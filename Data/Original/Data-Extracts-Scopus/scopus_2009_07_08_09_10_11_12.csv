(1) In California, recent analyses demonstrate that the diversity of species derived from different biogeographical origins is significantly correlated with temperature and precipitation gradients. These patterns support the hypothesis that niche conservatism is an important factor structuring modern diversity gradients. However, depending on how far back in time one looks, a species may be assigned to different origins; future discussions of biogeographical origins need to address the appropriate time frame for analysis. (2) Past research has demonstrated distinctive trait syndromes among woody plants of the Mediterranean, Chile, California and Mexico, and proposed that the syndromes are associated with lineages of different age in these floras. Reanalysis of individual traits demonstrates greater variability among regions than previously reported. The classification of plants into 'old' and 'new' genera is re-evaluated, and it is suggested that greater attention be paid to the age of traits, rather than to the age of taxa, especially at an arbitrary rank such as genus. (3) The idea of mediterranean-climate regions as 'climatic islands' is examined. Space-time diagrams of climate enable one to view the emergence of distinctive climatic regions in a continental context. The terms 'synclimatic' and 'anticlimatic' are proposed, referring to migration routes that parallel climate contours in space and time versus those that cross contours (including the case of geographic stasis in the face of climate change), respectively. Mediterranean-climate regions have served as important case studies in plant ecology and evolution, and merit continued close examination in the light of continued advances in phylogenetics and palaeoecology. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Adaptive evolution; Biogeographical origins; Biotic assembly; Climate change; Diversity; Environmental island; Mediterranean-type ecosystem; Migration; Niche conservatism; Trait syndromes","adaptive radiation; climate change; flora; geographical variation; Mediterranean environment; niche; paleoecology; phylogenetics; phytogeography; precipitation (climatology); species diversity; temperature gradient; woody plant; California; Mediterranean Sea; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649207436

Fisher Rd, St. Mary's City, MD 20686-3001, United States","The integrated assessment models (IAMs) that economists use to analyze the expected costs and benefits of climate policies frequently suggest that the ""optimal"" policy is to go slowly and to do relatively little in the near term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We trace this finding to the contestable assumptions and limitations of IAMs. For example, they typically discount future impacts from climate change at relatively high rates. This practice may be appropriate for short-term financial decisions but its extension to intergenerational environmental issues rests on several empirically and philosophically controversial hypotheses. IAMs also assign monetary values to the benefits of climate mitigation on the basis of incomplete information and sometimes speculative judgments concerning the monetary worth of human lives and ecosystems, while downplaying scientific uncertainty about the extent of expected damages. In addition, IAMs may exaggerate mitigation costs by failing to reflect the socially determined, path-dependent nature of technical change and ignoring the potential savings from reduced energy utilization and other opportunities for innovation. A better approach to climate policy, drawing on recent research on the economics of uncertainty, would reframe the problem as buying insurance against catastrophic, low-probability events. Policy decisions should be based on a judgment concerning the maximum tolerable increase in temperature and/or carbon dioxide levels given the state of scientific understanding. The appropriate role for economists would then be to determine the least-cost global strategy to achieve that target. While this remains a demanding and complex problem, it is far more tractable and epistemically defensible than the cost-benefit comparisons attempted by most IAMs. © The Author(s) 2009.",,"Climate policy; Complex problems; Environmental issues; Expected costs; Financial decisions; Global strategies; High rate; Human lives; Incomplete information; Integrated assessment models; Mitigation costs; Monetary value; Policy decisions; Reduced energy; Scientific uncertainty; Technical change; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Economics; Energy utilization; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental economics; environmental issue; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349986914

To evaluate the geothermal fields in the light of their prospectiveness, to further exploration of thermal energy resources, we took an effort to apply selected isotopic and chemical geothermometers to assess the maximum possible temperatures, which may be found in the reservoirs. The only chemical geothermometers which give a reliable range of reservoir temperatures are SiO2 (chalcedony), Na-Ka-Ca and partly Na-K ones. The oxygen isotopic geothermometer in the SO4-H2O system gives a real range of estimated reservoir temperatures only for deeply circulating waters in the Cieplice area.

This paper describes the current status and future plans for expansion of nuclear power, the advances in nuclear reactor technology, and their impacts on the associated risks and performance of nuclear power. Advanced nuclear reactors have been designed to be simpler and safer, and to have lower costs than currently operating reactors. By addressing many of the public health and safety risks that plagued the industry since the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, these reactors may help break the current deadlock over nuclear power. In that case, nuclear power could make a significant contribution towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, significant issues persist, fueling reservations among the public and many decision makers. Nuclear safety, disposal of radioactive wastes, and proliferation of nuclear explosives need to be addressed in an effective and credible way if the necessary public support is to be obtained. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Results show that all supports are active in deNOx reaction in the presence of the mentioned gas mixture. However, their catalytic activity varies with the content of cerium and goes through a maximum for x = 0.62, leading to 27% NOx consumption. The effect of rhodium on Ce0.62Zr0.38O2 considerably improves the catalytic activity during the deNOx process assisted by hydrocarbons. The rhodium addition decreases by about 34 °C the temperature of NOx consumption, which goes up to 57%.

So far, little is known about species responses to these seasonal components of climate change. 2. We experimentally manipulated spring and summer temperatures and winter snow accumulation and temperatures independently in a peatland in sub-arctic Sweden. This yielded six climate scenarios and we studied the esponses of the peat moss Sphagnum fuscum, the evergreen dwarf shrubs Empetrum hermaphroditum and Andromeda polifolia , the deciduous dwarf shrubs Betula nana and Vaccinium uliginosum, the grass Calamagrostis lapponica and the forb Rubus chamaemorus.3. We found substantial interspecific differences in leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables that reflect the response of tundra plants to climate change. S. fuscum had the lowest N and P concentrations, with increasing N and P concentrations (and decreasing C/N and C/P ratios) going from evergreen dwarf shrubs, to the grass, deciduous dwarf shrubs and the forb. Leaf N/P ratios varied between 10 and 14 which points to N-limited plant growth. 4. The natural abundance of 15 N varied very strongly among species and growth forms. These differences corresponded with the presence and type of mycorrhizal association in the plant roots. Leaf carbon isotope discrimination also differed strongly among species and growth forms, but the absolute differences were relatively small (< 5?). The rank order was: forb and graminoid < moss and evergreen shrubs < deciduous shrubs.5. After 4 years, the effects of realistic climate change manipulations on leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables were idiosyncratic with respect to species and generally small compared to the differences among species and growth forms. At the phenotypic level, spring warming or winter snow addition effects occurred as frequently as summer warming effects. 6.This implies that the changes in the species composition and structure of plant communities that have been observed in medium-term warming studies in cold biomes will have much more impact on plant-mediated nutrient and carbon cycling pathways and rates than climate-change induced phenotypic responses, irrespective of the seasonal timing of these climate changes. © 2009 British Ecological Society.","Growth forms; Isotopic composition; Plant-soil feedbacks; Soil nutrient mineralization; Tundra","abundance; biome; bog; carbon flux; climate change; grass; isotopic composition; mineralization; moss; nutrient dynamics; seasonal variation; shrub; soil nutrient; spring (season); temperature effect; warming; Andromeda polifolia; Betula nana; Bryophyta; Calamagrostis lapponica; Empetrum hermaphroditum; Rubus chamaemorus; Sphagnum; Sphagnum fuscum; Vaccinium; Vaccinium uliginosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649644197

The aim of the present study is to describe the evolution of CO poisoning during a period between January 1999 and December 2007 based on data collected from result of toxicological analysis in the laboratory of toxicology in the National Institute of Health in Morocco. Materials and methods: This study was based on autopsies samples sent to the laboratory of forensic toxicology covering the time period January 1999 to December 2007. Cases were analyzed according to the following criteria: age, region, month, gender, presence or not of autopsy report and post mortem blood carbon monoxide determination. Result: From January 1999 to December 2007, 139 out of the 4402 analysis performed were recorded as acute CO intoxications. Cases (93.5%) were classified as accident (E859). Hundred percentage of our cases were exclusively due to gaze inhalation. Circumstances of intoxications were described in autopsy report which is found in 41% (57 cases). Males predominated in accidental poisoning with 77 cases (55%) while females represented 62 cases (44%). the most represented city was Rabat with 48 cases (34%), followed by Casablanca with 20 cases (14.4%). the highest frequency of CO deaths was found in February and March with 29 cases (20.9%) and 28 cases (20.1%), respectively. The highest poisoning frequency was recorded for the age mean 34± years old. The average of carbon monoxide concentration was 5.76 ± 4.3 ml/100 ml of blood. Males predominated in accidental poisoning with 77 cases (55%) while females represented 62 cases (44%). Conclusion: Acute carbon monoxide intoxication is too dangerous because of its speed in addition to the particularities of carbon monoxide which is one of many ubiquitous contaminants of our environment that requires prevention and control measures inside and outside to insure adequate protection of public health.","Acute poisoning; Carbon monoxide (CO); Forensic toxicology; Inhalation","carbon monoxide; accident; adult; age distribution; article; autopsy; carbon monoxide blood level; carbon monoxide intoxication; controlled study; female; forensic toxicology; geographic distribution; human; human tissue; inhalation; major clinical study; male; Morocco; national health organization; sex difference; Accidents; Adult; Carbon Monoxide; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning; Female; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Male; Morocco; Seasons; Sex Distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69349090051

From an R-matrix analysis the resonance parameters for 7He as well as the spectroscopic factor for the 6He(0+) + n configuration in its ground-state have been obtained. The spectroscopic factor is 0.61 confirming that 7He is not a pure single-particle state. An analysis of 5He data from neutron-knockout reactions of 6He in a carbon target reveals the presence of an s-wave component at low energies in the α + n relative energy spectrum. A possible low-lying exited state in 7He observed in neutron knockout data from 8He in a carbon target and tentatively interpreted as a Iπ = 1 / 2- state, could not be observed in the present experiment. Possible explanations of the shape difference between the 7He resonance obtained in the two knockout reactions are discussed in terms of target-dependence or different reaction mechanisms at relativistic energies. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we identify HO-1 as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer (PCA). Immunohistochemical analysis of prostate tissue using a progression tissue microarray from patients with localized PCA and across several stages of disease progression revealed a significant elevation of HO-1 expression in cancer epithelial cells, but not in surrounding stromal cells, from hormone-refractory PCA (HRPCA) compared with hormone-responsive PCA and benign tissue. Silencing the ho-1 gene in HRPCA cells decreased the HO-1 activity, oxidative stress, and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase/p38 kinase. This coincided with reduced cell proliferation, cell survival, and cell invasion in vitro, as well as inhibition of prostate tumor growth and lymph node and lung metastases in vivo. The effect of ho-1 silencing on these oncogenic features was mimicked by exposure of cells to a novel selective small-molecule HO-1 inhibitor referred to as OB-24. OB-24 selectively inhibited HO-1 activity in PCA cells, which correlated with a reduction of protein carbonylation and reactive oxygen species formation. Moreover, OB-24 significantly inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth and lymph node/lung metastases in vivo. A potent synergistic activity was observed when OB-24 was combined with Taxol. Together, these results establish HO-1 as a potential therapeutic target for advanced PCA. ©2009 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"biological marker; heme oxygenase 1; heme oxygenase inhibitor; hormone; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; ob 24; paclitaxel; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; advanced cancer; animal model; antineoplastic activity; article; benign tumor; cancer cell; cell invasion; cell proliferation; cell survival; controlled study; disease course; drug selectivity; enzyme activity; epithelium cell; gene expression; gene silencing; growth inhibition; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; lung metastasis; lymph node; male; mouse; multiple cycle treatment; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oncogene; oxidative stress; priority journal; prostate; prostate cancer; protein carbonylation; reduction; stroma cell; tissue microarray; tumor growth; tumor localization; Animals; Apoptosis; Blotting, Western; Cell Adhesion; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Disease Progression; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Therapy; Heme Oxygenase-1; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Lung Neoplasms; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Mice; Mice, SCID; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent; Oxidative Stress; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Prostatic Hyperplasia; Prostatic Neoplasms; Reactive Oxygen Species; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; Tissue Array Analysis; Tumor Cells, Cultured",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350221874

In this paper, we report the effect of forced periodic cycling between propane-steam reforming feed and a carbon gasifying agent (CO2) as a novel reactor strategy to both improve product yield (H2 and CO) and catalyst longevity. Experiments were carried out over Co-Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in a fluidized bed reactor. Cycle period, ?, was varied between 5 to 20 mins at 5 different cycle splits, (0.1 ? s ? 0.9). Both H2 and CO formation rates were higher (up to 5-fold and more than 10-fold, respectively) than that attainable under steady-state operation at all periods investigated. In particular, the time-average H2:CO ratio was lower (< 3.0) than the steady-state equivalent for the pure propane steam reforming (14.0), although it increased monotonically with cycle split. Composition cycling with CO2 also improved catalyst stability and longevity compared to steady-state performance at the cycle periods examined. This strategic reactor operation is therefore a potentially useful key to green process engineering in the overall petrochemical plant design to effect greenhouse gas emission reduction. © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

For Diesel fuel and due to the ignition delay time behavior, different oxidation behavior can be realized at different preheating temperatures. In this work, the intermediate oxidation region of Diesel fuel is investigated. By making use of the ignition delay time behavior, an vaporizer like tube reactor is constructed in order to enable a very high preheating temperature without the risk of self-ignition in a time-independent experiment. The oxidation behavior of Diesel fuel in air is investigated numerically and experimentally. In the numerical part, the ignition delay time was estimated using CHEMIKIN tools for different air-fuel mixtures at different temperatures. The evaporation behavior of the Diesel fuel-air mixtures are investigated at relatively high air preheating temperatures ranging from 500 °C up to 680 °C. The amount of the process air was varied from an air ratio λ = 0.35 to λ = 0.6. The experiments are also performed with N2 as an evaporation media and compared with those performed with air to detect any temperature increase in the case of Diesel-air mixtures. The amount of heat release in the low chemistry region as well as in the intermediate region is calculated for the case of Diesel/air mixtures. The experiments show that four different oxidation region of Diesel fuel can be distinguished depending on air inlet temperatures and on the air ratio. At a temperature lower than 723 K (450 °C), no chemical reaction takes place. The cool flame reactions start at temperatures above 723 K (450 °C). However, no stable cool flame can be achieved unless the air preheating temperature reached about 753 K (480 °C). The cool flame region is extended up to about 873 K (600 °C), at which the intermediate regime started. This regime stabilized to a short range up to about 923 K (650 °C) after which ignition takes place. © 2009 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Soils were collected from a 93-year-old unfertilized stand and a 13-year-old P. pinaster stand with regular annual fertilization of either only P or P and nitrogen (N). After 6 months of culture in controlled conditions, different morphotypes of ectomycorrhiza (ECM) were used for the measurements of acid phosphatase activity and molecular identification of fungal species using amplification of the ITS region. Total biomass, N and P contents were measured in roots and shoots of plants. Bicarbonate- and NaOH-available inorganic P (Pi), organic P (Po) and ergosterol concentrations were measured in bulk and rhizosphere soil. The results showed that bulk soil from the 93-year-old forest stand presented the highest Po levels, but relatively higher bicarbonate-extractable Pi levels compared to 13-year-old unfertilized stand. Fertilizers significantly increased the concentrations of inorganic P fractions in bulk soil. Ergosterol contents in rhizosphere soil were increased by fertilizer application. The dominant fungal species was Rhizopogon luteolus forming 66.6% of analysed ECM tips. Acid phosphatase activity was highly variable and varied inversely with bicarbonate-extractable Pi levels in the rhizosphere soil. Total P or total N in plants was linearly correlated with total plant biomass, but the slope was steep only between total P and biomass in fertilized soil samples. In spite of high phosphatase activity in ECM tips, P availability remained a limiting nutrient in soil samples from unfertilized stands. Nevertheless young P. pinaster seedlings showed a high plasticity for biomass production at low P availability in soils.","Ectomycorrhizal morphotypes; Fertilizers application; Fungal biomass; P contents; Phosphatase activity; Plant plasticity","phosphatase; phosphorus; vegetable protein; bioaccumulation; concentration (composition); coniferous tree; enzyme activity; fertilizer application; fungus; morphotype; nutrient availability; phosphorus; seedling; soil profile; article; Basidiomycetes; biomass; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; mycorrhiza; physiology; pine; plant; plant root; soil; Basidiomycota; Biomass; Mycorrhizae; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Phosphorus; Pinus; Plant Proteins; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Soil; Pinus pinaster; Rhizopogon luteolus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74549188417

Thirty-two soil samples were collected around steel manufacturing plants located in the Al-Jiza area, south Jordan, around the Queen Alia Airport. The samples were obtained at two depths, 0-10 and 10-20 cm, and were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry for lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and chromium (Cr) levels. The physicochemical factors believed to affect the mobility of metals in the soil of the study area were also examined, including pH, electrical conductivity, total organic matter, calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) content and cation exchange capacity. The high concentrations of Pb, Zn and Cd in the soil samples were found to be related to anthropogenic sources, such as the steel manufacturing plants, agriculture and traffic emissions, with the highest concentrations of these metals close to the site of the steel plants; in contrast the concentration of Cr was low in the soil sampled close to the steel plants. The metals were concentrated in the surface soil, and concentrations decreased with increasing depth, reflecting the physical properties of the soil and its alkaline pH. The mineralogical composition of the topsoil, identified by X-ray diffraction, was predominantly quartz, calcite, dolomite and minor minerals, such as gypsum and clay minerals. Metal concentrations were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compute the statistical significance of the mean.

The UK-led Rapid Climate Change program has been monitoring the Atlantic Heat Conveyor since 2004. The Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory, part of a UK-German initiative introduced in 2006, started making year-round observations of the atmosphere in this remote region of the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Many researchers engaged in long-term datasets contend that LTS have broader benefits such as their ability to provide early warnings and come up with sudden findings.

Recent evidence suggests that indoor air quality may improve in homes where older, non-certified wood stoves are exchanged for lower emissions EPA-certified alternatives. As part of a wood stove exchange program in northern British Columbia, Canada, we sampled outdoor and indoor air at 15 homes during 6-day sampling sessions both before and after non-certified wood stoves were exchanged. During each sampling session two consecutive 3-day PM2.5 samples were collected onto Teflon filters, which were weighed and analyzed for the wood smoke tracer levoglucosan. Residential PM2.5 infiltration efficiencies (Finf) were estimated from continuous light scattering measurements made with nephelometers, and estimates of Finf were used to calculate the outdoor- and indoor-generated contributions to indoor air. There was not a consistent relationship between stove technology and outdoor or indoor concentrations of PM2.5 or levoglucosan. Mean Finf estimates were low and similar during pre- and post-exchange periods (0.32 ± 0.17 and 0.33 ± 0.17, respectively). Indoor sources contributed the majority (∼65%) of the indoor PM2.5 concentrations, independent of stove technology, although low indoor-outdoor levoglucosan ratios (median ≤ 0.19) and low indoor PM2.5-levoglucosan correlations (r ≤ 0.19) suggested that wood smoke was not a major indoor PM2.5 source in most of these homes. In summary, despite the potential for extensive wood stove exchange programs to reduce outdoor PM2.5 concentrations in wood smoke-impacted communities, we did not find a consistent relationship between stove technology upgrades and indoor air quality improvements in homes where stoves were exchanged. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Goethe-University, Altenhöferallee 1, Frankfurt/Main 60438, Germany","The concentration of platinum group elements (PGE) in the environment has increased significantly in the last 20 years mainly due to their use as catalysts in automotive catalytic converters. The quantitation of these metals in different environmental compartments is, however, challenging due to their very low concentrations and the presence of interfering matrix constituents when inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is used for analysis. Previously, the research focus was on the analysis of platinum (Pt) and rhodium (Rh). However, due to the increasing use of palladium (Pd) in automotive catalytic converters, quantitation of this element in airborne particulate matter (PM) is also needed. Compared to Pt and Rh, measurements of Pd using ICP-MS are plagued by greater molecular interferences arising from elements such as copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) strontium (Sr), yttrium (Y), and zirconium (Zr). The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of reductive co-precipitation procedures using both mercury (Hg) and tellurium (Te) for the pre-concentration of Pd from airborne PM. Furthermore, helium (He) was tested as a collision gas for isotope dilution-inductively coupled plasma-quadrupole-mass spectrometry (ID-ICP-Q-MS) to measure Pd in the Hg and Te precipitates. Airborne PM samples (PM10) were collected from Neuglobsow (Brandenburg, north-eastern Germany) and Deuselbach (Rhineland-Palatinate, south-western Germany), considered to represent background levels, and from the city Frankfurt am Main (Hesse, Germany), a high-traffic area. Samples were first digested with aqua regia in a high-pressure asher (HPA) at 320 °C and 130 bar prior to the application of reductive co-precipitation procedures. The method was validated with road dust reference material BCR-723 and the CANMET-CCRMP reference material TDB-1 and WPR-1. In airborne PM collected at the background areas Neuglobsow and Deuselbach, Pd was detected with median concentrations values of 0.5 and 0.6 pg/m3, respectively. Much higher median concentration values of 14.8 pg Pd/m3 (detection limit = 0.01 pg Pd/m3) were detected in samples collected in the city of Frankfurt am Main. Results have shown that Hg co-precipitation depletes the concentrations of interfering matrix constituents by at least one order of magnitude more, compared to Te co-precipitation, making it a more effective method for the isolation and pre-enrichment of Pd from airborne PM prior to analysis. The use of a He gas flow of 120 ml/min in the plasma further minimized interferences, particularly those arising from CuAr+, YO +, and ZrO+ during the determination of Pd. The results demonstrate that Hg co-precipitation and the use of He collision gas, in combination with isotope dilution, are highly effective methods for the quantitation of Pd in airborne PM using ICP-MS. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Collision gas; ID-ICP-Q-MS; Mercury co-precipitation; Palladium; Platinum group elements","Airborne particulate matters; Aqua regia; Automotive catalytic converters; Background level; Brandenburg; Collision gas; Concentration of; Detection limits; Eastern germany; Environmental compartment; Gas flows; Germany; ID-ICP-Q-MS; Isotope dilutions; Low concentrations; matrix; Median concentration; Mercury co-precipitation; Molecular interference; Order of magnitude; Platinum group elements; Pre-concentration; Pre-enrichment; Quadrupoles; Reductive co-precipitation; Reference material; Road dusts; Te precipitates; Catalytic converters; Concentration (process); Gases; Helium; Inductively coupled plasma; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Isotopes; Mass spectrometers; Mercury (metal); Platinum; Rhodium; Spectrometry; Strontium; Tellurium; Tellurium compounds; Yttrium; Zinc; Zirconium; Palladium; helium; mercury; palladium; tellurium; air pollutant; article; chemistry; environmental monitoring; evaluation; instrumentation; mass spectrometry; methodology; oxidation reduction reaction; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Helium; Mass Spectrometry; Mercury; Oxidation-Reduction; Palladium; Particulate Matter; Tellurium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449592139

The results show that the presence of iron oxide modifies the thermal behaviour of the pitch, especially in the temperature range of 400-500 °C when the pre-graphitic order in the carbon matrix is formed. The crystalline microstructure of the materials changes from domains to mosaics when iron oxide is added.

Local policymakers in California already have been searching for ways to reduce GHG emissions but it was the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32), which seeks to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, that has provided a framework for regions to evaluate their ability to reduce GHG emissions. We conducted a GHG inventory for the San Diego region from 1990 to 2006, with forecasts to 2020. The region emitted approximately 34 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMT CO2E) in 2006 from anthropogenic sources, which represents a 17% increase over the 1990 level of 29 MMT CO2E. Applying a combination of 21 existing or pending state GHG reduction mandates and feasible regional measures we show that the region could achieve the AB 32 target. Although the largest reductions are achieved through state mandates, all measures, including at the local level, will be required to achieve the AB 32 target. Thus local regions retain control over a fairly significant portion of reductions, and remain important actors in the implementation and compliance of state mandates. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The ERGO business model creates a market for co-ordinated production and consumption of renewable energy. The innovative contribution of the model rests in its ability to combine two problems and thereby solve them in a fresh way. One problem derives from utilizing power grids with a substantial increase in renewable electric energy production (as witnessed in the Danish case with wind energy) and managing the resulting fluctuating supply efficiently. The other problem concerns finding ways to reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector. The ERGO business model effectively solves both problems, by transforming EVs into distributed storage devices for electricity, thus enabling a fresh approach to evening out of fluctuating and unpredictable energy sources, while drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This integrated solution carries many other associated benefits, amongst which are the possibility of introducing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) distributed power generation; introducing IT intelligence to the grid, and creating virtual power plants from distributed sources; and providing new applications for carbon credits in the decarbonisation of the economy.

The responses of natural ecosystems to these changes are focus for research, due to the potential feedbacks to the climate. We here present results from a field experiment in which the effects of these three climate change factors are investigated solely and in all combinations at a temperate heath dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). Climate induced increases in plant production may increase plant root exudation of dissolved organic compounds such as amino acids, and the release of amino acids during decomposition of organic matter. Such free amino acids in soil serve as substrates for soil microorganisms and are also acquired as nutrients directly by plants. We investigated the magnitude of the response to the potential climate change treatments on uptake of organic nitrogen in an in situ pulse labelling experiment with 15N13C2-labelled glycine (amino acid) injected into the soil. In situ root nitrogen acquisition by grasses responded significantly to the climate change treatments, with larger 15N uptake in response to warming and elevated CO2 but not additively when the treatments were combined. Also, a larger grass leaf biomass in the combined T and CO2 treatment than in individual treatments suggest that responses to combined climate change factors cannot be predicted from the responses to single factors treatments. The soil microbes were superior to plants in the short-term competition for the added glycine, as indicated by an 18 times larger 15N recovery in the microbial biomass compared to the plant biomass.

Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O3) affect host plant carbon gain and allocation, which may in turn influence ectomycorrhizal sporocarp production if the carbon available to the ectomycorrhizal fungus is dependant upon the quantity of carbon assimilated by the host. We measured sporocarp production of ectomycorrhizal fungi over 4 years at the Aspen FACE (free air CO2 enrichment) site, which corresponded to stand ages seven to 10 years. Total mean sporocarp biomass was greatest under elevated CO2, regardless of O3 concentration, while it was generally lowest under elevated O3 with ambient CO 2. Community composition differed significantly among the treatments, with less difference in the final year of the study. Whether this convergence was due to succession or environmental factors is uncertain. CO2 and O3 affect ectomycorrhizal sporocarp productivity and community composition, with likely effects on dispersal, colonization and sporocarp-dependent food webs. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Aspen free air CO2 enrichment; Betula papyrifera; Carbon dioxide; Ectomycorrhizal fungi; Northern deciduous forests; Ozone; Populus tremuloides; Productivity; Sporocarps","carbon dioxide; ozone; biological production; biomass; carbon dioxide; community dynamics; community structure; deciduous tree; dispersal; ectomycorrhiza; fungus; ozone; recombination; analysis of variance; article; atmosphere; biomass; chemistry; ecosystem; fruiting body; growth, development and aging; mycorrhiza; United States; Analysis of Variance; Atmosphere; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Fruiting Bodies, Fungal; Mycorrhizae; Ozone; Wisconsin; Betula papyrifera; Fungi; Populus tremuloides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649946045

We use estimates of ozone responses to these emission changes from several atmospheric chemical transport models combined with a health impact function. Foreign emission reductions contribute approximately 30%, 30%, 20%, and >50% of the mortalities avoided by reducing precursor emissions in all regions together in NA, EA, SA, and EU, respectively. Reducing emissions in NA and EU avoids more mortalities outside the source region than within, owing in part to larger populations in foreign regions. Lowering the global methanea bundance by 20% reduces mortality mostin SA, followed by EU, EA, and NA.

These policies can be conducted at different levels of society. To achieve real results in energy efficiency improvements and in GHG reductions, the policies must be focused on the correct levels in society. In Finland, the province level seems to be a reasonable level for a policy targeted at industry. This paper proposes a category for the ways industry uses energy: building energy users, major users of electricity for process/production, major users of heat for process/production and direct combustion users. This approach gives opportunities for developing regional cooperation among different industries. The approach is also important between industries and society, so that there are integrated solutions which e.g. utilise district heating and biofuel potentials. The individual technologies like electric motors, pumps, fans, heat recovery equipment and boilers do not seem to have any significant potentials for improvements in energy efficiency by the EU target year 2020. However, there are opportunities but they are at system levels: how effectively the individual technologies are applied as a part of industrial systems.

Traditional models based on octanol-water partitioning generally overestimate native porewater concentrations, and modern approaches accounting for multiple carbon fractions, including black carbon, appear sediment specific. To assess the diversity of this sorption behavior, we collected all peer-reviewed total organic carbon (TOC)-normalized in situ sediment-porewater distribution coefficients, K TOC, for impacted sediments. This entailed several hundreds of data for PAHs, PCBs, PCDD/Fs, and chlorinated benzenes, covering a large variety of sediments, locations, and experimental methods. Compound-specific KTOC could range up to over 3 orders of magnitude. Output from various predictive models for individual carbonaceous phases found in impacted sediments, based on peer-reviewed polyparameter linear free energy relationships (PP-LFERs), Raoult's Law, and the SPARC online-calculator, were tested to see if any of the models could consistently predict literature KTOC values within a factor of 30 (i.e., ̃1.5 orders of magnitude, or half the range of K TOC values). The Raoult's Law model and coal tar PP-LFER achieved the sought-after accuracy for all tested compound classes, and are recommended for general, regional-scale modeling purposes. As impacted sediment-porewater distribution models are unlikely to get more accurate than this, this review underpins that the only way to accurately obtain accurate porewater concentrations is to measure them directly, and not infer them from sediment concentrations. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Black carbon; Carbon fraction; Carbonaceous phasis; Chlorinated aromatics; Distribution coefficient; Distribution models; Experimental methods; In-situ; Linear free energy relationships; Octanol-water partitioning; Orders of magnitude; PCDD/Fs; Pore waters; Porewater concentrations; Predictive models; Raoult's law; Scale modeling; Sediment concentration; Total organic carbon; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Benzene; Bubbles (in fluids); Carbon black; Coal tar; Laws and legislation; Organic carbon; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Pumping plants; Sorption; Vapor pressure; Sedimentology; benzene derivative; chlorinated hydrocarbon; coal tar; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; alcohol; anthropogenic source; black carbon; numerical model; organochlorine; PAH; porewater; sediment pollution; total organic carbon; accuracy; article; calculator; concentration (parameters); controlled study; experimental model; Internet; sediment; total organic carbon; water analysis; Carbon; Chemistry, Physical; Geologic Sediments; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Models, Statistical; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Reproducibility of Results; Risk; Software; Temperature; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68049120597

Using state-of-the-art emission inventories, a global three-dimensional photochemical tracer/transport model of the troposphere, and a global radiative transfer model based on methods presented in the latest IPCC Assessment Report (2007-AR4), we estimate the radiative forcing (RF) attributable to household fuel combustion in Asia in terms of current global annual-mean RF and future global integrated RF for a one-year pulse of emissions (2000) over two time horizons (100 and 20 years). Despite the significant emissions of black carbon (BC) aerosols, these estimates indicate that shorter-lived (non-Kyoto) air pollutants from household fuel use in the region overall seem to exert a small net negative RF because of the strong influence of reflective aerosols. There are, however, major uncertainties in emission estimates for solid fuel burning, and about the sustainability of household fuel wood harvesting in Asia (the carbon neutrality of harvesting). In addition, there is still substantial uncertainty associated with the BC radiative forcing. As a result we find that the sign of the RF from household biomass burning in the region cannot be established. While recognizing the value of integrating climate change and air pollution policies, we are concerned that for a 'Kyoto style' post-Kyoto treaty (with global cap-and-trade and the Global Warming Potential as the metric) expanding the basket of components with a selection of short-lived species without also including the wider range of co-emitted species may lead to unintended consequences for global-scale climate. Additional measurement, modelling, and policy research is urgently needed to reduce the uncertainties so that the net impact on climate of emissions and mitigation measures in this sector can be accurately assessed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A synthetic peptide which imitates this domain has been used to study the mechanism of peptide-phospholipid interaction. We have used static and MAS-NMR techniques to show that the interaction of Bax-C with membranes is modulated by the presence of a negatively charged phospholipid like phosphatidylglycerol. Bax-C slightly shifted upfield the 31P resonances coming from phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine. However the width of the resonance peaks was considerably higher when phosphatidylglycerol was present. Bax-C substantially decreased the T1 relaxation times of phosphatidylglycerol and those of phosphatidylcholine when mixtured with phosphatidylglycerol, but T1 values were not decreased when phosphatidylcholine was the only phospholipid present in the membrane. 13C-MAS-NMR showed that T1 values were decreased when Bax-C was incorporated into the lipid vesicles and this reduction affected similarly to carbons located in different regions of the membrane when the only phospholipid present was phosphatidylcholine. However, when phosphatidylglycerol was also present, the decrease in T1 affected considerably more to some carbons in the polar region. These results indicate that Bax-C interacts differently with the polar part of the membrane depending on whether phosphatidylglycerol is present or not, suggesting that an electrostatic interaction of Bax-C with the membrane determines the location of this domain. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the Trp residues of Bax-C were placed in a microenvironment more hydrophobic and less accessible to quenching by acrylamide when phosphatidylglycerol was present. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We develop two versions so that we can solve the model either as a fully inter-temporal optimization problem (forward-looking, perfect foresight) or recursively. The standard EPPA model on which these models are based is solved recursively, and it is necessary to simplify some aspects of it to make inter-temporal solution possible. The forward-looking capability allows one to better address economic and policy issues such as borrowing and banking of GHG allowances, efficiency implications of environmental tax recycling, endogenous depletion of fossil resources, international capital flows, and optimal emissions abatement paths among others. To evaluate the solution approaches, we benchmark each version to the same macroeconomic path, and then compare the behavior of the two versions under a climate policy that restricts greenhouse gas emissions. We find that the energy sector and CO2 price behavior are similar in both versions (in the recursive version of the model we force the inter-temporal theoretical efficiency result that abatement through time should be allocated such that the CO2 price rises at the interest rate.) The main difference that arises is that the macroeconomic costs are substantially lower in the forward-looking version of the model, since it allows consumption shifting as an additional avenue of adjustment to the policy. On the other hand, the simplifications required for solving the model as an optimization problem, such as dropping the full vintaging of the capital stock and fewer explicit technological options, likely have effects on the results. Moreover, inter-temporal optimization with perfect foresight poorly represents the real economy where agents face high levels of uncertainty that likely lead to higher costs than if they knew the future with certainty. We conclude that while the forward-looking model has value for some problems, the recursive model produces similar behavior in the energy sector and provides greater flexibility in the details of the system that can be represented. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, tightening of emission legislations, aimed at creating a cleaner and healthier environment, has led to increasingly demanding efforts required in making more efficient engines / vehicles and also focus on effective after-treatment systems. Catalytic converters, being the most preferred option for after-treatment solutions, play an important role in achieving the desired end results. Over the past several years, monolithic catalytic converters with laminar flow profile were being used by automotive industry. These catalytic converters though create some turbulence at the inlet, make the majority of the rest of the flow laminar, thereby reducing the mass transfer of the exhaust gas components to the effective catalytic sites. Turbulent flow technology has been successfully developed more recently with metal substrates to get the required turbulent flow characteristics in the substrate channels. The advantages of this technology include better conversion efficiencies, lesser volume of the catalysts - and hence less packaging space requirements, lower system costs etc. The present paper deals with the work done on two models of two wheelers and one model of three wheeler using Turbulent Structure metal substrates. On one two wheeler, it was possible to optimize the overall system cost by switching over to Turbulent Structure from the earlier Laminar Structure, thereby totally eliminating a start up catalyst used in the earlier design. Benefits on performance using Turbulent Flow technology also demonstrated on the other two wheeler and a three wheeler. All the emission evaluation results with Turbulent Flow technology are presented in this paper, along with benefits on the cost and performance. © Copyright 2009 SAE International.",,"Automotive industry; Catalysts; Chip scale packages; Costs; Laminar flow; Mass transfer; Substrates; Turbulent flow; Developing nations; Emission legislation; Emission performance; Evaluation results; Flow charac-teristics; Laminar structure; Space requirements; Turbulent structures; Catalytic converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877572206

Any global climate treaty must, however, at least not make global inequality worse, and ideally should embody desirable principles of justice. The Greenhouse Development Rights framework (GDRs), described briefly here, is a proposal for such a fair division of the burdens of emissions reductions and adaptation to climate change that won't be avoided, based on an assessment of capacity (ability to pay) and responsibility (contribution to the problem). The GDRs considers both inequality within countries and inequality between countries: national obligations are based on the exemption of poor individuals (under a 'development threshold') from global burdens. GDRs accepts the link between 'development' and the growth in consumption of the world's poor majority, an obvious requirement if it is to be taken seriously by Southern governments intent on 'development as usual'. It also does not directly challenge the institutions of capitalism or the sovereignty of nation states. Nonetheless, in its focus on poor and rich people it is consistent with a class-based rather than nation-based approach to economic justice. We conclude by raising a variety of questions both about the limits of approaches like GDRs, and the need for policies that address climate change even during or after a transition beyond the current global capitalist regime. © Institute of Social Studies 2009.",,"adaptation; capitalism; climate change; emission control; environmental policy; global climate; greenhouse gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72549083781

Chemical etching is a well-known method for synthesizing orange-luminescent, hydride-capped silicon nanoparticles (H/Si NPs). However, a blueshift in emission wavelength occurs when reducing the particle size to exciton Bohr radius or less. In this paper, we attempted to synthesize and characterize H/Si NPs that emit lower wavelengths at room temperature. We proved that our method succeeded in synthesizing H/Si NPs with emission in the blue region. The wavelength-resolved and time-resolved studies of the PL were executed for H/Si NPs in methanol (MeOH), pyridine (py) and furan, using the 355nm pulsed radiation from a Nd:YAG laser. In addition, excitation wavelength-dependent and PL studies were executed using the spectrofluorometer with a xenon (Xe) broad band light source. We noticed solvent-dependent PL spectra with sharp peaks near 420nm and a short lifetime less than 100ns. The morphology and particle size were investigated by high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM).

A reference carbon dioxide concentration of 383 ppm for 2007 is projected to increase to a nominal 500 ppm in less than 50 years according to business as usual models. This concentration change is equivalent to an increase of 7 billion tonnes of carbon per year (7 Gt C year -1). The concept of a stabilization wedge was introduced by Pacala and Socolow (Science, 305, 968-972, 2004) to break the 7 Gt C year-1 into more manageable 1 Gt C year-1 reductions that would be achievable with current technology. A total of fifteen possible wedges were identified; however, an integrated municipal solid waste (MSW) management system based on the European Unions waste management hierarchy was not evaluated as a wedge. This analysis demonstrates that if the tonnage of MSW is allocated to recycling, waste to energy and landfilling in descending order in lieu of existing business-as-usual practices with each option using modern technology and best practices, the system would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 1 Gt C year-1. This integrated waste management system reduces CO2 by displacing fossil electrical generation and avoiding manufacturing energy consumption and methane emissions from landfills.","Climate stabilization wedge; Greenhouse gas; Recycling; Waste management; Waste to energy","Anthropogenic sources; Best practice; Business-as-usual; Carbon dioxide concentrations; Climate stabilization; Concentration change; Current technology; Electrical generation; Energy consumption; European Union; Integrated waste management; Landfilling; Management systems; Methane emissions; Modern technologies; Municipal solid waste; Waste to energy; Carbon dioxide; Energy conversion; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Leakage (fluid); Methane; Recycling; Solid wastes; Stabilization; Waste management; carbon dioxide; methane; anthropogenic source; carbon dioxide; climate change; electricity generation; energy use; greenhouse gas; landfill; methane; municipal solid waste; recycling; waste management; article; carbon dioxide tension; climate change; combustion; controlled study; energy consumption; greenhouse gas; integrated waste management; landfill; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; priority journal; recycling; sensitivity analysis; waste management; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Waste Management; Waste Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72549101739

However, the implications of this neoliberalisation and hybridisation of climate governance, and particularly state-industry relations during these processes, remain under-integrated with wider geographical debates on the scalar and network politics of environmental governance. In this paper, we probe these issues by examining the regulatory and territorial logics underpinning the negotiation and implementation of the European Union emissions trading scheme (EU ETS). We argue that overlapping interpretations of the regulatory logic of emissions trading (as a cost-effective means of meeting climate objectives) by EU, state and industry actors provided the driving force for the creation of a Europeanised climate governance space and the consolidation of the EU's governing authority in respect of the formal rule-making elements of the EU ETS. However, alliances between state and industry actors, based around intersecting interpretations of their territorial interests in relation to emissions trading, strongly influenced the scheme's design. Moreover, speculative behaviour within the EU ETS market indicates the continued ability of market networks to disrupt territorially-based climate governance regimes. We argue that critical exploration of the territorial logics and practices of EU emissions trading from regime creation to operation provides new insights into the emerging spatial politics of neoliberal environmental governance and its implications for climate protection. © 2009 The Authors.

However, many modern microbial mat ecosystems are dominated by chemotrophic bacteria and archaea. Like phototrophs, filamentous sulfur-oxidizing bacteria form large mats at the sediment/water interface that can act to stabilize sediments, and their metabolic activities may mediate the formation of marine phosphorites. Similarly, bacteria and archaea associated with the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) catalyze the precipitation of seafloor authigenic carbonates. When preserved, lipid biomarkers, isotopic signatures, body fossils, and lithological indicators of the local depositional environment may be used to identify chemotrophic mats in the rock record. The recognition of chemotrophic communities in the rock record has the potential to transform our understanding of ancient microbial ecologies, evolution, and geochemical conditions. Chemotrophic microbes on Earth occupy naturally occurring interfaces between oxidized and reduced chemical species and thus may provide a new set of search criteria to target life-detection efforts on other planets.

This paper analyzes the climate change mitigation potential of charcoal production in East Africa by examining the impact of changing both land management and technology. Current production in a major charcoal producing region of Kenya where charcoal is made as a by-product of land clearance for commercial grain production is modeled as the ""business-as-usual"" scenario. Alternative production systems are proposed based on coppice management of native or exotic trees. Improved kilns are also considered. Changes in aboveground, belowground, and soil carbon are modeled and two distinct baseline assessments are analyzed: one is based on a fixed area of land and one is based on the quantity of non-renewable fuel that is displaced by project activities. The magnitude of carbon emissions reductions varies depending on land management as well as the choice of carbonization technology. However, these variations are smaller than the variations arising from the choice of baseline methodology. The fixed-land baseline yields annualized carbon emission reductions equivalent to 0.5-2.8 tons per year (t y-1) with no change in production technology and 0.7-3.5 t y-1 with improved kilns. In contrast, the baseline defined by the quantity of displaced non-renewable fuel is 2-6 times larger, yielding carbon emissions reductions of 1.4-12.9 t y-1 with no change in production technology and 3.2-20.4 t y-1 with improved kilns. The results demonstrate the choice of baseline, often a political rather than scientific decision, is critical in assessing carbon emissions reductions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A number of environmental and economic benefits are claimed for bio-fuels. Bio-ethanol is by far the most widely used bio-fuel for transportation worldwide. Production of bio-ethanol from biomass is one way to reduce both consumption of crude oil and environmental pollution. Using bio-ethanol blended gasoline fuel for automobiles can significantly reduce petroleum use and exhaust greenhouse gas emission. Bio-ethanol can be produced from different kinds of raw materials. These raw materials are classified into three categories of agricultural raw materials: simple sugars, starch and lignocellulose. Bio-ethanol from sugar cane, produced under the proper conditions, is essentially a clean fuel and has several clear advantages over petroleum-derived gasoline in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality in metropolitan areas.

In all jurisdictions, government agencies have consistently stressed 'leading by example' as a rationale for adoption. 'Direct mandate' by the Prime Minister (NZ); 'organic development' from wider central government sustainability initiatives (UK); and a more 'laissez faire' approach by Australian Federal and State Governments, were identified as the general pathways leading to implementation. Our assessment indicates: a lack of understanding of the implementation process for carbon neutrality; a need to identify and critically examine the 'offset threshold' at which mitigation efforts cease and offsetting is adopted; an absence of any evaluation of the 'leading by example' rationale; a lack of inter country comparisons; a gap in understanding the relationship with economic and social aspects of sustainability; and a need to evaluate the utility of core government departments as the focus of carbon accounting.

One major unknown in current peatland emission estimations is how much peat is combusted by fire. Using a light detection and ranging data set acquired in Central Kalimantan, Borneo, in 2007, one year after the severe peatland fires of 2006, we determined an average burn scar depth of 0.33 ± 0.18 m. Based on this result and the burned area determined from satellite imagery,we estimate that within the 2.79 million hectare study area 49.15±26.81 megatons of carbon were released during the 2006 El Niño episode. This represents 10-33% of all carbon emissions from transport for the European Community in the year 2006. These emissions, originating from a comparatively small area (approximately 13% of the Indonesian peatland area), underline the importance of peat fires in the context of green house gas emissions and global warming. In the past decade severe peat fires occurred during El Niño-induced droughts in 1997, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2009. Currently, this important source of carbon emissions is not included in IPCC carbon accounting or in regional and global carbon emission models. Precise spatial measurements of peat combusted and potential avoided emissions in tropical peat swamp forests will also be required for future emission trading schemes in the framework of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in developing countries.","Climate change; Fires; Indonesia; Remote sensing; Tropical peat","carbon; fossil fuel; article; burn scar; carbon dynamics; carbon emission; combustion; drought; El Nino; fire; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; Indonesia; light detection and ranging; peatland; priority journal; remote sensing; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon; Droughts; Environmental Monitoring; Fires; Global Warming; Indonesia; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75849150986

N1G 2W1, Canada","Canada began research on space-relevant biological life support systems in the early 1990s. Since that time Canadian capabilities have grown tremendously, placing Canada among the emerging leaders in biological life support systems. The rapid growth of Canadian expertise has been the result of several factors including a large and technically sophisticated greenhouse sector which successfully operates under challenging climatic conditions, well planned technology transfer strategies between the academic and industrial sectors, and a strong emphasis on international research collaborations. Recent activities such as Canada's contribution of the Higher Plant Compartment of the European Space Agency's MELiSSA Pilot Plant and the remote operation of the Arthur Clarke Mars Greenhouse in the Canadian High Arctic continue to demonstrate Canadian capabilities with direct applicability to advanced life support systems. There is also a significant latent potential within Canadian institutions and organizations with respect to directly applicable advanced life support technologies. These directly applicable research interests include such areas as horticultural management strategies (for candidate crops), growth media, food processing, water management, atmosphere management, energy management, waste management, imaging, environment sensors, thermal control, lighting systems, robotics, command and data handling, communications systems, structures, in-situ resource utilization, space analogues and mission operations. With this background and in collaboration with the Canadian aerospace industry sector, a roadmap for future life support contributions is presented here. This roadmap targets an objective of at least 50% food closure by 2050 (providing greater closure in oxygen, water recycling and carbon dioxide uptake). The Canadian advanced life support community has chosen to focus on lunar surface infrastructure and not low Earth orbit or transit systems (i.e. microgravity applications). To advance the technical readiness for the proposed lunar missions, including a lunar plant growth lander, lunar ""salad machine"" (i.e. small scale plant production unit) and a full scale lunar plant production system, a suite of terrestrial developments and analogue systems are proposed. As has been successfully demonstrated by past Canadian advanced life support activities, terrestrial technology transfer and the development of highly qualified personnel will serve as key outputs for Canadian advanced life support system research programs. This approach is designed to serve the Canadian greenhouse industry by developing compliance measures for mitigating environmental impact, reducing labour and energy costs as well as improving Canadian food security, safety and benefit northern/remote communities.

Marotti oil is inedible and available mainly in the state of Kerala. The oil is extracted from Marotti seeds. However, the high viscosity, poor volatility and cold flow characteristics of many vegetable oils in general, and Marotti oil in particular, can cause problems such as injector coking, severe engine deposits, filter gumming, piston ring sticking and thickening of lubrication from long-term use in diesel engines. These problems can be eliminated or minimised by transesterification of the vegetable oils to form monoesters. Although transesterification improves the fuel properties of vegetable oil, the viscosity and volatility of biodiesel are still worse than for petroleum diesel fuel. Subsequently, Marotti oil was converted into its methyl ester by the process of transesterification. The methyl ester was blended with diesel in various proportions to obtain different blends of Marotti oil with diesel. The performance, emission and combustion characteristics of Marotti methyl ester and its blends with diesel were studied and the results were compared with the base line data generated for diesel operation. Experiments were conducted using an injection timing of 23° before top dead centre (BTDC) and an injection pressure of 205 bar at various power outputs and at a constant rated speed of 1500 rpm. The engine manufacturer specifies an injection timing of 23° BTDC and injection pressure of 205 bar for the standard diesel fuel operation. The heat release rates, maximum rate of pressure rise, ignition delay and combustion duration for these fuel combinations were obtained. From the results obtained, it was observed that the biodiesel produced from Marotti oil and its blends with diesel have slightly reduced brake thermal efficiency and increased smoke, hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and reduced NOx emissions compared with diesel-only operation. The investigation showed that the B20 biodiesel blend of Marotti oil with diesel produced better performance in terms of higher brake thermal efficiency, lower specific fuel consumption and comparatively lower emissions compared to the other blend ratios considered. © 2009 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Alternative fuel; Emissions; Marotti oil; Marotti oil methyl ester","Base line; Biodiesel blends; Blend ratios; Brake thermal efficiency; CI engine; Cold flows; Combustion characteristics; Combustion duration; Compression ignition engine; Direct injection; Emission characteristics; Emissions; Engine manufacturers; Feasibility studies; Fuel properties; Heat release rates; Ignition delays; Injection pressures; Injection timing; Methyl esters; Monoesters; Petroleum diesel fuels; Power out put; Rate of pressure; Specific fuel consumption; Top dead centres; Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Brakes; Carbon monoxide; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Engines; Esterification; Esters; Hydrocarbons; Ignition; Lubricating oils; Piston rings; Smoke; Time measurement; Transesterification; Vegetable oils; Vegetables; Viscosity; Leakage (fluid)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957738710

Although range expansions in pinyon-juniper populations have been documented with changing climate throughout the Holocene, over the last century, local scale impacts such as livestock grazing, changes in fire regimes, and increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations are thought to be more recent drivers of pinyon-juniper woodland distribution. Our objective was to examine the role of historical livestock grazing relative to past climate in regulating pinyon (Pinus edulis Engelm.) recruitment and growth over the last century in a persistent pinyon-juniper woodland. We compared pinyon dynamics on a remote mesa site, minimally grazed by domestic livestock, to a nearby historically grazed site in southeastern Utah. The presence of a significant number of old trees (&gt;200 yr) at both sites suggests that these populations were well established prior to the 20th century. No differences in pinyon density or basal area were observed between grazed and ungrazed sites. Stand age structure data showed that pinyon recruitment across these sites was highly synchronous, with a large recruitment event occurring during the early 1900s; 17 of the pinyons on both sites dated to the 1920s. Climatic conditions during this decade were consistently cool and wet-conditions known to support enhanced recruitment and growth in pinyon pines. Pinyon growth was also strongly synchronous across sites (r0.96). Pinyon growth was significantly correlated with winter/spring precipitation and negatively correlated with June temperature. Taken together, our results suggest that past climate may be more important in structuring pinyon populations than historical land use in these persistent pinyon-juniper woodlands. Given future climate projections of increasing temperature and more extended drought periods, regeneration of pinyon populations following the recent regional-scale dieback may be slow. Moreover, prolonged drought combined with potentially slow regeneration times for pinyon under future climate scenarios could result in substantial declines in pinyon populations across the region, a result that land managers should consider when planning for future restoration treatments in persistent pinyon-juniper woodlands. © Society for Range Management.","Age structure; Climate change; Grand StaircaseEscalante National Monument; Land use change; Pinyon; Tree growth; Tree ring; Woodland expansion; Woody encroachment","age structure; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; comparative study; coniferous forest; dieback; grazing; growth rate; growth response; Holocene; land use change; livestock farming; paleoclimate; range expansion; recruitment (population dynamics); regeneration; restoration ecology; tree ring; twentieth century; woodland; Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument; North America; United States; Utah; Juniperus; Pinus edulis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450182719

Buildings, roads and other similar hard surfaces in big cities have made up an artificial ecosystem with the intensive use of vehicles. Trees and open areas can contribute very well to the arrangement of the artificial urban climate. No matter being of what scale, any park located within the urban structure can well regulate the balance of heat in residential areas significantly. At this point, the character of the vegetation, its distribution throughout the city, size and such other factors carry importance. The basic purpose of this research is to draw attention to the contribution of green areas with different characters that have made to the climate of city of Ankara, Turkey and help develop studies for formation of certain data concerning the subject for urban planning studies and henceforth proposals for planning of green areas. In order to determine the contributions of the open and green areas to the urban climate. In this study, three type of green areas of different characters were chosen and temperature and humidity levels of these areas and the surroundings were measured. The results of the research indicated that the green areas that are placed among the residential areas can create different microclimates in terms of temperature and humidity values when they are designed and positioned accordingly, irrespective of their size. © 2009 Academic Journals.","Ankara; Green space; Humidity; Temperature; Urban climate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349572625

By grounding the article in the literature on regulatory capitalism and governance, I follow the career of a specific legislative process: the enactment of Israel's Deposit Law on Beverage Containers, which aims to delegate the responsibility for recycling to industry. I show that one crucial result of this process was the creation of a non-profit entity licensed to act as a compliance mechanism. This new entity enabled industry to distance itself from the responsibility of recycling, and thereby frustrated the original objective of the legislation, which was to implement the principle of "" extended producer responsibility."" Furthermore, this entity, owned by commercial companies and yet acting as an environmentally friendly organization, allowed industry to promote an anti-regulatory agenda via a "" civic voice."" The study moves methodologically from considering governance as an institutional structure to analyzing the process of "" governancing,"" through which authoritative capacities and legal responsibilities are distributed among state and non-state actors. Two key findings are that this process and its outcome (i) are premised on an ideology of civic voluntarism, which ultimately delegates environmental responsibilities to citizens; and (ii) facilitate an anti-regulatory climate that serves commercial interests. © 2009 The Author.

Continued conservation as climate changes will require thinking differently about resource management than we have in the past; we present some logical steps and tools for doing so. Three critical tenets underpin future management plans and activities: (1) climate patterns of the past will not be the climate patterns of the future; (2) climate defines the environment and influences future trajectories of the distributions of species and their habitats; (3) specific management actions may help increase the resilience of some natural resources, but fundamental changes in species and their environment may be inevitable. Science-based management will be necessary because past experience may not serve as a guide for novel future conditions. Identifying resources and processes at risk, defining thresholds and reference conditions, and establishing monitoring and assessment programs are among the types of scientific practices needed to support a broadened portfolio of management activities. In addition to the control and hedging management strategies commonly in use today, we recommend adaptive management wherever possible. Adaptive management increases our ability to address the multiple scales at which species and processes function, and increases the speed of knowledge transfer among scientists and managers. Scenario planning provides a broad forward-thinking framework from which the most appropriate management tools can be chosen. The scope of climate change effects will require a shared vision among regional partners. Preparing for and adapting to climate change is as much a cultural and intellectual challenge as an ecological challenge.","Adaptation; Adaptive management; Climate change; National parks; Reserves; Scenario planning; Uncertainty","Adaptation; Adaptive Management; Climate patterns; Fundamental changes; Future climate; Knowledge transfer; Management activities; Management plans; Management strategies; Management tool; Monitoring and assessment; Multiple scale; National parks; Past and present; Reference condition; Resource management; Scenario Planning; Science-based management; Shared vision; Knowledge management; Management science; Natural resources management; Parks; Planning; Climate change; adaptive management; biodiversity; climate change; conservation planning; habitat management; national park; nature reserve; resource management; adaptive environmental management; climate change; ecology; ecosystem; environment; environmental planning; environmental protection; habitat; law; national park; resource management; review; scientist; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73449114286

We synthesized data spanning 15 years of experimentation during which interannual mean growing season temperature varied by 2°C and precipitation by 2.5 cm. We also manipulated temperature within mesocosms to test the affect of temperature on primary production and strength of direct and indirect trophic interactions. Both approaches produced similar results: plant production was not directly affected by temperature or precipitation, but the strength of top-down indirect effects on grasses and forbs increased by 30-40% per 1°C.

The extent of these impacts will vary across industries, depending on their energy intensities, the mix of energy sources they rely on and how energy is used in production activities (heat and power, feedstock). Of relevance is also the speed and rigor with which industries adopt new technologies and retire (or replace) old ones.

There remains considerable uncertainty, however, regarding the carbon (C) sink/source potential of these systems and few studies have examined C dynamics in conjunction with other important greenhouse gases. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of an alternative management scenario (reduced tillage and cover cropping) on ecosystem respiration (RE) and nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes in a maize (Zea mays L.)/soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation ecosystem in east-central Minnesota, United States. The control treatment was managed using fall tillage with a chisel plow in combination with a tandem disk, and the experimental treatment was managed using strip tillage and a winter rye (Secal cereale) cover crop. Over the two-year study period (2004-2005), cumulative RE was 222.7 g C m-2 higher in the alternatively managed treatment as a result of increased decomposition of the cover crop residue. N2O fluxes were similar in both treatments during the 2004 growing season and were 100.1 mg N m-2 higher in the conventional treatment during the 2005 growing season after nitrogen (N) fertilization. N fertilization and fertilizer type were the dominant factors controlling N2O fluxes in both treatments. CH4 fluxes were negligible in both treatments and often below the detection limit. Cumulative growing season N2O losses in the control and experimental treatments, which totalled 38.9 ± 3.1 and 26.1 ± 1.7 g C m-2 when converted to CO2 equivalents, were comparable to the annual estimates of net ecosystem CO2 exchange in both treatments. This study further supports that N2O losses are an important component of the total greenhouse gas budget of agroecosystems. It also suggests that spring cover cropping, without residue removal, has limited C sequestration potential. The results from this study, however, may not necessarily represent equilibrium conditions in the experimental treatment. Rather, they are a measure of the transient response of the system after tillage conversion and cover crop addition. It is expected that the soil microbes will continue to adjust to the reduction in tillage and increased C inputs. Therefore, continued, long-term monitoring is needed to confirm whether the results are representative of equilibrium conditions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Cover cropping; Ecosystem respiration; Methane fluxes; Nitrous oxide fluxes; Reduced tillage; Soil respiration","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural management; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; cover crop; crop rotation; greenhouse gas; growing season; maize; methane; nutrient loss; respiration; soybean; tillage; Minnesota; North America; United States; Glycine max; Secale cereale; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349096366

Testing direct emissions of pollutants from different sources neglects atmospheric transformations that may increase or decrease their toxicity. This work describes a system that conditionally samples particles from the atmosphere depending on the sources or source combinations that predominate at the sampling site at a given time. A single particle mass spectrometer (RSMS-II), operating in the 70-150 nm particle diameter range, continuously provides the chemical composition of individual particles. The mass spectra indicate which sources are currently affecting the site. Ten ChemVol samplers are each assigned one source or source combination, and the RSMS-II controls which one operates depending on the sources or source combinations observed.Byrunning this system for weeks at a time, sufficient sample is collected by the ChemVols for comparative toxicological studies.

Previously we demonstrated that an F7 bag-type filter that incorporates activated carbon (a ""combination filter"") reduces this adverse effect compared to an equivalent filter without carbon. The aim of the present study was to examine how the amount of activated carbon (AC) used in combination filters affects their ability to remove both sensory offending pollutants and ozone. A panel evaluated the air downstream of four different filters after each had continuously filtered outdoor suburban air over a period of 6 months. Interim assessments (mid-term evaluation) were performed after 3 months. During both assessments, four unused filters, identical in type to the loaded filters, were also evaluated. The evaluated filters included a conventional F7 fiberglass filter and three modifications of a bag-type fiberglass combination filter: the ""Heavy"" corresponded to a commercially available filter containing 400 g of carbon per square meter of filter area, the ""Medium"" contained half as much carbon (200 g/m2), and the ""Light"" contained a quarter as much carbon (100 g/m2). Each filter was weighed at the beginning of the soiling period and after 3 and 6 months of service. Additionally, up- and down-stream ozone concentrations and filter pressure drops were measured monthly. Following 6 months of service, the air downstream of each of the combination filters was judged to be significantly better than the air downstream of the 6-month-old F7 filter, and was comparable to that from an unused F7 filter. Additionally, the combination filters removed more ozone from the air than the F7 filter, with their respective fractional removal efficiencies roughly scaling with their carbon content. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Box 38, Solomons, MD 20688, United States","A variety of approaches have previously been developed to estimate the fraction of terrestrial or marine organic carbon present in aquatic sediments. The task of quantifying each component is especially important for the Arctic due to the regions' sensitivity to global climate change and the potential for enhanced terrestrial organic carbon inputs with continued Arctic warming to alter carbon sequestration. Yet it is unclear how each approach compares in defining organic carbon sources in sediments as well as their impact on regional or pan-Arctic carbon budgets. Here, we investigated multiple methods: (1) two end-member mixing models utilizing bulk stable carbon isotopes; (2) the relationship between long-chain n-alkanes and organic carbon (ALKOC); (3) principal components analysis (PCA) combined with scaling of a large suite of lipid biomarkers; and (4) ratios of branched and isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipids (the BIT index) to calculate the fraction of terrestrial organic matter components preserved in Arctic marine sediments. Estimated terrestrial organic carbon content among approaches showed considerable variation for identical sediment samples. For a majority of the samples, the BIT index resulted in the lowest estimates for terrestrial organic carbon, corroborating recent suggestions that this proxy may represent a distinct fraction of terrestrial organic matter; i.e., peat or soil organic matter, as opposed to markers such as n-alkanes or long-chain fatty acids which measure higher plant wax inputs. Because of the patchy inputs of n-alkanes to this region from coastal erosion in the western Arctic, the ALKOC approach was not as effective as when applied to river-dominated margins found in the eastern Arctic. The difficulties in constraining a marine δ13C end-member limit the applicability of stable isotope mixing models in polar regions. Estimates of terrestrial organic carbon using the lipid-based PCA method and the bulk δ13C mixing model approach varied drastically at each site, suggesting that organic matter fractions such as amino acids or carbohydrates may affect bulk organic matter composition in a manner that is not captured in the lipid-based analysis. Overall, terrestrial organic matter inputs to the Chukchi and western Beaufort Seas using the average of the methods at each site ranged from 11% to 44%, indicating that land-derived organic matter plays a substantial role in carbon dynamics in the western Arctic Ocean. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We consider here a conceptual alternative to more standard schemes, such as HIDIF (Heavy Ion Driven Inertial Fusion), which are still beyond the present state of the art of particle accelerators, even though the requirements on the total beam energy are lowered by fast ignition scenarios. The new generation of petawatt class lasers open new possibilities: acceleration of electrons or protons for the fast ignition and eventually light or heavy ions acceleration for compression. The pulses of chirped pulse amplification (CPA) lasers allow ions acceleration with very high efficiency at reachable intensities (I ∼ 1021 W / cm2), if circularly polarized light is used since we enter in the radiation pressure acceleration (RPA) regime. We analyze the possibility of accelerating carbon ion bunches by interaction of a circularly polarized pulses with an ultra-thin target. The advantage would be compactness and modularity, due to identical accelerating units. The laser efficiency required to have an acceptable net gain in the inertial fusion process is still far from the presently achievable values both for CPA short pulses and for long pulses used for direct illumination. Conversely the energy conversion efficiency from the laser pulse to the ion bunch is high and grows with the intensity. As a consequence the energy loss is not the major concern. For a preliminary investigation of the ions bunch production we have used the PIC code ALaDyn developed to analyze the results of the INFN-CNR PLASMONX experiment at Frascati National Laboratories (Rome, Italy) where the 0.3 PW laser FLAME will accelerate electrons and protons. We present the results of some 1D simulations and parametric scan concerning the acceleration of carbon ions that we suppose to be fully ionized. Circularly polarized laser pulses of 50 J and 50-100 fs duration, illuminating a 100 μ m2 area of a 20 nm thick carbon target, produce 2 × 1011 monoenergetic ions of 0.5 GeV with 30% efficiency. Fully 3D simulations show a non-dramatic degradation of the beam properties. In order to reach regimes interesting for the inertial fusion, 1-2 kJ lasers with pulse duration in the 100-500 fs range should be considered with an illuminated surface of few hundreds squared microns, which would insure ∼ 1012 ions per shot to be produced. The efficiencies would range from 30% to 70% so that the energy of ions would vary from 0.3 to 1.5 kJ. With a few hundreds of such lasers a total energy of ∼ 0.2 - 0.6 MJ, required in the fast ignition scenario, would be reached. By tailoring the space distribution of the beams and their time sequence an adiabatic compression may be reached avoiding the issues related to the charge neutralization in the final focus. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the potential for nutrients to accelerate heterotrophic processes and fluxes of detritus, few studies have examined detritus-nutrient dynamics at whole-ecosystem scales. We quantified organic matter (OM) budgets over three consecutive years in two detritus-based Appalachian (USA) streams. After the first year, we began enriching one stream with low-level nitrogen and phosphorus inputs. Subsequent effects of nutrients on outputs of different OM compartments were determined using randomized intervention analysis. Nutrient addition did not affect dissolved or coarse particulate OM export but had dramatic effects on fine particulate OM (FPOM) export at all discharges relative to the reference stream. After two years of enrichment, FPOM export was 340% higher in the treatment stream but had decreased by 36% in the reference stream relative to pretreatment export. Ecosystem respiration, the dominant carbon output in these systems, also increased in the treatment stream relative to the reference, but these changes were smaller in magnitude than those in FPOM export. Nutrient enrichment accelerated rates of OM processing, transformation, and export, potentially altering food-web dynamics and ecosystem stability in the long term. The results of our large-scale manipulation of a detrital ecosystem parallel those from analogous studies of soils, in which net loss of organic carbon has often been shown to result from experimental nutrient addition at the plot scale. Streams are useful model systems in which to test the effects of nutrients on ecosystem-scale detrital dynamics because they allow both the tracking of OM conversion along longitudinal continua and the integrated measurement of fluxes of transformed material through downstream sites. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","Appalachian (usa) streams; Coweeta hydrologie laboratory, North Carolina, USA; Detritus; Ecological stoichiometry; Nitrogen; Nutrient limitation; Organic matter budget; Phosphorus; Soils; Streams","nitrogen; phosphorus; detritus; food web; freshwater ecosystem; headwater; nutrient cycling; nutrient enrichment; organic matter; phosphorus; respiration; soil nutrient; stoichiometry; stream; article; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant; river; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plants; Rivers; Coweeta; North America; North Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69449102385

The obtained results showed the DFVs to emit higher amounts of PAHs than the GFVs per km driving distance at low average speed in the AU driving cycle, while the GFVs emitted higher amounts of PAHs than the DFVs per km driving distance at higher average speeds in the AR and AM driving cycles. Furthermore, the study showed an increase in PAH emissions per km driving distance with increasing average speed for the GFVs with the opposite trend found for the DFVs. The GFVs generated particulate matter with higher PAH content than the DFVs in all three driving cycles tested with the highest concentrations obtained in the AR driving cycle.

The DFVs displayed higher sum added potential carcinogenicity of the measured PAHs than the GFVs in the AU driving cycle with the opposite trend found in the AR and AM driving cycles. The findings of this study show the importance of including the dibenzopyrenes in vehicle exhaust chemical characterizations to avoid potential underestimation of the carcinogenic activity of the emissions. The lower emissions and the lower sum added potential carcinogenicity of the measured PAHs found in this study for the GFVs compared to the DFVs in the AU driving cycle indicate the GFVs to be preferred in dense urban areas with traffic moving at low average speeds with multiple start and stops. However, the obtained results suggest the opposite to be true at higher average speeds with driving at rural roads and motorways. Further studies are, however, needed to establish if the observed differences between GFVs and DFVs are generally valid as well as to study the effects on variations in vehicle/engine type, ambient temperature, fuel and driving conditions on the emission factors. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-temperature isotropic (LTI) pyrolytic carbon reportedly reduces cartilage wear in canine hemiarthroplasties. We therefore initiated a study in humans when it was released for human use. However, we observed failures in some patients. We therefore document and report the high failure rate observed in a subset of patients treated with an LTI pyrolytic carbon femoral head for osteonecrosis. We conducted a prospective pilot study of 17 patients treated with a titanium stem and an LTI pyrolytic carbon femoral head bearing surface for unipolar hemiarthroplasty for either femoral neck fracture (10 patients) or osteonecrosis (seven patients). One of 10 patients in the fracture group underwent conversion to THA as a result of arthritic progression compared with six of seven patients with osteonecrosis who underwent conversion to THA as a result of acetabular wear and severe groin pain. In this small series, patients with osteonecrosis had a higher rate of revision compared with the patients treated for femoral neck fracture. Level of Evidence: Level III, therapeutic study.

The goal of this study is to evaluate how afforestation affects mineral soil quality, including pH, sodium, exchangeable cations, organic carbon, and nitrogen, and to examine the magnitude of these changes regionally where afforestation rates are high. We also examine potential mechanisms to reduce the impacts of afforestation on soils and to maintain long-term productivity. Across diverse plantation types (153 sites) to a depth of 30 cm of mineral soil, we observed significant decreases in nutrient cations (Ca, K, Mg), increases in sodium (Na), or both with afforestation. Across the data set, afforestation reduced soil concentrations of the macronutrient Ca by 29% on average (P < 0.05). Afforestation by Pinus alone decreased soil K by 23% (P < 0.05). Overall, plantations of all genera also led to a mean 71% increase of soil Na (P < 0.05). Mean pH decreased 0.3 units (P < 0.05) with afforestation. Afforestation caused a 6.7% and 15% (P < 0.05) decrease in soil C and N content respectively, though the effect was driven principally by Pinus plantations (15% and 20% decrease, P < 0.05). Carbon to nitrogen ratios in soils under plantations were 5.7-11.6% higher (P < 0.05). In several regions with high rates of afforestation, cumulative losses of N, Ca, and Mg are likely in the range of tens of millions of metric tons. The decreases indicate that trees take up considerable amounts of nutrients from soils; harvesting this biomass repeatedly could impair long-term soil fertility and productivity in some locations. Based on this study and a review of other literature, we suggest that proper site preparation and sustainable harvest practices, such as avoiding the removal or burning of harvest residue, could minimize the impact of afforestation on soils. These sustainable practices would in turn slow soil compaction, erosion, and organic matter loss, maintaining soil fertility to the greatest extent possible. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","Acidification; Afforestation; Base cations; Salinity; Soil carbon; Soil nutrients; Sustainable harvest","carbon; nitrogen; acidification; afforestation; carbon dioxide; cation; human activity; meta-analysis; pH; plantation; soil carbon; soil fertility; soil management; soil nitrogen; soil profile; soil quality; sustainable development; article; chemistry; ecosystem; forestry; meta analysis; metabolism; pH; physiology; soil; tree; Carbon; Ecosystem; Forestry; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Nitrogen; Soil; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71549119198

We examined how microbial functional genes and biogeochemical pools responded to the altered chemical inputs accompanying land use change. We examined paired native grasslands and adjacent Eucalyptus plantations (previously grassland) in Uruguay, a region that lacked forests before European settlement. Along with measurements of soil carbon, nitrogen, and bacterial diversity, we analyzed functional genes using the GeoChip 2.0 microarray, which simultaneously quantified several thousand genes involved in soil carbon and nitrogen cycling. Plantations and grassland differed significantly in functional gene profiles, bacterial diversity, and biogeochemical pool sizes. Most grassland profiles were similar, but plantation profiles generally differed from those of grasslands due to differences in functional gene abundance across diverse taxa. Eucalypts decreased ammonification and N fixation functional genes by 11% and 7.9% (P &lt; 0.01), which correlated with decreased microbial biomass N and more NH4+ in plantation soils. Chitinase abundance decreased 7.8% in plantations compared to levels in grassland (P = 0.017), and C polymer-degrading genes decreased by 1.5% overall (P &lt; 0.05), which likely contributed to 54% (P &lt; 0.05) more C in undecomposed extractable soil pools and 27% less microbial C (P &lt; 0.01) in plantation soils. In general, afforestation altered the abundance of many microbial functional genes, corresponding with changes in soil biogeochemistry, in part through altered abundance of overall functional gene types rather than simply through changes in specific taxa. Such changes in microbial functional genes correspond with altered C and N storage and have implications for long-term productivity in these soils.

This paper presents a set of broad implications of advances in tree cloning technology on forest management and planning, and how these advances relate to socio-economic and environmental concerns of a growing human population. The discussion is divided into topics that present socio-economic and political issues and topics that present environmental issues. On the production side, there are difficulties in initiating embryogenic tissue of cloned trees, and genetic variation may still occur during the tissue culture process. However, if production issues can be overcome, tree cloning techniques may possibly accelerate forest tree selection processes and reduce cloned seedling costs. The silviculture applied to clonal tree plantations may differ from current seed orchard-based plantations as it relates to site preparation, planting density, thinning opportunities, intermediate treatments, and final rotation age. These alternatives need to be assessed, yet it seems that clonal tree plantations could result in a higher rate of return for a forest investment, due to higher growth rates and more uniform tree characteristics. Plantations composed of cloned seedlings may also result in wood quality traits that are more consistent, although manufacturing processes may have to take into account higher levels of juvenile wood. Matching desired genetic characteristics of trees to site conditions is a challenge, although limited results suggest low levels of response differences of clonal plantations to changing environmental conditions. Maintaining genetic diversity and managing risks associated with mass infestation of trees from diseases and insects are other issues for forest management and planning. And politically, forest managers must address the notion that the natural genetic pool may become polluted. These issues are important at the stand and the landscape level, as losses (for example) due to disease can be catastrophic in forests with limited genetic variability. The potential impact of climate change might suggest conservation strategies that differ from tree breeding objectives for timber production, although fast-growing trees may help reduce CO2 from the atmosphere, since biomass accumulation is related to the diameter and height of trees. Clonal forestry research efforts may also be valuable in identifying tree varieties that are more adaptable to climate change, should naturally-regenerated stands become affected on a large scale.","clonal technology; environment; forest management; tree improvement","climate effect; conservation management; environmental issue; forest management; forestry policy; forestry production; genetic variation; plantation forestry; population growth; silviculture; stand dynamics; thinning; United States; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954740889

Whether this synthetic compound also has anti-cancer potentials has been evaluated in vivo on DMBA (7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene) induced skin cancer in mice by analyzing results of several cytogenetic endpoints, Comet assay, and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).

Feeding of this synthetic coumarin induced positive modulations in expression of all biomarkers in DMBA administered mice, giving clues on its possible signaling pathway(s) - primarily through down-regulation of Aryl hydrocarbon receptor and PCNA and up-regulation of apoptotic proteins like Bax, Bad, Cytochrome c, Apaf, Caspase-3 and Caspase-9, resulting in an appreciable reduction in growth of papilloma in mice.

Utilizing an experimental technique developed to investigate noise sources along the radius of the blades, together with cross-correlation and coherence analyses of the near field and far field, the modified blade-tip configurations are shown to reduce the rotor-only aeroacoustic signature of the fan as a direct consequence of changes induced in tip-leakage flow behavior. These changes in the nature of flow mechanisms in the region of the blade tip are correlated with the spanwise noise sources, and their role in the creation of overall acoustic emissions is thus clarified. The tip-leakage flow structures are analyzed to identify their contribution to overall noise and interaction with other noise sources. Coherence spectra are also analyzed to investigate the relevance of the noise sources. The cross-correlations reveal distinctive acoustic signatures that are described in detail. The methodology has been demonstrated to be effective in identifying (i) the blade-tip configuration with the best acoustic performance, and (ii) other significant noise sources along the blade span. The modified tip configurations are shown to have a significant effect on the multiple vortex behavior of leakage flow, especially with respect to the near-wall fluid-flow paths on both blade surfaces.

Yet, there is still much uncertainty regarding the dynamics of the MOC and its variability. It is well established, however, that through geostrophy the zonally integrated meridional transport at a particular latitude and depth can be determined from the east-west bottom pressure difference across the basin. Therefore, rather than consider the MOC as a large-scale system, this paper focuses on the dynamics of this geostrophic relationship in two numerical ocean models at a single latitude (50°N) in the subpolar Atlantic. First, it is shown that the bottom pressure on the western boundary is sufficient to recover, with high fidelity, the interannual meridional transport variability at 50°N over a 100 year period in the climate model HadCM3. It is found that the variability of western boundary pressure is closely associated with density changes over the continental slope. These changes lead to a large zonal gradient in potential energy and imply an unfeasible depth-mean velocity over the slope. The western boundary pressure, from which the meridional transport can be recovered, is generated as a compensation to this and limits the depth-mean flow. This demonstrates that in numerical ocean models, at least, meridional transport variability is generated as a local response to density changes on the western slope. Whether this is a true representation of actual ocean variability is uncertain, but if it were, then meridional transport variability could largely be determined using only the density field on the western slope.

This study examined how school contextual factors such as homophobic victimization and school climate influence negative outcomes in LGB and questioning middle school students. Participants were 7,376 7th and 8th grade students from a large Midwestern county (50.7% Female, 72.7% White, 7.7% Biracial, 6.9% Black, 5.2% Asian, 3.7% Hispanic, and 2.2% reported ""other""). LGB and sexually questioning youth were more likely to report high levels of bullying, homophobic victimization, and various negative outcomes than heterosexual youth. Students who were questioning their sexual orientation reported the most bullying, the most homophobic victimization, the most drug use, the most feelings of depression and suicidality, and more truancy than either heterosexual or LGB students. A positive school climate and a lack of homophobic victimization moderated the differences among sexual orientation status and outcomes. Results indicate that schools have the ability to lessen negative outcomes for LGB and sexually questioning students through creating positive climates and reducing homophobic teasing. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bullying; Homophobia; Homosexuality; Middle school students; Moderators; School climate; Victimization","achievement; addiction; adolescent; article; bisexuality; depression; female; homosexuality; human; lesbian; male; psychological aspect; questionnaire; school; sexual harassment; social environment; statistics; student; suicide attempt; Achievement; Adolescent; Bisexuality; Depressive Disorder; Female; Homosexuality, Female; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Male; Questionnaires; Schools; Sexual Harassment; Social Environment; Students; Substance-Related Disorders; Suicide, Attempted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649201735

In this paper, we discuss how such basin-scale hydrogeologic impacts (1) may reduce current storage capacity estimates, and (2) can affect regulation of CO2 storage projects. Our assessment arises from a hypothetical future carbon sequestration scenario in the Illinois Basin, which involves twenty individual CO2 storage projects (sites) in a core injection area most suitable for long-term storage. Each project is assumed to inject five million tonnes of CO2 per year for 50 years. A regional-scale three-dimensional simulation model was developed for the Illinois Basin that captures both the local-scale CO2-brine flow processes and the large-scale groundwater flow patterns in response to CO2 storage. The far-field pressure buildup predicted for this selected sequestration scenario support recent studies in that environmental concerns related to near- and far-field pressure buildup may be a limiting factor on CO2 storage capacity. In other words, estimates of storage capacity, if solely based on the effective pore volume available for safe trapping of CO2, may have to be revised based on assessments of pressure perturbations and their potential impacts on caprock integrity and groundwater resources. Our results suggest that (1) the area that needs to be characterized in a permitting process may comprise a very large region within the basin if reservoir pressurization is considered, and (2) permits cannot be granted on a single-site basis alone because the near- and far-field hydrogeologic response may be affected by interference between individual storage sites. We also discuss some of the challenges in making reliable predictions of large-scale hydrogeologic impacts related to CO2 sequestration projects.","Basin-scale; CO2 storage; Pressure buildup; Saline formations","Brine flow; Caprock; Carbon sequestration; Environmental concerns; Far-field; Fluid pressurization; Illinois; Large regions; Limiting factors; Long-term storage; Pore volume; Potential impacts; Pressure build up; Pressure perturbation; Saline formation; Sedimentary basin; Storage capacity; Storage pressures; Storage sites; Three dimensional simulations; Aquifers; Brines; Flow patterns; Groundwater flow; Hydrogeology; Laws and legislation; Pressurization; Simulators; Three dimensional; Three dimensional computer graphics; Water injection; Groundwater resources; aquifer; carbon sequestration; groundwater resource; hydrogeology; sedimentary basin; three-dimensional modeling; Illinois Basin; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71049184435

Since then several other applications have been realised though papermaking has never been on the lead concerning the use of computer-based modelling and simulation. The complex nature of the materials is one of the most demanding challenges and the biggest hurdle for any electronic description of the papermaking process or paper itself. So other industries took the lead and it is now for the paper industry to learn from these industries what can be done with the help of computers to control or optimise processes or to design new grades. The application of results gained with the use of modelling and simulation techniques in pulp and paper manufacturing processes has helped the industry to, for example, reduce emissions and increase the productivity and cost-efficiency of the processes. Still there are many important tasks open. A better understanding of the mechanisms of the processes and their control loops has to be achieved in order to further improve the paper quality, stabilise the wet-end chemistry, and enhance the runnability. Important features to be developed are new process designs, efficient process monitoring and systems that offer decision support during operation. In this paper a review of the state of the art on modelling and simulation in the pulp and paper industry is presented as well as further research needs. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Modelling; Papermaking; Pulping; Simulation","Decision supports; Important features; Modelling and simulations; Papermaking process; Pulp and paper industry; Pulping; Simulation; Wet-end chemistry; Decision support systems; Models; Paper and pulp industry; Papermaking; Process monitoring; Production engineering; Pulp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75349098935

It brings together scholars from diverse schools working on new areas of research and application in urban design and planning. Emergent research agendas include both novel areas of research and important shifts in the direction of a research area. The challenge for planning schools is to reflect critically on these changes and develop long-term research agendas that can better position our field in society and academia, and provide a basis from which to assess our academic programmes. The chapters in this issue display the different scales and fields of planning, including planning for: disaster recovery; climate change, especially opportunities for mitigation; shrinking cities in the First World; and rapidly urbanising informal and impoverished cities in the global South. At the same time, the chapters identify research areas that respond to major social and environmental changes. Olshansky and Chang highlight the increasing losses from catastrophic disasters, and address the need for disaster recovery planning. Wheeler, Randolph and London focus on climate change, and, noting the urgency of action now, their research agenda emphasises opportunities for planners to develop research and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hollander, Pallagst, Schwarz and Popper look at increasing economic and population trends in many First World cities that result in city 'shrinkage'. They present new opportunities for improving cities' green space networks and natural features, and for research. The trebling of urban population in African cities by 2050, in conditions of poverty and informality, is the major trend driving Parnell, Pietriese and Watson's chapter. They present an agenda for new planning theories and for supporting empirical research to address the actual conditions of African cities. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptation; Climate change; Demographics; Disasters; Global South; Global trends; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Informality; Land use; Mitigation; Natural hazards; Reconstruction; Recovery; Research needs; Right to the city; Shrinking cities; Urban Africa; Urban decline; Urban planning; Urban systems","academic research; action plan; catastrophic event; climate change; disaster management; environmental research; greenspace; hazard management; planning theory; recovery plan; urban design; urban planning; urban policy; urban system; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70549100224

We assessed near-surface BD max using the Proctor test under long-term (&gt; 19 yr) moldboard plow (MP), convendonal tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and NT conditions in the central Great Plains and determined its relationships with SOC, particle size distribution, and Atterberg consistency limits. The experiments were located on silt loam soils at Hays and Tribune, KS, and loam soils at Akron, CO, and Sidney, NE. The near-surface BDmax of the MP soil was higher than that of the NT soil by 13% at Sidney, while The near-surface BD max of the CT was higher than that of the NT soil by about 6% at Akron, Hays, and Tribune. Critical water content (CWC) for BDmax in the NT soil was higher than in the CT and MP soils except at Tribune. The BDmax decreased with increase in CWC (r = -0.91). The soil liquid limit was higher for NT than for MP by 82% at Sidney, and it was higher than for CT by 14,9, and 31% at Akron, Hays, and Tribune, respectively.

They are formed by reducing conditions due to oxygen deficiency caused by the accumulation of reduct gases such as CH4, CO2, NH3, or H2S in the soil atmosphere. Soil oxygen may have been displaced by the ascent of CO 2 from post-volcanic mofettes or by CH4 from sanitary landfills. Furthermore, a lack of oxygen causing redoximorphism can occur in unsaturated soils if they contain or receive large quantities of easily decomposable organic matter (i.e., organic urban waste or sludge). Under such circumstances, a gleyic color pattern (e.g., an oxidized Bg horizon above a Cr horizon with strongly reducing conditions) forms without the influence of an aquic moisture regime. Waste-water and petrol infiltration in soil can form a stagnic color pattern without the stagnation of surface water. Such more or less well-drained but strongly redoximorphic horizons should be named as Yg instead of Bg. In some cases, such soils only exist for a short time due to the loss of reduct gases or termination of infiltration of organic liquids. Reductosols are ecotops with oxygen deficiency. Natural Reductosols dominate in recent and former volcanic areas, whereas Reductic Technosols are formed in urban-industrial agglomerations. Their morphology, chemistry, dynamics, genesis, and ecology is summarized and discussed in this paper. Natural gas and CO2 gas are deposited in deeper zones of the earth crust since some time. Leakages of these depots let form reductosols as well. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Comparative results of effluent temperature and product concentrations between experiment and thermodynamic equilibrium calculation show that the NO2 formation in dry air GAD is totally out of thermodynamic equilibrium. Meanwhile, obvious NO (A2∑+) and N2+ (B2∑u+) are detected as the major reactive species in the dry air GAD plasma region. These results suggest that the thermal (or Zeldovich) NOx formation mechanism is not significant in GAD system, while the energy level and the density of electrons in the plasma region will severely influence the NO2 formation. The presence of 500 ppm VOCs in the feed gases shows a limiting influence on the NO2 formation, which is in the order of aromatic hydrocarbon (C6H6 and C7H8) &gt; straight-chain hydrocarbon (C4H10 and C6H14) &gt; halogenated hydrocarbon (CCl4). The influences of VOCs chemical structure, supply voltage, feed gas humidity, and reactor geometry on NO2 formation are investigated, and the results correspond to above mechanism analysis. Based on the above, the possible pathways of the inhibition of NO2 formation in GAD-assisted VOCs decomposition process are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The project, titled ""The New York/New Jersey HarborWatershed Pollution Prevention and Industrial Ecology Project,"" in a very conscious and overt way engaged stakeholders in the process of developing P2 recommendations for the Harbor. The industrial ecology (IE) tools applied by the Harbor Consortium include substance flow analysis (SFA), material flow analysis (MFA), and, to a limited extent, life cycle analysis (LCA) and fate and transport analysis (F&T), to quantify and characterize how the contaminants flow through the regional economy and the Harbor Watershed once released to the environment. The application of these scientific tools to five contaminants at such a large geographical scale, within the context of a broad and inclusive stakeholder process, and with the goal of identifying and implementing pollution prevention strategies, led to a wide range of surprising outcomes and lessons learned.

Infrared (IR) spectroscopy and imaging provide a prime tool to study the characteristics of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules and the mineralogy in regions of star formation. Herbig Ae/Be stars are known to have varying amounts of natal cloud material present in their vicinity. Aims. Our aim is to study the characteristics of the mid-IR emission originating in Herbig Ae/Be stars, especially the extent of the emission and how this relates to the (proto-)stellar characteristics. Methods. Today's powerful ground- and space-based telescopes provide images and. spectra at unprecedented spectral and spatial resolution. We analyse the images and. spectra from, four Herbig Ae/Be stars (IRAS 06084-0611, CD-42 11721, TY CrA, and HD176386), as obtained with TIMMI2 on the ESO 3.6 m telescope and VISIR on the VLT. These observations are supplemented with, data from ISO-SWS and Spitzer-IRAC. Results. We find evidence for large-scale structure and extended emission in all. four sources, except for HD 176386, which only shows silicate emission, all sources show PAH emission in their spectra. In addition, a spatially resolved silicate and PAH spectrum, could be extracted for TY CrA. Conclusions. The variety in emission scales distinguishes two classes. In the first, the morphology and spectral characteristics resemble those of reflection nebulae. In the second, the characteristics are in-line with Herbig A stars. This separation simply reflects a difference in stellar characteristics (e.g. luminosity). In Herbig B stars, dust emission from, the surroundings dominates, where for Herbig A stars, the disk dominates the emission. In this scheme, IRAS 06084-0611 and CD-42 11721 resemble reflection nebulae and HD176386 a more typical Herbig Ae/Be star. TY CrA shows characteristics common to both genuine reflection nebulae and Herbig B stars. We propose a geometry for TY CrA, with most notably, a ∼70 AU inner gap in the 340 AU circumtertiary disk, cleared by a fourth stellar companion. © ESO 2009.","Astrochemistry; Infrared: ISM; ISM: Molecules; Techniques: Spectroscopic","Astrochemistry; Dust emission; In-line; Infrared: ISM; ISM: Molecules; Large-scale structure; Mid-IR emissions; PAH emissions; Reflection nebulae; Space-based telescopes; Spatial resolution; Spatially resolved; Spectral characteristics; Spitzer; Star formations; Techniques: Spectroscopic; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Crystallography; Disks (structural components); Galaxies; Infrared spectroscopy; Mineralogy; Minerals; Molecules; Optical instruments; Optical telescopes; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Reflection; Silicates; Spacecraft observatories; Stars; Telescopes; Emission spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68349113675

Since the EU ETS covers only some industries, it implies a hybrid emission control scheme where EU member states must apply complementary domestic emissions regulation for the non-trading sectors of their economies in order to comply with their national emission reduction targets. The EU ETS thus opens up for strategic partitioning of national emissions budgets by the member states between trading and non-trading sectors. In this paper we examine the potential effects of such strategic behavior on compliance cost and emissions prices. We show that concerns on efficiency losses from strategic partitioning are misplaced. In turn, our analysis implicitly indicates significant political economy forces behind EU climate policy, as both cost-effective and strategically motivated partitioning of national emission budgets are far off from the actual break-down between trading and non-trading sectors. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Considerable analysis of transportation GHGs has been done for California, which has a large population and vehicle fleet and can enact unique emissions regulations; Minnesota represents a more typical state with respect to many demographic and transportation parameters. We conclude that Minnesota has a viable approach to meeting its stated GHG reduction targets (15% by 2015 and 30% by 2025, relative to year 2005) only if advancements are made in all three areassvehicle efficiency, carbon content of fuels, and VKT.

Yet these distinct environmental problems are closely related, since they are both driven by the nature of present energy production and consumption patterns. Our study demonstrates the mutual relevance of, and interaction between, policies designed to address these two environmental challenges individually. Given the many dimensions air pollution control and climate change management have in common, it is surprising that they have only little been analyzed in combination so far. We attempt to cover at least part of the existing gap in the literature by assessing how costs and benefits of technologies and strategies that jointly tackle these two environmental problems can best be balanced. By using specific technological options that cut down local air pollution, e.g. related to particulate emissions, one may concurrently reduce CO2 emissions and thus contribute to diminishing global climate change. Inversely, some of the long-term climate change strategies simultaneously improve the quality of air in the short run. We have extended the well-established MERGE model by including emissions of particulate matter, and show that integrated environmental policies generate net global welfare benefits. We also demonstrate that the discounted benefits of local air pollution reduction significantly outweigh those of global climate change mitigation, at least by a factor of 2, but in most cases of our sensitivity analysis much more. Still, we do not argue to only restrict energy policy today to what should be our first priority, local air pollution control, and wait with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, we propose to design policies that simultaneously address these issues, as their combination creates an additional climate change bonus. As such, climate change mitigation proves an ancillary benefit of air pollution reduction, rather than the other way around. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, more frequent heat waves, droughts and storms and accompanying pathogen attacks are also expected for Europe and are considered to be increasingly important abiotic and biotic stress factors for forests. Adaptive forestry can help forest ecosystems to adapt to these new conditions in order to achieve management goals, maintain desired forest ecosystem services and reduce the risks of forest degradation. With a focus on central Europe, this paper presents the following management strategies: (1) conservation of forest structures, (2) active adaptation, and (3) passive adaptation. The feasibility and criteria for application of the different strategies are discussed. Forest adaptation may entail the establishment of ""neonative"" forests, including the use and intermixing of native and non-native tree species as well as non-local tree provenances that may adapt better to future climate conditions. An integrative adaptive management concept is proposed that combines (1) species suitability tests and modelling activities at the international scale, (2) priority mapping of adaptation strategies at the national to regional scale, and (3) implementation at the local scale. To achieve this, an international experimental trial system is required to test suitable adaptive measures throughout Europe and worldwide. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Biotic agent; Drought; Management strategy; Provenance; Restoration; Storm; Trial system","Adaptation strategies; Adaptive Management; Biotic stress; Central Europe; Climate change impact; Climatic warming; Drought management; Forest degradation; Forest ecosystem; Forest management; Forest productivity; Forest structure; Future climate; Heat waves; International scale; Local scale; Management goals; Management strategies; Management strategy; Non-native; Nonlocal; Passive adaptation; Pathogen attack; Regional scale; Trial systems; Drought; Ecosystems; Forestry; Management; Restoration; Storms; Climate change; Drought; Europe; Forest Management; Pathogens; Provenance; Restoration; Seasonal Variation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71049172930

The exciton absorption line shape exhibits Rabi splitting ∼0.1 eV as the exciton energy is tuned to the nearest interband surface-plasmon resonance of the nanotube. We also show that the quantum confined Stark effect may be used as a tool to control the exciton binding energy and the nanotube band gap in carbon nanotubes in order, e.g., to bring the exciton total energy in resonance with the nearest interband plasmon mode. The exciton-plasmon Rabi splitting we predict here for an individual carbon nanotube is close in its magnitude to that previously reported for hybrid plasmonic nanostructures artificially fabricated of organic semiconductors on metallic films.

This article links the need for reducing transport-related greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries with the current international climate negotiations. Arguing that a sustainable transport approach requires comprehensive policy packages, it assesses the suitability of current climate negotiation proposals in promoting sustainable transport. The project-based approach under the current climate regime incentivises neither comprehensive sustainable transport and mobility policies, nor sufficient numbers of local projects. Current proposals to increase efforts by developing countries, to reform the Clean Development Mechanism, and to create new emission trading mechanisms are promising but still have to overcome several obstacles. One obstacle involves how to properly assess the impact of actions while maintaining streamlined procedures. The authors conclude from their analysis that the best way forward would be to establish an international mitigation fund with a dedicated transport window financed by industrialised countries. This fund would enable developing countries to implement national policies and local projects. Developing countries would outline low-carbon development strategies, including a sectoral strategy for low-carbon transport.","Climate change; Developing countries; International climate regime; Mobility; Post-2012 agreement; Transport",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77149160088

Aiming to inform the population about the air they are breathing, several air quality modelling systems have been developed and tested allowing the assessment and forecast of air pollution ambient levels in many countries. However, every day, an individual is exposed to different concentrations of atmospheric pollutants as he/she moves from and to different outdoor and indoor places (the so-called microenvironments). Therefore, a more efficient way to prevent the population from the health risks caused by air pollution should be based on exposure rather than air concentrations estimations. The objective of the present study is to develop a methodology to forecast the human exposure of the Portuguese population based on the air quality forecasting system available and validated for Portugal since 2005. Besides that, a long-term evaluation of human exposure estimates aims to be obtained using one-year of this forecasting system application. Additionally, a hypothetical 50% emission reduction scenario has been designed and studied as a contribution to study emission reduction strategies impact on human exposure. To estimate the population exposure the forecasting results of the air quality modelling system MM5-CHIMERE have been combined with the population spatial distribution over Portugal and their time-activity patterns, i.e. the fraction of the day time spent in specific indoor and outdoor places. The population characterization concerning age, work, type of occupation and related time spent was obtained from national census and available enquiries performed by the National Institute of Statistics. A daily exposure estimation module has been developed gathering all these data and considering empirical indoor/outdoor relations from literature to calculate the indoor concentrations in each one of the microenvironments considered, namely home, office/school, and other indoors (leisure activities like shopping areas, gym, theatre/cinema and restaurants). The results show how this developed modelling system can be useful to anticipate air pollution episodes and to estimate their effects on human health on a long-term basis. The two metropolitan areas of Porto and Lisbon are identified as the most critical ones in terms of air pollution effects on human health over Portugal in a long-term as well as in a short-term perspective. The coexistence of high concentration values and high population density is the key factor for these stressed areas. Regarding the 50% emission reduction scenario, the model results are significantly different for both pollutants: there is a small overall reduction in the individual exposure values of PM10 (&lt;10 μg m-3 h), but for O3, in contrast, there is an extended area where exposure values increase with emission reduction. This detailed knowledge is a prerequisite for the development of effective policies to reduce the foreseen adverse impact of air pollution on human health and to act on time. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The survey concerns primarily a description of the damage flaws (morphology, flaw size distribution and density) and an evaluation of the roughness and the optical transmission. The results show that the samples average flaw density (number of flaws per cm2 surface) is 316 ± 65. The mean size based on a large number of flaws from all samples is 245 ± 128 μ m. Microscopic observations reveal that the flaws vary also in their morphologies. The main flaw types (micro-cracks, flakes and pits) extend differently in length and depth.

However the distribution of CDM projects has been extremely uneven across countries and regions, and a few technologies and sectors have dominated the early stages of CDM experience. This has caused some to question whether the CDM has fallen short of its potential in contributing to sustainable development. We review the broad patterns of CDM project approvals and evaluate 10 CDM projects according to their sustainability benefits. The difficulty of defining ""sustainable development"" and the process of defining criteria by individual non-Annex 1 governments has meant that sustainable development concerns have been marginalized in some countries. Given these observed limitations, we present possible CDM policy futures, focusing on the main proposals for a post-2012 climate regime. Five options for enhancing the sustainable development benefits in the CDM are discussed, including proactive approaches to favour eligibility of emission reduction projects which ensure such co-benefits. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in some areas climate change may reduce or eliminate non-native invasive species, creating opportunities for restoration. If invasive species are no longer suited to novel climate conditions, the native communities that they replaced may not be viable either. If neither invasive nor native species are climatically viable, a type of "" transformative"" restoration will be required, involving the translocation of novel species that can survive and reproduce under new climate conditions. Here, we illustrate one approach for restoration planning by using bioclimatic envelope modeling to identify restoration opportunities in the western United States, where the invasive plant cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is no longer climatically viable under 2100 conditions projected by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL2.1) coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model. We then select one example of a restoration target area and identify novel plant species that could become viable at the site in the wake of climate change. We do so by identifying the closest sites that currently have climate conditions similar to those projected at the restoration target area in 2100. This approach is a first step toward identifying appropriate species for transformative restoration. © 2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International.","Bioclimatic envelope modeling; Bromus tectorum; Climate change; Ecological niche; Invasive species; Restoration; Species distribution","climate change; environmental restoration; grass; invasive species; native species; restoration ecology; translocation; North America; United States; Bromus; Bromus tectorum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349480910

The ability to achieve these outcomes using only solar energy as an input is particularly attractive. However, the implementation of most photocatalytic processes at an effective scale requires the use of a photoreactor, a device which brings photons, a photocatalyst and reactants into contact, as well as collecting the reaction products. In this work, we review the state-of-the-art in solar photoreactor design and assess those systems which are most applicable for industrial- scale implementation. Designs for parabolic trough, compound parabolic, inclined plate, double skin sheet, rotating disk, water bell, fiber optic, and fixed/fluidized bed photoreactors are qualitatively discussed and compared. Compound parabolic photoreactors are most suited to near term applications at pilot-scale (>1000 L/day) due to their advantageous light collecting properties and well-known design methodology. Double-skin sheet photoreactors are also suited to near term applications; however, significantly less is known about their design and performance discrepancies between studies in the literature have been reported. Compared to other photoreactor designs, the significantly simplified design and low material cost of inclined plate photoreactors makes them particularly suitable for use in economically and logistically challenged areas where the volumes to be treated are small (<100 L/day). Fluidized bed photoreactors are highly efficient, but more research is needed into their design and operation for effective use with solar radiation. The other photoreactor designs reviewed are unlikely to see wide use due to, variously, high mechanical complexity, poor efficiency, and/or susceptibility to environmental conditions but may find limited use in specialized applications, e.g. in instances where it is advantageous to separate the light gathering and photocatalytic components of the photoreactor. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemical synthesis; Collecting property; Design and operations; Design Methodology; Double skin; Energy productions; Environmental conditions; Fluidized bed photoreactors; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Inclined plate; Material cost; Mechanical complexity; Parabolic trough; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic process; Photocatalytic reactors; Photoreactor design; Photoreactors; Pilot scale; Reaction products; Scale-up; Water bell; Fluidization; Fluidized beds; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Light; Photocatalysis; Rotating disks; Skin; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Sun; Synthesis (chemical); Wastewater; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Design",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349678235

Post-deforestation, secondary forest assemblages are comprehensively described, both as broad general assemblages and island-specific variations by calculating species importance values from forest inventory data. Hierarchical clustering and indicator species analysis defined species assemblages, and then correlations between species assemblages and environmental variables were explored with non-metric multidimensional scaling, analysis of variance and χ2 testing. These assemblages are arrayed along environmental gradients of decreasing spring moisture stress, decreasing maximum temperatures, and increasing minimum temperatures. Land-use history is not as important to determining variation in species composition across climatic zones, although several species assemblages are associated with certain geology types or land-use histories. Naturalized tree species are prominent in these secondary forests and contribute to the formation of some novel assemblages, but native late and early successional species also colonize former agricultural land, all influenced by the degree of disturbance. We conclude that environmental factors have an overarching effect on forest species composition across the broader range of climatic, geologic and topographic conditions and larger geographic scales, while land-use history influences subtropical secondary forest species assemblages within a specific climatic zone or set of relatively narrow environmental conditions.","Caribbean; Cluster analysis; Introduced species; Land-use history; NMS ordination; Species composition; Tropical secondary forest","Caribbean; Introduced species; Land-use history; NMS ordination; Species composition; Tropical secondary forest; Cluster analysis; Deforestation; Land use; Regression analysis; Tropics; Landforms; agricultural land; biophysics; clearcutting; climate effect; cluster analysis; Commonwealth of Nations; community composition; deforestation; forest inventory; introduced species; land use change; plant community; secondary forest; tropical forest; Deforestation; Forestry; Land Use; Regression Analysis; Species Identification; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Islands; Greater Antilles; Leeward Islands [Lesser Antilles]; Lesser Antilles; Puerto Rico; Virgin Islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68949159801

An overfilled incised valley presents simple or compound valley-fill architecture, depending on the depth of the valley incision, compared with the height reached by the following sea-level rise. The Ventimiglia incised valley, exposed on the Ligurian coast, north-western Mediterranean margin, presents a spectacular example of compound incised-valley fill, developed in perennial ""overfill"" conditions. The valley was subaerially incised during the Messinian Salinity Crisis and rapidly flooded by the sea at the beginning of Pliocene, then filled by eleven coarse-grained Gilbert-type deltas during Early-Middle Pliocene time. The basal Messinian unconformity is locally paved with subaerial scree breccias and bioclastic shallow-marine sandstones, and blanketed by bathyal marls. These deposits record the lowstand, transgressive and early-highstand systems tracts of the first valley-fill sequence. The subsequent progradation of Gilbert-type deltas occurred in four stages, or depositional sequences, separated by transgressive marine-marl intervals. Within each depositional sequence, the deltaic bodies display offlapping architecture, recording falling shoreline trajectory, downward shifts in facies, and overall forced regression. The water depth and accommodation in the inundated coastal valley was gradually decreasing with time. The reduced accommodation allowed the youngest deltas to prograde out to the shelf edge, triggering mass collapses and subsequent filling into the newly created slump scars. Some of the deltas probably acted as ""canyon-perched deltas"" and supplied sediment to the deep-water slope and floor of the Ligurian Basin. The vertical stacking of Gilbert-type deltas is usually attributed, in tectonically active basins, to fault-related subsidence pulses. In Ventimiglia, the accommodation was created by high-frequency eustatic sea-level rises that, probably accompanied by climate controlled reductions in sediment supply, temporarily outpaced uplift, leading to the development of multiple cycles of infill. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Class I areas in the southeastern United States are among the most impacted in the country; fine particle loadings in the western United States are a fraction of those in the East. In the Southeast, (NH4)2SO4 (ammonium sulfate) predominantly from SO2 (sulfur dioxide) emissions from electric generating utilities and industrial sources contributes 60-70% of the light extinction on the 20% haziest days; particulate organic matter (POM) predominantly from biogenic emissions and biomass burning is the second largest contributor. In the West, the mix of source contributions is more complex. At Class I areas downwind of major urban areas (e.g., California), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), predominantly because of mobile sources, is the dominant contributor to haze. For many western Class I areas, POM from wildland fires and fine particles from windblown dust, largely uncontrollable sources, are significant contributors to haze. International emissions are an additional uncontrollable and significant contribution to total sulfate (SO4) and nitrate (NO3) concentrations at the western Class I areas. In the Southeast, SO2 emissions reductions are projected to result in nearly 1:1 regional SO4 reductions; oxides of nitrogen (NO x) emissions reductions have minimal impact on NO3 concentrations and haze. In the West, SO2 emissions reductions result in incremental SO4 reductions, whereas mobile NOx emissions reductions are projected to reduce NO3 and improve visibility at Class I areas affected by urban areas. Because wildfire, dust, and international emissions have large contributions to the haziest days and are mostly uncontrollable in the West, reductions from anthropogenic sources in the West have less effect in improving visibility compared with the Southeast.

Direct consequences of cumulative post-industrial emissions include increasing global temperature, perturbed regional weather patterns, rising sea levels, acidifying oceans, changed nutrient loads and altered ocean circulation. These and other physical consequences are affecting marine biological processes from genes to ecosystems, over scales from rock pools to ocean basins, impacting ecosystem services and threatening human food security. The rates of physical change are unprecedented in some cases. Biological change is likely to be commensurately quick, although the resistance and resilience of organisms and ecosystems is highly variable. Biological changes founded in physiological response manifest as species range-changes, invasions and extinctions, and ecosystem regime shifts. Given the essential roles that oceans play in planetary function and provision of human sustenance, the grand challenge is to intervene before more tipping points are passed and marine ecosystems follow less-buffered terrestrial systems further down a spiral of decline. Although ocean bioengineering may alleviate change, this is not without risk. The principal brake to climate change remains reduced CO2 emissions that marine scientists and custodians of the marine environment can lobby for and contribute to. This review describes present-day climate change, setting it in context with historical change, considers consequences of climate change for marine biological processes now and in to the future, and discusses contributions that marine systems could play in mitigating the impacts of global climate change. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we quantify the resource potential and investigate the environmental implications of woodbased transportation relative to a fossil reference system for a specific region in Norway. We apply a well-to-wheel life cycle assessment to evaluate four E85 production system designs based on two distinct wood-to-ethanol conversion technologies. We form best and worst case scenarios to assess the sensitivity of impact results through the adjustment of key parameters, such as biomass-to-ethanol conversion efficiency and upstream biomass transport distance. Depending on the system design, global warming emission reductions of 46% to 68% per-MJ-gasoline avoided can be realized in the region, along with reductions in most of the other environmental impact categories considered. We find that the region's surplus forest-bioenergy resources are vast; use for the production of bioethanol today would have resulted in the displacement of 55% to 68% of the region's gasoline-based global warming emission-or 6% to 8% of Norway's total global warming emissions associated with road transportation. © 2009 by Yale University.","Biochemical; Biofuels; Cellulosic ethanol; Industrial ecology; Thermochemical; Wood","Bio-energy; Bio-ethanols; Biochemical; Boreal forests; Considerable resources; Emission reduction; Environmental implications; Ethanol conversion; Industrial ecology; Key parameters; Life-cycle assessments; Production system designs; Reference systems; Regional analysis; Resource potentials; Road transportation; Scandinavia; Second generation; System design; Thermochemical; Transport distances; Transport fuel; Well-to-wheel; Worst case scenario; Bioethanol; Biomass; Cellulosic ethanol; Conversion efficiency; Efficiency; Emission control; Environmental impact; Gasoline; Global warming; Regional planning; Systems analysis; Ethanol; alternative fuel; biofuel; boreal forest; emission control; environmental impact; ethanol; forest resource; life cycle analysis; traffic emission; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349305399

We aimed to determine the mechanism and air pollutant responsible. The effects of pollution on heart rate variability, blood pressure, biomarkers, and brachial flow-mediated dilatation were determined in 2 randomized, double-blind, crossover studies. In Ann Arbor, 50 subjects were exposed to fine particles (150 μg/m) plus ozone (120 parts per billion) for 2 hours on 3 occasions with pretreatments of an endothelin antagonist (Bosentan, 250 mg), antioxidant (Vitamin C, 2 g), or placebo. In Toronto, 31 subjects were exposed to 4 different conditions (particles plus ozone, particles, ozone, and filtered air). In Toronto, diastolic blood pressure significantly increased (2.9 and 3.6 mm Hg) only during particle-containing exposures in association with particulate matter concentration and reductions in heart rate variability. Flow-mediated dilatation significantly decreased (2.0% and 2.9%) only 24 hours after particle-containing exposures in association with particulate matter concentration and increases in blood tumor necrosis factor α. In Ann Arbor, diastolic blood pressure significantly similarly increased during all of the exposures (2.5 to 4.0 mm Hg), a response not mitigated by pretreatments. Flow-mediated dilatation remained unaltered. Particulate matter, not ozone, was responsible for increasing diastolic blood pressure during air pollution inhalation, most plausibly by instigating acute autonomic imbalance. Only particles from urban Toronto additionally impaired endothelial function, likely via slower proinflammatory pathways. Our findings demonstrate credible mechanisms whereby fine particulate matter could trigger acute cardiovascular events and that aspects of exposure location may be an important determinant of the health consequences. © 2009 American Heart Association, Inc.","Endothelium; Hypertension; Inflammation; Oxidative stress; Sympathetic nervous system","antioxidant; ascorbic acid; biological marker; bosentan; ozone; placebo; tumor necrosis factor alpha; ozone; adult; air pollutant; air pollution; article; blood; blood flow; blood pressure; brachial artery; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; endothelium; environmental exposure; female; flow cytometry; health hazard; heart function; heart rate variability; human; human experiment; male; mediator; normal human; outcome assessment; particulate matter; priority journal; signal transduction; vasoconstriction; vasodilatation; air pollutant; air pollution; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; crossover procedure; drug effect; electrocardiography; environmental monitoring; exposure; heart rate; methodology; multicenter study; particulate matter; photochemical smog; physiology; randomized controlled trial; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Blood Pressure; Brachial Artery; Cross-Over Studies; Electrocardiography, Ambulatory; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Male; Oxidants, Photochemical; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349263586

Through such self-propagating changes in function, yeast prions act as protein-based elements of phenotypic inheritance. We report a prion that makes cells resistant to the glucose-associated repression of alternative carbon sources, [GAR+] (for ""resistant to glucose-associated repression,"" with capital letters indicating dominance and brackets indicating its non-Mendelian character). [GAR+] appears spontaneously at a high rate and is transmissible by non-Mendelian, cytoplasmic inheritance. Several lines of evidence suggest that the prion state involves a complex between a small fraction of the cellular complement of Pma1, the major plasma membrane proton pump, and Std1, a much lower-abundance protein that participates in glucose signaling. The Pma1 proteins from closely related Saccharomyces species are also associated with the appearance of [GAR +]. This allowed us to confirm the relationship between Pma1, Std1, and [GAR+] by establishing that these proteins can create a transmission barrier for prion propagation and induction in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The fact that yeast cells employ a prion-based mechanism for heritably switching between distinct carbon source utilization strategies, and employ the plasma membrane proton pump to do so, expands the biological framework in which self-propagating protein-based elements of inheritance operate. © 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.","Glucose repression; PMA1; Prion; STD1; Yeast","cell membrane protein; fungal protein; glucose; prion protein; protein Pma1; protein Std1; proton pump; unclassified drug; article; carbon source; carbon utilization; complex formation; controlled study; extrachromosomal inheritance; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein conformation; protein induction; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; signal transduction; yeast; yeast cell; Carbon; Gene Expression; Genes, Fungal; Glucose; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins; Phenotype; Prions; Proton-Translocating ATPases; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Signal Transduction; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349612496

Some commentators have argued that slowing population growth is necessary to reduce further rises in carbon emissions. Others have objected that this would give rise to dehumanizing ""population control"" programmes in developing countries. Yet the perspective of the developing countries that will be worst affected by climate change has been almost completely ignored by the scientific literature. This deficit is addressed by this paper, which analyses the first 40 National Adaptation Programmes of Action reports submitted by governments of least-developed countries to the Global Environment Facility for funding. Of these documents, 93% identified at least one of three ways in which demographic trends interact with the effects of climate change: (i) faster degradation of the sources of natural resources; (ii) increased demand for scarce resources; and (iii) heightened human vulnerability to extreme weather events. These findings suggest that voluntary access to family planning services should be made more available to poor communities in least-developed countries. We stress the distinction between this approach, which prioritizes the welfare of poor communities affected by climate change, and the argument that population growth should be slowed to limit increases in global carbon emissions.

It has been previously shown that, under denitrifying conditions, inactivation of the cycA gene encoding cytochrome c550, the electron donor to the Cu-containing nitrite reductase, reduces cbb3 expression. In order to establish the role of c 550 in electron transport to the cbb3 oxidase, in this work, we have analyzed cbb3 expression and activity in the cycA mutant grown under microaerobic or denitrifying conditions. Under denitrifying conditions, mutation of cycA had a negative effect on cytochrome c oxidase activity, heme c (FixP and FixO) and heme b cytochromes as well as expression of a fixP'-'lacZ fusion. Similarly, cbb3 oxidase was expressed very weakly in a napC mutant lacking the c-type cytochrome, which transfers electrons to the NapAB structural subunit of the periplasmic nitrate reductase. These results suggest that a change in the electron flow through the denitrification pathway may affect the cellular redox state, leading to alterations in cbb 3 expression. In fact, levels of fixP'-'lacZ expression were largely dependent on the oxidized or reduced nature of the carbon source in the medium.

This paper reports each fleet's carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) mean data. The fleets represent current emission retrofit technologies, such as diesel particulate filters and diesel oxidation catalysts, and a control fleet. This study shows that CO and HC emissions decrease with the use of either retrofit technology when compared with control buses of the same initial emission standards. The CO and HC emission reductions are consistent with published U.S. Environmental Protection Agency verified values. The total oxides of nitrogen (NOx), NO, and the NO2/NOx ratio all increase with each retrofit technology when compared with control buses. As was expected, the diesel particulate filters emitted significantly higher levels of NO2 than the control fleet because of the intentional conversion of NO to NO2 by these systems. Most prior research suggests that NOx emissions are unaffected by the retrofits; however, these previous studies have not included measurements from retrofit devices on-road and after nearly 5 yr of use. Two 2006 model-year buses were also measured. These vehicles did not have retrofit devices but were built to more stringent new engine standards.

This is more pronounced if the major axis of the polarization ellipse is parallel or perpendicular to the molecular axis and at the end of the high-energy plateau. For the O2 molecule (characterized by πg symmetry) the maximum yield is observed for some value of the ellipticity ε different from zero.

Worldwide, policy responses to climate change are increasing the attractiveness of investment in regrowth protection or facilitation which with strategic planning could also deliver substantial dividends for biodiversity conservation. This study compares the performance of two commonly used indicators of biodiversity conservation priority, irreplaceability and complementarity, as tools to support planning for iterative investment to protect natural regrowth of Brigalow, an endangered ecological community in subtropical eastern Australia. Brigalow covered more than seven million hectares prior to clearing, it now persists 'intact' on less than a tenth of that area but there are significant areas of regrowth. Data on Brigalow regrowth derived from mapping and remote sensing identify 10,555 patches covering 280,000 hectares in total. Two different classifications are used to represent Brigalow biodiversity: a land-type classification of 16 'regional ecosystems' mapped at 1:100,000 scale, and a landscape-scale classification of 40 biogeographic subregions that discriminate relatively uniform landscapes at about 1:500,000 scale. Conservation targets are expressed as the extent of regrowth needed to increase the extent of intact or 'remnant' areas of each biodiversity feature to either 5% or 10% of its former extent. In each case, irreplaceability and complementarity are positively correlated, and either metric type could be used to identify relatively large sets of high-priority patches. However, regional-scale restoration is likely to involve iterative investment and therefore to require discrimination of relatively small sets of patches of the highest priority for biodiversity conservation. Irreplaceability is not an ideal measure of biodiversity value when planning such iterative processes, simply because irreplaceability is uninformative for ranking 'high-value' patches; they all have the highest possible score. This study demonstrates the importance of considering quite fundamental points when choosing metrics for conservation planning, such as the frequency distribution of values they produce. Where planning aims to identify quite small sets of very high value features metrics that are most variable among the highest value patches, like the one used for complementarity in this study, will be more useful than metrics that are strongly bounded at higher values. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-elevation plants exhibited larger (yet fewer in number) leaves per plant compared with high-elevation plants. Reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments indicated that differences due to elevation were predominantly environmentally determined, with only a small heritable component for leaf number. Plants did not exhibit a native-site advantage in terms of survival, and selection analyses showed no association between trait variation and fitness. Patterns contrast to recent findings in the grass P. hiemata, highlighting that levels of plastic and genetic variation and responses to climate change may vary markedly between species inhabiting the same environment.

However, all the environmental burdens of an organic waste biological treatment are not always considered. Real data on gaseous emissions released from full-scale composting plants are difficult to obtain. These emissions are related to the composting technology and waste characteristics and therefore, an exhaustive sampling campaign is necessary to obtain representative and reliable data of a single plant. This work proposes a methodology to systematically determine gaseous emissions of a composting plant and presents the results obtained in the application of this methodology to a plant treating source-separated organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) for the determination of ammonia and total volatile organic compounds (VOC). Emission factors from the biological treatment process obtained for ammonia and VOC were 3.9 kg Mg OFMSW-1 and 0.206 kg Mg OFMSW-1 respectively. Emissions associated to energy use and production were also quantified (60.5 kg CO2 Mg OFMSW-1 and 0.66 kg VOC Mg OFMSW-1). Other relevant parameters such as energy and water consumption and amount of rejected waste were also determined. A new functional unit is presented to relate emission factors to the biodegradation efficiency of the composting process and consists in the reduction of the Respiration Index of the treated material. Using this new functional unit, the atmospheric emissions released from a composting plant are directly related to the plant specific efficiency. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that different plant functional groups (cool-season C3 vs. warm-season C4 grasses) between the two prairie restoration treatments would lead to differences in soil and vegetation characteristics and amount of sequestered carbon, compared to the crop system. We found significant (P &lt; 0.05) differences between the two prairie restoration treatments in soil CO2 respiration and above- and belowground productivity, but no significant differences in long-term (∼ 16-year) carbon sequestration. We used a biometric approach aggregating short-term observations of above- and belowground productivity and CO2 respiration to estimate total net primary production (NPP) and net ecosystem production (NEP) using varied methods suggested in the literature. Net ecosystem production is important because it represents the ecosystem carbon sequestration, which is of interest to land managers and policymakers seeking or regulating credits for ecosystem carbon storage. Such a biometric approach would be attractive because it might offer the ability to rapidly assess the carbon source/sink status of an ecosystem. We concluded that large uncertainties in (1) estimating aboveground NPP, (2) determining belowground NPP, and (3) partitioning soil respiration into microbial and plant components strongly affect the magnitude, and even the sign, of NEP estimates made from aggregating its components. A comparison of these estimates across treatments could not distinguish differences in NEP, nor the absolute sign of the overall carbon balance. Longer-term quantification of carbon stocks in the soil, periodically linked to measurements of individual processes, may offer a more reliable measure of the carbon balance in grassland systems, suitable for assigning credits. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","Aboveground; Belowground; Carbon cycling; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sink; Conservation reserve program; Grassland; Net ecosystem production; Net primary production; Southwestern wisconsin; Uncertainty analysis; USA","carbon; nitrogen; C3 plant; C4 plant; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; conservation management; functional group; net ecosystem production; prairie; restoration ecology; soil respiration; article; biometry; chemistry; ecosystem; environmental protection; growth, development and aging; metabolism; methodology; oxygen consumption; Poaceae; soil; soybean; time; Biometry; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Oxygen Consumption; Poaceae; Soil; Soybeans; Time Factors; North America; United States; Wisconsin; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71549144107

An assessment is provided on 24 climate models that constitute phase 3 of the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (WCRP CMIP3), used in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The strength of the ENSO-rainfall teleconnection, defined as the correlation between rainfall and Niño-3.4, is overwhelmingly controlled by the amplitude of ENSO signals relative to stochastic noise, highlighting the importance of realistically simulating this parameter. Because ENSO influences arise from the movement of convergence zones from their mean positions, the well-known equatorial Pacific climatological sea surface temperature (SST) and ENSO cold tongue anomaly biases lead to systematic errors. The climatological SSTs, which are far too cold along the Pacific equator, lead to a complete ""nonresponse to ENSO"" along the central and/or eastern equatorial Pacific in the majority of models. ENSO anomalies are also too equatorially confined and extend too far west, with linkages to a weakness in the teleconnection with Hawaii boreal winter rainfall and an inducement of a teleconnection with rainfall over west Papua New Guinea in austral summer. Another consequence of the ENSO cold tongue bias is that the majority of models produce too strong a coherence between SST anomalies in the west, central, and eastern equatorial Pacific. Consequently, the models' ability in terms of producing differences in the impacts by ENSO from those by ENSO Modoki is reduced. Similarly, the IOD-rainfall teleconnection strengthens with an intensification of the IOD relative to the stochastic noise. A significant relationship exists between intermodel variations of IOD-ENSO coherence and intermodel variations of the ENSO amplitude in a small subset of models in which the ENSO anomaly structure and ENSO signal transmission to the Indian Ocean are better simulated. However, using all but one model (defined as an outlier) there is no systematic linkage between ENSO amplitude and IOD-ENSO coherence. Indeed, the majority of models produce an ENSO-IOD coherence lower than the observed, supporting the notion that the Indian Ocean has the ability to generate independent variability and that ENSO is not the only trigger of the IOD. Although models with a stronger IOD amplitude and rainfall teleconnection tend to have a greater ENSO amplitude, there is no causal relationship; instead this feature reflects a commensurate strength of the Bjerknes feedback in both the Indian and Pacific Oceans. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",,"Austral summers; Bjerknes feedback; Boreal winters; Causal relationships; Climate model; Climate research; Convergence zones; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Eastern equatorial Pacific; ENSO signal; Equatorial Pacific; Indian ocean; Indian ocean dipoles; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Pacific ocean; Papua New Guinea; Sea surface temperatures; Southern Oscillation; SST anomalies; Stochastic noise; Teleconnections; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Nickel compounds; Oceanography; Rain; Stochastic systems; Submarine geophysics; Systematic errors; Climate models; air-sea interaction; climate modeling; climatology; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; rainfall; sea surface temperature; teleconnection; temperature anomaly; Hawaii [United States]; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Papua New Guinea; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76649106088

In this paper, starting from the average composition of undifferentiated municipal solid waste in Italy, the effect of separate collection on greenhouse gases emissions from municipal waste management has been assessed. Different combinations of separate collection scenarios and disposal options (i.e. landfilling and incineration) have been considered. The effect of energy recovery from waste both in landfills and incinerators has also been addressed. The results outline how a separate collection approach can have a significant effect on the emission of greenhouse gases and how wise municipal solid waste management, implying the adoption of Best Available Technologies (i.e. biogas recovery and exploitation system in landfills and energy recovery system in Waste to Energy plants), can not only significantly reduce greenhouse gases emissions but, in certain cases, can also make the overall process a carbon sink.

Ceria (111) surfaces containing positively charged Au ions, either as supported Au+ adatoms or as substitutional Au 3+ ions, are shown to activate molecular CO and to catalyze its oxidation to CO2. In the case of supported single Au+ adatoms, the limiting rate for the CO oxidation is determined by the adsorbate spillover from the adatom to the oxide support. The reaction then proceeds with the CO oxidation via lattice oxygen and O vacancy formation. These vacancies are shown to readily attract the supported Au+ adatoms and to turn them into negatively charged Auδ- adspecies that deactivate the catalyst, preventing further CO adsorption. Au3+ ions dispersed into the ceria lattice as substitutional point defects can instead sustain a full catalytic cycle consisting of three individual steps maintaining their activity along the reaction process: Au cations in AuxCe1-xO2 systems promote multiple oxidations of CO without any activation energy via formation of surface O vacancies. Molecular oxygen adsorbs at these vacancies and forms O adspecies that then catalyze the oxidation of molecular CO, closing the catalytic cycle and recovering the stoichiometric AuxCe 1-xO2 system. The interplay between the reversible Ce 4+/Ce3+ and Au3+/Au+ reductions underpins the high catalytic activity of dispersed Au atoms into the ceria substrate. It is shown that the positive oxidation state of the substitutional Au ions is retained along the catalytic cycle, thus preventing the deactivation of AuxCe1-xO2 catalysts in operation conditions. Finally, although a single Au+ adatom bound to an O vacancy is shown to deactivate during CO oxidation, the calculations predict that the reactivity of gold nanoparticles nucleated at O vacancies can be recovered for cluster sizes as small as Au2. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalytic activity; Catalytic cycles; Cluster sizes; CO adsorption; CO oxidation; Density functional theory calculations; Gold Nanoparticles; Hubbard; Lattice oxygen; Multiple oxidation; Operation conditions; Oxidation of CO; Positive oxidation state; Positively charged; Reaction mechanism; Reaction process; Small clusters; Vacancy formation; Activation energy; Adatoms; Adsorption; Atoms; Carbon monoxide; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalytic oxidation; Cerium; Cerium compounds; Density functional theory; Gold compounds; Molecular oxygen; Oxidation; Point defects; Positive ions; Vacancies; Gold; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; cation; cerium oxide; gold; gold nanoparticle; ion; oxygen; adsorption; article; atom; catalysis; catalyst; chemical reaction; cluster analysis; density functional theory; energy; oxidation; prediction; reaction analysis; stoichiometry; surface property",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68049134429

Unfortunately, this requirement is not met for the 14 High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounders (HIRS) on the historical NOAA satellites, because the instrument was developed for weather forecasts and lacks accuracy and consistency across satellites. It is well known that for HIRS, differences in the spectral response functions (SRF) between instruments and their prelaunch measurement uncertainties often lead to observations of the atmosphere at different altitudes. As a result of the atmospheric lapse rate, they both can introduce significant intersatellite biases. The SRF-dependent biases are further mixed with other effects such as the diurnal cycle because of observation time differences and orbital drifts, on board calibration, and algorithm issues. In this study, the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) observations are used to calculate the radiances for the 14 Television Infrared Observation Satellite series N (TIROS-N; to MetOp-A) HIRS instruments in different climate regimes and seasons to separate the SRF-induced intersatellite biases from other factors. It is found that the calculated radiance ratio (a bias indicator) using IASI observations for the HIRS satellite pairs forms bell-shaped curves that vary with the HIRS model and channel as well as climate regimes. This suggests that a bias found in the polar regions at the Simultaneous Nadir Overpass (SNO) cannot be blindly used for bias correction globally; instead, the IASI/HIRS spectral bias bell curves should be used as a complement to more fully address the biases. These bell curves also serve as lookup charts for separating the bias due to true SRF differences from that caused by SRF prelaunch measurement errors to resolve the inconsistency, which sheds new light on reprocessing and reanalysis in generating fundamental climate data records from HIRS. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",,"Bell-shaped curves; Bias correction; Bias estimation; Climate change detection; Climate data records; Climate regime; Diurnal cycle; High resolution infrared radiation sounders; Infrared atmospheric sounding interferometers; International system of units; Lapse rate; Lookups; Measurement uncertainty; NOAA satellite; On-board calibration; Orbital drift; Polar Regions; Reanalysis; Spectral response functions; Television infrared observation satellites; Time-differences; Weather forecasts; Bells; Climate models; Infrared radiation; Infrared television; Measurement errors; Metric system; Uncertainty analysis; Weather forecasting; Weather satellites; Climate change; algorithm; calibration; climate change; diurnal variation; interferometer; nadir; NOAA satellite; satellite data; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73049087474

Advanced modelling codes require substantial numerical input, therefore the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has worked extensively since 1993 on a library of validated nuclear-model input parameters, referred to as the Reference Input Parameter Library (RIPL). A final RIPL coordinated research project (RIPL-3) was brought to a successful conclusion in December 2008, after 15 years of challenging work carried out through three consecutive IAEA projects. The RIPL-3 library was released in January 2009, and is available on the Web through http://www-nds.iaea.org/RIPL-3/. This work and the resulting database are extremely important to theoreticians involved in the development and use of nuclear reaction modelling (ALICE, EMPIRE, GNASH, UNF, TALYS) both for theoretical research and nuclear data evaluations. The numerical data and computer codes included in RIPL-3 are arranged in seven segments: MASSES contains ground-state properties of nuclei for about 9000 nuclei, including three theoretical predictions of masses and the evaluated experimental masses of Audi et al. (2003). DISCRETE LEVELS contains 117 datasets (one for each element) with all known level schemes, electromagnetic and γ-ray decay probabilities available from ENSDF in October 2007. NEUTRON RESONANCES contains average resonance parameters prepared on the basis of the evaluations performed by Ignatyuk and Mughabghab. OPTICAL MODEL contains 495 sets of phenomenological optical model parameters defined in a wide energy range. When there are insufficient experimental data, the evaluator has to resort to either global parameterizations or microscopic approaches. Radial density distributions to be used as input for microscopic calculations are stored in the MASSES segment. LEVEL DENSITIES contains phenomenological parameterizations based on the modified Fermi gas and superfluid models and microscopic calculations which are based on a realistic microscopic single-particle level scheme. Partial level densities formulae are also recommended. All tabulated total level densities are consistent with both the recommended average neutron resonance parameters and discrete levels. GAMMA contains parameters that quantify giant resonances, experimental gamma-ray strength functions and methods for calculating gamma emission in statistical model codes. The experimental GDR parameters are represented by Lorentzian fits to the photo-absorption cross sections for 102 nuclides ranging from 51V to 239Pu. FISSION includes global prescriptions for fission barriers and nuclear level densities at fission saddle points based on microscopic HFB calculations constrained by experimental fission cross sections. © 2009.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70949104790

Among the key technological barriers are a lack of experience in capturing significant amounts of CO2 from power plants and the significant cost of capturing CO2, particularly from existing coal-fired power plants, which are the single largest source of CO2 emissions in the United States. Compounding these technological issues are regulatory and legal uncertainties, including uncertainty regarding liability for CO2 leakage and ownership of CO2 once injected. According to the IPCC, the National Academy of Sciences, and other knowledgeable authorities, another barrier is the absence of a national strategy to control CO2 emissions (emissions trading plan, CO2 emissions tax, or other mandatory control of CO2 emissions), without which the electric utility industry has little incentive to capture and store its CO2 emissions. Moreover, according to key agency officials, the absence of a national strategy has also deterred their agencies from addressing other important practical issues, such as resolving how stored CO2 would be treated in a future CO2 emissions trading plan. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Across the country, states are adopting policy instruments aimed at carbon mitigation and renewable energy deployment. One of the most prevalent and innovative policy instruments is a renewable portfolio standard (RPS), which seeks to increase the share of renewable energy electrification in the electricity market. This analysis evaluates the effectiveness of state energy programs with an empirical investigation of the linkage between state RPS policy implementation and the percentage of renewable energy electricity generation across states. We use a variant of a standard fixed effects model, referred to as a fixed effects vector decomposition, with state-level data from 1998 to 2006. Results indicate that RPS implementation is not a significant predictor of the percentage of renewable energy generation out of the total generation mix, yet for each additional year that a state has an RPS policy, they are found to increase the total amount of renewable energy generation. These findings reveal a potentially significant shortcoming of RPS policies. Political institutions, natural resource endowments, deregulation, gross state product per capita, electricity use per person, electricity price, and the presence of regional RPS policies are also found to be significantly related to renewable energy deployment. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper concludes by briefly examining how more sustainable patterns of design might be delivered and by whom. It argues that fundamentally good urban design is sustainable, but this implies much more than simply reducing energy use and carbon emissions. Instead, it implies a much more profound basis upon which to make decisions that impact on the social, economic and environmental sustainability of the built environment.

The air quality control can be formalized as a two-objective nonlinear mathematical problem, integrating source-receptor models and the estimate of emission reduction costs. Both aspects present several complex elements. In particular the source-receptor models cannot be implemented through deterministic modelling systems, that would bring to a computationally unfeasible mathematical problem. In this paper we suggest to identify source-receptor statistical models (neural network and neuro-fuzzy) processing the simulations of a deterministic multi-phase modelling system (GAMES). The methodology has been applied to ozone and PM10 concentrations in Northern Italy.

In these tests, not only the deformations have been acquired, but also the acoustic emissions (AE) events, in order to get information about local cracking in the specimens. In addition, a meso-scale numerical model of the test is presented, where every brick of the masonry is modeled in details. Discrete cracks can arise both in the mortar joints and in the brick units. A good correlation is found between the amount of cracking simulated numerically and the experimental AE events for different prism sizes. The model is also able to catch the decrease in the compressive strength with increasing size.

Motor vehicle idling among individual private citizens is one behavior that may be amenable to large-scale policy interventions. Currently, little data are available to quantify the potential reductions in emissions that could be realized by successful policy interventions. In addition, little is known about the motivations and beliefs that underlie idling. In the fall of 2007, 1300 drivers in the US were surveyed to assess typical idling practices, beliefs and motivations. Results indicate that the average individual idled for over 16 min a day and believed that a vehicle can be idled for at least 3.6 min before it is better to turn it off. Those who held inaccurate beliefs idled, on average, over 1 min longer than the remainder of the sample. These data suggest that idling accounts for over 93 MMt of CO2 and 10.6 billion gallons (40.1 billion liters) of gasoline a year, equaling 1.6% of all US emissions. Much of this idling is unnecessary and economically disadvantageous to drivers. The policy implications of these findings are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The combined MALDI-FTICR-MS and 2D-DIGE data show that lung carbonyl reductase (CBR2), involved in prostaglandin metabolism, converting PGE2 to PGF2alpha, is localized to airway cells and is reduced 2-fold in mutant mice compared to normal, both before and after challenge. Further, we observe a downregulation of two key enzymes of retinoic acid metabolism after injury, which is more pronounced in CF mutant mice. These data show that state-of-the-art proteomics can be used to evaluate airway injury in small cell samples.

Before this volcanic belt originated, palaeobotanical evidence suggests that topographic, palaeoclimatic and ecological conditions were different, allowing the establishment of an evergreen tropical forest represented by plants similar to Terminalia, Cedrela and cf. Hypodaphnys, which together suggest the presence of a warm-humid (tropical) climate in a region not higher than 900 masl. In contrast, today Panotla is located at an altitude that varies from 2100 to 2300 masl, has a temperate sub-humid climate, with annual precipitation of 1650 mm, maximum annual temperature of 24.3 °C, and its vegetation is composed of a white pine (Pinus pseudostrobus Lindol.), oak (Quercus spp.) and white cedar (Cupressus benthamii Endl.). Geological and palaeobiological evidence suggests an active volcanic and tectonic scenario that influenced plant evolution by shifting climatic conditions from high temperature-humid to high temperature-dry, selecting the plant communities in the region through time, supporting the change from a tropical rain forest to a xeric vegetation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Hourly emissions fields used in air quality models (AQMs) generally show less temporal variability than corresponding measurements from continuous emissions monitors (CEM) and field campaigns would imply. If emissions control scenarios to reduce emissions at peak ozone forming hours are to be assessed with AQMs, the effect of emissions' daily variability on modeled ozone must be understood. We analyzed the effects of altering all anthropogenic emissions' temporal distributions by source group on 2002 summer-long simulations of ozone using the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) v4.5 and the Carbon Bond IV (CBIV) chemical mechanism with 12 km resolution. We find that when mobile source emissions were made constant over the course of a day, 8-h maximum ozone predictions changed by ±7 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) in many urban areas on days when ozone concentrations greater than 80 ppbv were simulated in the base case. Increasing the temporal variation of point sources resulted in ozone changes of +6 and -6 ppbv, but only for small areas near sources. Changing the daily cycle of mobile source emissions produces substantial changes in simulated ozone, especially in urban areas at night; results suggest that shifting the emissions of NOx from day to night, for example in electric powered vehicles recharged at night, could have beneficial impacts on air quality. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Landfill regulations, self-sufficiency and proximity principles have induced shifts in waste management techniques. Historically, energy security, best use of resources, renewable energy use and climate change mitigation have not been leveraged in waste management strategies. This study examines emerging treatment technologies that could make a contribution in the aforementioned areas and have the potential for working at smaller scales in urban locations. The energy efficiency and environmental and economic performance of two thermal treatment technologies are presented, thus elucidating their potential role in urban strategies in the light of rising energy prices, decarbonisation of the economy, taxation and full use of incentives. The study illustrates that considering the full life cycle, beyond waste management, will enable more strategic technology utilisation. Improvements in viability over time according to evolving regulations are assessed, demonstrating how possible contributions to renewable heat and power can enhance profitability. Combustion technology is analysed for a medium-scale configuration, processing 100 kilotonnes per annum (ktpa) using a steam turbine for heat and power generation, and a large-scale 250 ktpa configuration. Fluidised bed gasification is analysed at the small scale (50 ktpa) and medium scale (100 ktpa) using a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) for heat and power generation. One key aspect is the evaluation of the processing of waste into a predominantly renewable fuel capable of running a gas and steam turbine while rendering a significant proportion of residues reusable. Emission profiles and mass and energy balances are presented quantitatively. A discounted cash flow of material and energy outputs incorporating the effect of incentives across deployment scenarios is presented.

Gregory Drive, Urbana, IL 61801, United States","The effect of rising atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide [CO2] on the reproductive development of soybean (Glycine max. Merr) has not been evaluated under open-air field conditions. Soybeans grown under Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) exhibit warmer canopies due to decreased latent heat loss because of decreased stomatal conductance. According to development models based on accumulated thermal time, or growing degree days (°Cd), increased canopy temperature should accelerate development. The SoyFACE research facility (Champaign, Illinois, USA) was used to test the hypothesis that development is accelerated in soybean when grown in [CO2] elevated to 548 μmol mol -1. Canopy temperature was measured continuously with infrared thermometry, and used in turn to calculate GDD. Opposite to expectation, elevated [CO2], while increasing canopy temperature, delayed reproductive development by up to 3 days (P &lt;0.05). Soybean grown in elevated [CO2] required ∼49 °Cd more GDD (P &lt;0.05) to complete full bloom stage (R2) and ∼52 °Cd more GDD (P &lt;0.05) to complete the beginning seed (R5) stage, but needed ∼46 °Cd fewer GDD (P &lt;0.05) to complete seed filling (R6). Soybeans grown in elevated [CO2] produced significantly more nodes (P &lt;0.01) on the main stem than those grown under current [CO2]. This may explain the delay in completion of reproductive development and final maturation of the crop under elevated [CO2].

There remains a clear need to develop conceptual models that are capable of interpreting and predicting spatial pattern formation in savannas (and similar dry woodland ecosystems), as well as metrics for assessing optimization or organization of patterns, as one scales from individual canopies to landscapes and beyond. In this article, we propose a unifying hypothesis regarding ecohydrological optimization of pattern and processes, namely, that vegetation patterns in water-limited environments are constrained in their ability to maximize water use by a need to simultaneously minimize water stress. We use this trade-off-based hypothesis to infer the function of dryland ecosystems under a wide range of scales and applications. Specifically, we examine spatial and temporal aspects of ecohydrological organization of vegetation patterns for three different cases: (1) patterns of regional-scale temporal organization across a regional climate gradient, (2) patterns of landscape-scale spatial organization within a semiarid drainage basin, and (3) patterns of individual-scale structural organization across varying soil textures. Although the insight gained from each of these examples is derived from specific modeling approaches, each of which contains its own unique set of assumptions and limitations, they are unified by our proposed ecohydrological trade-off approach that simultaneously considers both plant water deficit and plant water use as a diagnostic tool for assessing vegetation patterns in water-limited environments. It is our hope that the ongoing development of coupled ecological and hydrological models capable of assessing a diversity of interactions between plants, soils, and climates will lead to the emergence of more generalized hypotheses regarding the manner by which ecological and hydrological patterns coorganize in landscapes.

In the ""top-down"" approach, two-month average NO2 columns are assimilated into a regional chemical transport model (CTM), STEM, using different assimilation setups. In a basic setup, NOx emissions are adjusted by assimilating the NO2 columns. A more general setup of emission inversion allows the initial O3 concentrations be adjusted along with the NOx emissions. A final case is set up to assimilate both the NO2 columns and O3 measurement from various platforms while allowing adjustments of both the NOx emissions and the initial O3 concentrations. It is found that the addition of O3 measurements did not improve the NOx emission inversion. With the NOx emission at surface and upper levels being adjusted separately, results from four cases show that the elevated NOx emission reduction ranges from 8.9% to 11.4%, and the surface NOx emission reduction is up to 6.6%.

We use the income distribution of a country to estimate how its fossil fuel CO2 emissions are distributed among its citizens, from which we build up a global CO2 distribution. We then propose a simple rule to derive a universal cap on global individual emissions and find corresponding limits on national aggregate emissions from this cap. All of the world's high CO2-emitting individuals are treated the same, regardless of where they live. Any future global emission goal (target and time frame) can be converted into national reduction targets, which are determined by ""Business as Usual"" projections of national carbon emissions and in-country income distributions. For example, reducing projected global emissions in 2030 by 13 GtCO2 would require the engagement of 1.13 billion high emitters, roughly equally distributed in 4 regions: the U.S., the OECD minus the U.S., China, and the non-OECD minus China. We also modify our methodology to place a floor on emissions of the world's lowest CO2 emitters and demonstrate that climate mitigation and alleviation of extreme poverty are largely decoupled.","Climate change; Climate equity; Climate policy; Individual emissions; Inequality","carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; carbon dioxide; article; China; climate; greenhouse effect; income; poverty; priority journal; United States; Australia; exhaust gas; France; Australia; Carbon Dioxide; France; Greenhouse Effect; Income; Poverty; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67749113766

In Greece currently this may account for 70-100% of the total MSW costs, most of it being spent on salaries and fuel. It is therefore crucial to improve the WC&amp;T system through routing optimisation. Geographic Information System (GIS) technology provides an advanced modelling framework for decision makers in order to analyse and simulate various spatial waste management problems, including waste collection. In this study a methodology for the optimisation of the waste collection and transport system, based on GIS, was developed. A model in ArcGIS Network Analyst was developed in order to improve the efficiency of WC&amp;T in the Municipality of Nikea (MoN), Athens, Greece via the reallocation of waste collection bins and the optimisation of vehicle routing in terms of distance and time travelled. Two scenarios were compared with the current empirical collection scheme: S1-collection vehicle routing optimisation, and S2-reallocation of bins and routing optimisation. Results demonstrate that both scenarios provided savings compared to the current situation in terms of collection time (3.0% and 17.0% for S1 and S2 respectively) and travel distance (5.5% and 12.5% for S1 and S2 respectively). Time and distance reduction relate to similar CO2 emissions and fuel consumption savings. These figures indicate that GIS based models can offer significant improvements to the WC&amp;T system and, consequently, to its financial and environmental costs.","GIS; Modelling; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Network analyst; Route optimisation; Routing; Waste collection","carbon dioxide; cost-benefit analysis; decision making; environmental modeling; fuel consumption; GIS; municipal solid waste; network analysis; numerical model; optimization; routing; transportation system; waste management; waste transport; Attica; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Nikea; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449113236

In the present study, we have analysed multibeam bathymetry and 2D/3D seismic data from the south-western Barents Sea, in relation to gas hydrate stability field and sediment type, to examine pockmark genesis. Seismic attributes of the sediments at and beneath the seafloor have been analysed to study the factors related to pockmark formation. The seabed depths in the study area are just outside the methane hydrate stability field, but the presence of higher order hydrocarbon gases such as ethane and/or propane in the expelled fluids may cause localised gas hydrate formation. The selective occurrence of pockmarks in regions of specific seabed sediment types indicates that their formation is more closely related to the type of seabed sediment than the source path of fluid venting such as faults. The presence of high acoustic backscatter amplitudes at the centre of the pockmarks indicates harder/coarser sediments, likely linked to removal of soft material. The pockmarks show high seismic reflection amplitudes along their fringes indicating deposition of carbonates precipitated from upwelling fluids. High seismic amplitude gas anomalies underlying the region away from the pockmarks indicate active fluid flow from hydrocarbon source rocks beneath, which is blocked by overlying less permeable formations. In areas of consolidated sediments, the upward flow is limited to open fault locations, while soft sediment areas allow diffused flow of fluids and hence formation of pockmarks over a wider region, through removal of fine-grained material. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we characterize the role of the conserved residue S114 in cofactor binding and catalysis, using site-directed mutagenesis, steady-state kinetics, fluorescence quenching and anisotropy measurements. The catalytic efficiency of V/KNADHEt for wild-type and S114A is 1.5 × 107 and 3.8 × 103 M- 1 s- 1, respectively, suggesting that NADH association to wild-type and S114A mutant enzymes involves two steps, a bimolecular binding step and isomerization. The binding of NADH into a hydrophobic pocket in the active site of wild-type and S114A mutant enzymes restricts its motion and shields the fluorescence quenching from solvent, with an increase in the fluorescence intensity and a blue shift at the maximum wavelength. Furthermore, the binding of NADH leads to the protein fluorescence quenching, mainly due to fluorescence resonance energy transfer to NADH. S114A mutant enzyme decreases 3100-fold in V/Et with no apparent change in Km for substrates. Addition of NADH to S114A mutant enzyme induces a secondary structural change. These results suggest that S114 is important to maintain the correct conformation for the nucleotide binding and facilitate the reaction. Substitution of alanine for S114 eliminates the hydrogen bonding interaction with P185, causing a conformational change in a nonproductive binding of NADH and a significant loss of activity. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Their model treats net C emissions from ecosystems as the balance between net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (HR, i.e. primarily decomposition). Under conditions near steady state, geographic patterns of decomposition closely match those of NPP, and net C emissions are adequately described as a simple balance of NPP and HR (the Woodwell-Whittaker model). This close coupling between NPP and HR occurs largely because of tight coupling between C and N (nitrogen) cycles and because NPP constrains the food available to heterotrophs. Processes in addition to NPP and HR become important to understanding net C emissions from ecosystems under conditions of rapid changes in climate, hydrology, atmospheric CO2, land cover, species composition and/or N deposition. Inclusion of these processes in climate-C cycle models would improve their capacity to simulate recent and future climatic change. Processes that appear critical to soil C dynamics but warrant further research before incorporation into ecosystem models include below-ground C flux and its partitioning among roots, mycorrhizas and exudates; microbial community effects on C sequestration; and the effects of temperature and labile C on decomposition. The controls over and consequences of these processes are still unclear at the ecosystem scale. Carbon fluxes in addition to NPP and HR exert strong influences over the climate system under conditions of rapid change. These fluxes include methane release, wildfire, and lateral transfers of food and fibre among ecosystems. Water and energy exchanges are important complements to C cycle feedbacks to the climate system, particularly under non-steady-state conditions. An integrated understanding of multiple ecosystem-climate feedbacks provides a strong foundation for policies to mitigate climate change. Synthesis. Current climate systems models that include only NPP and HR are inadequate under conditions of rapid change. Many of the recent advances in biogeochemical understanding are sufficiently mature to substantially improve representation of ecosystem C dynamics in these models. © 2009 British Ecological Society.","Carbon cycle; Climate change; Decomposition; Heterotrophic respiration; Mycorrhizas; Net ecosystem production; Net primary production; Roots; Soil carbon","biogeochemical cycle; carbon cycle; carbon emission; climate change; decomposition; ecological modeling; net primary production; soil carbon; terrestrial ecosystem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68849118270

To better understand how salt marshes will respond to warming and associated shifts in precipitation, we conducted a manipulative experiment in a tidal salt marsh in Massachusetts, USA. We exposed two plant communities (one dominated by Spartina patens-Distichlis spicata and one dominated by short form Spartina alterniflora) to five climate manipulations: warming via passive open-topped chambers, doubled precipitation, warming and doubled precipitation, extreme drought via rainout shelter, and ambient conditions. Modest daytime warming increased total aboveground biomass of the S. alterniflora community (24%), but not the S. patens-D. spicata community. Warming also increased maximum stem heights of S. alterniflora (8%), S. patens (8%), and D. spicata (15%). Decomposition was marginally accelerated by warming in the S. alterniflora community. Drought markedly increased total biomass of the S. alterniflora community (53%) and live S. patens (69%), perhaps by alleviating waterlogging of sediments. Decomposition was accelerated by increased precipitation and slowed by drought, particularly in the S. patens-D. spicata community. Flowering phenology responded minimally to the treatments, and pore water salinity, sulfide, ammonium, and phosphate concentrations showed no treatment effects in either plant community. Our results suggest that these salt marsh communities may be resilient to modest amounts of warming and large changes in precipitation. If production increases under climate change, marshes will have a greater ability to keep pace with sea-level rise, although an increase in decomposition could offset this. As long as marshes are not inundated by flooding due to sea-level rise, increases in aboveground biomass and stem heights suggest that marshes may continue to export carbon and nutrients to coastal waters and may be able to increase their carbon storage capability by increasing plant growth under future climate conditions. © 2009 by the Eclogical society of America.","Altered precipitation; Climate change; Decomposition; Distichlis spicata; Ecosystem services; Nutrient cycling; Open-topped chamber; Salt marsh; Spartina alterniflora; Spartina patens","rain; sodium chloride; water; climate change; climate effect; coastal water; community structure; decomposition; ecosystem service; intertidal environment; nutrient cycling; nutrient dynamics; open-top chamber; plant community; precipitation (climatology); saltmarsh; article; chemistry; circadian rhythm; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; light; plant; temperature; time; United States; wetland; Circadian Rhythm; Greenhouse Effect; Light; Massachusetts; Plants; Rain; Sodium Chloride; Temperature; Time Factors; Water; Wetlands; New England; North America; United States; Distichlis spicata; Spartina alterniflora; Spartina patens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349303272

This policy aims to reduce the dependence of developing sub-Saharan nations on fossil-fuels, while ensuring the global proliferation of alternative transport energy generation as a means to combat climate change. Though the policy seems equitable in theory, and indeed mutually beneficial, several important issues arise. The paper examines the EU-Africa Energy Policy in the context of biofuels in particular, with a view to identifying potential flaws and imbalances and making policy recommendations. Aside from establishing critical uncertainties, the study adduces environmental science, historical comparanda and economic theory in order to assess the various threats associated with aspects of the policy, especially in light of previous policies that have stifled the development of sub-Saharan economies.

Finding a balance among economic development, energy consumption, and environmental protection has become a common concern to the international community. For this reason, it may be important for Taiwan to increase the speed at which it implements regulations related to greenhouse gas and thereby reduce emissions. This paper will discuss and evaluate in depth the various energy policies and objectives that emerged after Taiwan's first National Energy Conference held in 1998 using a decomposition input-output analysis model. We also analyze the effects of different energy policies on reducing CO2 emissions.

The excitation wavelength to cause optimal emissions from SWNTs is tunable in a wide wavelength range from 388 to 480 nm (from 488 to 520 nm) depending on the concentration of excess PFO (F8T2) polymers. The energy transfer and hence the excitation wavelength to cause optimal SWNT emissions is govern by the chain conformation and aggregation state of the polymers proximate to SWNT surfaces. The PLE mapping technique, an ideal method to monitor the energy transfer process, is adopted to study the SWNT binding competition between PFO and F8T2. We conclude that SWNTs are preferentially bound with F8T2 polymers. Moreover, the molecular dynamic simulation also agrees well with the experiment results.

Since vehicle emissions are the major source of air pollution in most of Taiwan's urban areas, Taiwan's government has implemented policies to rectify the degrading air quality, especially in areas with high population density. To reduce vehicle pollution emissions an on-road remote sensing and monitoring system is used to check the exhaust emissions from gasoline engine automobiles. By identifying individual vehicles with excessive emissions for follow-up inspection and testing, air quality in the urban environment is expected to improve greatly. Because remote sensing is capable of measuring a large number of moving vehicles in a short period, it has been considered as an assessment technique in place of the stationary emission-sampling techniques. However, inherent measurement uncertainty of remote sensing instrumentation, compounded by the indeterminacy of monitoring site selection, plus the vagaries of weather, causes large errors in pollution discrimination and limits the application of the remote sensing. Many governments are still waiting for a novel data analysis methodology to clamp down on heavily emitting vehicles by using remote sensing data. This paper proposes an artificial neural network (ANN), with vehicle attributes embedded, that can be trained by genetic algorithm (GA) based on different strategies to predict vehicle emission violation. Results show that the accuracy of predicting emission violation is as high as 92%. False determinations tend to occur for vehicles aged 7-13 years, peaking at 10 years of age. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Biogenic emissions in the future are influenced by projected changes in global and regional climates and by variations in future land use and land cover (LULC). The modeling system was applied for five summer months for the present-day case (1990-1999, Case 1) and three future cases covering 2045-2054. Individual future cases were: present-day LULC (Case 2); projected-future LULC (Case 3); and future LULC with designated regions of tree planting for carbon sequestration (Case 4). Results showed changing future meteorology with present-day LULC (Case 2) increased average isoprene and monoterpene emission rates by 26% and 20% due to higher temperature and solar insolation. However when LULC was changed together with climate (Case 3), predicted isoprene and monoterpene emissions decreased by 52% and 31%, respectively, due primarily to projected cropland expansion. The reduction was less, at 31% and 14% respectively, when future LULC changes were accompanied by regions of tree planting (Case 4). Despite the large decrease in biogenic emission, future average daily maximum 8-h (DM8H) ozone was found to increase between +8 ppbv and +10 ppbv due to high future anthropogenic emissions and global chemistry conditions. Among the future cases, changing LULC resulted in spatially varying future ozone differences of -5 ppbv to +5 ppbv when compared with present-day case. Future BSOA changed directly with the estimated monoterpene emissions. BSOA increased by 8% with current LULC (Case 2) but decreased by 45%-28% due to future LULC changes.

The approach adopted by RGGI is a regional cap-and-trade program, which sets a maximal annual amount of regional CO2 emissions that can be emitted from the electric sector. However, incoherence of the geographic scope of the regional electricity market is expected to produce two undesirable consequences: CO2 leakage and NOx and SO2 emissions spillover. This paper addresses these two issues using transmission-constrained electricity market models. The results show that although larger CO2 leakage is associated with higher allowance prices, it is negatively related to CO2 prices if measured in percentage terms. On the other hand, SO2 and NOx emissions spillover increase in commensurate with CO2 allowance prices. Demand elasticity attenuates the effect of emissions trading on leakage and emissions spillover. This highlights the difficulties of designing a regional or local climate policy.","CO2 leakage; Electric market; Emissions trading","Cap-and-trade program; Carbon leakage; CO2 leakage; Demand elasticities; Electric market; Electricity market model; Emissions trading; Local climate; Regional electricity markets; Air quality; Commerce; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Carbon monoxide; carbon emission; demand analysis; demand elasticity; electricity generation; emission control; emissions trading; energy market; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; pollution tax; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67651027603

We examine the major processes required to support a lignocellulosic (employing enzymatic hydrolysis) municipal solid waste-to-ethanol infrastructure computing cost, energy, and greenhouse gas effects for California. The infrastructure is compared against the Business As Usual case where the state continues to import most of its ethanol needs from the Midwest. Assuming between 60% and 90% practical yields for ethanol production, California could produce between 1.0 and 1.5 billion gallons per year of ethanol from 55% of the 40 million metric tonnes of waste currently sent to landfills annually. The classification of organic wastes and ethanol plant operation represent almost the entire system cost (between $3.5 and $4.5 billion annually) while distribution has negligible cost effects and savings from avoided landfilling is small. Fossil energy consumption from Business As Usual decreases between 82 and 130 PJ largely due to foregone gasoline consumption. The net greenhouse gas impacts are ultimately dependent on how well landfills control their emissions of decomposing organics. Based on the current landfill mix in the state, the cellulosic infrastructure would experience a slight gain in greenhouse gas emissions. However, net emissions can rise if organics diversion releases carbon that would otherwise be flared and sequestered. Emissions would be avoided if landfills are not capable of effectively controlling emissions during periods of active waste decay. There is currently considerable uncertainty surrounding the recovery efficiency of landfill emissions controls. In either case, burying lignin appears to be better than burning lignin because of its decay properties, energyandcarbon content. We estimate the breakeven price for lignocellulosic ethanol between $2.90 and $3.47/gal (μ = $3.13/gal). © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Break-even prices; Business-as-usual; California; Computing cost; Decay properties; Emissions control; Entire system; Ethanol plants; Ethanol production; Fossil energy; Landfilling; Municipal Solid Waste; Organic content; Organic wastes; Organics; Organics diversion; Recovery efficiency; Transportation fuels; Cellulosic ethanol; Costs; Energy conversion; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Ethanol; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Land fill; Leakage (fluid); Lignin; Sewage; Solid wastes; Waste disposal; alcohol; carbon; cellulose; cellulosic ethanol; gasoline; lignin; lignocellulose; unclassified drug; cellulose; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; environmental economics; ethanol; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; landfill; lignin; municipal solid waste; organic pollutant; waste disposal; article; case study; combustion; cost benefit analysis; decomposition; economic aspect; electric power plant; energy; energy consumption; experience; fossil energy; greenhouse; hydrolysis; land use; landfill; methodology; organic waste; solid waste; United States; waste disposal; California; Cellulose; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Ethanol; Greenhouse Effect; Refuse Disposal; Sewage; Cellulose; Costs; Enzymatic Activity; Ethanol; Greenhouse Gases; Greenhouses; Hydrolysis; Land Fill; Leakage; Lignins; Sewage; Solid Wastes; Waste Disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650422662

Methods and Results-Left ventricular muscarinic receptor density was measured in vivo by positron emission tomography using the specific antagonist 11C]methylquinuclidinyl benzilate ([11C]MQNB) in 11 patients 43±20 daysafter myocardial infarction and 9 healthy volunteers. The extent of myocardial damage was quantified by delayed contrast-enhanced MRI. Three short-axis slices from each subject were analyzed in matched positron emission tomography and MRI images. A 2-injection positron emission tomography protocol was used; [11C]MQNB timeactivity curves were obtained in 6 regions per slice and fitted to a 3-compartment ligand-receptor model. Four classes of myocardial regions were considered: normal (in volunteers); remote, supplied by healthy or ≤70% diameter reduction arteries and without MRI signs of damage; potentially damaged, supplied by infarct-related or &gt;70% diameter reduction arteries and without signs of damage; and damaged, with damage. The muscarinic receptor density in remote (67±30pmol/mL tissue; n=86) and potentially damaged (71±30 pmol/mL tissue; n=42) regions of patients was higher than in normal regions of volunteers (32±17 pmol/mL tissue; n=156; P&lt;0.001). The muscarinic receptor density in damaged regions (42±21 pmol/mL tissue; n=58) was reduced compared with remote and potentially damaged regions (P&lt;0.001) but was not significantly different from normal regions in volunteers (P=0.093). Conclusions-Vagal control in patients with chronic myocardial infarction involves muscarinic receptor upregulation in remote nondamaged left ventricular regions. Our results suggest that the receptor density remains within normal values in myocardial regions containing damaged tissue. (Circ Cardiovasc Imaging. 2009;2:365-372.)

By using variables which possess forecast power for equity and commodity returns, we document that carbon futures returns may be weakly forecast on the basis of two variables from the stock and bond markets, i.e. equity dividend yields and the ""junk bond"" premium. Our results also suggest that the forecast abilities of two variables related to interest rates variation and economic trends on global commodity markets, respectively the U.S. Treasury bill yields and the excess return on the Reuters/CRB Index, are not robust on the carbon market. This latter result reinforces the belief that the EU ETS is currently operating as a very specific commodity market, with distinct fundamentals linked to allowance supply and power demand. The sensitivity of carbon futures to macroeconomic influences is carefully identified following a sub-sample decomposition before and after August 2007, which attempts to take into account the potential impact of the ""credit crunch"" crisis. Collectively, these results challenge the market observers' viewpoint that carbon futures prices are immediately correlated with changes in the macroeconomic environment, and rather suggest that the carbon market is only remotely connected to macroeconomic variables. The economic logic behind these results may be related to the fuel-switching behavior of power producers in influencing primarily carbon futures price changes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These include the global public good of carbon sequestration and local and national level contributions to livelihoods for more than half a billion users. Forest commons are a particularly important class of forests generating these multiple benefits. Institutional arrangements to govern forest commons are believed to substantially influence carbon storage and livelihood contributions, especially when they incorporate local knowledge and decentralized decision making. However, hypothesized relationships between institutional factors and multiple benefits have never been tested on data from multiple countries. By using original data on 80 forest commons in 10 countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, we show that larger forest size and greater rule-making autonomy at the local level are associated with high carbon storage and livelihood benefits; differences in ownership of forest commons are associated with trade-offs between livelihood benefits and carbon storage. We argue that local communities restrict their consumption of forest products when they own forest commons, thereby increasing carbon storage. In showing rule-making autonomy and ownership as distinct and important institutional influences on forest outcomes, our results are directly relevant to international climate change mitigation initiatives such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) and avoided deforestation. Transfer of ownership over larger forest commons patches to local communities, coupled with payments for improved carbon storage can contribute to climate change mitigation without adversely affecting local livelihoods.","Climate change; Decentralization; Institutions; Mitigation; REDD","carbon; article; carbon storage; climate change; community; deforestation; forest; outcome assessment; priority journal; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forestry; Global Warming; Humans; Local Government; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449584585

Primary sources of CH 4 on dairy farms are the animals and manure storage, with smaller contributions from field-applied manure, feces deposited by grazing animals, and manure on barn floors. The Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM) was expanded to include simulation of CH 4 emissions from all farm sources along with modules predicting other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The new CH 4 module incorporated previously published relationships and experimental data that were consistent with our modeling objectives and the current structure of IFSM. When used to simulate previously reported experiments, the model was found to predict enteric fermentation and slurry manure storage emissions similar to those measured. In simulating a representative 100-cow dairy farm in Pennsylvania, the model predicted a total average annual emission of 21 Mg CH 4. This included annual emissions of 142 kg CH 4 per cow from the Holstein herd and 6.4 kg CH 4 per m 3 of slurry manure in storage, which were consistent with previously summarized emission data. To illustrate the use of the expanded whole-farm model, potential CH 4 reduction strategies were evaluated. Farm simulations showed that increasing the production and use of forage (corn silage) in animal diets increased CH 4 emission by 16% with little impact on the global warming potential of the net farm emission of all GHGs. Use of grazing along with high forage diets reduced net farm GHG emission by 16%. Using an enclosed manure storage and burning the captured biogas reduced farm emission of CH 4 by 32% with a 24% reduction in the net farm emission of GHG. Incorporation of GHG emission modules in IFSM provides a tool for estimating whole-farm emissions of CH 4 and evaluating proposed reduction strategies along with their impact on net GHG emission and other environmental and economic measures.","Dairy farm; Greenhouse gas; Methane; Simulation model","Animal diet; Atmospheric methanes; Corn silage; Current structure; Dairy farm; Dairy farms; Emission data; Enteric fermentation; Experimental data; Farm model; GHG emission; Global warming potential; Grazing animals; Greenhouse gas reductions; Manure storages; Methane emissions; Modeling objectives; Pennsylvania; Primary sources; Reduction strategy; Simulation model; System models; Total emissions; Animals; Atmospheric chemistry; Biogas; Farms; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Manures; Methane; Model structures; Nutrition; Simulators; Leakage (fluid); annual variation; biogas; dairy farming; data acquisition; experimental study; global warming; greenhouse gas; manure; methane; North America; Pennsylvania; United States; Animalia; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549097547

However, other outcomes resulting from CCHP operation such as primary energy consumption and emission of pollutants should also be considered during CCHP systems evaluation as one would expect these outcomes can be subject to regulation. This paper presents an optimization of the operation of CCHP systems for different climate conditions based on operational cost, primary energy consumption (PEC), and carbon dioxide emissions (CDE) using an optimal energy dispatch algorithm. The results for the selected cities demonstrate that in general there is not a common trend among the three optimization modes presented in this paper since optimizing one parameter may reduce or increase the other two parameters. The only cities that show reduction of PEC while also reducing the CDE are Columbus, MS; Minneapolis, MN; and Miami, FL. For these cities the operational cost always increases when compared to the reference case consisting of using a vapor/compression cycle for cooling and natural gas for heating. On the other hand, for San Francisco and Boston, CCHP systems increase the CDE. In general, if CCHP systems increase the cost of operation, as long as energy savings and reduction of emissions are guaranteed, the implementation of these systems should be considered. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the thermal performance of a natural airflow window was examined through the use of a dynamic model, developed based on the integrated energy balance and airflow networks. The validity of the model was first tested by measured data obtained from a prototype installed at an environmental chamber. The application in the subtropical and temperate climate zones were then examined with the typical weather data of Hong Kong and Beijing. The findings confirmed that the natural airflow window can achieve substantial energy saving in both cities, and the reversible window frame is only required for Beijing, a location with hot summer and cold winter. The space cooling load via fenestration in Hong Kong, a subtropical city, can be reduced to 60% of the commonly used single absorptive glazing. In Beijing, as an example of the temperate climate, this can be reduced to 75% of the commonly used double glazing configuration in the summer period, and the space heat gain can be improved by 46% in the winter period. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Truck-only toll (TOT) lanes have been proposed in several cities as a means of improving truck flows and reducing freeway congestion. This paper describes an analysis that utilized the US EPA's MOBILE6.2 vehicle emissions modeling software to identify freeway locations with large pollutant emissions and estimated the changes in emission associated with TOT lanes. Emissions including hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and CO2 were estimated by multiplying vehicle kilometers traveled by emission factors associated with various vehicle types and average speeds. The CO2 calculation was limited due to lack of sensitivity in the model of speed variation, which is one of the benefits of the implementation of TOT lanes. Mechanical equations of engine horsepower involving the change in vehicle speeds is applied to estimate the change in CO2 fuel consumption and then converted to estimate the change in CO2 emissions. The results show that voluntary and mandatory use of TOT lanes would reduce total CO2 emissions on all freeway lanes by 62% and 60%. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a coupled model of climate, ocean, and land biogeochemistry, we show that atmospheric nitrogen deposition and atmospheric CO2 have a strong synergistic effect on the carbon uptake of land. Our best estimate of the global land carbon uptake in the 1990s is 1.34 PgC/yr. The synergistic effect could explain 47% of this carbon uptake, which is higher than either the effect of increasing nitrogen deposition (29%) or CO2 fertilization (24%). By 2030, rising carbon uptake on land has a potential to reduce atmospheric CO 2 concentration by about 41 ppm out of which 16 ppm reduction would come from the synergetic response of land to the CO2 and nitrogen fertilization effects. The strength of the synergy depends largely on the cooccurrence of high nitrogen deposition regions with nonagricultural ecosystems. Our study suggests that reforestation and sensible ecosystem management in industrialized regions may have larger potential for climate change mitigation than anticipated.

Hippuric acid has the potential to be a N2O mitigation tool because animal diets can be manipulated to adjust its concentration in the urine. This study was conducted to determine if the effect observed in previous laboratory studies would also occur in situ under field conditions. In our field study, plots were treated with unadulterated bovine urine (56 mM hippuric acid), the same bovine urine amended with either benzoic acid (34 mM), dicyandiamide (DCD) or varying rates of hippuric acid (up to 90 mM). Soil inorganic-N, N2O fluxes, and plant N responses were monitored over a 78 d period. Effects on microbial communities were monitored by determining the size and structure of nitrite oxidizer (nxrA) and nitrite reducer (nirS) bacterial populations using real-time PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), respectively. Decreases in N2O emissions, with increasing hippuric and benzoic acid concentrations, were only seen on Day two of the trial. With the exception of the DCD treatment (0.60% of N applied) the amended urine treatments did not significantly affect emissions of N2O as a percentage of N applied (1.28-1.65%). Soil inorganic-N and plant response were not affected by urinary amendment, except in the DCD treatment where nitrification inhibition occurred. Nitrite oxidizer community structures shifted and increased approximately 5.4-fold in size over 48 d in response to urine, although no specific response to elevated hippuric acid or benzoic acid was observed. No treatment effects were observed on community structure of the nitrite reducing bacteria but averaged over time the highest rate of hippuric acid significantly decreased nirS gene copy numbers g-1 soil. We concluded that under the conditions of this field study, increasing hippuric or benzoic acid concentrations in bovine urine had no effect on N2O mitigation in situ. We argue that the discrepancy with previous laboratory studies may be related to differences in soil pH, microbial communities and the presence of vegetation. Further research is needed to determine the potential for hippuric acid as a tool to mitigate N2O emissions, and its effect(s) on resident N cycling microorganisms. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Populations of high energy electrons can produce hard X-ray (HXR) emission in galaxy clusters by up-scattering CMB photons via the inverse Compton scattering (ICS) mechanism. However, this scenario has various astrophysical consequences. Aims. We discuss here the consequences of the presence of a population of high energy particles for the multi-frequency emissivity of the same clusters and the structure of their atmospheres. Methods. We derive predictions for the ICS HXR emission in the specific case of the Ophiuchus cluster (for which an interesting combination of observational limits and theoretical scenarios have been presented.) for three main scenarios producing high-E electrons: primary cosmic ray model, secondary cosmic rays model and neutralino DM annihilation scenario. We further discuss the predictions of the Warming Ray model for the cluster atmosphere. Under the assumption to fit the HXR emission observed in Ophiuchus, we explore the consequences that these electron populations induce on the cluster atmosphere. Results. We find, that: i) primary electrons can be marginally consistent with the available data provided, that the electron spectrum is cutoff at E ≲ 30 and E ≲ MeV for electron spectral index values of 3.5 and 4.4, respectively; ii) secondary electron models from pp collisions are strongly inconsistent with the viable gamma-ray limits, cosmic ray protons produce too much heating of the intracluster (IC) gas and their pressure at the cluster center largely exceeds the thermal, one; iii) secondary electron models from. DM annihilation are also strongly inconsistent with the viable gamma-ray and radio limits, and electrons produce too much heating of the IC gas at the cluster center, unless the neutralino annihilation cross-section is much lower than the proposed value. In that case, however, these models no longer reproduce the HXR excess in Ophiuchus. Conclusions. We conclude that ICS by secondary electrons from both neutralino DM annihilation and pp collisions cannot be the mechanism responsible for the HXR excess emission; primary electrons are still a marginally viable solution provided that their spectrum has a low-energy cutoff at E ≲ 30-90 MeV. We also find that diffuse radio emission localized at the cluster center is expected in all these models and requires quite low values of the average magnetic field (B∼ 0.1-0.2 μG in primary and secondary-pp models; B ∼ 0.055-0.39 μG in secondary-DM models) to agree with the available observations. Finally, the WR model (with B ∼ 0.4-2.0 μG) offers, so far, the most accurate description of the cluster in terms of the temperature distribution, heating and pressure and multifrequency spectral energy distribution. Fermi observations of Ophiuchus will provide further constraints to this model. © ESO 2009.","Cosmology: Theory; Galaxies: Clusters: General; Galaxies: Clusters: Individual: Ophiuchus; Radiation mechanisms: Non-thermal","Cluster centers; Cosmic ray protons; Cosmology: Theory; Electron population; Electron spectrum; Galaxies: Clusters: General; Galaxies: Clusters: Individual: Ophiuchus; Galaxy clusters; Hard X ray; High-energy electron; High-energy particles; Intra-cluster; Inverse Compton scattering; Low energies; Multi frequency; Neutralino annihilation; Neutralinos; Primary electrons; Radiation mechanisms: Non-thermal; Radio emission; Ray models; Secondary electrons; Spectral energy distribution; Spectral indices; Viable solutions; Auger electron spectroscopy; Compton scattering; Cosmic rays; Cosmology; Electrons; Emission spectroscopy; Forecasting; Galaxies; Gamma rays; Heating; Intelligent control; Magnetic fields; Secondary emission; Electron energy loss spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68649112860

Will the engaged regulations for the respect of ozone air quality thresholds be fully efficient on the most polluted regions? How can we design the continuation of ozone control in those areas? This study is based on refined 3D modelling studies over a French Mediterranean region. It compares 2001 and 2003 situations with several prospective 2010 emission scenarios with, for the first time, the evaluation of local action plans. The degree of compliance with air quality regulation is investigated and the impact of emission control on the local potential for ozone formation is discussed. The results show that current efforts on emissions, although substantial and efficient, are not sufficient yet to abrogate all the ozone threshold exceedances. They also highlight the gap between regulatory and effective emission control, as well as the need for regional regulations to complete national efforts. Finally, the simulations indicate that large-scale emission control significantly helps reducing rural ozone (-20 ppbv) but affects much fewer (-2 to -10 ppbv) the highest peaks. The continuation and the strengthening of ozone policies under their current form in such regions are considered. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To address this problem we use the LMDZ4 atmospheric general circulation model to evaluate the impact on the Saalian ice sheet's surface mass balance (SMB) from proglacial lakes, dust deposition on snow, vegetation and sea surface temperatures (SST) since geological records suggest that these environmental parameters were different during the two glacial periods. Seven model simulations have been carried out. Dust deposition decreases the mean SMB by intensifying surface melt during summer while proglacial lakes cool the summer climate and reduce surface melt on the ice sheet. A simulation including both proglacial lakes and dust shows that the presence of the former parameter reduces the impact of the latter, in particular, during summer. A switch from needle-leaf to tundra vegetation affects the regional climate but not enough to significantly influence the SMB of the nearby ice margin. However, a steady-state vegetation in equilibrium with the climate should be computed to improve the boundary conditions for further evaluations of the vegetation impact on the ice sheet's SMB. Finally, changes of the SST broadly affect the regional climate with significant consequences for the SMB. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, beyond the general imperative to participate, major policy bodies offer little guidance on what this entails. We suggest that the dominance of Arnstein's ladder of citizen participation in policy discourses constrains the ways we think about, and critically the purposes we ascribe to, participation in a climate change context. We suggest an alternative framing of climate change, where no single group has clear access to understanding the issue and its resolution. Thus adaptation is fundamentally dependent on new forms of learning. Drawing on experiences of social learning approaches to natural resource managing, we explore how a commitment to social learning more accurately embodies the new kinds of role, relationship, practice and sense of purpose required to progress adaptive climate change agendas and practices.

The purpose of the study was to estimate the impact of the MSWI emissions and to distinguish the contribution of these emissions from other potential emission sources in the industrial area. PCDD/F atmospheric concentrations were similar to those generally detected in urban-rural areas with one location about 2-3 times more contaminated than the others. Since the most contaminated location was inside the industrial area but upwind of the MSWI, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to establish whether other sources were the cause. This analysis clearly showed that a local steel plant's emission was the main source of PCDDs/Fs in ambient air.

It is notable that water oxidation to dioxygen is a key half-reaction in both. In principle, these solar fuel reactions can be coupled to light absorption in molecular assemblies, nanostructured arrays, or photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) by a modular approach. The modular approach uses light absorption, electron transfer in excited states, directed long range electron transfer and proton transfer, both driven by free energy gradients, combined with proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) and single electron activation of multielectron catalysis. Until recently, a lack of molecular catalysts, especially for water oxidation, has limited progress in this area. Analysis of water oxidation mechanism for the ""blue"" Ru dimer cis,cis- [(bpy)2(H2O)RuIIIORuIII(OH 2)(bpy)2]4+ (bpy is 2,2′-bipyridine) has opened a new, general approach to single site catalysts both in solution and on electrode surfaces. As a catalyst, the blue dimer is limited by competitive side reactions involving anation, but we have shown that its rate of water oxidation can be greatly enhanced by electron transfer mediators such as Ru(bpy) 2(bpz)2+ (bpz is 2,2′-bipyrazine) in solution or Ru(4,4′-((HO)2P(O)CH2)2bpy) 2(bpy)2+ on ITO (ITO/Sn) or FTO (SnO 2/F) electrodes. In this Account, we describe a general reactivity toward water oxidation in a class of molecules whose properties can be ""tuned"" systematically by synthetic variations based on mechanistic insight. These molecules catalyze water oxidation driven either electrochemically or by Ce(IV). The first two were in the series Ru(tpy)(bpm)(OH2)2+ and Ru(tpy)(bpz)(OH2) 2+ (bpm is 2,2′- bipyrimidine; tpy is 2,2′:6′, 2′′-terpyridine), which undergo hundreds of turnovers without decomposition with Ce(IV) as oxidant. Detailed mechanistic studies and DFT calculations have revealed a stepwise mechanism: initial 2e-/2H + oxidation, to RuIV(O2)2+, 1e- oxidation to RuV(O2)3+, nucleophilic H 2O attack to give RuIII-OOH2+, further oxidation to RuIV(O2)2+, and, finally, oxygen loss, which is in competition with further oxidation of RuIV(O2)2+ to RuV(O2)3+, which loses O2 rapidly. An extended family of 10-15 catalysts based on Mebimpy (Mebimpy is 2,6-bis(1-methylbenzimidazol-2-yl)pyridine), tpy, and heterocyclic carbene ligands all appear to share a common mechanism. The osmium complex Os(tpy)(bpy)(OH2)2+ also functions as a water oxidation catalyst. Mechanistic experiments have revealed additional pathways for water oxidation one involving Cl- catalysis and another, rate enhancement of OsO bond formation by concerted atom-proton transfer (APT). Surface-bound [(4,4′-((HO)2P(O)CH2)2bpy) 2RuII(bpm)RuII(Mebimpy)(OH2)] 4+ and its tpy analog are impressive electrocatalysts for water oxidation, undergoing thousands of turnovers without loss of catalytic activity. These catalysts were designed for use in dye-sensitized solar cell configurations on TiO2 to provide oxidative equivalents by molecular excitation and excitedstate electron injection. Transient absorption measurements on TiO2-[(4,4′((HO)2P(O)CH 2)2bpy)2RuII(bpm)RuII(Mebimpy)(OH2)] 4+, (TiO2-RuII-RuIIOH2) and its tpy analog have provided direct insight into the interfacial and intramolecular electron transfer events that occur following excitation. With added hydroquinone in a PEC configuration, APCE (absorbed-photon-tocurrent- efficiency) values of 4-5% are obtained for dehydrogenation of hydroquinone, H2Q + 2h? → Q + H2. In more recent experiments, we are using the same PEC configuration to investigate water splitting. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72949103896

Countries such as Canada and Japan which might be thought to have a less complex and more cohesive cultural and institutional context failed to do so. Europe succeeded for a number of reasons: with a Single Market for the economy, the logic of a single market for environment is inexorable; the European Commission-which had failed in its earlier efforts to introduce a carbon energy tax-made the case for trading with great skill and persistence, on the basis of qualified majority voting, which meant no country had a veto; the UK and Denmark initiated their own national schemes, and there was a serious risk of balkanising the market with up to 27 different schemes, with the losses of scale and scope this would entail; meeting the Union's Kyoto commitments required a substantive pan European response, and EU ETS was the most credible and effective way of doing so.

Exposed water ices can become oxidized from radiolytic chemical alteration of near-surface water ice by space environment irradiation. In contact with primordially abundant reductants such as NH3, CH4, and other hydrocarbons, the product oxidants can react exothermically to produce volatile gases driving cryovolcanism via gas-piston forces on any subsurface liquid reservoirs. Radiolytic oxidants such as H2O2 and O2 can continuously accumulate deep in icy regoliths and be conveyed by rheological flows to subsurface chemical reaction zones over million-year time scales indicated by cratering ages for active regions of Enceladus and Europa. Surface blanketing with cryovolcanic plume ejecta would further accelerate regolith burial of radiolytic oxidants. Episodic heating from transient gravitational tides, radioisotope decay, impacts, or other geologic events might occasionally accelerate chemical reaction rates and ignite the exothermic release of cumulative radiolytic oxidant energy. The time history for the suggested ""Old Faithful"" model of radiolytic gas-driven cryovolcanism at Enceladus and elsewhere therefore consists of long periods of chemical energy accumulation punctuated by much briefer episodes of cryovolcanic activity. The most probable sequence for detection of activity in the current epoch is a long evolutionary phase of slow but continuous oxidant accumulation over billions of years followed by continuous but variable high activity over the past 107-108 years. Detectable cryovolcanic activity could then later decline due to near-total oxidation of the rheologically accessible ice crust and depletion the accessible reductant abundances, as may have already occurred for Europa in the more intense radiation environment of Jupiter's magnetosphere. Astrobiological potential of Enceladus could correspondingly be higher than at Europa due to a less extreme state of oxidation and greater residual abundance of organics.","Cryovolcanism; Enceladus; Energetic particles; Oxidants; Radiolysis; Water","Active regions; Chemical alteration; Chemical energy; Cryovolcanism; Enceladus; Energetic particles; Evolutionary phase; High activity; Icy Moons; Jupiter's magnetosphere; Kuiper belt objects; Near-surface; New model; Organics; Radiation environments; Reductants; Rheological flow; Space environment; Subsurface liquid; Time history; Time-scales; Total oxidation; Volatile gas; Water ice; Hydrocarbons; Magnetosphere; Newtonian flow; Oxidants; Oxidation; Petroleum tar; Radiation chemistry; Radioisotopes; Reaction rates; Solar system; Radiolysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449102704

The paper evaluates whether vessel speed reduction can be a potentially cost-effective CO2 mitigation option for ships calling on US ports. By applying a profit-maximizing equation to estimate route-specific, economically-efficient speeds, we explore policy impacts of a fuel tax and a speed reduction mandate on CO2 emissions. The profit-maximizing function incorporates opportunity costs associated with speed reduction that go unobserved in more traditional marginal abatement cost analyses. We find that a fuel tax of about $150/ton fuel will lead to average speed-related CO2 reductions of about 20-30%.

These changes may be responsible for seasonal changes in bioavailability of mercury (Hg) and other pollutants to the estuarine and coastal biota. Mercury bioaccumulates along estuarine-marine food chains usually result in higher concentrations in tissues of top predators and posing a risk to both marine mammals and humans alike. The Goiana River Estuary (7.5° S) is a typical estuary of the semi-arid tropical regions and supports traditional communities with fisheries (mollusks, fish, and crustacean). It is also responsible for an important part of the biological production of the adjacent coastal waters. Materials and methods Trichiurus lepturus (Actinopterygii: Perciformes) is a pscivorous marine straggler. Fish from this species (n = 104) were captured in a trapping barrier used by the local traditional population and using an otter trawl net along the main channel of the low estuary during two dry seasons (D1 = November, December 2005, January 2006; D2 = November, December 2006, January 2007) and the end of a rainy season (R = August, September, October 2006). Fish muscle samples were preserved cold and then freeze-dried prior to analysis of its total mercury (Hg-T) contents. Total mercury was determined by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS) with sodium borohydride as a reducing agent. Results The studied individuals (n = 104) were sub-adult (30-70 cm, 71 ind.) and adult fish (&gt;70 cm, 33 ind.). Weight (W) (204.1 ± 97.9 g, total biomass = 21,229.7 g) and total length (TL) (63.1 ± 10.1 cm, range 29.5-89.0 cm) presented a significant (p &lt; 0.05) correlation. Two-way ANOVA (n = 81) showed that TL and W had significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) among seasons, being higher in D1 than in D2 and R, respectively. Moreover, season vs. month interaction were detected for the variables length and weight. For the variable weight was detected significant difference for the factor month (p &lt; 0.05). It suggests that the fish enter the estuary at the end of the rainy season and increase in length and weight during the time they spend in the estuary. Fish from this estuary are shown to be fit for human consumption (125.3 ± 61.9 μgHg-T kg-1 w.wt.; n = 104). Fish mercury contents increased with size and weight. Correlations between TL and Hg-T (r = 0.37286) and between W and Hg-T (r = 0.38212) were significant (p &lt; 0.05). Dryer months showed higher mercury concentrations in fish (D1 773.4 ± 207.5 μgHg-T kg-1 d.wt., n = 27; D2 370.1 ± 78.8 μgHg-T kg-1 d.wt., n = 27; R 331.2 ± 138.5 μgHg-T kg-1 d.wt., n = 27). The variable mercury concentration showed differences in relation to the factor season (p &lt; 0.05), where fish captured during the first dry season showed the highest concentration of mercury. The correlation between Hg-T and rainfall (Rf) showed a negative correlation (r = -0.56; p &lt;0.05). Discussion The main likely source of mercury to this estuary is diffuse continental run off, including urban and industrial effluents. Since concentration of mercury in fish tissue is negatively correlated to rainfall, but positively correlated with fish length and weight, it suggests that fish growth in this estuary results in mercury uptake and concentration on the fish tissue. In the dry season of 2005-2006, when rainfall remained below the historic average, fish bioaccumulated significantly more mercury than in the dry season 2006-2007, when rainfall was within the predictable historic average. It is suggested that less rainfall, and consequently less particulate matter and less primary production in the estuary, make mercury more available to the higher levels of the estuarine food chain. In the case of higher rainfall, when river flow increases and water quality in the estuary is reduced, mercury probably is quickly exported associated to the particulate matter to the adjacent coastal waters where it then disperses. This species is a potential routine bioindicator for mercury contamination of the biota, but so far was used only with a limited number of individuals and contexts. Conclusions Fish from the Goiana River estuary can still be safely consumed by the local population. However, any further contamination of this resource might lead to total mercury levels above the recommended limits for pregnant women and small children. The proposed heavy dependency of total mercury levels in fish on water quality indicates that land use and water quality standards must be more closely watched in order to guarantee that best possible practices are in place to prevent bioaccumulation of mercury and its transfer along the food chain. Human interventions and climatic events which affect river water flow are also playing a role in the mercury cycle at tropical semi-arid estuaries. Recommendations and perspectives T. lepturus is largely consumed by coastal populations of tropical and sub-tropical countries all over the world. It is also consumed by a number of marine mammals over which we have a strong conservation interest. This species is also a link among different ecosystems along the estuarine ecocline. Therefore, knowledge of its degree of contamination might contribute to public health issues as well as marine conservation actions. Studies on mercury and other contaminants using this species as bioindicator (cosmopolitan, readily available) could help elucidating mechanisms through which pollutants are being transferred not only through the food chain, but also from estuarine-coastal-open waters. In addition, using the same species in marine pollution studies, especially as part of a mosaic of species, allows for wide range comparisons of marine food chain contamination. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Bioaccumulation; CVAAS; Goiana River estuary; Marine straggler; Pscivorous fish; Risk assessment; Seasonal changes; Total mercury","anthropogenic effect; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; correlation; dry season; environmental risk; food chain; land use; length-weight relationship; mercury (element); risk assessment; river water; seasonal variation; semiarid region; tropical region; water flow; water quality; Brazil; South America; Actinopterygii; Carnivora; Crustacea; Mammalia; Mollusca; Perciformes; Trichiuridae; Trichiurus lepturus; mercury; rain; animal; article; body size; Brazil; chemistry; ecosystem; metabolism; Perciformes; river; sea; season; skeletal muscle; time; water pollutant; Animals; Body Size; Brazil; Ecosystem; Mercury; Muscle, Skeletal; Oceans and Seas; Perciformes; Rain; Rivers; Seasons; Time Factors; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349392826

In plants, one of the preeminent roles of VOCs is their repellent or cytotoxic activity, which helps the plant deter its predators. Most studies on VOCs emitted by vegetative parts have been conducted in model plant species, and little is known about patterns of VOC emissions in diverse plant communities. We conducted a survey of the VOCs released immediately after mechanical damage of the bark and the leaves of 195 individual trees belonging to 55 tropical tree species in a lowland rainforest of French Guiana. We discovered a remarkably high chemical diversity, with 264 distinct VOCs and a mean of 37 compounds per species. Two monoterpenes (α-pinene and limonene) and two sesquiterpenes (β-caryophyllene and α-copaene), which are known to have cytotoxic and deterrent effects, were the most frequent compounds in the sampled species. As has been established for floral scents, the blend of VOCs is largely species-specific and could be used to discriminate among 43 of the 55 sampled species. The species with the most diverse blends were found in the Sapindales, Laurales, and Magnoliales, indicating that VOC diversity is not uniformly distributed among tropical species. Interspecific variation in chemical diversity was caused mostly by variation in sesquiterpenes. This study emphasizes three aspects of VOC emission by tropical tree species: the species-specificity of the mixtures, the importance of sesquiterpenes, and the wide-ranging complexity of the mixtures. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009.","Chemical diversity; French Guiana; Sesquiterpenes; Tropical; VOCs","organic compound; antipredator defense; bark; biogenic emission; chemical defense; chemical ecology; monoterpene; phytochemistry; rainforest; volatile organic compound; article; bark; chemistry; cluster analysis; factual database; French Guiana; information processing; metabolism; physiology; plant leaf; species difference; tree; tropic climate; volatilization; Cluster Analysis; Data Collection; Databases, Factual; French Guiana; Organic Chemicals; Plant Bark; Plant Leaves; Species Specificity; Trees; Tropical Climate; Volatilization; Bacteria (microorganisms); Laurales; Magnoliales; Mammalia; Sapindales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73249132186

However, the presence of multiple drivers of change over similar or overlapping timescales may obscure palaeolimnological signals obtained using traditional statistical analyses. 2. As part of the European Union-funded EMERGE programme, sediment cores were obtained from 209 mountain lakes across 11 lake districts spanning gradients of altitude, latitude, geochemistry and atmospheric deposition. Surface sediments (0-0.5 cm) were subsampled to represent modern conditions corresponding with chemical and environmental measurements, while core bottom (15-17 cm) sediments were subsampled to represent the pre-industrial period. 3. We used a novel approach to explore the relative importance of environmental drivers of change in diatom communities. First, we used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to identify the most significant variables explaining diatom community distributions in lake surface sediments. Lake water pH, nitrate concentration/dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ice-free period were identified as uniquely significant explanatory variables along three primary axes of variation. The modern data set was then used to construct transfer functions linking diatom communities to these key variables. We applied these transfer functions to core bottom samples to reconstruct change since the pre-industrial period. 4. Drivers of diatom community change differed among regions. Diatom-inferred pH declined in five acid-sensitive lake districts (Central & Southern Norway, Piedmont Ticino, Retezat Mountains, Scotland and Tatra Mountains), consistent with acidification caused by sulphur and nitrogen deposition. Diatom-inferred pH increased in two lake districts [Julian Alps (JA), Pyrenees (PY)], probably due to eutrophication and climate warming-induced increases in weathering rates respectively. 5. Diatom inference models for nitrate and DOC were not independent. However, diatom-inferred nitrate increased in all lake districts with detectable changes, except for the Retezat Mountains. These changes are consistent with increased nitrogen deposition and leaching in the industrial period and are independent of acidification effects, presumably reflecting a nitrogen fertilization effect. Diatom-inferred DOC increased in the Central Alps and Scotland but decreased in Central Norway and Northern Finland, in contrast to increasing trends reported for Northern Europe and North America over the last 10-20 years. Conflicting drivers of change in DOC such as recovery from acidification and climate change further confound the interpretation of diatom-inferred changes. 6. Changes in the diatom-inferred ice-free period varied across regions. Warming is indicated in Central Norway, Scotland, Piedmont Ticino and the Pyrenees, while cooling is suggested in the more southern and eastern Julian Alps and Rila Mountains. Where detectable changes in diatom-inferred pH and ice-free period coincide there is generally an association between acidification and climate warming. Since warming is associated with increased weathering and alkalinity generation it is therefore possible that climate warming has reduced the impacts of acidification in acid-sensitive lake districts. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Acidification; Alpine lakes; Climate change; Diatoms; Palaeolimnology","Bacillariophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449580525

From 1980 to 2000, we calculate small global OH and methane lifetime changes due to compensating effects by emission changes in Southeast Asia and emission changes in the rest of the world. There is no guarantee that this offset will persist in the future. Southeast Asia is going through rapid economic development and emission increases there may be a major driver for changes. The development of Asian emissions after year 2000 is under much debate and for this period we apply several emission scenarios. For most emission scenarios the simulated Southeast Asian induced changes in global hydroxyl and methane lifetime after year 2000 are moderate. However, an upper estimate assuming very high increases in NOx emissions results in substantial increases of hydroxyl and corresponding reductions in global methane lifetime. Interestingly, for the high NOx emission case our results fit very well with recent satellite observations on trends of NO2 over central eastern China. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Munksgaard.",,"anthropogenic effect; carbon emission; hydroxyl radical; methane; modeling; nitrogen oxides; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350025936

Not only do dust emission schemes rely on various assumptions, but also their implementation within a regional or global model presents challenges. This paper provides an in-depth comparative analysis of two different physically based schemes that were originally developed by Marticorena and Bergametti (1995) and Shao et al. (1996) with some recent improvements. Both schemes were implemented in a dust module (DuMo) and coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Here we examine the physical parameterizations employed by these schemes, identify the key input parameters, and establish linkages between them by developing a new data set for dust sources in Central and East Asia. The relative importance of the input parameters is assessed through partial derivatives. The major issues involved in implementing the physically based schemes within a regional model are also discussed. Consistent implementation of two state-of-the-art dust schemes within the same regional model enables us to bracket inherent uncertainties in simulated dust emission. The results of a case study based on WRF-DuMo simulations are presented to demonstrate associated biases in the magnitude and spatial patterns of emitted dust vertical fluxes. Also, recommendations on the selection of input parameters, including land and meteorological variables, to achieve an improved modeling of dust emission in Central and East Asia are provided.

As a primary safeguard against excess emission the replacement of fossil fuels by any other alternative fuel of low emission level cannot be ignored. Bio-diesel which is a blending ofJatropha oil to the fossil fuel in the right proportion can be considered as one of the alternative fuels of high oxygen content and so low emission level. Jatropha plantation in the waste land is doubly advantageous because of its conversion of the arid land into fertile character and extraction of oil.

Leading up to the crisis, world-wide interest in these fuels-which include biomass, biogas, bioethanol, and biodiesel-had been surging as states increasingly saw these as a way to meet greenhouse gas reduction targets and promote sustainable economic development. Now some consumers, notably in Europe, are scaling back demand as they worry that biofuels are responsible for increased food prices and deforestation. In contrast, some states-particularly Brazil and the USA, the world's leading bioethanol producers-continue to promote biofuel development, especially in developing countries. Partnerships arising from these efforts, we argue, reflect new patterns in the international political economy, where trade relationships among developing countries are strengthening, and where economic lines between developed and emerging developing countries are blurring. Given previously observed patterns of resource exploitation involving complex webs of North-South and South-South trade (such as for resources like palm oil in Indonesia), we anticipate that the emerging political economy of biofuels will repeat and reinforce many of these same environmentally destructive trends. © 2009 Third World Quarterly.",,"biofuel; developing world; exploitation; North-South relations; partnership approach; political economy; trade relations; Brazil; Eurasia; Europe; North America; South America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449475461

Experiments were performed in batch reactors on single-mineral powders of selected grain size, either in supercritical CO2 or in aqueous solutions with different alkalinities. The main reaction products were calcite and amorphous silica. Calcite occurred either as a compact, continuous coating of small crystals in the case of supercritical CO2 and in circum-neutral pH aqueous solutions, or as isolated larger crystals in acidic aqueous solutions. Measured extents of carbonation were faster in aqueous solutions than in supercritical CO2. Extents of carbonation in aqueous acidic solutions were modelled using a geochemical code incorporating kinetic parameters for wollastonite dissolution and calcite precipitation taken from the literature. Comparison with experimental results shows that, in aqueous solutions, wollastonite dissolution is the rate-limiting step of the carbonation reaction and that silica layers have only a minor passivation effect on the overall reaction rate. In acidic solutions, secondary calcite coating has only a minor effect on carbonation extent, whereas the experimental data in circum-neutral pH aqueous solutions are consistent with dissolution rates inhibited by the observed dense calcite coating. A geochemical code incorporating a modified reactive surface model successfully accounted for this passivation effect. The more efficient carbonation in acidic than in circum-neutral pH solutions is thus ascribed to differences in microstructures of the secondary calcite layers due to differences in supersaturation states of calcite when its precipitation begins. Inhibitory effects of dense calcite coating are also invoked for limiting carbonation extents of wollastonite in supercritical CO2. Secondary calcite precipitations are thus shown to play a major role both as coatings of reactive surfaces and by maintaining large undersaturation with respect to wollastonite dissolution. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, the response of plant communities to disturbance may be fundamentally altered as a consequence of invasive plants, climate change, or prior disturbances. The appropriateness of historical disturbance patterns under modern conditions and the interactions among disturbances are issues that ecologists must address to protect and restore native plant communities. We evaluated the response of Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis (Beetle & A. Young) S.L. Welsh plant communities to their historical disturbance regime compared to other disturbance regimes. The historical disturbance regime of these plant communities was periodic fires with minimal grazing by large herbivores. We also investigated the influence of prior disturbance (grazing) on the response of these communities to subsequent disturbance (burning). Treatments were: (1) ungrazed (livestock grazing excluded since 1936) and unburned, (2) grazed and unburned, (3) ungrazed and burned (burned in 1993), and (4) grazed and burned. The ungrazed-burned treatment emulated the historical disturbance regime. Vegetation cover, density, and biomass production were measured the 12th, 13th, and 14th year post-burning. Prior to burning the presence of Bromus tectorum L., an exotic annual grass, was minimal (<0.5% cover), and vegetation characteristics were similar between grazed and ungrazed treatments. However, litter accumulation was almost twofold greater in ungrazed than in grazed treatments. Longterm grazing exclusion followed by burning resulted in a substantial B. tectorum invasion, but burning the grazed areas did not produce an invasion. The ungrazed-burned treatment also had less perennial vegetation than other treatments. The accumulation of litter (fuel) in ungrazed treatments may have resulted in greater fire-induced mortality of perennial vegetation in ungrazed compared to grazed treatments. Our results demonstrate that prior disturbances exert a strong influence on the response of plant communities to subsequent disturbances and suggest that low-severity disturbances may be needed in some plant communities to increase their resilience to more severe disturbances. Modern deviations from historical conditions can alter ecosystem response to disturbances, thus restoring the historical disturbance regime may not be an appropriate strategy for all ecosystems. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","Artemisia tridentata; Bromus tectorum; Cheatgrass; Ecosystem management; Fire; Grazing; Historical conditions; Invasive plants; Northern Great Basin experimental range, Oregon, USA; Prior disturbance; Sagebrush","burning; ecosystem management; grazing; historical ecology; invasive species; native species; perennial plant; plant community; restoration ecology; shrub; vegetation structure; agriculture; animal; Artemisia; article; Bromus; ecosystem; fire; population density; United States; Agriculture; Animals; Artemisia; Bromus; Ecosystem; Fires; Oregon; Population Density; Basin and Range Province; Great Basin; North America; United States; Artemisia; Artemisia tridentata; Bromus; Bromus tectorum; Coleoptera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69449100342

These structures document shallow subsurface pathways of Early Eocene methane seepage in the Balkan Mountains foreland (NE Bulgaria). Their exceptional exposure allowed a unique study of the factors governing the morphology and spatial distribution of such fossilized fluid conduits. The large dimensions and subvertical, cylindrical shape of the most common tube type primarily reflects the buoyancy-driven, vertical path of an ascending gas-bearing fluid through permeable, mainly unconsolidated sandy host sediments. Tube morphology was also influenced by local stratigraphic anisotropies and might as well document differences in former seepage conditions. Mapping of >800 tubular concretions showed the NNW-NNE elongation and alignment of tube clusters and massive cemented sandstone structures. This suggests that Paleogene fault systems played a major role in directing the movement of fluids. However, within a single tube cluster, tubes are preferentially aligned, over distances up to 50 m along directions at an angle between 10° and 36° with respect to the inferred NNW-NNE, cluster parallel fault traces. In addition, cylindrical tubes of analogue dimensions are aligned over distances >100 m along N15° to N25°-oriented directions. It is hypothesized that this spatial geometry of tubular concretions reflects the complex geometry of deformations structures in fault damage zones along which fluids were preferentially channelled. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article possibilities are explored to reduce vulnerability of these areas by implementing alternative water management options. Two main water management fields are distinguished, water supply and flood control. A four-component vulnerability framework is presented that includes threshold capacity, coping capacity, recovery capacity, and adaptive capacity. By using the vulnerability framework it is shown that current water supply and flood control strategies in the Netherlands focus on increasing threshold capacity by constructing higher and stronger dikes, improved water storage and delivery infrastructure. A complete vulnerability decreasing strategy requires measures that include all four capacities. Flood damage reduction, backup water supply systems and emergency plans are measures that can contribute to increasing coping capacity. Recovery capacity can be increased by multi-source water supply, insurance, or establishing disaster funds. Adaptive capacity can be developed by starting experiments with new modes of water supply and urbanization. Including all four components of the vulnerability framework enables better understanding of water and climate related vulnerability of urban areas and enables developing more complete water management strategies to reduce vulnerability. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Flood control; The Netherlands; Vulnerability; Water management","climate change; flood control; urban area; vulnerability; water management; water supply; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449534920

Next, a simulation model is developed to quantitatively discuss the effects of a tradable green certificate system, a premium mechanism, a tradable CO2 allowance system and a CO2 tax on both RES-E deployment and CO2 mitigation. A three-regional model implementation representing the Benelux, France and Germany is used. In a first step of simulations, all measures are implemented separately. In a second step, combinations of both RES-E supporting and CO2 mitigating measures are simulated and discussed.

We also evaluated the influence of including the biochemical metal cycle on the calculated loads. Differences are illustrated by examples of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn for a deciduous forest on five major soil types in the Netherlands. Stand-still loads are generally lower than critical loads, which in turn are lower than the target loads indicating that present levels are below critical levels. Uncertainties in the calculated critical loads are mainly determined by the uncertainty in the critical limits and the chemical speciation model. Including the metal cycle has a small effect on the calculated critical loads. Results are discussed in view of the applicability of the critical load concept for metals in future protocols on the reduction in metal emissions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The most recent Regional Air Quality Management Plans (AQMPs) highlighted the importance of Non-Technical Measures (NTMs), in addition to Technical Measures (TMs), in meeting environmental targets. The aim of the present work is to compile a list of all the TMs and NTMs taken into account in the Italian Regional AQMPs and to give in the target year, 2010, an estimation of SO2, NOx and PM10 emission reductions, of PM10 concentration and of the health impact of PM2.5 concentrations in terms of Life Expectancy Reduction. In order to do that, RAINS-Italy, as part of the National Integrated Modeling system for International Negotiation on atmospheric pollution (MINNI), has been applied. The management of TMs and NTMs inside RAINS have often obliged both the introduction of exogenous driving force scenarios and the control strategy modification. This has inspired a revision of the many NTM definitions and a clear choice of the definition adopted. It was finally highlighted that only few TMs and NTMs implemented in the AQMPs represent effective measures in reaching the environmental targets. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Approximately half of the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are nonfunctional. Due to lack of specific symptoms, most patients with nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Second primary malignancies are seen very rarely in these patients. Colon carcinoma ranks third in frequency among primary sites of cancer in both men and women in western countries. Presence of a metachronous colon adenocarcinoma in a patient with nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor has not been reported before. We present a patient who had an asymptomatic mass in the head of the pancreas, detected by ultrasonography in 1996. The patient did not consent to operation. In 2002, after the diagnosis of an unresectable, nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, interferon alpha-2b and octreotide were started. A year after biological treatment, he refused further treatment. In 2004, during the evaluation of dissemination of the asymptomatic disease, positron emission tomography revealed a high uptake by the descending colon despite the failure of other imaging methods. After surgery for operable colon carcinoma, the patient received chemotherapy and biological therapy for both tumors. Since 2005, he has been doing well without any further treatment thus far. In conclusion, computerized tomography/magnetic resonance imaging and octreotide scintigraphy may be insufficient to show disseminated disease and asymptomatic second primary malignancies. Therefore, positron emission tomography is a valuable promising option for the evaluation of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and concomitant or metachronous malignancies. Lifelong follow-up by a multidisciplinary oncology team is needed so that a long-term survival can be achieved with integrated multimodal systemic treatment approaches.","Colon cancer; Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor; Positron emission tomography","alpha2b interferon; chromogranin A; epirubicin; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; fluorouracil; folinic acid; irinotecan; octreotide; pentetreotide; streptozocin; adult; anamnesis; arthralgia; arthritis; article; ascites; case report; colon biopsy; colon carcinoma; colorectal surgery; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic imaging; drug dose increase; drug fever; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; flu like syndrome; follow up; hemicolectomy; histopathology; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; immunotherapy; laparotomy; male; multiple cycle treatment; neuroendocrine tumor; pancreas tumor; pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor; positron emission tomography; protein blood level; treatment outcome; Adenocarcinoma; Colonic Neoplasms; Humans; Incidental Findings; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms, Second Primary; Neuroendocrine Tumors; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Positron-Emission Tomography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350155579

Within this context, this paper first explores the pros and cons of many possible conceptual approaches to assess the comparability of the mitigation efforts by Annex I countries. We selected six approaches for further analysis, which represent efforts well and are technically feasible. The implications of each of these six approaches were analysed in terms of the reductions and abatement costs that must be made by different Annex I countries to meet an aggregate reduction of 20% and 30%, respectively, below 1990 levels by 2020. The analysis indicates that significant reductions are necessary for all developed countries. This study shows that reductions by the EU of at least 30%, combined with comparable reduction efforts by other developed countries to meet the aggregate Annex I reduction target of 30% by 2020 and support of developed countries for developing countries to keep their emissions 15-30% below the baseline, are sufficient to achieve the EU climate goal of 2 °C. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Shenzhen as the representative city has experienced rapid urbanization and population growth. Urbanization strongly changes the nature of the land surface and has a large influence on the regional ecosystems. In the process of urbanization, fertile cropland and original forest are often destroyed. It is important to regularly monitor the effect of urbanization on the natural environment so as to allow us to control the encroachment to a reasonable extent. Net primary productivity (NPP) is an important productivity indicator of the ecosystem. We obtained land covers from Landsat TM images to quantify urbanization of Shenzhen between 1999 and 2005. We used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-based) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, Landsat-based land cover map, meteorological data and other field data to drive the CASA productivity model and obtain net primary productivity for the study area. Finally, we estimated the effect of urban sprawl on regional NPP. The study on Landsat-based land cover maps indicated that a move towards urban is the most significant landscape change in Shenzhen City and urbanization has irreversibly transformed about 20.21% of Shenzhen's surface during 1999-2005. NPP loss mainly resulted from urbanization during 1999-2005 and totaled to 321.51 Gg of carbon, an average annual reduction of 45.93 Gg of carbon. For every square km of Shenzhen area, NPP was on average reduced by 0.0017 Gg of carbon during 1999-2005. The loss of NPP is equivalent to a reduction in absorption of 520.85 Gg CO2 and release of 385.81 Gg O2, so urbanization has a large influence on the regional net primary productivity. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The change in distribution and total SOC stock in the 0-60 cm layer, the stratification of microbial biomass carbon (MB-C) content in the 0-40 cm layer and the carbon (C) mineralization in the upper 0-5 cm layer in silt loam soils in Western Europe with different periods of RT agriculture were evaluated. Ten fields at seven locations, representing the important RT types and maintained for a different number of years, and eight fields under conventional tillage (CT) agriculture with similar soil type and crop rotation were selected. RT agriculture resulted in a higher stratification of SOC in the soil profile than CT agriculture. However, the total SOC stock in the 0-60 cm layer was not changed, even after 20 of years RT agriculture. The MB-C was significantly higher in the 0-10 cm layer under RT agriculture, even after only 5 years, compared to CT agriculture. The higher SOC and MB-C content in the upper 0-5 cm layer of RT fields resulted in a higher C mineralization rate in undisturbed soil in the laboratory. Simulating ploughing by disturbing the soil resulted in inconsistent changes (both lower and higher) of C mineralization rates. A crop rotation with root crops, with heavy soil disturbance every 2 or 3 years at harvest, possibly limited the anticipated positive effect of RT agriculture in our research. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon mineralization; Microbial biomass carbon; Reduced tillage agriculture; Root crops; Soil organic carbon","biomass; crop rotation; microbial community; mineralization; silty loam; soil carbon; soil erosion; soil organic matter; tillage; Eurasia; Europe; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649158228

Thus, a better understanding of urban energy uses is necessary for Chinese decision-makers at various levels to address energy security, climate change mitigation, and local pollution abatement. Therefore, this paper addresses three key questions: What is the urban contribution to China's energy usage and CO2 emissions? What is the contribution of large cities, and what alternate energy-economy pathways are they following? How have energy uses and CO2 emissions transformed in the last two decades in key Chinese cities? This three-tier analysis illustrates the changes in urban energy uses and CO2 emissions in China. The results show that the urban contributions make up 84% of China's commercial energy usage. The 35 largest cities in China, which contain 18% of the population, contribute 40% of China's energy uses and CO2 emissions. In four provincial cities, the per capita energy usage and CO2 emissions have increased several-fold. Rapid progress was made in reducing the carbon intensity of economic activities in cities throughout the 1990s, but alarmingly, such progress has either slowed down or been reversed in the last few years.

A very well-calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (R2 D 0.9968, NSE D 0.91) was exercised over the Kangsabati river watershed in Bankura district of West Bengal, India, for a year including monsoon and non-monsoon period in order to evaluate projected parameters for agricultural activities. Evapotranspiration, transmission losses, potential evapotranspiration and lateral flow to reach are evaluated from the years 2041-2050 in order to generate a picture for sustainable development of the river basin and its inhabitants. The projected climate change under various scenarios is likely to have implications on food production, water supply, biodiversity and livelihoods. India has a significant stake in scientific advancement as well as an international understanding to promote mitigation and adaptation. This requires improved scientific understanding, capacity building, networking and broad consultation processes.

The distribution of cobalt species was investigated by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and by H2-TPR in order to identify the active cobalt species in hydrocarbons (HC)-selective catalytic reduction (SCR). It was found that the nature of cobalt species strongly depends on the cobalt loading as well as on the properties of the support. The barium addition to the alumina slows down solid state diffusion processes, improving the thermal stability of the support and preventing diffusion of cobalt into the bulk. Highly dispersed surface Co2+ species over alumina were identified as active sites in the NO-SCR process. Accordingly, a high concentration of surface Co2+ sites in Co 1 wt%/Al2O3 improves the catalytic performance in NO-SCR, the long term stability as well as the water tolerance. On the contrary, the formation of Co3O4 particles in Co 1 wt%/Al2O3-BaO promotes the propylene oxidation by oxygen, decreasing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst in NO reduction. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Barium effect; Cobalt oxide catalysts; NO-SCR; Water tolerance","Active site; Catalytic performance; Cobalt content; Cobalt loading; Cobalt oxide catalysts; Cobalt species; High concentration; Long term stability; NO reduction; NO-SCR; Propylene oxidation; SCR process; Solid-state diffusion; Supported cobalt catalyst; Thermal stability; UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; Water tolerance; Barium; Catalyst selectivity; Catalyst supports; Cobalt; Hydrocarbons; Oxygen; Propylene; Reduction; Spectroscopy; Thermodynamic stability; Selective catalytic reduction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71749106186

Brazil is often included in their number, yet this country is in fact notable for its exceptionally high reliance on energy from renewable sources - approaching 50%. However, the fact that much of this energy comes from hydropower and biofuels, and recent discoveries of massive oil reserves off of the Brazilian coast, are a recipe for controversy. In this detailed account, Antonio Dias Leite sets out the development of Brazil's energy mix. Beginning with the history of energy provision and use, he then moves on to tackle the various sources in detail: hydropower, biomass and other renewables, as well as fossil fuels and nuclear power. In each case he examines growth, distribution, environmental and socio-economic issues (such as deforestation and displacement of indigenous communities) and potential for future development - highlighting what has worked, and what hasn't. The book ends by examining Brazilian approaches to energy efficiency, and by positioning Brazil in the world context. This is a major contribution to the discussion around climate change mitigation that will be key reading for policymakers and researchers concerned with the future role and impacts of rapidly developing countries. © Antonio Dias Leite, 2009.

In particular, we focus on controlling the wavelength of emission, in order to tune the laser wavelength, as well as on increasing the amount of PBI in the films, aiming to decrease the laser thresholds, while keeping a good photostability. Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) was observed for all compounds, the best performance being obtained for films doped with PBIs symmetrically substituted at the imide positions, that emitted at 580 nm with a threshold of 20 kW/cm2 and a photostability half-life of 30,000 pump pulses. Substitution at the bay positions of the PBI core and replacement of imide functions by anhydride groups allow to red-shift the emission wavelength up to 645 nm, but the thresholds increase considerably and the photostability is reduced. PBIs are among the most photostable materials reported in the literature and show very reasonable thresholds. In addition they have a great potential for their application in the field of data communications based on poly(methyl methacrylate) optical fibers, with low-loss transmission windows between 530 and 590 nm and at 650 nm. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, diesel particles may contribute a warming effect on the planet's climate. The composition of these particles is composed principally of elemental carbon (EC) with adsorbed organic compounds, sulfate, nitrate, ammonia, metals, and other trace elements. The purpose of this study was to depict the seasonality and modeling of particulate matter in the Southeastern US produced by the diesel fueled sources (DFSs). The modeling results came from four one-month cases including March, June, September, and December to represent different seasons in 2003 by linking Models-3/CMAQ and SMOKE. The 1999 National Emissions Inventory Version 3 (NEI99) was used in this analysis for point, area, and non-road sources, whereas the National Mobile Inventory Model (NMIM) was used to create the on-road emissions. Three urban areas, Atlanta, Birmingham, and Nashville were selected to analyze the DPM emissions and concentrations. Even though the model performance was not very strong, it could be considered satisfactory to conduct seasonal distribution analysis for DPM. Important hourly DPM seasonality was observed in each city, of which higher values occurred at the morning traffic rush hours. The EC contributions of primary DPM were similar for all three sites (~ 74%). The results showed that there is no significant daily seasonality of DPM contribution to PM2.5 for any of these three cities in 2003. The annual DPM contribution to total PM2.5 for Atlanta, Nashville, and Birmingham were 3.7%, 2.5%, and 2.2%, respectively.","CMAQ; Diesel particulate matter; Modeling; PM2.5; Seasonality","Carbon; Health risks; Models; Roads and streets; CMAQ; Diesel particulate; Diesel particulate matters; Inventory modeling; National emissions inventories; Particulate Matter; Seasonal distributions; Seasonality; Trace elements; diesel fuel; carbon emission; chemical composition; diesel; health risk; modeling; particulate matter; pollutant source; seasonality; urban area; urban pollution; article; concentration (parameters); exhaust gas; geographic distribution; model; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; traffic; United States; urban area; Alabama; Atlanta; Birmingham [Alabama]; Georgia; Nashville; North America; Tennessee; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66849135403

Firstly, building occupiers and owners are becoming increasingly concerned at rising energy prices whilst building designers are also required to reduce, due to European and national and local legislation, the operational CO2 emissions from new and existing buildings. This paper considers the application of Bivalent (dual fuel) ground source heat pump heating and cooling systems as a way to reduce the installation costs whilst also providing considerable economic and environmental savings. A case study building is used to demonstrate the importance of optimising ground loop heat exchanger length, considering differing future energy prices and the chosen appraisal period. An incremental approach is used to consider the relative benefits of increasing the size of the GSHP. Designers can also be misled by the assumption that by sizing a GSHP system to just meet the legislative targets the most economically sized system will be installed. The optimum system shows a &gt;60% reduction in the capital cost vs. a peak sized GSHP system whilst still providing &gt;70% of the respective economic savings and CO2 reduction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We estimate the plasticity of 17 household action types in 5 behaviorally distinct categories by use of data on the most effective documented interventions that do not involve new regulatory measures. These interventions vary by type of action and typically combine several policy tools and strong social marketing.

In this paper, a Method for Heat Load Analysis (MeHLA) for exploring industrial DH conversions has been developed. This method can be a helpful tool for analyzing the impact different industrial processes have on the local DH system, when processes that utilize electricity and other fuels, convert to utilizing DH. Heat loads for different types of industries and processes are analyzed according to characteristics such as temperature levels and time-dependency. MeHLA has been used to analyze 34 Swedish industries and the method demonstrates how conversion of industrial processes to DH can result in heat load duration curves that are less outdoor temperature-dependent and more evenly distributed over the year. An evenly distributed heat load curve can result in increased annual operating time for base load DH plants such as cogeneration plants, leading to increased electricity generation. In addition to the positive effects for the DH load duration curve, the conversions to DH can also lead to an 11% reduction in the use of electricity, a 40% reduction in the use of fossil fuels and a total energy end-use saving of 6% in the studied industries. Converting the industrial processes to DH will also lead to a potential reduction of the global carbon dioxide emissions by 112,000 tonnes per year. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Instead of letting only a small number of countries dominate a few controversial dialogues about emissions reductions, a comprehensive global system must be established based on emissions allowances for different countries, to realize the long-term goal of controlling global atmospheric CO2 concentrations. That a system rooted in ""cumulative emissions per capita,"" the best conception of the ""common but differentiated responsibilities"" principle affirmed by the Kyoto Protocol according to fundamental standards of fairness and justice, was demonstrated. Based on calculations of various countries' cumulative emissions per capita, estimates of their cumulative emissions from 1900 to 2005, and their annual emissions allowances into the future (2006-2050), a 470 ppmv atmospheric CO2 concentration target was set. According to the following four objective indicators-total emissions allowance from 1900 to 2050, actual emissions from 1900 to 2005, emissions levels in 2005, and the average growth rate of emissions from 1996 to 2005-all countries and regions whose population was more than 300000 in 2005 were divided into four main groups: countries with emissions deficits, countries and regions needing to reduce their gross emissions, countries and regions needing to reduce their emissions growth rates, and countries that can maintain the current emissions growth rates. Based on this proposal, most G8 countries by 2005 had already expended their 2050 emissions allowances. The accumulated financial value based on emissions has reached more than 5.5 trillion US dollars (20 dollars per ton of CO2). Even if these countries could achieve their ambitious emissions reduction targets in the future, their per capita emissions from 2006 to 2050 would still be much higher than those of developing countries; under such circumstance, these future emissions would create more than 6.3 trillion US dollars in emissions deficits. Because of their low cumulative emissions per capita, most developing countries fall within one of the latter two groups, which means that they have leeway for making emissions decisions in the future. Although China accounts for more than 30% of the total global emissions allowance from 2006 to 2050, its total emissions can be controlled within that allowance by no other way than reducing its future emissions growth rates. In the end, nine key issues related to international climate negotiations were briefly addressed. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","Cumulative emissions per capita; Emission allowance; International negotiations on climate change","Atmospheric CO; Average growth rate; Critical issues; Current emissions; Denmark; Emission allowances; Emissions reduction; Financial values; G8 countries; Global emissions; Global systems; Gross emissions; International negotiation; International negotiations on climate change; Key issues; KYOTO protocol; Long-term goals; Main group; Per capita; Quantitative data; Total emissions; US dollar; Concentration (process); Developing countries; Emission control; International cooperation; Climate change; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; developing world; emission control; environmental policy; estimation method; Kyoto Protocol; negotiation process; China; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71949124746

This review will focus on the clinical use of radioactive tracers (nonpharmacologic amounts of compounds labeled with a radioactive substance) that permit external imaging using single photon emission computed tomography (planar, SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Imaging of lung cancer has been revolutionized with the use of fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), an analog of glucose that can be imaged using PET. The ability to carry out whole body imaging after intravenous injection of 18F-FDG allows accurate staging of disease, helping to determine regional and distant nodal and other parenchymal involvement. Glycolysis is increased in nonmalignant conditions, including inflammation (e.g., sarcoidosis), and 18F-FDG PET is a sensitive method for evaluation of active inflammatory disease. Inflammatory disease has been imaged, even before the advent of PET, with planar and SPECT imaging using gallium-67, a radiometal that binds to transferrin. Metabolic alteration in pulmonary pathology is currently being studied, largely in lung cancer, primarily with PET, with a variety of other radiotracers. Prominent among these is thymidine; fluorine-18-labeled thymidine PET is being increasingly used to evaluate proliferation rate in lung and other cancers. This overview will focus on the clinical utility of 18F-FDG PET in the staging and therapy evaluation of lung cancer as well as in imaging of nonmalignant pulmonary conditions. PET and SPECT imaging with other radiotracers of interest will also be reviewed. Future directions in PET imaging of pulmonary pathophysiology will also be explored.","Cancer; Infection; PET; Radiolabeled ligands; SPECT","fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; gallium 67; gallium citrate ga 67; indium 111; macrosalb tc 99m; technetium 99m; thiosemicarbazone derivative; thymidine c 11; thymidine f 18; tracer; unclassified drug; bone metastasis; cancer staging; cell proliferation; computer assisted tomography; conference paper; diagnostic accuracy; glycolysis; human; lung cancer; lung nodule; lung parenchyma; lung tuberculosis; lymph node metastasis; metastasis; phenotype; pneumonia; positron emission tomography; sarcoidosis; single photon emission computer tomography; treatment outcome; tumor vascularization; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Molecular Imaging; Pneumonia; Positron-Emission Tomography; Radiopharmaceuticals; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69249219282

Similarly, Benford's law can also be applied to the first two significant digits (i.e., from 10 to 99), and so on. Here, we show that gross data sets of daily pollen counts from three aerobiological stations (located in European cities with different features regarding vegetation and climatology) fit Benford's law for the first significant digits, but this is not always true for the data transformed by a correction factor used in aerobiological studies. That is to say, the biases introduced by rounding and lower and upper built-in limits in pollen counts are detected by Benford's law analysis. The analysis of the first two significant digits from transformed data is better explained by a Power law than Benford's law.

However, the production processes for these unconventional fossil fuels create large quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) and this remains one of the key arguments against such development. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies could reduce these emissions and preliminary analysis of regional CO2 storage capacity in locations where such facilities might be sited within the U.S. indicates that there appears to be sufficient storage capacity, primarily in deep saline formations, to accommodate the CO2 from these industries. Nevertheless, even assuming wide-scale availability of cost-effective CO2 capture and geologic storage resources, the emergence of a domestic U.S. oil shale or coal-to-liquids (CTL) industry would be responsible for significant increases in CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. The authors present modeling results of two future hypothetical climate policy scenarios that indicate that the oil shale production facilities required to produce 3 MMB/d from the Eocene Green River Formation of the western U.S. using an in situ retorting process would result in net emissions to the atmosphere of between 3000 and 7000 MtCO2, in addition to storing potentially 900-5000 MtCO2 in regional deep geologic formations via CCS in the period up to 2050. A similarly sized, but geographically more dispersed domestic CTL industry could result in 4000-5000 MtCO2 emitted to the atmosphere in addition to potentially 21,000-22,000 MtCO2 stored in regional deep geologic formations over the same period. While this analysis shows that there is likely adequate CO2 storage capacity in the regions where these technologies are likely to deploy, the reliance by these industries on large-scale CCS could result in an accelerated rate of utilization of the nation's CO2 storage resource, leaving less high-quality storage capacity for other carbon-producing industries including electric power generation.","Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Climate change; Coal-to-liquids; Oil shale; Unconventional fossil fuels production; United States","Atmospheric CO; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Climate policy; Conventional oil; Deep saline formations; Energy security; Geologic formations; Geologic storage; Green River Formation; Heavy hydrocarbons; High quality; In-situ; Large-scale deployment; Modeling results; Preliminary analysis; Production facility; Production process; Storage capacity; Storage resources; Unconventional fossil fuels production; United States; Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Coal storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Industry; Leakage (fluid); Oil shale; Power quality; Shale; Shale oil; Well stimulation; Carbon monoxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; coal; emission control; environmental policy; fossil fuel; hydrocarbon resource; hydrocarbon technology; oil production; oil shale; power generation; technological development; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71049169302

The results were compared with those derived from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument onboard the Thermosphere-lonosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. The zonal mean temperatures at similar latitudes show good agreement. The observations also reveal that the AO dominates the seasonal oscillations in both the stratosphere and the mesosphere at middle and high latitudes, with the amplitudes increasing poleward. The SAO oscillations are weaker at all six sites. The oscillations in the upper mesosphere are usually stronger than those in the upper stratosphere with a local minimum near 50-65 km. The upper mesospheric signals are clearly out of phase with upper stratospheric signals. Some differences between lidar and SABER results were found in both the stratosphere and mesosphere. These could be due to: the difference in data sampling between ground-based and space-based instruments, the length of data set, the tidal aliasing owing to the temperature AO and SAO since lidar data are nighttime only, and lidar temperature analysis algorithms. The seasonal oscillations of tidal amplitudes derived from SABER observations suggests that the tidal aliasing of the lidar temperature AO and SAO in the upper mesosphere may over- or under-estimate the real temperature oscillations, depending on the tidal phases. In addition, the possibly unrealistic seasonal oscillations embedded in the elimatological models (e.g., MSIS or CIRA) at the reference point for lidar temperature analysis may also affect the lidar results in the top part of the profiles (usually in the upper mesosphere).

This study sought to explore women prisoners' perceptions of the impact of imprisonment on their health. Methods: This qualitative study involved adult women prisoners in two closed local prisons. Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted. Results: Women prisoners reported that imprisonment impacted negatively upon their health. The initial shock of imprisonment, separation from families and enforced living with other women suffering drug withdrawal and serious mental health problems affected their own mental health. Over the longer term, women complained of detention in unhygienic facilities by regimes that operated to disempower them, including in the management of their own health. Women described responses to imprisonment that were also health negating such as increased smoking, eating poorly and seeking psychotropic medication. However, imprisonment could also offer a respite from lives characterised by poverty, social exclusion, substance misuse and violence, with perceived improvements in health. Conclusion: The impact of imprisonment on women's health was mixed but was largely perceived to be negative. Despite policy initiatives to introduce health promotion in prisons, there is little evidence of the extent to which this has been effective. The current policy climate in the UK makes it especially timely to examine the reported experience of women prisoners themselves about the impact of imprisonment on their health and to re-evaluate health promotion in women's prisons.",,"psychotropic agent; health status; prisoner dilemma; qualitative analysis; adult; article; coping behavior; fear; female; health; health care practice; human; hygiene; information processing; malnutrition; mental disease; mental health; perception; poverty; prison; prisoner; smoking; social isolation; violence; wellbeing; withdrawal syndrome; Adolescent; Adult; England; Female; Focus Groups; Health Promotion; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Middle Aged; Policy Making; Prisoners; Qualitative Research; Women's Health Services; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69749122316

Carbon productivity was limited by long-term shading or by girdling. The trees were grown in compost soil to avoid nutrient deficiencies. Despite severe limitation in photosynthesis and biomass production by shading, the concentrations of carbohydrates in roots were unaffected by the light level. Shade-acclimated plants were only 10% and sun-acclimated plants were 74% colonized by ectomycorrhiza. EM diversity was higher on roots with high than at roots with low mycorrhizal colonization. Evenness was unaffected by any treatment. Low mycorrhizal colonization had no negative effects on plant mineral nutrition. In girdled plants mycorrhizal colonization and diversity were retained although 14C-leaf feeding showed almost complete disruption of carbon transport from leaves to roots. Carbohydrate storage pools in roots decreased upon girdling. Our results show that plant carbon productivity was the reason for and not the result of high ectomycorrhizal diversity. We suggest that ectomycorrhiza can be supplied by two carbon routes: recent photosynthate and stored carbohydrates. Storage pools may be important for ectomycorrhizal survival when photoassimilates were unavailable, probably feeding preferentially less carbon demanding EM species as shifts in community composition were found. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Beech; Diversity; Invisibility; Nitrogen; Productivity; Understory ecology","carbohydrate; carbon; abundance; colonization; community composition; community structure; deciduous tree; ectomycorrhiza; fungus; hypothesis testing; nutrition; photosynthesis; species diversity; species evenness; article; beech; biomass; biosynthesis; growth, development and aging; light; metabolism; microbiology; mycorrhiza; photosynthesis; plant root; Biomass; Carbohydrates; Carbon; Carbon Isotopes; Fagus; Light; Mycorrhizae; Photosynthesis; Plant Roots; Soil Microbiology; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650473673

The equatorial drought belt arises from the ompensatory descending motion associated with exaggerated deep convection over the tropics in both hemispheres. A double ITCZ disappears in a coupled experiment (Exp2) with the same AGCM as used in Expl coupled to an interactive ocean mixed layer within the great warm pool. This finding demonstrates that local air-sea interaction can modify the SST pattern, thereby regulating the climate mean state via the following processes. Local air-sea flux exchanges in tropical convective regions such as the ITCZ tend to cool SST via negative cloud-radiation and wind-evaporation feedbacks. Such changes further modify the tropical atmospheric circulation structure such that the equatorial compensatory descent in Expl is replaced by the equatorial convergence zone, as seen in nature. A third sensitivity experiment (Exp3), with the AGCM driven by the monthly SST field derived from the coupled experiment, yielded similar results to those obtained in Exp2. Overall, the results indicate that a reasonable depiction of the air-sea coupling process is important to successfully simulating the tropical precipitation pattern, as the atmosphere is closely coupled with the ocean over the tropics.

Four-year-old trees were subjected to two light treatments (30% and 100% of full sunlight) and two watering regimes (well watered, drought) for 2 years. In both tested populations, drought significantly decreased gi and the net photosynthesis rate (A) and increased carbon isotope composition (δ13C) values in both light treatments, in particular in the sun. Moreover, drought resulted in a significantly higher relative limitation due to stomatal conductance (Ls) in both light treatments and higher relative limitation due to internal conductance (Li) and abscisic acid (ABA) in the sun plants. The results also showed that Li (0.260.47) was always greater than Ls (0.120.28). On the other hand, drought significantly decreased the ratio of chloroplastic to internal CO2 concentration (Cc/C i), photosynthetic nitrogen utilization efficiency (PNUE) and total biomass in the sun plants of the wet climate population, whereas there were no significant changes in these parameters in the dry climate population. Our results also showed that the dry climate population possessed higher δ13C values with higher ratio of internal conductance to stomatal conductance (gi/gs), suggesting that increasing the gi/gs ratio enhances water-use efficiency (WUE) in plants evolved in arid environments. Thus, we propose that the use of the gi/gs parameter to screen P. asperata plants with higher water deficit tolerance is certainly worthy of consideration. Furthermore, gi is an important variable, which reflects the population differences in PNUE, and it should thus be included in plant physiological investigations related to leaf economics.","Carbon isotope discrimination; Internal conductance; Limitation analysis; Photosynthesis; Stomatal conductance","carbon; carbon dioxide; water; abscisic acid; biochemical composition; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; climate conditions; coniferous tree; isotopic composition; light effect; nutrient use efficiency; photosynthesis; phytochemistry; phytomass; soil water; stomatal conductance; water availability; water stress; article; drought; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plant stoma; radiation exposure; spruce; sunlight; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Isotopes; Droughts; Photosynthesis; Picea; Plant Stomata; Sunlight; Water; Picea asperata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74549221403

In this paper we evaluate the performance of partially covered flat plate water collectors connected in series using theoretical modeling. PV is used to run the DC motor, which circulates the water in a forced mode. Analytical expressions for N collectors connected in series are derived by using basic energy balance equations and computer based thermal models. This paper shows the detailed analysis of thermal energy, exergy and electrical energy yield by varying the number of collectors by considering four weather conditions (a, b, c and d type) for five different cities (New Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Srinagar, and Jodhpur) of India. Annual thermal and electrical energy yield is also evaluated for four different series and parallel combination of collectors for comparison purpose considering New Delhi conditions. This paper also gives the total carbon credit earned by the hybrid PV/T water heater investigated as per norms of Kyoto Protocol for New Delhi climatic conditions. Cost analysis has also been carried out. It is observed that the collectors partially covered by PV module combines the production of hot water and electricity generation and it is beneficial for the users whose primary requirement is hot water production and collectors fully covered by PV is beneficial for the users whose primary requirement is electricity generation. We have also found that if this type of system is installed only in 10% of the total residential houses in Delhi then the total carbon credit earned by PV/T water heaters in terms of thermal energy is USD $144.5 millions per annum and in terms of exergy is USD $14.3 millions per annum, respectively. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Foraminiferal Sr/Ca ratios constitute another example of the application of trace elements in paleostudies since they may reflect the Sr/Ca values of seawater. However, over the past few decades it has been proven that the incorporation of trace elements in foraminiferal calcite is controlled by more than one environmental parameter. To quantify the effect of salinity on Mg and Sr incorporation planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides sacculifer (sensu stricto) were grown in the laboratory under different environmental conditions. Laboratory experiments allowed us to separate a direct salinity effect from a possible independent impact through differences in the calcite saturation state of the seawater (Ω). Although the temperature effect is more important than the salinity effect, a change of 4 salinity units is equivalent to a 1 °C bias on Mg/Ca-based temperatures. This effect of salinity on Mg incorporation is minor. However, when using Mg/Ca-based temperatures in combination with foraminiferal δ18O to calculate salinity, it cannot be neglected. The present study shows salinity as the overriding control on Mg incorporation within the range of Ω studied (Ω between 5.25 and 6.50; [CO32-] between 218 and 270 μmol/kg) at a constant temperature of 26 °C. In contrast, Ω appears to be the main control on foraminiferal Sr incorporation (0.10 mmol/mol per 100 μmol/kg rise in [CO32-]), whereas salinity has a non significant influence on Sr/Ca. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It is defined as the mono-alkyl esters of fatty acids derived from plant oils or animal fats. Biodiesel has many important technical advantages compared to petrodiesel including superior inherent lubricity, low toxicity, high (non-flammable) flash point and biodegradability, very low or negligible sulfur content and lower exhaust emissions of most regulated species. Biodiesel is generally produced by transesterification of the lipid with a short-chain monohydric alcohol. This process may leave behind very small (trace) concentrations of minor constituents such as saturated monoacylglycerols (MAGs) or free steryl glucosides (FStGs). These materials have high melting points and very low solubilities allowing them to form solid residues when stored during cold weather. Blending with petrodiesel exacerbates the problem. Settling solid residues were found to clog fuel filters in fuel dispensers and vehicles. In response to documented problems the biodiesel industry in the United States collaborated with the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) to develop a cold soak filterability performance test that will help identify fuels that may have a propensity to clog filters if exposed to long-term storage in cold weather.","Cloud point; Cold soak filtration test; Low-temperature flow test; Monoacylglycerol; Solid residues; Steryl glucoside","Cloud points; Filtration tests; Low temperatures; Solid residues; Steryl glucosides; Alternative fuels; Biodegradation; Biodiesel; Blending; Carbohydrates; Esters; Fatty acids; Filtration; Fuel storage; Glycerol; Materials testing; Melting point; Porous materials; Sulfur; Testing; Vegetable oils; Cold weather problems",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71249153479

Successful organisms will respond to these changes by persisting in suitable microsites, adapting to novel conditions, or dispersing to new sites. We describe three general categories of strategies for restoring and managing natural systems in light of likely changes in future climate that collectively embrace many of the approaches that The Nature Conservancy is applying or considering in the state of Washington. Component redundancy suggests that in natural systems greater ecosystem resilience, despite changing climates, may be achieved by increasing species and community redundancy. Functional redundancy is the idea that different components of a system can fulfill the same functions, thereby producing the same result. Restoration projects and managers of natural systems can introduce ecologically equivalent species or novel associations of species, which may help avoid losses in biodiversity. Increased connectivity suggests that success is achieved by ensuring that suitable habitats are always within easy reach of one another. This includes conservation approaches that provide linkages, corridors, or other mechanisms to facilitate the movement of organisms as they respond to climate changes. We acknowledge that these approaches are not without risk, nor do they necessarily ensure success. However, we propose them as potential solutions among a growing suite of alternative strategies for incorporating climate change into conservation actions. © 2009 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.","Climate change; Conservation management; Global warming; Pacific Northwest; Restoration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68649086472

Regrowth is actively controlled in working pastures, but it could be managed to offset greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and other emitting industries with supplementary benefits for biodiversity conservation. This paper explores the case of Brigalow regrowth in the extensive pastoral landscape of north-eastern Australia. By synthesising current ecological knowledge with relevant socio-economic and policy considerations, it examines the potential of the Brigalow regrowth ecosystem to provide dual carbon/biodiversity benefits. Brigalow regrowth sequesters large amounts of carbon, especially when compared to other ecosystems from similar sub-humid climates. In addition, restoring regrowth is likely to have benefits for a wide range of native flora and fauna, including the endangered bridled nailtail wallaby. However, there are knowledge gaps relating to the landscape ecology of Brigalow regrowth and the impacts of management and climate change on carbon/restoration potential. Also, a conflict exists between short-term carbon sequestration and long-term restoration goals and we suggest a role for restoration thinning to resolve this. Regional demand for high biomass regrowth as a carbon offset is likely to be high but ambiguities in carbon policy threaten to diminish the use of natural regrowth for reforestation projects. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Acacia harpophylla; Biodiversity; Brigalow; Carbon; Natural regeneration; Pastoralism; Restoration","abandoned land; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural management; agricultural policy; biodiversity; landscape ecology; pastoralism; pasture; reforestation; regeneration; regrowth; socioeconomic conditions; woody plant; Australasia; Australia; Acacia; Acacia harpophylla",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69249216463

Statistical analysis of long-term variations of ground air temperature, gas composition of atmosphere, depth of seasonal melting, temperature, and distribution area of permafrost ground in the subpolar zone of the north hemisphere testifies to significant directional changes of basic cryolitozone characteristics. Analysis of the latitudinal distribution of flux density of anthropogenic and natural methane showed that the greatest methane emission is in the subpolar zone of the northern hemisphere, where anthropogenic impact is minimal. In view of the estimations of methane emission during thawing of permafrost grounds, a new hypothesis explaining the present climate conditions in northern latitudes has been proposed. The planetary maximum of climate warming in the arctic zone is substantially caused by methane and carbonic acid outbreaks from thawing permafrost grounds, which, in turn, is an additional reason for the greenhouse effect. This effect is materially analogous to the influence of technogenic discharge of greenhouse gases in the temperate zone. © 2009 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"Air temperature; Anthropogenic impacts; Carbonic acids; Climate condition; Climate variation; Climate warming; Directional changes; Distribution area; Flux densities; Frozen rock; Gas compositions; Latitudinal distribution; Long-term variations; Methane emissions; Natural methane; North latitudes; Northern Hemispheres; Northern latitudes; Statistical analysis; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Organic acids; Permafrost; Thawing; Methane; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric plume; climate change; climate variation; estimation method; frozen ground; greenhouse gas; latitude; long-term change; methane; Northern Hemisphere; observational method; permafrost; polar region; statistical analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75749105856

Such a switch may be linked to the propensity for periodic breathing (PB) in infancy. To test this idea, we characterized the maturation of the respiratory controller and its effect on breathing stability in ∼10-day-old lambs and 6-mo-old sheep. We measured 1) carotid body sensitivity via dynamic ventilatory responses to step changes in O2 and CO2, 2) steady-state ventilatory sensitivity to CO2 under hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions, 3) the dependence of the apneic threshold on arterial PO2, and 4) the effect of hypoxic or hypercapnic gas inhalation during induced PB. Stability of the system was assessed using surrogate measures of loop gain. Peripheral sensitivity to O 2 was higher in newborn than in older animals (P &lt; 0.05), but peripheral CO2 sensitivity was unchanged. Central CO2 sensitivity was reduced with age, but the slopes of the ventilatory responses to CO2 were the same in hypoxia and hyperoxia. Reduced arterial PO 2 caused a leftward shift in the apneic threshold at both ages. Inspiration of hypoxic gas during PB immediately halted PB, whereas hypercapnia stopped PB only after one or two further PB cycles. We conclude that the controller in the sheep remains additive over the first 6 mo of life. Our results also show that the loop gain of the respiratory control system is reduced with age, possibly as a result of a reduction of peripheral O 2 sensitivity.

We present an OSSE to assess the improvement in surface CO characterization that would result from the addition of a GEO-CAPE CO measurement to current low Earth orbit (LEO) thermal infrared-only measurements. We construct instrument simulators for these two measurement scenarios and study the case of July 2004 when wildfires in Alaska and Canada led to significant CO pollution over the contiguous United States. Compared to a control experiment, an ensemble-based data assimilation of simulated satellite observations in a global model leads to improvements in both the surface CO distributions and the time evolution of CO profiles at locations affected by wildfire plumes and by urban emissions. In all cases, an experiment with the GEO-CAPE CO measurement scenario (overall model skill of 0.84) performed considerably better than the experiment with the current LEO/thermal infrared measurement (skill of 0.58) and the control (skill of 0.07). This demonstrates the advantages of increased sampling from GEO and enhanced measurement sensitivity to the lowermost troposphere with a multispectral retrieval.

Greenhouse gas emission reduction targets have been set in many industrialised countries. A change in current practices of almost all greenhouse-emitting industrial sectors is unavoidable, if the set targets is to be achieved. Although, waste disposal contributes around 3% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in Australia (mainly due to fugitive methane emissions from landfills), the carbon credit and trading scheme set to start in 2010 presents significant challenges and opportunities to municipal solid waste practitioners. Technological advances in waste management, if adopted properly, allow the municipal solid waste sector to act as carbon sink, hence earning tradable carbon credits. However, due to the complexity of the system and its inherent uncertainties, optimizing it for carbon credits may worsen its performance under other criteria. We use an integrated, stochastic multi-criteria decision-making tool that we developed earlier to analyse the carbon credit potential of Sydney municipal solid waste under eleven possible future strategies. We find that the changing legislative environment is likely to make current practices highly non-optimal and increase pressures for a change of waste management strategy. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines the dispersion from a multi-stack cement manufacturing complex with associated quarries and transport activities for regulatory compliance under uncertain emission and meteorological conditions. The concentrations of CO, NOx, SO2 and PM at sensitive receptor locations were used as indicators in comparison to World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidelines. Exceedance exposure areas were delineated under bounded uncertainties in input emission factors and meteorological parameters. Planning and management initiatives were tested to control/minimize potential exposure. Compared to the case of low emissions and actual meteorological conditions, the consideration of worst emissions coupled to worst meteorological conditions enlarged the boundaries of the exceedance exposure areas considerably. The implementation of best available technologies and enforcement of emission standards improved air quality in the region significantly and lowered the exposure at many population centers to below health standards. Uncertainty in the output of atmospheric dispersion models continues to play a significant role to be considered at the point where science is translated into political decision making. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The model incorporates power generation as well as CO2 emissions from a fleet of generating stations (hydroelectric, fossil fuel, nuclear, and wind). The model is formulated as a mixed integer program and is used to optimize an existing fleet as well as recommend new additional generating stations, carbon capture and storage, and retrofit actions to meet a CO2 reduction target and electricity demand at a minimum overall cost. The model was applied to the energy supply system operated by Ontario power generation (OPG) for the province of Ontario, Canada. In 2002, OPG operated 79 electricity generating stations; 5 are fueled with coal (with a total of 23 boilers), 1 by natural gas (4 boilers), 3 nuclear, 69 hydroelectric and 1 wind turbine generating a total of 115.8 TWh. No CO2 capture process existed at any OPG power plant; about 36.7 million tonnes of CO2 was emitted in 2002, mainly from fossil fuel power plants. Four electricity demand scenarios were considered over a span of 10 years and for each case the size of new power generation capacity with and without capture was obtained. Six supplemental electricity generating technologies have been allowed for: subcritical pulverized coal-fired (PC), PC with carbon capture (PC+CCS), integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), IGCC with carbon capture (IGCC+CCS), natural gas combined cycle (NGCC), and NGCC with carbon capture (NGCC+CCS). The optimization results showed that fuel balancing alone can contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions by only 3% and a slight, 1.6%, reduction in the cost of electricity compared to a calculated base case. It was found that a 20% CO2 reduction at current electricity demand could be achieved by implementing fuel balancing and switching 8 out of 23 coal-fired boilers to natural gas. However, as demand increases, more coal-fired boilers needed to be switched to natural gas as well as the building of new NGCC and NGCC+CCS for replacing the aging coal-fired power plants. To achieve a 40% CO2 reduction at 1.0% demand growth rate, four new plants (2 NGCC, 2 NGCC+CCS) as well as carbon capture processes needed to be built. If greater than 60% CO2 reductions are required, NGCC, NGCC+CCS, and IGCC+CCS power plants needed to be put online in addition to carbon capture processes on coal-fired power plants. The volatility of natural gas prices was found to have a significant impact on the optimal CO2 mitigation strategy and on the cost of electricity generation. Increasing the natural gas prices resulted in early aggressive CO2 mitigation strategies especially at higher growth rate demands. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Energy; Environmental engineering; Green engineering; Mathematical modeling; Optimization","Carbon capture; Carbon capture and storage; Carbon mitigation; Coal-fired power plant; Cost of electricity; Demand growth; Electricity demands; Energy planning; Energy supply system; Energy usage; Generating stations; Green engineering; Integrated gasification combined cycle; Mathematical modeling; Mitigation strategy; Mixed-integer programs; Natural gas combined cycles; Natural gas price; Ontario , Canada; Ontario power generations; Optimal structures; Overall costs; Power generating systems; Pulverized coals; Reduction targets; Retrofit actions; Significant impacts; Coal; Coal fired boilers; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal industry; Costs; Electric power generation; Electricity; Environmental engineering; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas fired boilers; Gas industry; Gas plants; Gases; Hydroelectric power plants; Integer programming; Mining; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Optimization; Retrofitting; Wind power; Electric generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72149088805

However, relative to wet deposition, less is known regarding the sources and spatial variability of dry deposition. This is in part due to difficulty in measuring dry deposition and associated deposition velocities. Passive sampling techniques offer potential for improving our understanding of the spatial distribution and sources of gaseous and aerosol N species, referred to here as dry deposition. We report dual nitrate isotopic composition (δ 15N and δ18O) in actively collected dry and wet deposition across the high-deposition region of Ohio, New York, and Pennsylvania. We also present results from initial tests to examine the efficacy of using passive nitric acid collectors as a collection medium for isotopic analysis at a site in New York. Isotopic values in actively collected dry deposition, including particulate nitrate and gaseous nitric acid, are compared with those in wet nitrate deposition and surrounding NOx emission sources. δ15N values in dry and wet fractions are highest at the westernmost sites and lowest at the easternmost sites, and stationary source NOx emissions (e.g., power plants and incinerators) appear to be the primary control on δ15N spatial variability. In contrast, δ18O values show a less consistent spatial pattern in dry deposition. Both δ15N and δ18O show strong seasonality, with higher values in winter than summer. Seasonal variations in stationary source NOx emissions appear to be the most likely explanation for seasonal variations in δ15N, whereas seasonal variations in air temperature and solar radiation indicate variable chemical oxidation pathways control δ18O patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of passive samplers for collecting the nitric acid (HNO3) component of dry deposition suitable for isotopic analysis. We observe slight differences in δ15N-HNO3 values between simultaneous samples collected actively and passively (0.6%). However, we observe a larger offset in δ18O values between actively and passively collected samples; the causes for this offset warrant further investigation. Nonetheless, passive sample collection represents a significant cost savings over active sampling techniques and could allow a more extensive understanding of patterns of dry deposition and associated insights to nitrogen sources across landscapes.

We researched and developed environmental health indicators for inputs into human health vulnerability assessments for climate change and to propose public health preventative actions. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a review of the scientific literature to identify outcomes and actions that were related to climate change. Data sources included governmental and nongovernmental agencies and the published literature. DATA EXTRACTION: Sources were identified and assessed for completeness, usability, and accuracy. Priority was then given to identifying longitudinal data sets that were applicable at the state and community level. DATA SYNTHESIS: We present a list of surveillance indicators for practitioners and policy makers that include climate-sensitive health outcomes and environmental and vulnerability indicators, as well as mitigation, adaptation, and policy indicators of climate change. CONCLUSIONS: A review of environmental health indicators for climate change shows that data exist for many of these measures, but more evaluation of their sensitivity and usefulness is needed.

Analyses of plant stable carbon isotope ratios and in vivo measurements of leaf gas exchange were used to describe the CO2 effects on water relations. For most species examined elevated [CO2] significantly increased the intrinsic water-use efficiency (A/gs) as derived from carbon isotope analyses. In some of the species, seasonal averages of the ratio between leaf internal to atmospheric CO2 (ci/ca) were found to be significantly reduced by elevated [CO2]. Periodic leaf gas exchange measurements confirmed the increased water-use efficiency, but significant CO2 effects became evident only over the entire season by carbon isotope analysis. In both types of analysis conducted, spring wheat was found to react significantly different from all other species examined. The relation between A/gs and biomass production was significantly influenced by elevated [CO2] in all three years of the study. At the end of the drier growing seasons 2003 and 2004, the soil water content tended to be increased in the CO2 enriched plots indicating a water saving effect. These observations demonstrate the impact of elevated [CO2] on plant water relations with a likely positive feedback leading to higher soil water availability. Due to the differences in the CO2 responses of spring wheat compared to the weeds we suggest that rising [CO2] may cause shifts in the species composition of crop-weed communities. © 2008 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","δ13C value; ci/ca ratio; Competition; Crop-weed interaction; FACE; Leaf gas exchange; Microclimate; Soil water content; Triticum; WUE","Triticum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349259671

These assimilates are distributed within the plant and translocated via roots into the rhizosphere and soil microorganisms. In this study, 3 year old European beech trees (Fagus sylvatica L.) were exposed after the chilling period to an enriched 13C-CO2 atmosphere (δ13C = 60‰ - 80‰) at the time point when leaves development started. Temporal dynamics of assimilated carbon distribution in different plant parts, as well as into dissolved organic carbon and microbial communities in the rhizosphere and bulk soil have been investigated for a 20 days period. Photosynthetically fixed carbon could be traced into plant tissue, dissolved organic carbon and total microbial biomass, where it was utilized by different microbial communities. Due to carbon allocation into the rhizosphere, nutrient stress decreased; exudates were preferentially used by Gram-negative bacteria and (mycorrhizal) fungi, resulting in an enhanced growth. Other microorganisms, like Gram-positive bacteria and mainly micro eucaryotes benefited from the exudates via food web development. Overall our results indicate a fast turnover of exudates and the development of initial food web structures. Additionally a transport of assimilated carbon into bulk soil by (mycrorhizal) fungi was observed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Detailed characterization of these strata in the South Pars field has shown that the reservoir properties are a function of both sedimentary and diagenetic processes at the field scale. Facies analysis of the studied units indicates that the sediments were deposited in the inner regions of a homoclinal carbonate ramp and were subsequently subjected to shallow diagenesis and minor burial. The vertical distribution of the facies shows cyclic patterns that impact reservoir quality. The rock type classes have been grouped on the basis of the dominant pore spaces, and have enabled distinct fields to be identified. This approach has demonstrated a relationship between poroperm values and rock type groups. Diagenetic overprinting has significantly affected the reservoir properties. Although the original poroperm heterogeneities in the studied reservoir are inherited from the Upper Dalan-Kangan palaeoplatform, they have been modified strongly by diagenetic overprinting. Consequently, tentative correlation may be possible between facies types and reservoir properties based on diagenetic effects. Therefore, for precise characterization of the Upper Dalan-Kangan reservoir properties it has been necessary to integrate both the depositional history and diagenetic features. © 2009 EAGE/Geological Society of London.","Carbonate reservoir heterogeneity; Dalan and Kangan Formations; Diagenesis; Khuff reservoirs; Persian Gulf; South Pars field","Carbonate reservoir heterogeneity; Dalan and Kangan Formations; Diagenesis; Khuff reservoirs; Persian Gulf; South Pars field; Gas industry; Petroleum reservoirs; Sedimentology; Carbonation; burial diagenesis; carbonate ramp; depositional environment; facies analysis; gas field; hydrocarbon reserve; hydrocarbon reservoir; reservoir characterization; vertical distribution; Arabian Sea; Indian Ocean; Persian Gulf",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350356280

Here we present the soil description and analysis for Danilo Bitinj. The site, farmed for at least 7000 years, is located at the center of Danilo Polje, a valley in Dalmatia's well-developed karst terrain. Soils both on- and off-site are fine-grained and carbonate-rich. Other measured pedologic properties indicate a stable valley-bottom environment throughout the life of the analyzed solum. The longevity of agriculture corresponds with the high measured calcite content, while electric conductivity and pH measurements indicate a sodic, plant-toxic chemical environment. Soil organic matter stable carbon isotope data indicate a local environment heavily dominated by C3 plants. Soil carbonate stable carbon and oxygen ratios were also measured, but appear to be out-of-equilibrium with those for organic carbon, and therefore invalid for paleoclimatic interpretation. According to regional paleoclimatic studies, the earliest agricultural occupation at Danilo coincided with a significant drought. This evidence for regional drought is at odds with the on-site isotope data indicating relatively cool, moist conditions. These findings present an interesting scenario in terms of human behavioral ecology: that despite the soil's sodicity, Danilo may have represented a moist and productive resource refuge. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Technologies for gasification of biomass may then play a key role given their potential for high electrical efficiency and multiple outputs; not only electricity but also bio transport fuels and district heat. The aim of this study is to assess the economic consequences and the potential for CO2 reduction of integration of a biomass gasification plant into a district-heating (DH) system. The study focuses on co-location with an existing natural gas combined cycle heat and power plant in the municipal DH system of Göteborg, Sweden. The analysis is carried out using a systems modelling approach. The so-called MARTES model is used. MARTES is a simulating, DH systems supply model with a detailed time slice division. The economic robustness of different solutions is investigated by using different sets of parameters for electricity price, fuel prices and policy tools. In this study, it is assumed that not only tradable green certificates for electricity but also tradable green certificates for transport fuels exist. The economic results show strong dependence on the technical solutions and scenario assumptions but in most cases a stand-alone SNG-polygeneration plant with district-heat delivery is the cost-optimal solution. Its profitability is strongly dependent on policy tools and the price relation between biomass and fossil fuels. Finally, the results show that operation of the biomass gasification plants reduces the (DH) system's net emissions of CO2. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty-seven surface sediment samples were collected and analyzed for total contents of Cu, Zn, Al, Fe and Mn and for chemical forms of Cu and Zn. These results reveal that the total contents of Cu and Zn in the sediment of DRS mainly ranged from 4.5 to 86.1 and 17.7 to 1340.9 mg kg-1, respectively. The enrichment factors (EFs) were generally lower than 1.0 at most sampling sites, while at T3, B5 and B7 sites of the Taizi River near Benxi, Liaoyang and Anshan cities, respectively, they were more than 2.0. The primary sources of Zn and Cu contamination at these three sites are considered to be iron mining and smelting and some chemical industries. Hence, the total contents of Cu and Zn in the sediments of the Daliao River system mainly ranged around background levels. In general, less than 2% and more than 60% of total Cu and Zn contents in the sediment at most sampling sites were associated to the exchangeable fraction and residual fraction, respectively, showing their low mobility and bioavailability. The major sink for anthropogenic Cu might be organic matter and Fe oxides, while for anthropogenic Zn it was carbonate and the easily reducible phase dominated by Mn and amorphous Fe oxides. Therefore, anthropogenic Cu and Zn have relatively high potential mobility and bioavailability. In comparison with the sediments of other rivers in China and in the world, the sediment of the DRS contained relatively low contents of Cu and Zn. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Enrichment; Fraction; Heavy metal; Sediment","Background level; Chemical forms; Chemical fractions; Copper and zinc; Enrichment; Enrichment factors; Exchangeable fraction; Fe oxide; Fraction; High potential; Low mobility; Organic matter; Primary sources; Residual fraction; River systems; Sampling site; Surface sediments; Total content; Zn content; Biochemistry; Chemical industry; Heavy metals; Manganese; Manganese compounds; Organic compounds; Reconnaissance aircraft; Rivers; Sedimentology; Sediments; Zinc; Zinc smelting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77649100019

This is the first study simultaneously focused on trophodynamics of deep-sea zooplankton and suprabenthos. Samples were collected southeast of Mallorca (Algerian Basin, Western Mediterranean), on the continental slope close to Cabrera Archipelago, at 650-780 m depths, ca. bi-monthly between August 2003 and June 2004. Mean δ13C values of suprabenthos ranged from -21.1‰ (Munnopsurus atlanticus) to -16.7‰ (Cyclaspis longicaudata). Values of δ15N ranged from 2.8‰ (Lepechinella manco) to 9.9‰ (larvae of Gnathia sp.). The stable isotope ratios of suprabenthic fauna displayed a continuum of values, confirming a wide spectrum of feeding guilds (from filter feeders/surface deposit feeders to predators). According to the available information on diets for suprabenthic species, the highest annual mean δ15N values were found for the hematophagous isopod Gnathia sp. parasite on fish (represented by Praniza larvae) and carnivorous amphipods (e.g. Rhachotropis spp., Nicippe tumida) consuming copepods, and the lowest δ15N values were found for two cumaceans (Cyclaspis longicaudata and Platysympus typicus) feeding on detritus. Assuming a 15N-enrichment factor of 2.5‰ and deposit feeders as baseline, we found three trophic levels in suprabenthic food webs. δ13C ranges were particularly wide among deposit feeders (ranging from -21.8% to -17.3‰) and omnivores (from -20.5% to -18.8‰), suggesting exploitation of particulate organic matter (POM) of different characteristics. Our isotopic analyses revealed lower ranges of δ13C and δ15N for macrozooplankton/micronekton, compared with suprabenthos. δ13C values of zooplankton taxa ranged from -21.1‰ (the hyperiid Phrosina semilunata) to -19.9‰ (the decapod Pasiphaea multidentata), while δ15N values ranged from 3.9‰ (P. semilunata) to 7.5‰ (P. multidentata). Among zooplankton, more enriched δ15N values were found among carnivores (e.g. the fish Cyclothone spp. and Pasiphaea multidentata) preying on copepods, hyperiids, euphausiids and small fish. The lowest δ15N values were found for hyperiids that feed on the mucus nets of salps (e.g. Vibilia armata). After contrasting isotope analysis with dietary data, we conclude there were two trophic levels among zooplankton/micronekton. Strong correlation between the mean annual δ15N and δ13C values was found for zooplankton (R2=0.7), but not for suprabenthos, which suggests a single source of carbon for plankton. We found a general seasonal trend for δ13C enrichment from late autumn (November) to late winter-spring (February-April) for both suprabenthos and zooplankton. The δ13C enrichment in February-April was correlated in zooplankton with higher surface chlorophyll a concentration 1 month before sampling.

This paper examines how each of these factors influences the magnitude of the $/ton estimate. We employ a reduced-form air quality model to predict changes in ambient PM2.5 resulting from an array of emission control scenarios affecting 12 different combinations of sources emitting carbonaceous particles, NOx, SOx, NH3, and volatile organic compounds. We perform this modeling for each of nine urban areas and one nationwide area. Upon modeling the air quality change, we then divide the total monetized health benefits by the PM2.5 precursor emission reductions to generate $/ton metrics. The resulting $/ton estimates exhibit the greatest variability across certain precursors and sources such as area source SOx, point source SOx, and mobile source NH3. Certain $/ton estimates, including mobile source NOx, exhibit significant variability across urban areas. Reductions in carbonaceous particles generate the largest $/ton across all locations. © The Author(s) 2009.","$/ton; Air pollution; Area sources; Benefit per ton; BenMAP; CMAQ; Electrical generating units; Emission type; Health benefits; Industrial point sources; Mobile sources; PM2.5; Population exposure; Precursor; RSM; SOx, NOx, NH3, VOC, carbonaceous particles; Source; Spatial heterogeneity","air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; emission control; health impact; heterogeneity; particulate matter; pollutant source; spatial analysis; urban area; volatile organic compound",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449095174

The results obtained through a three years experimental activity on a pilot-scale BAF plant fed with real wastewater showed high process efficiencies and stable performance for both carbon and ammonia oxidation. The effluent quality met, on average basis, 68 mg/L total COD (CODtot), 37 mg/L Total Suspended Solids (TSS), 3.3 mg/L ammonia-nitrogen (NH4+-N) and 21.1 mg/L nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N). Despite the good performance, the high content of suspended solids in the influent stream caused filter bed clogging and frequent backwashing operations were required. Therefore, in the last part of the experimental activity a pre-treatment step was adopted prior to the biological step, consisting of chemical precipitation by lime addition. The influent quality parameters were consequently modified; for instance the particulate matter content was reduced by about 73%. The process efficiency of both ammonia and organic carbon oxidation did not modify appreciably; however, a beneficial effect was obtained on the frequency of the backwashing phase, which could be reduced by half. Since the new combined chemical-biological system demonstrated to be a valid alternative to the activated sludge treatment plant, a modeling activity was finally performed with the aim of evaluating the design parameters of a full-scale BAF plant fed with the same pre-treated wastewater as used in the experimental activity.

This paper addresses the reduction of harvester ground speed from a standard 8 km/hr (5 mph) to 4 km/hr (2.5 mph) as a possible mitigation measure for reducing PM10 emissions. Ambient total suspended particulate (TSP) and PM10 sampling was conducted during harvest with alternating control (8 km/hr [5 mph]) and experimental (4 km/hr [2.5 mph]) treatments. On-site meteorological data were used in conjunction with both Industrial Source Complex-Short Term version 3 (ISCST3) and the American Meteorological Society/U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) dispersion models to backcalculate emission rates from the measured concentrations. Baseline annual emission factors for nut pickup of 381 ± 122 and 361± 123 kg PM10/km2·yr were determined using ISCST3 and AERMOD, respectively. Both of these values are substantially lower than the current PM10 emission factor for almond pickup of 4120 kg PM10/ km2·yr. The particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) emission factors for nut pickup developed from this study were 25 ± 8 kg PM 2.5/km2·yr and 24 ± 8 kg PM 10/km2·yr were determined using ISCST3 and AERMOD, respectively. Reducing harvester speed resulted in an emissions reduction of 42% for TSP, but no differences were detected in emissions of PM10 and PM2.5. Differences detected in the emission factors developed using ISCST3 and AERMOD were not statistically significant, indicating that almond harvest emission factors previously developed using ISCST3 may be applied appropriately in AERMOD.",,"Aerodynamics; Atmospheric movements; Emission control; Environmental Protection Agency; Harvesters; Harvesting; Meteorology; Particles (particulate matter); Pickups; Aerodynamic diameters; American meteorological societies; Emissions reduction; Industrial source complex short terms; Meteorological data; Mitigation measures; Particulate matter emissions; Total suspended particulates; Particulate emissions; air sampler; almond; article; exhaust gas; harvesting; harvesting machine; machine; meteorology; model; particulate matter; priority journal; regression analysis; suspended particulate matter; velocity; agriculture; air pollution; chemistry; environmental monitoring; particle size; particulate matter; Prunus; theoretical model; United States; Prunus dulcis; Agriculture; Air Pollution; California; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Theoretical; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Prunus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350501193

Escobedo, J. Chem. Phys. 108 (1998) 8761]. The technique involves a sequential implementation of the isobaric-isothermal and canonical ensembles in a simulation box, in which the (residual) thermodynamic derivative properties are evaluated via the fluctuation method during configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulation. We specifically tested our Monte Carlo theory to compute the velocity of sound in a number of (linear) alkane fluids (methane, n-butane, n-heptane, and n-decane). In the case of methane, we employed a united atom Lennard-Jones potential [D. Möller, J. Oprzynski, A. Möller, J. Fischer, Mol. Phys. 75 (1992) 363]. We present an analysis of the bulk pair correlation function for methane near its critical temperature, which potentially reveals structural differences to explain the extrema phenomena in heat capacities as well as sound velocity differences at such corresponding extrema states. In the case of n-butane, n-heptane, and n-decane, we used an optimized anisotropic united atom intermolecular Lennard-Jones description of Ungerer et al. [P. Ungerer, C. Beauvais, J. Delhommelle, A. Boutin, B. Rousseau, A.H. Fuchs, J. Chem. Phys. 112 (2000) 5499] along with the intramolecular parameters of Nieto-Draghi and Ungerer [C. Nieto-Draghi, P. Ungerer, J. Chem. Phys. 125 (2006) 044517]. We provided extensive comparison with the experimental data in the temperature range between 273.15 and 432.15 K and pressures up to 50 MPa. In excellent agreement with the experiment, we find the Monte Carlo technique to be capable of predicting the velocity of sound in the fluids studied in the present analysis, with improved accuracy in higher pressures at which the validity of the fluctuation theory has been established. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The first valorisation of this natural resource was hunting and gathering activities, followed by and later associated with swidden cultivation of upland rice. The industrial revolution in Europe and North America in the 1950s created increasing demand for rubber. Answering this new market opportunity, farmers introduced rubber seedlings in their swiddens amidst the upland rice. By doing so, they invented a new cropping system, i.e. rubber agroforests. Thanks to the continuously increasing demand for rubber by the developing industry, rubber agroforests spread over Sumatra's eastern peneplains until the 1990s. Forest conversion to rubber agroforests conserves a high level of forest biodiversity and the agroforests act as a buffer zone around national parks. But with growing demographic pressure, market integration and household monetary needs, agroforests are increasingly endangered. New cropping systems have appeared and challenge agroforests' dominance in the landscape. Since the mid-twentieth century, rubber monospecific plantations have been competing for land, with an undoubtedly higher profitability than agroforests. More recently, oil palm plantations have spread over the island, quickly becoming the new challenger to rubber agroforestry. Nevertheless, the international community shows more and more interest in forest and biodiversity conservation. Forest cover in Jambi province has nearly disappeared over the past 30 years. The only way to save the remnants of forests and agroforests seems to be the creation of market incentives through conservation programs such as reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation. © 2009 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Deforestation; Landscape dynamics; Market incentives; Natural rubber; Oil palm","agroforestry; alternative agriculture; cropping practice; deforestation; forest cover; incentive; landscape; nature conservation; nineteenth century; rubber; shifting cultivation; sustainable forestry; Greater Sunda Islands; Sumatra; Sunda Isles; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73449094537

Identifying strategies to mitigate atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions on the national level are therefore critical. Fossil fuel combustion is primarily responsible for the perturbation of the global carbon cycle, although the influence of humans extends far beyond the combustion of fossil fuels. Changes in land use arising from human activities contribute substantially to atmospheric carbon dioxide; however, land use changes can act as a carbon dioxide sink as well. A soil carbon model was built using STELLA to explore how soil organic carbon sequestration (SOC) varies over a range of values for key parameters and to estimate the amount of global soil carbon sequestration from livestock waste. To obtain soil carbon sequestration estimates, model simulations occurred for 11 different livestock types and with data for eight regions around the world. The model predicted that between 1980 and 1995, United States soils were responsible for the sequestration of 444-602 Tg C from livestock waste. Model simulations further predicted that during the same period, global soil carbon sequestration from livestock waste was 2,810-4,218 Tg C. Our estimates for global SOC sequestration are modest in proportion to other terrestrial carbon sinks (i.e. forest regrowth); however, livestock waste does represent a potential for long-term soil carbon gain. SOC generated from livestock waste is another example of how human activities and land use changes are altering soil processes around the world. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon sink; Climate change; Global carbon cycle; Livestock manure; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil organic carbon","carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; combustion; fossil fuel; global climate; greenhouse effect; human activity; land use change; livestock farming; mitigation; soil carbon; soil organic matter; waste; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67651219172

This paper uses the IPAT model (where I = Impact representing CO2 emissions, P = Population, A = Affluence, and T = emission intensity) to analyze how these main drivers contributed to the growth of CO2 emissions over this time period. Affluence or lifestyle change has been variously recognized as one of the key factors contributing to CO2 emissions. Through comparative analysis of the development of five regions in China, we trace lifestyle changes since the foundation of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949 until 2002. We find that household consumption across the five regions follows similar trajectories, driven by changes in income and the increasing availability of goods and services, although significant differences still exist between and within regions due to differential policies in China and different possibilities for social mobility. There are considerable differences between the southeast and northwest and between urban and rural areas. We also found that technological improvements have not been able to fully compensate for the increase of emissions due to population growth and increasing wealth, which is also in line with results from other studies. Finally, this paper emphasizes that developing countries such as China, which is home to 22% of the world population and a growing middle class, and which is on a fast track to modernization, need to ensure that people's lifestyles are changing towards more sustainable ways of living. China has been investing heavily in infrastructure and thus creating the emissions of tomorrow. Thus investing, for example, in public transport and low energy building today will help reduce emissions in the future and will support more sustainable lifestyles. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Productive use of bioenergy is an important strategy for rural households to improve not only their income, but also their health, living environment and so on. In Tibet of China, which is rich in cattle dung and firewood as the major energy sources for rural households, the efficiency of energy utilization is just about 10%. In order to improve energy utilization efficiency and the living conditions for rural residents, the Tibet Autonomous Region government introduced residential biogas model (RBM) to local households, which was a comprehensive utilization system of energy integrated with residential biogas digester, vegetable greenhouse and livestock shed. This paper aims to show the productive use of the bioenergy by the RBM, which could be depicted as the feasibility and the benefits on economic, eco-environmental and social aspects of biogas utilization, based on household questionnaires in Panam County. In RBM, biogas digester works as the biomass material supplement loop to transform originally biomass flow from single-direction to recycling-direction. The results indicate that the output of unit biogas digester could replace 1.44 t of firewood, 1.65 t of agricultural residues and 1.75 t of cattle dung, respectively. The net incremental benefit of RBM could reach 5550.72 Yuan in 15 years. The reduced amount of CO2 emission when substituted by biogas in other agricultural areas and the areas of semi-agricultural and semi-husbandry in Tibet could be (76.66-79.89) × 104 t/year and the capability for nitrogen storage could achieve (0.39-0.99) × 104 t/year. The amount of cattle dung replaced by biogas could reach 78.29 × 104 t/year; this means that the saved cattle dung, 3.51 t/hm2, could be reallocated back to cultivated land to improve the soil fertility and to keep the balance of nutrient elements in cultivated land. Biogas utilization reduces the labor opportunity costs of women compared to use of traditional bioenergy sources.

Roofs constructed above the canopy of grass stands and gravity irrigation systems simulated three climate scenarios: (1) rainfall reduced by 50%, (2) rainfall enhanced by 50%, and (3) the full natural rainfall of the current growing season. Experimentally reduced amounts of precipitation significantly affected both yearly root increments and total root dry mass in the highland grassland. Dry conditions in 2007 resulted in considerable reduction of total belowground dry mass in highland and mountain grasslands.

To address this critical gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of published data (&gt; 1300 datapoints) to compare belowground plant, microbial and faunal biomass across seven of the major biomes on Earth. We also assembled data to assess biome-level patterns in belowground microbial community composition. Our analysis suggests that variation in microbial biomass is predictable across biomes, with microbial biomass carbon representing 0.6-1.1% of soil organic carbon (r2 = 0.91) and 1-20% of total plant biomass carbon (r2 = 0.42). Approximately 50% of total animal biomass can be found belowground and soil faunal biomass represents &lt; 4% of microbial biomass across all biomes. The structure of belowground microbial communities is also predictable: bacterial community composition and fungal : bacterial gene ratios can be predicted reasonably well from soil pH and soil C : N ratios respectively. Together these results identify robust patterns in the structure of belowground microbial and faunal communities at broad scales which may be explained by universal mechanisms that regulate belowground biota across biomes. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","16S rRNA; Acari; Collembola; Nematodes; Soil bacteria; Soil faunal biomass; Soil food webs; Soil fungi; Soil microbial biomass","carbon; nitrogen; belowground biomass; biome; community structure; food web; fungus; microbial community; nematode; RNA; soil fauna; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; animal; bacterium; biomass; ecosystem; genetics; growth, development and aging; microbiology; plant; review; Animals; Bacteria; Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Plants; Soil Microbiology; Acari; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Collembola; Fungi; Nematoda",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350074600

A new report ""The State of the Forests of Papua New Guinea"" claims that rates of DFD in PNG are much higher than have previously reported. It suggests more than half of PNG's remaining forests will have disappeared or be damaged beyond recovery by 2021. We argue that this claim is incorrect. The report overestimates the area of intact primary forest in 1972 and the impact of traditional land use practices on forest cover. Much of what the RSLUP report considers as deforestation is part of a cycle of traditional clearance for farming, fallow and regrowth that has been occurring for hundreds of years. The assumption that areas impacted by harvesting or shifting cultivation will inevitably degrade and become non-forest is also not supported by observation of cutover forest in PNG. A considerable proportion of cutover forest areas will recover carbon stocks after harvesting. It is argued that traditional land use practices and forest recovery processes need to be considered in assessing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and degradation in countries with complex land use histories such as PNG. © 2009 INRA EDP Sciences.","Carbon; Forest dynamics; Rainforest; Remote sensing","deforestation; emission control; forest clearance; forest cover; forest dynamics; greenhouse gas; land use; rainforest; regrowth; remote sensing; shifting cultivation; Melanesia; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; Papua New Guinea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71049121857

They sell a quarter of the nation's electricity, yet the carbon impact of these sales is not well understood, due to their small size, unique ownership models, and high percentage of purchased power for distribution. This paper situates consumer-owned utilities in the context of emerging U.S. climate policy, quantifying for the first time the state-by-state carbon impact of electricity sales by consumer-owned utilities. We estimate that total retail sales by consumer-owned utilities account for roughly 568 million metric tons of CO2 annually, making this sector the 7th largest CO2 emitter globally, and examine state-level carbon intensities of the sector in light of the current policy environment and the share of COU distribution in the states.

The amount of carbon that can be claimed by an individual landowner will ultimately depend on multiple factors, including the productivity of the forest, the management history of the stand, and the program in which the landowner is participating. This project presents a modeling framework for forest carbon accounting which is driven by forest yield curves and carbon pool partitioning. Within this model the amount of creditable carbon generated from adjusting the rotation age of multiple forest stands can be estimated for 46 distinct North American forest types. The model also provides a comparison of total creditable carbon generated under three carbon accounting methodologies: the Department of Energy 1605b Registry, the Chicago Climate Exchange, and the Voluntary Carbon Standard. In our evaluation of a 5-year rotation extension across 102 unique modeling scenarios, we find large differences among the carbon accounting schemes. This has implications for both forest landowners and policymakers alike. In particular, methodologies to account for such issues as leakage, permanence, additionality, and baseline establishment, while potentially increasing the overall legitimacy of any forest carbon offset program, can reduce creditable carbon to the forest owner (by up to 70%). Regardless of the protocol used, we also note strong regional differences, with Pacific Northwest forests of fir, spruce, hemlock, alder and maple being the most effective at sequestering carbon on a per area basis.","Carbon market; Carbon sequestration; Forest carbon; Forest management; Offset","Carbon accounting; Carbon markets; Carbon pool; Carbon sequestration; Chicago; Department of Energy; Financial incentives; Forest landowners; Forest management; Forest owners; Forest stand; Modeling frameworks; Multiple factors; North American; Pacific Northwest; Policy makers; Sequestering carbon; Yield curve; Rotation; Forestry; carbon sequestration; forest management; incentive; landowner; policy making; Carbon; Chelation; Forest Management; Forestry; Rotation; North America; Abies; Acer; Alnus; Conium; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449718706

The high sensitivity of the detection method was further improved by using two cantilever sensors on the opposite walls of the photoacoustic cell in order to suppress noise. Methane (CH4) gas was used to demonstrate the sensitivity of the method yielding a detection limit of 0.5 ppm with 5 s sample integration time employing an optical filter with a center wavenumber 2950 cm-1. The achieved result is very good with a low power infrared source and enables the utilization of the benefits of such a source: low price and power consumption, easily controlled and simple electrical modulation of the radiation intensity and absence of the mechanical chopper and its noise. The structure of the source enables a relatively high pulse rate to be used as the modulating frequency.

Roadlink-based emission models are developed using modal fuel use and emission rates applied to facility-and speed-specific driving cycles. For an urban case study, passenger cars were found to be the largest sources of HC, CO, and CO2 emissions, whereas trucks contributed the largest share of NOx emissions. When alternative fuel and propulsion technologies were introduced in the fleet at a modest market penetration level of 27%, their emission reductions were found to be 3-14%. Emissions for all pollutants generally decreased with an increase in the market share of alternative vehicle technologies. Turnover of the light duty fleet to newer Tier 2 vehicles reduced emissions of HC, CO, and NOx substantially.

Fuel-use rates are estimated based on electronic control unit (ECU) data for truck engines and measurements for APU engines. Engine emission factors were measured using a portable emission measurement system. Indirect emissions from SP were based on average utility grid emission factors. Base engine fuel use and APU and SP electrical load were analyzed for 20 trucks monitored for more than 1 yr during 2.76 million mi of activity within 42 U.S. states. The average base engine fuel use varied from 0.46 to 0.65 gal/hr. The average APU fuel use varied from 0.24 to 0.41 gal/hr. Fuel-use rates are typically lowest in mild weather, highest in hot or cold weather, and depend on engine speed (revolutions per minute [RPM]). Compared with the base engine, APU fuel use and emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are lower by 36-47%. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions are lower by 80-90%. Reductions in particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbon emissions vary from approximately 10 to over 50%. SP leads to more substantial reductions, except for SO2. The actual achievable reductions will be lower because only a fraction of base engine usage will be replaced by APUs, SP, or both. Recommendations are made for reducing base engine fuel use and emissions, accounting for variability in fuel use and emissions reductions, and further work to quantify real-world avoided fuel use and emissions.

We examined the long-term effects of the 1995 repeal of federal speed limit controls on road fatalities and injuries in fatal crashes. Methods. We used a Poisson mixed-regression model to assess changes in the number of fatalities and injuries in fatal crashes between 1995 and 2005 on rural interstates, where all US states have raised speed limits since the repeal, as well as on urban interstates and noninterstate roads, where many states have raised speed limits. Results. We found a 3.2% increase in road fatalities attributable to the raised speed limits on all road types in the United States. The highest increases were on rural interstates (9.1%) and urban interstates (4.0%). We estimated that 12545 deaths (95% confidence interval [CI]=8739, 16352) and 36583 injuries in fatal crashes (95% CI=29322, 43844) were attributable to increases in speed limits across the United States.

Reduced speed limits and improved enforcement with speed camera networks could immediately reduce speeds and save lives, in addition to reducing gas consumption, cutting emissions of air pollutants, saving valuable years of productivity, and reducing the cost of motor vehicle crashes.",,"article; health care policy; health care system; mortality; rural area; traffic accident; traffic safety; United States; urban area; Accidents, Traffic; Automobile Driving; Government Regulation; Humans; Program Evaluation; Public Policy; Survival Rate; Transportation; United States; Wounds and Injuries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69049109866

Of interest was to understand how bacteria are partitioned between groundwater and BIOS and to determined whether such spatial separation within the same environment confers niche-specific selectivity. The distribution of the methane-oxidizing and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) was examined closely because the former are important for redox maintenance in this predominantly anaerobic environment. The SRB are ecologically important in organic carbon mineralization representing the most abundant and diverse metabolic group in the aquifers. The corrosive hydrogen sulphide they produce poses a threat to the integrity of the copper canisters that will store spent nuclear waste deposited in these aquifers. Widespread deposits of BIOS occur at microaerophilic interfaces where anaerobic ground water inter-acts with oxygen. Applying molecular techniques, BIOS deposited along microaerophilic zones in the aquifers was found to select for bacterial phylotypes normally not predominant in groundwater. More than 70% of the SRB occurred in association with the BIOS-richzones. The native SRB wide spread in the aquifers poorly colonized environments associated with BIOS. As much as 50% of the total bacterial counts present in the BIOS communities could be identified as type I methanotrophs predominated by filamentous forms. In addition to biogeochemical factors such as salinity and depth, this study suggests that BIOS environments may constitute a distinct niche with unique properties that enrich for microor-ganisms different from those commonly reported in the non-BIOS aquifers. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Clonothrix; Creothrix; FISH; Granite aquifers; Groundwater; Iron oxides; Methanotrophs; Salinity; Sulphate reduction","aquifer; bacterium; biogeochemistry; community structure; iron oxide; microbial community; microorganism; spatial distribution; Bacteria (microorganisms); Methylococcaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349843303

This paper focuses on energy use and energy recovery in waste management and outlines how these aspects should be addressed consistently in a GHG perspective. Essential GHG emission data for the most common fuels, electricity and heat are provided. Average data on electricity provision show large variations from country to country due to different fuels being used and different efficiencies for electricity production in the individual countries (0.007-1.13 kg CO 2-eq. kWh-1). Marginal data on electricity provision show even larger variations (0.004-3 kg CO2-eq. kWh-1). Somewhat less variation in GHG emissions is being found for heat production (0.01-0.69 kg CO2-eq. kWh-1). The paper further addresses allocation principles and the importance of applying either average or marginal energy data, and it discusses the consequences of introducing reduction targets on CO2 emissions.

Design/methodology/approach – A case study of how COP14 and a European union (EU) summit on climate change are covered by three Middle Eastern and one Danish newspaper. Findings – The paper shows significant regional differences in the media coverage of climate change both in terms of quantity (numbers of news articles) and quality (editorial variations, sources, framing, use of graphics). Overall, the study suggests that regional differences in climate change coverage can be traced back to the financial resources, institutional practices and journalistic fields of different regional media systems. Research limitations/implications – The paper is a pilot project designed to test the analytical significance of regional variations in international media coverage of climate change. Originality/value – Whereas global variations in climate change coverage have mostly been documented by (quantitative) content analysis, less research has been devoted to qualitative differences on how the media approach and frame climate change. Numerical analysis only tells half the story as qualitative differences, such as editorial priorities, or journalistic practices, can either increase or decrease the significance of quantitative variations. By acknowledging the importance of regional differences in international news reporting, this paper emphasises the role and function of regional media systems in conditioning media coverage of climate change. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Climatology; Denmark; Global warming; Information media; Middle East; Newspapers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993054392

Using a 3-D physical-biogeochemical model, we simulate the partial pressure of CO 2 in surface water (pCO2sea) and air-sea CO2 flux in the tropical and subtropical regions from 1990 to 2004. The model reproduces well the observed spatial differences in physical and biogeochemical processes, such as: (1) relatively higher sea surface temperature (SST), and lower dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and pCO2sea in the western than in the central tropical-subtropical Pacific, and (2) predominantly seasonal and interannual variations in the subtropical and tropical Pacific, respectively. Our model results suggest a non-negligible contribution of the wind variability to that of the air-sea CO2 flux in the central tropical Pacific, but the modeled contribution of 7% is much less than that from a previous modeling study (30%; McKinley et al., 2004). While DIC increases in the entire region SST increases in the subtropical and western tropical Pacific but decreases in the central tropical Pacific from 1990 to 2004. As a result, the interannual pCO2sea variability is different in different regions. The pCO2sea temporal variation is found to be primarily controlled by SST and DIC, although the role of salinity and total alkalinity, both of which also control pCO2sea, need to be elucidated by long-term observations and eddy-permitting models for better estimation of the interannual variability of air-sea CO2 flux. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon cycling; Physical-biogeochemical model; Tropical-subtropical Pacific","air-sea interaction; alkalinity; annual variation; biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; dissolved inorganic carbon; partial pressure; sea surface salinity; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; subtropical region; surface water; tropical region; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Central); Pacific Ocean (Subtropical); Pacific Ocean (Tropical); Pacific Ocean (West)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70949105244

In addition to the development of crop processing technologies, cultivation processes in a cropping system could be modified to meet the emerging needs, along with the conventional needs in food supply. This study provides a decision tool for modifications in cultivation of crops based on life cycle assessment. Sugarcane cultivation in Taiwan is chosen as a case study to present such a decision tool, because it is an important potential indigenous resource for energy (for example, bio-ethanol) and materials (for example, bio-plastics). First, this study presents the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the production of 1 ton of sugarcane in Taiwan, which makes it possible to understand how it is consistent to develop this bio-resource in terms of both objectives: i.e., resource security and reduction of global warming impact. Next, sensitivity of the parameters in cropping systems, such as amount of irrigation, fertilization and tillage are assessed from a viewpoint of GHG emissions, using the LCI model constructed in the first step. Finally, equivalent impact level (EIL) lines are presented for some important parameters in the cropping system to support considerations in modification of agricultural methods. Because the objective is to discuss parameters in cultivation processes, the scope of study is limited to cradle-to-gate of raw sugarcane transported to the cane processing plant. Materials and methods: In addition to GHG emissions from cultivation processes, such as soil preparation, growing, harvesting and transportation, auxiliary processes such as agrochemicals production, power generation and fossil diesel fuel refining was accounted for. To quantify the nitrous oxide emission from the soil ecosystem, a denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model was used with the localized data obtained in this study. EIL lines were developed aiming at supporting decisions about modifying agricultural methods that should be made considering consequential changes in environmental impacts. For example, if the envisioned improvement in yield as a result of modification of parameters such as irrigation, tillage and fertilization is likely to achieve a value above the EIL line, GHG emission per ton of sugarcane would be decreased. An iterative procedure is applied to draw nonlinear EIL lines using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 3 method for nitrous oxide emission from soil. Results: A 3 year crop cycle was assumed, and the net GHG emissions associated with the sugarcane produced was -280 kg-CO2-equiv. per ton of raw sugarcane. The emission of nitrous oxide from soil during cultivation accounted for 50.4% of the total emissions. One-at-a-time sensitivity analysis indicates that this result is most sensitive to yield and amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied, which are correlated to each other. The EIL lines were drawn for yield over five parameters in cultivation including amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied with respect to GHG emission. For example, if an additional 5% of nitrogen fertilizer application realizes enhancement of yield by 5 tons per hectare, such modification simultaneously reduces total GHGs associated with sugarcane production. Discussion: The EIL lines drawn with respect to various environmental impacts aims to provide a simple-to-use guidance in reconsideration of agricultural options. The cradle-to-gate LCA of sugarcane provides information useful in development of bioethanol and bioplastics derived from sucrose in the cane juice. In doing so, it must be noted, if extension of farm area is among the options to be assessed, that release of the carbon stock from the original state of use should be accounted for in addition to the result presented in this study. Absorbed CO2 should be quantified separately based on the content of the sugarcane, which could be varied for different cultivars. Conclusions: This study presents a decision tool to allow introduction of an environmental life cycle perspective in modification of cultivation methods, which has already been undergoing as driven by economic reasons. The data and inventory method presented in this study can be applied for varied end products derived from sugarcane. The algorithm to develop an EIL line for correlated parameters in the inventory model was presented. Recommendations and perspectives: Results from this study require appropriate modification if they are to be used for studies for other regions. Such modifications would be straightforward, because all inventory data and assumptions are presented in this paper. Essentially, the functional unit used in this study is unit amount (by weight) of sugarcane. If some specific content (for example, sucrose or cellulose) is important in a study which attempts to use results from this study, variations in the content over cultivation methods and cultivar of sugarcane must be investigated further. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Carbon dioxide; Denitrification-decomposition model (DNDC model); Equivalent impact level line (EIL line); Fertilization; Greenhouse gases; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); Irrigation; Nitrous oxide; Sensitivity analysis; Sugarcane","agricultural chemical; nitrogen; article; controlled study; crop management; crop production; cropping system; decision support system; decomposition; denitrification; environmental protection; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; harvesting; irrigation (agriculture); life cycle assessment; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; sugarcane; Taiwan; tillage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350596108

These changes have meant significant impacts for physical, natural and human systems in Canada's North. Climate models suggest that such trends will continue into the future, and therefore shifts in Arctic systems are expected for some time to come. This introductory paper is the first in a series published in two issues of Ambio presenting work conducted for northern chapters of two recent Canadian national climate science assessment initiatives, From Impacts to Adaptation: Canada in a Changing Climate 2007 and Human Health in a Changing Climate: A Canadian Assessment of Vulnerabilities and Adaptive Capacity. Collectively, these assessments involved the work of 24 scientists with expertise in a variety of disciplines and regions in the Canadian North. These assessment processes adopted aspects of a vulnerability approach to climate assessment, primarily through a review of existing and projected exposures and elements of adaptive capacity based on existing literature. In so doing, they have contributed towards a more comprehensive understanding of climate impacts and adaptations across the northern regions of the country.

Previous studies on metal bioaccumulation have shown that total metal concentrations are not a good predictor of bioavailability in the dispersion plumes of municipal effluents. The objective of this study was to determine the solid phase speciation of metals in surface waters receiving urban and mining effluents in order to assess their fate and relative mobility in the receiving environment. Suspended particulate matter was sampled using sediment traps at several sites downstream of effluent outfall plumes as well as at reference upstream sites. Particulate metal in operationally defined fractions-exchangeable/carbonates, reducible, oxidisable and residual-were determined in suspended particulate matter with a series of selective chemical extractions. Metal enrichment in suspended particles was generally observed in both mining and urban effluent discharges. When compared to its receiving environment, the mining effluent appeared to release more particulate metals (Cu, Fe, Zn) in the most reactive fractions (i.e. exchangeable/carbonates + reducible forms, 23-43%), while other released metals, such as Cd and Mn, were predominantly in the least reactive forms (i.e., oxidisable + residual, 73-97%). In contrast, the reactivity of all particulate metals, with the exception of Mn, from the urban effluent was much higher, with up to 65, 42, 30 and 43% for Cd, Cu, Fe and Zn, respectively, in the two most reactive fractions. As expected in effluent dispersion plumes, parameters such as the organic carbon, Fe oxide and carbonate contents have specific effects on the partitioning of several trace metals, particularly Cd, Cu and Zn. Our results indicated that the relative distributions of metals among geochemical fractions varied in the effluent receiving waters where organic carbon and Fe oxides appeared as the most important parameters. This could therefore decrease the exposure for aquatic organisms that are exposed to those contaminated sediments as well as the risk to human health. © 2008 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.","Association; Bioavailability; Effluent; Extraction; Metal; Sediment; Wastewater","metal; bioavailability; comparative study; effluent; element mobility; environmental fate; environmental impact; extraction method; metal; mining; speciation (chemistry); surface water; suspended particulate matter; wastewater; article; Canada; chemistry; comparative study; environmental monitoring; industrial waste; mining; particulate matter; sediment; water pollutant; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Industrial Waste; Metals; Mining; Particulate Matter; Quebec; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71249111598

Twenty-three AM fungal species representing six genera (Acaulospora, Entrophospora, Glomus, Pacispora, Paraglomus, and Scutellospora) were detected and species richness varied from 5.3 ± 0.8 to 10.5 ± 2.5 per site. Some AM fungal species were restricted to one vegetation type and Glomus mosseae, Glomus intraradices, and Scutellospora calospora were detected in all three vegetation types. Glomus species were found to be the most frequent and abundant in all three vegetation types. Acaulospora occurred mostly in the alpine steppe and alpine meadow. Scutellospora occurred mostly in montane scrub grassland. At the species level, Glomus mosseae was dominant in the montane scrub, Acaulospora laevis and Pacispora scintillans were dominant in the alpine steppe, and Acaulospora laevis, Pacispora scintillans, and Glomus claroideum dominated the alpine meadow. It was evident from the distribution pattern of AM fungi in the different vegetation types that the abundance and diversity of AM fungal species were lowest in the montane scrub grassland than the other two plant communities.

The conversion of ploughed cropland to zero-tillage is discussed as an option to reduce CO2 emissions and promises at the same time effective soil and water conservation. Based on the upscaling of simulation results with the soil and land resources information system SLISYS-BW, estimations of CO2-mitigation rates in relation to crop rotations and soil type have been made for the state of Baden-Württemberg (Germany). The results indicate considerable differences in the CO2-mitigation rates between crop rotations ranging from 0.48 to 0.03 Mg C ha-1 a-1 for winter cereals-spring cereals-rape rotations and winter cereals-spring cereals-corn silage rotations, respectively. The efficiency of the crop rotations is strongly related to the total carbon input and in particular the amount of crop residues. Among the considered soil types, highest CO2-mitigation rates are associated with Cumulic Anthrosols (0.62 Mg C ha-1 a-1) and the lowest with Gleysols (-0.01 Mg C ha-1 a-1). An agricultural extensification scenario with conventional plowing but conversion of the presently applied intensive crop rotations to a clover-clover-winter cereals rotation indicated a CO2-mitigation potential of 466 Gg C a-1. However, the present high market prices for cereals and increasing demand for energy production from biomass encourages an intensification of the agricultural production and an excessive removal of biomass which in future will seriously reduce the potential for carbon sequestration on cropland. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using climate projections from an ensemble of 16 models, we conducted an assessment of a midcontinental area of North America (Minnesota) based on a resistance, resilience, and facilitation framework. We assessed likely impacts and proposed options for eight landscape regions within the planning area. Climate change projections suggest that by 2069, average annual temperatures will increase 3 °C with a slight increase in precipitation (6%). Analogous climate locales currently prevail 400-500 km SSW. Although the effects of climate change may be resisted through intensive management of invasive species, herbivores, and disturbance regimes, conservation practices need to shift to facilitation and resilience. Key resilience actions include providing buffers for small reserves, expanding reserves that lack adequate environmental heterogeneity, prioritizing protection of likely climate refuges, and managing forests for multi-species and multi-aged stands. Modifying restoration practices to rely on seeding (not plants), enlarge seed zones, and include common species from nearby southerly or drier locales is a logical low-risk facilitation strategy. Monitoring ""trailing edge"" populations of rare species should be a high conservation priority to support decision-making related to assisted colonization. Ecological assessments that consider resistance, resilience, and facilitation actions during scenario planning is a productive first step towards effective climate change planning for biodiversity with broad applicability to many regions of the world. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to its being the location of one of the world's largest and most acidic mining pit lakes, Butte is host to over 16,000 km of flooded underground mine workings. Of the more than 60 mine shafts that have historically operated in Butte, approximately one dozen are presently accessible for groundwater sampling. The geochemistry of the mine shaft waters is zoned and roughly coincides with a district-wide zonation in hydrothermal alteration and mineralization. Mine waters in the so-called ""Central zone"" of intense phyllic and advanced argillic alteration have lower pH and very high concentrations of As, Fe, Mn, and Zn, but very low concentrations of dissolved Cu. The scarcity of Cu is attributed to cementation onto scrap iron left in the mines, and/or to replacement of preexisting sulfide minerals below the water table in a manner analogous to supergene enrichment processes. At the other extreme, mine waters in the ""Peripheral zone"" of weakest alteration have near-neutral pH, low metal concentrations, and contain dissolved sulfide (H2S, HS-). These waters are close to equilibrium with calcite, siderite, crystalline or amorphous MnCO3, and mackinawite (poorly crystalline FeS). A suite of deep groundwater monitoring wells completed in fractured and mineralized Butte Quartz Monzonite, unassociated with the mining complex, shows a similar range in groundwater chemistries to the mine shaft waters, suggesting a fundamental control of bedrock geology on water quality. Based on its isotopic composition, aqueous sulfate in the Butte mine waters was sourced from a combination of pyrite oxidation and leaching of hydrothermal anhydrite associated with early, porphyry-style Cu-Mo mineralization. Aqueous sulfide in the Peripheral zone mine workings is 28 to 50 per mil depleted in 34S relative to coexisting aqueous sulfate, consistent with microbial sulfate reduction. Dissolved inorganic carbon in the majority of the waters sampled appears to have isotopically equilibrated at low temperature with hydrothermal rhodochrosite, an abundant mineral at Butte. Waters with the highest H2S concentrations also have unusually high dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations that are depleted in 13C, consistent with an influx of CO2 from microbial oxidation of organic carbon. The source of organic carbon is not known, but may include timbers used to reinforce the tunnels and stopes. In contrast to the large horizontal gradients in mine water chemistry on a district scale, vertical gradients in chemistry and temperature within each individual shaft at Butte are negligible, possibly due to vertical water circulation.

The Kelley mine has an anomalously warm temperature (̃35°C), and some of the excess heat in this mine shaft may have come from pyrite oxidation, a highly exothermic reaction.

Almost all of the primary magnesium in China is produced using the Pidgeon process invented in the 1940s in Canada. The environmental problems of the primary magnesium production with the Pidgeon process have already attracted much attention of the local government and enterprises. The main purposes of this research are to investigate the environmental impacts of magnesium production and to determine the accumulative environmental performances of three different scenarios. System boundary included the cradle-to-gate life cycle of magnesium production, including dolomite ore extraction, ferrosilicon production, the Pidgeon process, transportation of materials, and emissions from thermal power plant. The life cycle assessment (LCA) case study was performed on three different fuel use scenarios from coal as the overall fuel to two kinds of gaseous fuels, the producer gas and coke oven gas. The burden use of gaseous fuels was also considered. The procedures, details, and results obtained are based on the application of the existing international standards of LCA, i.e., the ISO 14040. Depletion of abiotic resources, global warming, acidification, and human toxicity were adopted as the midpoint impact categories developed by the problem-oriented approach of CML to estimate the characterized results of the case study. The local characterization and normalization factors of abiotic resources were used to calculate abiotic depletion potential (ADP). The analytic hierarchy process was used to determine the weight factors. Using the Umberto version 4.0, the emissions of dolomite ore extraction were estimated and the transportation models of the three scenarios were designed. The emissions inventory showed that both the Pidgeon process of magnesium production and the Fe-Si production were mainly to blame for the total pollutant emissions in the life cycle of magnesium production. The characterized results indicated that ADP, acidification potential, and human toxicity potential decreased cumulatively from scenarios 1 to 3, with the exception of global warming potential. The final single scores indicated that the accumulative environmental performance of scenario 3 was the best compared with scenarios 1 and 2. The impact of abiotic resources depletion deserves more attention although the types and the amount of mineral resources for Mg production are abundant in China. This study suggested that producer gas was an alternative fuel for magnesium production rather than the coal burned directly in areas where the cost of oven gas-produced coke is high. The utilization of ""clean"" energy and the reduction of greenhouse gases and acidic gases emission were the main goals of the technological improvements and cleaner production of the magnesium industry in China. This paper has demonstrated that the theory and method of LCA are actually helpful for the research on the accumulative environmental performance of primary magnesium production. Further studies with ""cradle-to- cradle"" scheme are recommended. Furthermore, other energy sources used in magnesium production and the cost of energy production could be treated in further research. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","China; Energy use strategies; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Pidgeon process; Primary magnesium production","coal; coke; ferrous ion; fuel; magnesium; silicon; acidification; article; China; electric power plant; energy cost; energy resource; energy yield; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; extraction; gas; government; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; industry; life cycle assessment; pidgeon process; priority journal; process technology; standard",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650744241

Four potential co-combustion scenarios have been identified following discussions with industry stakeholders. These scenarios have been evaluated using (a) an existing energy and mass flow framework model, (b) a semi-quantitative risk analysis, (c) an environmental assessment and (d) a financial assessment. A summary of results from these evaluations for the four different scenarios is presented. For the given ranges of assumptions; SRF co-combustion with coal in cement kilns was found to be the optimal scenario followed by co-combustion of SRF in coal-fired power plants. The biogenic fraction in SRF (ca. 70%) reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions significantly (∼2500 g CO2 eqvt./kg DS SRF in co-fired cement kilns and ∼1500 g CO2 eqvt./kg DS SRF in co-fired power plants). Potential reductions in electricity or heat production occurred through using a lower calorific value (CV) fuel. This could be compensated for by savings in fuel costs (from SRF having a gate fee) and grants aimed at reducing GHG emission to encourage the use of fuels with high biomass fractions. Total revenues generated from coal-fired power plants appear to be the highest (£95/t SRF) from the four scenarios. However overall, cement kilns appear to be the best option due to the low technological risks, environmental emissions and fuel cost. Additionally, cement kiln operators have good experience of handling waste derived fuels. The scenarios involving co-combustion of SRF with MSW and biomass were less favourable due to higher environmental risks and technical issues. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Sampling surveys in the whole Seine drainage network have shown that N2O water concentrations are always far above saturation with respect to atmospheric concentrations. Highest values are found in 1st order streams (1-4 μg N l-1), decrease by out-gazing down to 4th order rivers (0.5 μg N l-1) and increase again in polluted higher order rivers (4 μg N l-1). Calculated values of gas transfer velocities and the observed N2O supersaturation by stream order was used to estimate N2O emissions for the whole water surface area of the Seine drainage network to 100-200 × 103 kg N-N2O yr-1. The results show that a major fraction of the emission occurs in head-water streams. On the basis of previous work, the emission by wastewater treatment plants - WWTPs - has been estimated at the scale of the Seine basin, to 150-260 × 103 kg N-N2O yr-1, i.e. to be in the same range as N2O emissions from the entire water surface. Using an emission factor approach, based on an intensive literature survey considering grassland, cropland and forest soils distribution, the total direct emissions of N2O of the Seine basin was estimated to 10 400 × 103 kg N-N2O yr-1 among which 2500 × 103 kg N-N2O yr-1 are issued from the forested soils and 7900 × 103 kg N-N2O yr-1 from agricultural land. The latter figure agrees well with the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2006. AFOLU, N2O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO2 Emissions from Lime and Urea Application, vol. 4, 54 pp (Chapter 11)] estimate of 8250 × 103 kg N-N2O yr-1. The quantified indirect emissions (from the river-atmosphere interface and from the WWTPs) thus represent 3-6% of the direct agricultural emissions of the Seine basin. However, N2O indirect emissions from 'riparian zones' have only been roughly calculated and, thus, are remaining uncertain. A conservative estimate might increase the indirect emissions to about 13-17% of the direct ones. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The natural vegetation above 2200 m elevation is thought to be forests dominated by Juniperus procera. Nonetheless, this hypothesis is not supported in the vegetation cover now and is scarcely studied in the palaeorecord. To examine changes in vegetation, climate, and land use, we identified buried charcoalized wood and estimated the percentage of organic carbon from C4 plants (% C4 carbon) from δ13C values of bulk organic matter in the soils of gully walls in the boundaries of the ancient Aksumite Empire. Charcoal ranged in age from ca. 13,700 to 110 cal yr BP. Juniperus procera occurred in even the youngest samples, although at lower percentages of the total charcoal than in older samples. Nevertheless, rapidly regenerating angiosperms usually dominated or co-dominated charcoal even in some of the oldest strata. A shift towards higher % C4 carbon and % total organic carbon (%TOC) in soils younger than 3300 cal yr BP began during a period when agricultural uses of land may have increased in order to support the needs of growing societies. A shift towards higher % C4 carbon but lower %TOC began at ca. 6000 cal yr BP, however, during a period when no charcoal was found and no changes in human societal complexity are known. These results indicate that juniper forest types have long been present at &gt; 2200 m in the Tigray Plateau but that they have rarely been the dominant natural vegetation. Furthermore, lack of repeatable correspondence between factors suggests that the causes of similar shifts in vegetation composition were not always the same. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

There are, however, large uncertainties around estimates of global NO emissions due to the paucity of data. In particular, there is little information on the rate of NO emission and its sensitivity to processes such as land use changes in dry environments. Here we report on a two-year study on the influence of afforestation on soil NO fluxes in the semi-arid afforestation system in Southern Israel (Yatir forest, mean annual precipitation ∼280 mm). Laboratory incubations were carried out under seasonally defined conditions of soil moisture and temperature using soils sampled in different seasons from the native shrubland (taken both under shrub canopy and in the inter-shrub areas), and from the adjacent ∼2800 ha, 40-year-old pine afforestation site. Combining laboratory results with field measurements of soil moisture and temperature, we up-scaled soil-atmosphere NO fluxes to the ecosystem level. The different microsites differed in their annual mean NO release rates (0.04, 0.14 and 0.03 mg m-2 d-1 for the shrubland under and between shrubs and for the forest, respectively), and exhibited high inter-seasonal variability in NO emission rates (ranging from zero up to 0.25 mg m-2 d-1 in the wet and dry-rewetting seasons, respectively), as well as in temperature responses. Up-scaling results to annual and ecosystem scales indicated that afforestation of the semi-arid shrubland could reduce soil NO emission by up to 65%. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This estimate of dilution potential can ba used to compare the wind pattern in spaco and time. The application of the above estimate was demonstrated by comparing the dilution potential for November and April for Vadodara region. In India, rain is brought by monsoon winds and therefore the wind velocity during rainy season is high. The end of rainy season is characterized by very low wind velocity and is called post-monsoon period by environmental meteorologists. November is a post monsoon month and is not a favorable period for dilution of pollutants. On the contrary, April is the summer month characterized by very high wind velocity. Estimate of dilution potential for November and April was carried out and found that the dilution potential for November and April was 4.72 km 2 and 14.71 km 2, respectively.

Plant-bacterial communities are described for the first time. The dependence of the production and destruction on the season and salinity of the water body is shown. The development of planktonic cyanobacteria is related to the presence of zooplankton, the development of which is controlled by hydrogen sulfide. The high hydrogen sulfide tolerance of benthic cyanobacteria secures the integrity of cyanobacterial communities. Observations in nature and laboratory modeling show that the formation of mineral layers is restricted to conditions of supersaturation with mineral components. Carbonate precipitation can take place in cyanobacterial communities under conditions of mixing sea water enriched with Ca and Mg with continental water enriched with sodium carbonate. Cyanobacteria are able to form and transform various Ca-Mg-carbonates. Dolomite formation is a derived process that occurs in cyanobacterial mats in the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Carbonatization of cyanobacterial cells is considered using the example of the unicellular halophilic-alkaliphilic cyanobacterium Euhalothece sp. The accomplished study is of certain interest for interpretation of geological and paleontological data in the context of the supposed analogy between cyanobacterial mats and ancient stromatolites. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2009.","Carbonate precipitation; Carbonatization; Cyanobacteria; Cyanobacterial communities","algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cyanobacteria; Euhalothece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76649125585

As outdoor PM concentrations exhibit highly temporal and spatial variations, personal PM exposure depends strongly on individual trajectories and activities. Furthermore, indoor environments deserve special attention due to the large fraction of the day people spend indoors. The indoor PM concentration in turn depends on infiltrated outdoor PM and indoor particle sources, partially caused by the activities of people indoor. We present an approach to estimate PM2.5 exposure levels for individuals based upon existing data sources and models. For this pilot study, six persons kept 24-hour diaries and GPS tracks for at least one working day and one weekend day, providing their daily activity profiles and the associated geographical locations. The survey took place in the city of Münster, Germany in the winter period between October 2006 and January 2007. Environmental PM2.5 exposure was estimated by using two different models for outdoor and indoor concentrations, respectively. For the outdoor distribution, a dispersion model was used and extended by actual ambient fixed site measurements. Indoor concentrations were modeled using a simple mass balance model with the estimated outdoor concentration fraction infiltrated and indoor activities estimated from the diaries. A limited number of three 24-hour indoor measurements series for PM were performed to test the model performance. The resulting average daily exposure of the 14 collected profiles ranged from 21 to 198 μg m- 3 and showed a high variability over the day as affected by personal behavior. Due to the large contribution of indoor particle sources, the mean 24-hour exposure was in most cases higher than the daily means of the respective outdoor fixed site monitors. This feasibility study is a first step towards a more comprehensive modeling approach for personal exposure, and therefore restricted to limited data resources. In future, this model framework not only could be of use for epidemiological research, but also of public interest. Any individual operating a GPS capable device may become able to obtain an estimate of its personal exposure along its trajectory in time and space. This could provide individuals a new insight into the influence of personal habits on their exposure to air pollution and may result in the adaptation of personal behavior to minimize risks. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Sexual lineages produce frost-resistant eggs, conferring an advantage in regions with cold winters, while asexual lineages predominate in regions with mild winters. However, habitat and resource heterogeneities are known to exert a strong influence on sex maintenance and might modulate the effect of climate on aphid reproductive strategies. We carried out a hierarchical sampling in northern France to investigate whether reproductive mode variation of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi is driven by winter climate conditions, by habitat and resource heterogeneities represented by a range of host plants or by both factors. We confirmed the coexistence in R. padi populations of two genetic clusters associated with distinct reproductive strategies. Asexual lineages predominated, whatever the surveyed year and location. However, we detected a between-year variation in the local contribution of both clusters, presumably associated with preceding winter severity. No evidence for host-driven niche differentiation was found in the field on six Poaceae among sexual and asexual lineages. Two dominant multilocus genotypes (∼70% of the sample), having persisted over a 10-year period, were equally abundant on different plant species and locations, indicating their large ecological tolerance. Our results fit theoretical predictions of the influence of winter climate on the balance between sexual and asexual lineages. They also highlight the importance of current agricultural practices which seem to favour a small number of asexual generalist genotypes and their migration across large areas of monotonous environments. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bayesian assignment; Host alternating aphid; Population structure; Reproductive mode; Rhopalosiphum padi; Sexual vs. asexual lineages","microsatellite DNA; allele; animal; aphid; article; asexual reproduction; Bayes theorem; biological model; climate; cluster analysis; DNA sequence; ecosystem; France; genetic variability; genetics; genotype; geography; population genetics; Prunus; season; Alleles; Animals; Aphids; Bayes Theorem; Climate; Cluster Analysis; Ecosystem; France; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Geography; Microsatellite Repeats; Models, Genetic; Prunus; Reproduction, Asexual; Seasons; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Aphididae; Poaceae; Rhopalosiphum padi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649651507

A number of key themes emerge. First, the urban public are resistant to urban growth and have an ingrained and deep attachment to 'traditional' and romanticised visions of rural land use. Second, farmers, the main managers of land use, have proved resistant to concepts of multifunctional land use. Third, there is a perception gap between the practice of food production as a damaging land use exercise and consumer ignorance about the realities of how food and other raw materials are produced. However, consumers support the ideas of farmers being paid to use their land in a more environmentally friendly way. Fourth, there is a value-action gap between people's perceptions of the land use damage they are doing and their lack of willingness to actually change their behaviours. The drivers behind these perceptions are likely to change as carbon reduction policies begin to impact.

Using a 20-year-long time series of population densities for the five species and a dynamic model that has been previously parameterized for northeast Greenland, we analyzed the population and community level consequences of the ongoing and predicted climate change. Species' responses to climate change are complex, because in addition to the direct effects of climate change, which vary depending on species' life histories, species are also affected indirectly due to, e.g., predator-prey interactions. The lemming-predator community exemplifies these complications, yet a robust conclusion emerges from our modeling: in practically all likely scenarios of how climate change may influence the demography of the species, climate change increases the length of the lemming population cycle and decreases the maximum population densities. The latter change in particular is detrimental to the populations of the predators, which are adapted to make use of the years of the greatest prey abundance. Therefore, climate change will indirectly reduce the predators' reproductive success and population densities, and may ultimately lead to local extinction of some of the predator species. Based on these results, we conclude that the recent anomalous observations about lack of cyclic lemming dynamics in eastern Greenland may well be the first signs of a severe impact of climate change on the lemming-predator communities in Greenland and elsewhere in the high Arctic. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Alopex lagopus; Arctic community; Climate change; Cyclic dynamics; Dicrostonyx groenlandicus; Greenland; Mustela erminea; Nyctea scandiaca; Predator-prey interaction; Stercorarius longicaudus","arctic environment; climate change; climate effect; community response; demography; ecological modeling; extinction; population cycle; population density; population dynamics; predator-prey interaction; Arctic; Greenland; Alopex lagopus; Dicrostonyx; Dicrostonyx groenlandicus; Mustela erminea; Nyctea; Nyctea scandiaca; Stercorarius longicaudus; Strigiformes; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66749167061

Seasonal variations of gas fluxes were studied on a reference transect in a newly discovered gas discharge zone. Radon-222 and CO2 fluxes were measured with the accumulation chamber technique, coupled with the scintillation flask method for radon. In the reference transect, fluxes reach exceptional mean values, as high as 8700 ± 1500 g m-2 d-1 for CO2 and 3400 ± 100 × 10-3 Bq m-2 s-1 for radon. Gases fluxes were measured in September 2007 during the monsoon and during the dry winter season, in December 2007 to January 2008 and in December 2008 to January 2009. Contrary to expectations, radon and its carrier gas fluxes were similar during both seasons. The integrated flux along this transect was approximately the same for radon, with a small increase of 11 ± 4% during the wet season, whereas it was reduced by 38 ± 5% during the monsoon for CO2. In order to account for the persistence of the high gas emissions during monsoon, watering experiments have been performed at selected radon measurement points. After watering, radon flux decreased within 5 min by a factor of 2-7 depending on the point. Subsequently, it returned to its original value, firstly, by an initial partial recovery within 3-4 h, followed by a slow relaxation, lasting around 10 h and possibly superimposed by diurnal variations. Monsoon, in this part of the Himalayas, proceeds generally by brutal rainfall events separated by two- or three-day lapses. Thus, the recovery ability shown in the watering experiments accounts for the observed long-term persistence of gas discharge. This persistence is an important asset for long-term monitoring, for example to study possible temporal variations associated with stress accumulation and release. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the net benefit of carbon sequestration in wetlands in terms of a reduction in global warming forcing has often been questioned because of potentially greater emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). We compared gas emissions (N2O, CH4, carbon dioxide [CO2]) and soil moisture and temperature from eight cropland and eight restored grassland wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region from May to October, 2003, to better understand the atmospheric carbon mitigation potential of restored wetlands. Results show that carbon dioxide contributed the most (90%) to net-GHG flux, followed by CH4 (9%) and N2O (1%). Fluxes of N2O, CH4, CO2, and their combined global warming potential (CO2 equivalents) did not significantly differ between cropland and grassland wetlands. The seasonal pattern in flux was similar in cropland and grassland wetlands with peak emissions of N2O and CH4 occurring when soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) was 40-60% and &gt;60%, respectively; negative CH4 fluxes were observed when WFPS approached 40%. Negative CH4 fluxes from grassland wetlands occurred earlier in the season and were more pronounced than those from cropland sites because WFPS declined more rapidly in grassland wetlands; this decline was likely due to higher infiltration and evapotranspiration rates associated with grasslands. Our results suggest that restoring cropland wetlands does not result in greater emissions of N2O and CH4, and therefore would not offset potential soil carbon sequestration. These findings, however, are limited to a small sample of seasonal wetlands with relatively short hydroperiods. A more comprehensive assessment of the GHG mitigation potential of restored wetlands should include a diversity of wetland types and land-use practices and consider the impact of variable climatic cycles that affect wetland hydrology.","Carbon dioxide; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Global warming potential; Land use; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Soil temperature; Water-filled pore space","Carbon sequestration; Global warming potential; Nitrous oxide; Soil temperature; Water-filled pore space; Anesthetics; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Groundwater; Hydrology; Land use; Leakage (fluid); Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Restoration; Soil moisture; Underwater soils; Water supply; Wetlands; agricultural emission; carbon sequestration; climate cycle; evapotranspiration; global warming; greenhouse gas; habitat restoration; hydroperiod; methane; nitrous oxide; pore space; prairie; seasonality; soil carbon; soil moisture; soil temperature; wetland management; North America; Prairie Pothole Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350567216

The objective of this study is to determine if recharge to a fractured crystalline aquifer in a humid climate is governed by heterogeneous fracture networks and/or overlying soil characteristics. A 10 km2 study area is instrumented with a network of 15 bedrock wells completed to observe conditions in the shallow bedrock aquifer. Hydrogeological characterization, detailed observation of the 2007 snowmelt freshet and numerical simulations are used. Snowmelt is a valuable natural tracer because it has a distinct thermal and isotopic signature and is applied simultaneously and evenly to the entire ground surface. Results indicate that soil thickness and bedrock transmissivity are both highly heterogeneous at the site scale but that much of the study area is underlain by silty sand with a thickness of &gt;1 m. Cold, δ2H depleted snowmelt locally recharged the bedrock aquifer to depths of at least 20 m within two days. Since recharge is typically quantified and discussed as an annual flux, the snowmelt event is extremely rapid. However, hydraulic, isotopic, and thermal data also indicate that most wells did not rapidly recharge. Numerical simulations indicate that soil thickness and hydraulic conductivity are critical parameters that controls whether the underlying bedrock aquifer rapidly recharges. The vertical fracture aperture, number of vertical fractures, the amount of snowmelt, water-table gradient, depth to water table and pressure-saturation relations are all less significant controls on the rate and amount of rapid recharge. Both field results and numerical simulations indicate that the rapid recharge process is localized to areas where the soil is very thin, such as the fringes of outcrops. Outcrops are exposed in &lt;0.1% of the study area indicating that the process of rapid recharge is also extremely localized. This poorly documented hydrogeologic phenomenon has broad implications for groundwater management and protection, as well as our understanding of recharge processes in fractured rock aquifers. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The data on coal consumption in Poland in the past, at present and in the future are discussed in the paper. Information on the content of mercury in Polish coals is presented. Coal combustion processes for electricity and heat production are the main source of anthropogenic mercury emission in Poland. It is expected that the current emissions will decrease in the future due to implementation of efficient control measures. These measures for emission reduction are described in the paper.

However due to sustainability constraints, biofuels will replace only 10 to 15% of fossil liquid fuels in the transport sector. Several governments have defined a minimum target of GHG emissions reduction for those biofuels that will be eligible to public incentives, for example a 35% emissions reduction in case of biofuels in Members States of the European Union. This article points out the significant biases in estimating GHG balances of biofuels stemming from modelling choices about system definition and boundaries, functional unit, reference systems and allocation methods. The extent to which these choices influence the results is investigated. After performing a comparison and constructive criticism of various modelling choices, the LCA of wheat-to-bioethanol is used as an illustrative case where bioethanol is blended with gasoline at various percentages (E5, E10 and E85). The performance of these substitution options is evaluated as well. The results show a large difference in the reduction of the GHG emissions with a high sensitivity to the following factors: the method used to allocate the impacts between the co-products, the type of reference systems, the choice of the functional unit and the type of blend. The authors come out with some recommendations for basing the estimation of energy and GHG balances of biofuels on principles such as transparency, consistency and accuracy. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Particle size, stack height, topography and meteorological conditions strongly affect particulate matter (PM) dispersion. In this work, an impact distance calculation methodology considering different particulate sizes is presented. A Gaussian-type dispersion model for PM that handles size particles larger than 0.1 μm is used. The model considers primary particles and continuous emissions. PM concentration distribution at every affected geographical point defined by a grid is computed. Stochastic uncertainty caused by the natural variability of atmospheric parameters is taken into consideration in the dispersion model by applying a Monte Carlo methodology. The prototype package (STRRAP) that takes into account the stochastic behaviour of atmospheric variables, developed for risk assessment and safe distances calculation [Godoy SM, Santa Cruz ASM, Scenna NJ. STRRAP SYSTEM - A software for hazardous materials risk assessment and safe distances calculation. Reliability Engineering and System Safety 2007;92(7):847-57] is enlarged for the analysis of the PM air dispersion. STRRAP computes distances from the source to every affected receptor in each trial and generates the impact distance distribution for each particulate size. In addition, a representative impact distance value to delimit the affected area can be obtained. Fuel oil stack effluents dispersion in Rosario city is simulated as a case study. Mass concentration distributions and impact distances are computed for the range of interest in environmental air quality evaluations (PM2.5-PM10). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper demonstrates how the greenhouse gas effects of waste treatment processes can be described in a simplified manner by considering energy efficiency indicators. For evaluation to be consistent, it is necessary to use reasonable system boundaries and to take the generation of electricity and the use of heat into account. The new European R1 efficiency criterion will lead to the development and implementation of optimized processes/systems with increased energy efficiency which, in turn, will exert an influence on the greenhouse gas effects of waste management in Europe. Promising technologies are: the increase of steam parameters, reduction of in-plant energy consumption, and the combined use of heat and power. Plants in Brescia and Amsterdam are current examples of good performance with highly efficient electricity generation. Other examples of particularly high heat recovery rates are the energy-from-waste (EfW) plants in MalmÃ¶ and Gothenburg. To achieve the full potential of greenhouse gas reduction in waste management, it is necessary to avoid landfilling combustible wastes, for example, by means of landfill taxes and by putting incentives in place for increasing the efficiency of EfW systems.","Greenhouse gas; Waste-to-energy","Electric power generation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Transport properties; Waste heat; Waste treatment; Electricity generation; Energy efficiency indicator; Greenhouse gas balance; Greenhouse gas reductions; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Waste management systems; Waste to energy; Waste treatment process; Municipal solid waste; biofuel; carbon dioxide; combined heat and power; electricity generation; emission control; energy efficiency; energy use; global warming; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; waste management; waste treatment; article; biomass; carbon balance; carbon cycle; combustion; controlled study; electricity; energy consumption; energy recovery; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; heat; landfill; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; priority journal; process optimization; process technology; waste management; Europe; Brescia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72549100958

Land-based activities are responsible for over a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet the economics of land-use decisions have not been explicitly modeled in global mitigation studies. In this paper, we develop a new, general equilibrium framework which effectively captures the opportunity costs of land-use decisions in agriculture and forestry, thereby allowing us to analyse competition for heterogeneous land types across and within sectors, as well as input substitution between land and other factors of production. When land-using sectors are confronted with a tax on greenhouse gas emissions, we find significant changes in the global pattern of comparative advantage across sectors, regions, and land types. Globally, we find that forest carbon sequestration is the dominant strategy for GHG emissions mitigation, while agricultural-related mitigation comes predominantly from reduced methane emissions in the ruminant livestock sector, followed by fertilizer and methane emissions from paddy rice. Regionally, agricultural mitigation is a larger share of total land-use emissions abatement in the USA and China, compared to the rest of the world, and, within agriculture, disproportionately from reductions in fertilizer-related emissions. The results also show how analyses that only consider regional mitigation, may bias mitigation potential by ignoring global market interactions. For example, USA-specific analyses likely over-estimate the potential for abatement in agriculture. Finally, we note that this general equilibrium framework provides the research community with a practical methodology for explicit modeling of global land competition and land-based mitigation in comprehensive assessments of greenhouse gas mitigation options. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Depending on the methodology used to account for the local pollutant emissions and the global greenhouse gases emissions during the production and consumption of both the fossil and bio-fuels, the results can show huge differences. If it is taken into account a life cycle inventory approach to compare the different fuel sources, these results can present controversies. A comparison study involving the American oil diesel and soybean diesel developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory presents CO2 emissions for the bio-diesel which are almost 20% of the emissions for the oil diesel: 136 g CO2/bhp-h for the bio-diesel from soybean and 633 g CO2/bhp-h for the oil diesel [National Renewable Energy Laboratory-NREL/SR-580-24089]. Besides that, important local environmental impacts can also make a big difference. The water consumption in the soybean production is much larger in comparison with the water consumption for the diesel production [National Renewable Energy Laboratory-NREL/SR-580-24089].

The molecule of phloretin has eight dihedral angles, four of them taking part in the carbon backbone and the other four, related with the orientation of the hydroxyl groups. A systematic search involving a random variation of the dihedral angles has been used to generate input structures for the quantum chemical calculations. Calculations at the DFT(B3LYP)/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory permitted the identification of 58 local minima belonging to the C1 symmetry point group. The molecular structures of the conformers have been analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis. This method allowed us to group conformers according to their similarities, and thus, to correlate the conformers' stability with structural parameters. The dendrogram obtained from the hierarchical cluster analysis depicted two main clusters. Cluster I included all the conformers with relative energies lower than 25 kJ mol-1 and cluster II, the remaining conformers. The possibility of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds resulted the main factor contributing for the stability. Accordingly, all conformers depicting intramolecular H-bonds belong to cluster I. These conformations are clearly favored when the carbon backbone is as planar as possible. The values of the νC{double bond, long}O and νOH vibrational modes were compared among all the conformers of phloretin.

It is known that partial substitution for B-site cations of LSCFO by Cr gives rise to a significant improvement on chemical and thermal stability of the perovskite oxide. On the basis of this doped structure, introduction of an immaterial dose of Mg2+ ion into its B-site results in a microstructure consisting of smaller grains with higher density than its precursor. Furthermore, the resulting perovskite oxide La0.19Sr0.8Fe0.69Co0.1Cr0.2 Mg0.01O3 - δ (LSFCCMO) displays higher O2- conductivity than the solely Cr-doped LSCFO besides the improved chemical stability against reduction in 5% CH4/He stream at 850 °C.

We constructed plots of 200 m 5 m in two distinct habitats on the islands of Dominica, Grenada and Puerto Rico (total of six plots) and recorded visitors to all plant species in flower. In total we recorded 447 interactions among 144 plants and 226 pollinator species. Specifically we describe how rainfall and temperature affect proportional richness and importance of the different pollinator functional groups. We used three measures of pollinator importance: number of interactions, number of plant species visited and betweenness centrality. Overall rainfall explained most of the variation in pollinator richness and relative importance. Bird pollination tended to increase with rainfall, although not significantly, whereas insects were significantly negatively affected by rainfall. However, the response among insect groups was more complex; bees were strongly negatively affected by rainfall, whereas dipterans showed similar trends to birds. Bird, bee and dipteran variation along the climate gradient can be largely explained by their physiological capabilities to respond to rainfall and temperature, but the effect of climate on other insect pollinator groups was more obscure.

On-site meteorological data were used in conjunction with inverse dispersion modeling using Industrial Source Complex Short-Term, version 3 (ISCST3) to develop emission rates from the measured concentrations. Baseline emission factors of 379 ±86 kg PM 10 km -2 year -1 and 16 ±3.3 kg PM 10 km -2 year -1 were determined, and an emissions reduction of 49% was achieved by the experimental treatment, representing a significant potential for emissions reduction across the state.

The conventional approach of deriving gain factors only strictly applies at equilibrium, and they differ with scenario and with respect to different climate variables (e.g., CO2, radiative forcing, and temperature) which have different time lags. Here we show that the positive feedback whereby ocean heating reduces the solubility of CO2 can be quantified in a. scenario-independent way, directly from ocean heat content changes, by expressing it as an 'equivalent carbon emission'. On annual to centennial timescales, the feedback has the same impact on atmospheric CO2 as an equivalent emission flux of fossil fuel carbon. From ocean heat-content data we quantify the ocean heating-CO2 solubility positive feedback, which increased in average strength from an equivalent emission of ∼0.08 PgC yr-I oyer 1961-2003 to ∼0.19 PgC yr-1 during 1993-2003.

Sustainability will be a strong factor in the regulatory environment and investments in biofuels. Biomass feedstock production is an important contributor to environmental, social, and economic impacts from biofuels. This study presents a systems approach where the agricultural, energy, andenvironmental sectors are considered ascomponents of a single system, and environmental liabilities are used as recoverable resources for biomass feedstock production. We focus on efficient use of land and water resources. We conducted a spatial analysis evaluating marginal land and degraded water resources to improve feedstock productivity with concomitant environmental restoration for the state of Nebraska. Results indicate that utilizing marginal land resources such as riparian and roadway buffer strips, brownfield sites, and marginal agricultural land could produce enough feedstocks to meet a maximum of 22% of the energy requirements of the state compared to the current supply of 2%. Degraded water resources such as nitrate-contaminated groundwater and wastewater were evaluated as sources of nutrients and water to improve feedstock productivity. Spatial overlap between degraded water and marginal land resources was found to be as high as 96% and could maintain sustainable feedstock production on marginal lands. Other benefits of implementing this strategy include feedstock intensification todecreasebiomass transportation costs, restoration of contaminated water resources, and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Agricultural land; Biomass feedstock; Brownfield sites; Buffer strip; Contaminated groundwater; Contaminated water; Current supplies; Economic impacts; Energy requirements; Environmental liabilities; Environmental restoration; Feedstock production; Land resources; Nebraska; Recoverable resource; Regulatory environment; Spatial analysis; Spatial overlap; Systems approach; Transportation cost; Biofuels; Biomass; Feedstocks; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Hydrogeology; Investments; Land use; Leakage (fluid); Productivity; Remediation; Restoration; Sustainable development; Wastewater; Water analysis; Groundwater resources; biofuel; ground water; nitrate; water; alternative energy; biofuel; biomass; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; environmental impact; environmental restoration; land use; socioeconomic impact; sustainable development; wastewater; water pollution; water resource; agricultural land; article; biomass; crop management; ecosystem restoration; energy; environmental sustainability; greenhouse gas; land use; riparian ecosystem; United States; waste water; water contamination; Agriculture; Biomass; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Energy-Generating Resources; Environment; Geography; Greenhouse Effect; Software; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution; Nebraska; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68049140908

Two zeolites of different Co status were used: in the first, Co2+ ions were localized mostly in cation exchange positions, and in the second most of the Co2+ occurred in the form of CoO and oxide-like clusters. IR studies evidenced that NO reduced some Co3+ to Co2+ already at room temperature, and also reduced some Co 2+ to lower oxidation states (probably Co) at 670 and 1070 K. Only Co2+ in exchange positions could be reduced with NO. The treatment of zeolite CoZSM-5 with H2 or with CO at 670 and 1070 K made the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ (the contribution of Co 3+ decreased and the contribution of Co2+ increased). IR studies illustrated that the most electron-acceptor Co3+ (characterized by a high frequency Co3+-NO band) were transformed, by reduction, into the most electron-acceptor Co2+ (characterized by a high frequency Co2+-CO band).

Our objectives were to (1) characterize differences in soil temperature, moisture and frost associated with elevation at the HBEF and (2) evaluate variation in total soil (TSR) and microbial respiration, N mineralization, nitrification, denitrification, nitrous oxide (N2O) flux, and methane (CH4) uptake along this gradient. Low elevation sites were consistently warmer (1.5-2.5°C) and drier than high elevation sites. Despite higher temperatures, low elevation plots had less snow and more soil frost than high elevation plots. Net N mineralization and nitrification were slower in warmer, low elevation plots, in both summer and winter. In summer, this pattern was driven by lower soil moisture in warmer soils and in winter the pattern was linked to less snow and more soil freezing in warmer soils. These data suggest that N cycling and supply to plants in northern hardwood ecosystems will be reduced in a warmer climate due to changes in both winter and summer conditions. TSR was consistently faster in the warmer, low elevation plots. N cycling processes appeared to be more sensitive to variation in soil moisture induced by climate variation, whereas C cycling processes appeared to be more strongly influenced by temperature. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Methane; Mineralization; Nitrification; Nitrous oxide","biomineralization; carbon cycle; climate variation; denitrification; frost; global warming; methane; microbial activity; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide; nutrient uptake; soil carbon; soil moisture; soil temperature; Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest; New Hampshire; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349682160

Investigations included work up for malignancy and hyperparathyroidism. However, the hypercalcaemia was attributed to ingestion of large doses of calcium carbonate, leading to milk-alkali syndrome. She was managed with intravenous fluids and withdrawal of calcium carbonate. The patient responded well to treatment, with normalization of the calcium concentration and clinical improvement.

Tidal energy and water turbulence strongly affect the water column resulting in a well-mixed structure and high concentrations of suspended sediment. The phytoplankton community is mostly dominated by diatoms and the annual pattern has been characterized by a recurrent winter-early spring bloom. Here, we investigated to what extent the temporal variations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) regulate the phytoplankton blooms in the head of the estuary by light-limitation. Sampling was done on a fortnightly basis (weekly during the blooming season) at a fixed station in the inner zone of the estuary from January 2007 to February 2008. SPM concentrations and light extinction coefficients (k) in the water column were significantly correlated and showed relatively lower values during the phytoplankton maximal biomass levels. During winter, SPM and k reached values of 23.6 mg l-1 and 0.17 m-1 which were significantly lower than the annual means of 77.6 mg l-1 and 2.94 m-1, respectively. The particulate organic matter (POM) concentration was significantly correlated with the calculated phytoplankton biomass although the contribution of the latter to the total POM was rather low. Both, POM and biomass, had maximal values during winter (21.8 mg l-1 and 393.5 μg C l-1) and mid summer (24.3 mg l-1 and 407.0 μg C l-1), with cell densities up to 8 × 106 cells l-1 and chlorophyll a up to 24.6 μg l-1. Our results suggest that the decrease of SPM concentrations in the water column with a concomitant increase in the penetration of solar radiation seems to be one of the main causes for the development of the phytoplankton winter bloom in the Bahía Blanca Estuary. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It aims at assessing key drivers and key bottlenecks for their deployment, focusing particularly on the role of biofuels and hydrogen in meeting climate policy objectives. The analysis is pursued using the Global Multi-regional MARKAL model (GMM), a perfect foresight ""bottom-up"" model of the global energy system with a detailed representation of alternative fuel chains, linked to the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC). The analysis shows that biofuels are limited by the regional availability of low-cost biomass, but can be important for meeting mild climate policy targets. If policy-makers intend to pursue more stringent climate policy, then hydrogen becomes a competitive option. However, the analysis finds that the use of hydrogen in personal transport is restricted to very stringent climate policy, as only such policy provides enough incentive to build up the required delivery infrastructure. An analysis of costs additionally shows that ""keeping the hydrogen option open"" does not take considerable investments compared to the investment needs in the power sector within the next decades, but allows the use of hydrogen for the pursuit of stringent climate policy in the second half of the century. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The study was conducted according to ISO 14040 standards and was based on an automotive component made on cold-chamber HPDC machines operating in typical mass production environments. The aluminum alloy foundry was located in Australia; the magnesium alloy foundry was located in the United States. In both cases, emissions were found to reduce with an increasing HPDC process yield. However, yield variations had only a modest impact on GHG emissions in the aluminum alloy HPDC, due to the excellent in-plant recycling of the alloy and the relatively low emissions from primary aluminum production compared with primary magnesium production. In contrast, for the magnesium alloy, significant reductions in emissions were recorded as the yield increased. This outcome was attributed to the considerable savings achieved in raw material quantities sourced from high-emitting primary production and the use of lower amounts of SF6, a GHG with a very high global warming potential (GWP). These results were found to hold irrespective of changes to the ratio between the primary and secondary alloys in the raw material mix, although the magnitude of the impact was reduced considerably with reductions in the primary alloy component. In the case of the magnesium alloy HPDC, decreases in quality assurance (QA) rejects and cycle times were also found to contribute toward reduced emissions, although their influences were an order of magnitude lower than that of the yield improvements. © 2009 The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society and ASM International.",,"Alloy components; Australia; Automotive component; Cycle time; GHG emission; Global warming potential; High-pressure diecasting; In-plants; Low emission; Magnesium production; Mass production; Order of magnitude; Primary aluminum; Primary production; Process parameters; Process yield; Secondary alloys; Using life; Yield Improvement; Alumina; Aluminum; Die casting; Foundry practice; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Leakage (fluid); Magnesium; Magnesium alloys; Quality assurance; Total quality management; Aluminum alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68549118797

The development and application of a bottom-up carbon-counting approach called DECoRuM is described. DECoRuM is a Geographical Information System-based software model which estimates and maps baseline energy use and CO2 emissions on a house-by-house level, identifies 'pollution' hotspots, predicts the potential for reductions in CO2 emissions and monitors reductions achieved as a result of deploying energy efficiency measures and renewable energy systems. The application of DECoRuM model to a case study in Oxford shows that CO2 emission reductions above 60% are possible, at a cost of between £6 and £77 per tonne of CO2 emissions saved, depending upon the package of measures used and the scenario of capital costs (low or high) employed. Alongside DECoRuM, the author has led the development of an action-oriented Oxford Climate Change Action Plan (OCCAP) which uses top-down approaches to construct an accurate CO2 emissions inventory for Oxford city for a baseline year, establish CO2 reduction targets and propose action for each of the energy-related sectors to meet those targets. These two different, but complimentary, approaches provide a useful example for other cities in their endeavour for emission reductions. © The Author 2009.

It grows on the rock slopes of Baba mountains under Lebanon Cedars in the Mugla province of Turkey with Mediterranean climate. The plant is vulnerable and endangered due to illegal collection for local and foreign flower industry. Fast developing tourism industry and rapid urbanization has also shown negative implications on its population. The study reports three years successful adaptation results of S. candida in the continental climate of Ankara in the Central Anatolia. Four groups of bulbs based on diameter (>2.45, 2.15-2.44, 1.85-2.14 and <1.84 cm) were collected from its natural habitat during March, April and May 1998 and were evaluated for frequency (%) of emergence, mean number of leaves per plant, mean plant height, frequency (%) of flowering, frequency (%) of fruit setting. mean number of bulbs per plant, and mean diameter (cm) of regenerated bulbs. All categories of bulbs could be multiplied and adapted successfully with variable frequency of fruit setting. However, the highest fruit set was recorded from 2.15-2.44 cm April collected bulbs.

As atmospheric CO2 measurements expand with the advent of a dedicated remote sensing platform and denser in situ measurements, the ability to close the carbon budget at spatial scales of ∼100 km 2 and daily time scales requires fossil fuel CO2 inventories at commensurate resolution. Additionally, the growing interest in U.S. climate change policy measures are best served by emissions that are tied to the driving processes in space and time. Here we introduce a high resolution data product (the ""Vulcan"" inventory: www.purdue.edu/eas/carbon/ vulcan/) that has quantified fossil fuel CO2 emissions for the contiguous U.S. at spatial scales less than 100 km2 and temporal scales as small as hours. This data product, completed for the year 2002, includes detail on combustion technology and 48 fuel types through all sectors of the U.S. economy. The Vulcan inventory is built from the decades of local/regional air pollution monitoring and complements these data with census, traffic, and digital road data sets. The Vulcan inventory shows excellent agreement with national-level Department of Energy inventories, despite the different approach taken by the DOE to quantify U.S. fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Comparison to the global 1° x 1° fossil fuel CO2 inventory, used widely by the carbon cycle and climate change community prior to the construction of the Vulcan inventory, highlights the space/time biases inherent in the population-based approach. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Air pollution monitoring; Atmospheric CO; Carbon budgets; Carbon cycles; Climate change policies; Combustion technology; Data products; Data sets; Department of Energy; Emission fluxes; Fossil fuel combustion; Fuel types; High resolution; High resolution data; In-situ measurement; Remote sensing platforms; Space and time; Spatial scale; Temporal scale; Time-scale; Air quality; Combustion; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Remote sensing; Thermochemistry; Climate change; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; atmospheric pollution; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate change; combustion; data set; emission inventory; environmental policy; fossil fuel; in situ measurement; remote sensing; air monitoring; air pollution; article; carbon cycle; climate change; combustion; industry; traffic; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Fossil Fuels; United States; Vehicle Emissions; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650496166

Fortunately, there are a number of initiatives to address environmental impacts involving environmental groups and industry participants, along with academics and governmental agencies (e.g., Council for Sustainable Biomass Production; Roundtable for Sustainable Biofuels). A second major challenge is that there is no advanced biofuels industry today, and the biofuel supply chain requires many participants working closely together. Thus, governments have an essential role to support both critical R&D as well as industry participants, to reduce their risk from early investment in this industry.

Predicted weather-related events like sea level rise, increased storm events, and extreme heat waves imply an urgent need for new approaches to settlement design to enable human and non-human species to adapt to these increased risks. A wide variety of policy responses are emerging at local and regional levels - from sustainable urban form, to alternative energy production and new approaches to biodiversity conservation. However, little attempt has been made to ensure that strategies to adapt to the inevitable impacts of enhanced climate change (such as additional open space to enable water inundation) support ongoing policies intended to mitigate local contributions to climate change (such as attempts to increase urban densities to reduce car dependency). In some cases mitigation and adaptation are complementary but in other cases these policy goals may conflict. This research examined leading case examples of land-use plans and policies designed to address climate change. Focusing predominantly on cases from the United States and Australia, we identified whether the policies address adaptation, mitigation or both and whether the practices put mitigation and adaptation in potential conflict with each other. We found that half of the actions identified contain potential conflicts to achieving adaptation and mitigation simultaneously. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This includes the saline-only section below the oil-water contact (OWC) in oil reservoirs, a storage target neglected in many current storage capacity assessments. This also includes saline aquifers (high porosity and permeability formations) immediately below oil-bearing formations. While this is a very specific injection target, we contend that most, if not all, oil-bearing basins in the US contain a great volume of such strata, and represent a rather large CO2 storage capacity option. We hypothesize that these are the best storage targets in those basins. The purpose of this research is to evaluate this hypothesis. We quantitatively compared CO2 behavior in oil reservoirs and brine formations by examining the thermophysical properties of CO2, CO2-brine, and CO2-oil in various pressure, temperature, and salinity conditions. In addition, we compared the distribution of gravity number (N), which characterizes a tendency towards buoyancy-driven CO2 migration, and mobility ratio (M), which characterizes the impeded CO2 migration, in oil reservoirs and brine formations. Our research suggests competing advantages and disadvantages of CO2 injection in oil reservoirs vs. brine formations: (1) CO2 solubility in oil is significantly greater than in brine (over 30 times); (2) the tendency of buoyancy-driven CO2 migration is smaller in oil reservoirs because density contrast between oil and CO2 is smaller than it between brine and oil (the approximate density contrast between CO2 and crude oil is ∼100 kg/m3 and between CO2 and brine is ∼350 kg/m3); (3) the increased density of oil and brine due to the CO2 dissolution is not significant (about 7-15 kg/m3); (4) the viscosity reduction of oil due to CO2 dissolution is significant (from 5790 to 98 mPa s). We compared these competing properties and processes by performing numerical simulations. Results suggest that deep saline CO2 injection immediately below oil formations reduces buoyancy-driven CO2 migration and, at the same time, minimizes the amount of mobile CO2 compared to conventional deep saline CO2 injection (i.e., CO2 injection into brine formations not below oil-bearing strata). Finally, to investigate practical aspects and field applications of this injection paradigm, we characterized oil-bearing formations and their thickness (capacity) as a component of the Southwest Regional Partnership on Carbon Sequestration (SWP) field deployments.

The loss of large hollow-bearing trees coupled with inadequate recruitment of mature ash forest has been predicted to result in a reduction in population size of up to 90% by 2020. Furthermore, bioclimatic analyses have suggested additional reductions in the species' distribution under a variety of climate change scenarios. Using a panel of 15 highly resolving microsatellite markers and mitochondrial control region sequence data, we infer past and present gene flow. Populations in the northern part of the core range were highly admixed, and showed no signs of either current or historical barriers to gene flow. A marginal, isolated and inbred population at Yellingbo was highly genetically differentiated, both in terms of current and historic genetic structure. Sequence data confirmed the conclusions from earlier genetic simulation studies that the Yellingbo population has been isolated from the rest of the species range since before European-induced changes to the montane landscape, and formed part of a larger genetic unit that is now otherwise extinct. Historic loss of maternal lineages in the Central Highlands of Victoria was detected despite signals of immigration, indicating population declines that most probably coincided with changes in climate at the end of the Pleistocene. Given ongoing habitat loss and the recent (February 2009) wildfire in the Central Highlands, we forecast (potentially extensive) demographic declines, in line with predicted range reductions under climate change scenarios. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Conserved sequence blocks; Control region; Wildfire","microsatellite DNA; mitochondrial DNA; animal; article; Australia; DNA sequence; ecosystem; environmental protection; gene flow; genetics; greenhouse effect; haplotype; marsupial; population genetics; single strand conformation polymorphism; tree; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; DNA, Mitochondrial; Ecosystem; Gene Flow; Genetics, Population; Greenhouse Effect; Haplotypes; Microsatellite Repeats; Phalangeridae; Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Trees; Victoria; Gymnobelideus leadbeateri; Metatheria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68349158896

Because of the limitations on understandings and analysis tools, assessments on impacts of climate change in regions are not completely clear. However, according to investigations by researchers, climate change has affected China remarkably in natural and socioeconomic fields. The paper mainly focuses on impacts of climate change on water resources in China and corresponding respondences to deal with those problems. In the first part, the current and future impacts of climate change on water resources in China are introduced. Climate change has caused the change of distribution of water resources in China, which is already proved by the trends of decreasing runoffs of many rivers in China, especially in the Yellow River, Haihe River and Huaihe River. In the future, water resources may further decrease in northern part of China, while increase in southern regions, which may rise the opportunity of droughts and floods. Water shortage will also be a serious problem in Ningxia and Gansu provinces. Because of impacts of climate change, there are big challenges for the development and protection of water resources in China. To deal with these problems, two aspects of treatments are provided, including mitigation of greenhouse gases outlet and adaption to the climate change. Meanwhile, several detailed measures are also listed in the paper. Climate change is a problem of environment, and it's also a problem of development. Understandings and responses of its impacts on water resources in China must be based on sustainable development.","Climate change; Corresponding countermeasures; Water resources distribution","Analysis tools; Corresponding countermeasures; Distribution of water; Gansu province; Global problems; Haihe river; Huaihe river; Water shortages; Yellow river; Drought; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Rivers; Strategic planning; Water resources exploration; Water supply; Water resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350733831

However, the partitioning of soil and plant sources, understanding of contributory mechanisms, and their response to climate change are uncertain. A plant removal experiment was established within a peatland located in the UK uplands to quantify respiration derived from recently-fixed plant carbon and that derived from decomposition of soil organic matter, using natural abundance 13C and bomb-14C as tracers. Soil and plant respiration sources were found respectively to contribute ~ 36% and between 41 and 54% of the total ecosystem CO2 flux. Respired CO2 produced in the clipped ('soil') plots had a mean age of ~ 15 years since fixation from the atmosphere, whereas the 14C content of ecosystem CO2 was statistically indistinguishable from the contemporary atmosphere. Results of carbon mass balance modelling showed that, in addition to respiration from bulk soil and plant respired CO2, a third, much older source of CO2 existed. This source, which we suggest is CO2 derived from the catotelm constituted between ~ 10 and 23% of total ecosystem respiration and had a mean radiocarbon age of between several hundred and ~ 2000 years before present (BP). These findings show that plant-mediated transport of CO2 produced in the catotelm may form a considerable component of peatland ecosystem respiration. The implication of this discovery is that current assumptions in terrestrial carbon models need to be re-evaluated to consider the climate sensitivity of this third source of peatland CO2. © 2009.","δ13C; Carbon cycling; CO2; Isotope mass balance; Mixing model; Partitioning; Peatland; Radiocarbon; Respiration","Carbon cycling; CO2; Isotope mass balance; Mixing model; Partitioning; Peatland; Radiocarbon; Respiration; Bombs (ordnance); Climate change; Isotopes; Organic compounds; Soils; Wetlands; Ecosystems; air-soil interaction; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; atmospheric modeling; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon isotope; catotelm; climate change; decomposition; ecosystem dynamics; mass balance; mixing; partitioning; peatland; removal experiment; respiration; soil organic matter; upland region; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349992646

There is a serious pressure to reduce CO2 emission from automotive application which contributes to around 15.9% of the total CO2 production based on the Surveys done time to time. In a developing market like India, many foreign players are entering with lots of option for offering to this market. The parameters of prime importance here are fuel efficiency with good drive ability and at the same time affordable price. Diesel engines are finding these benefits and attracting the buyer over its counterpart (Gasoline). The road condition and the driving pattern in India compared with developed countries differ to a major extent. In India, the Low speed uses are predominating in Cities and in Ghats. This leads to frequent gear shifting thus reducing driver comfort and loss of fuel economy. In Diesel engine, the low end response of engine plays a vital role in reducing the gear downshifting in both city and Ghats drive. Thus, can take a potential saving of fuel and driving comfort. However, the low engine speed torque is limited by the air availability. With the upcoming trends towards downsizing, the swept volume of the engine is coming down. Hence, the air taken by the engine at low speed and low BMEP is limited. The black smoke formation is more prominent in lower engine speed. Hence, simultaneous increase of low end performance without any design changes and cost becomes a challenge. In this paper, Low end performance improvement of a Multi purpose Vehicle (MPV) equipped with a 2.5L common rail diesel engine is presented. The efforts for the low end performance improvements were made from both vehicle (Gear box, axle ratio, and tyre) and engine side (improvement of low end torque) by exploring the common rail potential. Iteration of different gear ratio combination, final axle ratio and tyre dynamic rolling radius were done. To reduce the number of Experiments, AVL CRUISE software was used to minimize the iteration. Torque at full load in lower engine speed was improved by introducing the early pilot with relatively Higher quantity. However, in the part load, this pilot quantity was split into two successive pilot injections. Selection of pilot separation was optimized in such a way that Noise and Smoke levels are maintained or improved. Engine level trials were conducted with cylinder pressure and Noise Measurement with AVL Indicom. The Concept of Design of experiment (DOE) was used to minimize the number of iteration and for analysis of results was done using commercially available MINITAB software.

This limits broad generalizations about the effects of a changing climate across biomes. To broaden this generalization, we used free air CO2 enrichment to compare effects of eCO2 (i.e., double ambient ~ 720 ppm) relative to ambient CO2 (aCO2 ~ 360 ppm) on several ecosystem properties and functions in large, outdoor, experimental mesocosms that mimicked shallow sand-bottom prairie streams. In general, we showed that eCO2 had strong bottom-up effects on stream autotrophs, which moved through the food web and indirectly affected consumer trophic levels. These general effects were likely mediated by differential CO2 limitation between the eCO2 and aCO2 treatments. For example, we found that eCO2 decreased water-column pH and increased dissolved CO2 in the mesocosms, reducing CO2-limitation at times of intense primary production (PP). At these times, PP of benthic algae was about two times greater in the eCO2 treatment than aCO2 treatment. Elevated PP enhanced the rate of carbon assimilation relative to nutrient uptake, which reduced algae quality in the eCO2 treatment. We predicted that reduced algae quality would negatively affect benthic invertebrates. However, density, biomass and average individual size of benthic invertebrates increased in the eCO2 treatment relative to aCO2 treatment. This suggested that total PP was a more important regulator of secondary production than food quality in our experiment. This study broadens generalizations about ecosystem-level effects of a changing climate by providing some of the first evidence that the global increase in atmospheric CO2 might affect autotrophs and consumers in small stream ecosystems throughout the southern Great Plains and Gulf Coastal slope of North America. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Atmospheric CO2; Ecosystem function; Free air CO2 enrichment; Global change; Streams","alga; autotrophy; biome; bottom-up approach; carbon dioxide; climate change; food quality; food web; global change; mesocosm; nutrient uptake; primary production; water column; Great Plains; Gulf Coastal Plain; United States; algae; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73449103301

However, little is known of the spatial extension of highly active weathering regions and their proportion of global CO2-consumption. As those regions may be of significant importance for global climate change, global CO2-consumption is calculated here at high resolution, to adequately represent them. In previous studies global CO2-consumption is estimated using two different approaches: i) a reverse approach based on hydrochemical fluxes from large rivers and ii) a forward approach applying spatially explicit a function for CO2-consumption. The first approach results in an estimate without providing a spatial resolution for highly active regions and the second approach applied six lithological classes while including three sediment classes (shale, sandstone and carbonate rock) based at a 1° or 2° grid resolution. It remained uncertain, if the applied lithological classification schemes represent adequately CO2-consumption from sediments on a global scale. This is due to the large variability of sediment properties, their diagenetic history and the contribution from carbonates apparent in silicate dominated lithological classes. To address these issues, a CO2-consumption model, trained at high-resolution data, is applied here to a global vector based lithological map with 15 lithological classes. The calibration data were obtained from areas representing a wide range of weathering rates. Resulting global CO2-consumption by chemical weathering is similar to earlier estimates (237 Mt C a- 1) but the proportion of silicate weathering is 63%, and thus larger than previous estimates (49 to 60%). The application of the enhanced lithological classification scheme reveals that it is important to distinguish among the various types of sedimentary rocks and their diagenetic history to evaluate the spatial distribution of rock weathering. Results highlight the role of hotspots (&gt; 10 times global average weathering rates) and hyperactive areas (5 to 10 times global average rates). Only 9% of the global exorheic area is responsible for about 50% of CO2-consumption by chemical weathering (or if hotspots and hyperactive areas are considered: 3.4% of exorheic surface area corresponds to 28% of global CO2-consumption). The contribution of endorheic areas to the global CO2-consumption is with 3.7 Mt C a- 1 only minor. A significant impact on the global CO2-consumption rate can be expected if identified highly active areas are affected by changes in the overall spatial patterns of the hydrological cycle due to ongoing global climate change. Specifically if comparing the Last Glacial Maximum with present conditions it is probable that also the global carbon cycle has been affected by those changes. It is expected that results will contribute to improve global carbon and global circulation models. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Previous work established empirical functions for bicarbonate-flux and CO2-consumption in dependence of runoff for five to six lithological classes. These functions were applied in global studies. However, it has remained uncertain, if improvements can be achieved by considering further factors or by an enhanced lithological classification scheme. This study applies a new lithological map of Japan with an enhanced lithological classification, a hydrochemical data set representing 382 catchments (covering ∼ 44.4% of the Japanese Archipelago) and a multi-lithological model approach to predict bicarbonate-fluxes and CO2-consumption by chemical weathering. Because of significant carbonate contents in sediments (different from carbonate sedimentary rocks), acid plutonics and metamorphics, firstly a bicarbonate-flux model approach is established and, secondly, silicate and carbonate CO2-consumption is estimated, based on the geochemical composition of rocks. In accordance with previous studies on the catchment scale, the most important factors controlling bicarbonate-fluxes are lithology and runoff. The anion ratio HCO3-/(SO42- + Cl-) is identified as the third most important predictor, because anion sources and anion composition of river water have a great effect on bicarbonate concentrations. And last but not least, potential predictors such as gradient of slope, temperature and physical erosion explain some part of the observed bicarbonate-flux variation. These potential predictors have been discussed in literature, but quantification of the effects of these factors remains difficult due to their correlation with runoff and lithology. However, all tested models reproduce a total of observed bicarbonate-fluxes within 10% on the regional scale including the simplest model which recognizes only lithology and runoff as predictors. Model results suggest that bicarbonate-flux from the Japanese Archipelago is about 6.61 t C km- 2 a- 1, and CO2-consumption by chemical weathering is about 6.05 t C km- 2 a- 1 (91.6% of bicarbonate-flux). This CO2-consumption rate is 3.2 times above the global average rate. The silicate to carbonate CO2-consumption ratio is comparatively high. It amounts to 9.9 which is above the global value. The latter one being 1 to 1.5. Carbonate sedimentary rocks contribute only 1.3% to bicarbonate-fluxes due to their low areal proportion (0.2%). Acid volcanic rocks (VA) show the lowest bicarbonate-fluxes, on average, while basic and intermediate volcanics (VB) as well as pyroclastics (PY) are in the range of the Japanese average value. The carbonate weathering contribution to bicarbonate-fluxes from mixed sediments, siliciclastic sediments, metamorphics and acid plutonics is estimated to be 69.2%, 23.3%, 63.4% and 24.8%, respectively. Only an average carbonate CO2-consumption per lithological class is calculated because no function based on typical predictors could be established to calculate carbonate weathering contribution to silicate-dominated lithological classes. This can be attributed to large spatial differences in carbonate content in rocks and to corresponding contributions to bicarbonatefluxes. In the following, results are compared to bicarbonate-flux models of previous studies and identified differences are discussed. In conclusion, recognition of carbonate abundance in silicate-dominated lithological classes (including trace calcite) is important to calculate silicate/carbonate CO2-consumption ratios. Presented results are relevant for studies modelling CO2-consumption by chemical weathering in context of the global C-cycle. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The transport of timber from the forest to primary milling facilities may in particular create emissions that reduce the net sequestration value of product carbon storage. However, attempts to quantify the effects of transport on the net effects of forest management typically use relatively sparse survey data to determine transportation emission factors. We developed an approach for systematically determining transport emissions using: 1) -remotely sensed maps to estimate the spatial distribution of harvests, and 2) - industry data to determine landscape-level harvest volumes as well as the location and processing totals of individual mills. These data support spatial network analysis that can produce estimates of fossil carbon released in timber transport. Results: Transport-related emissions, evaluated as a fraction of transported wood carbon at 4 points in time on a landscape in western Montana (USA), rose from 0.5% in 1988 to 1.7% in 2004 as local mills closed and spatial patterns of harvest shifted due to decreased logging on federal lands. Conclusion: The apparent sensitivity of transport emissions to harvest and infrastructure patterns suggests that timber haul is a dynamic component of forest carbon management that bears further study both across regions and over time. The monitoring approach used here, which draws only from widely available monitoring data, could readily be adapted to provide current and historical estimates of transport emissions in a consistent way across large areas. © 2009 Healey et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71149088944

This layered perovskite exhibits a near-ideal checkerboard pattern of Co2+ / Co3+ charge order at temperatures below ∼800 K. Magnetic correlations are observed at temperatures below ∼60 K but the magnetic order only becomes established at 31 K, a temperature at which a kink is observed in the susceptibility. On warming above 31 K we observed a change in the magnetic correlations which we attribute either to a spin canting or to a change in the proportion of inequivalent magnetic domains. The magnetic excitation spectrum is dominated by an intense band extending above a gap of approximately 3 meV up to a maximum energy of 16 meV. A weaker band exists in the energy range of 20-30 meV. We show that the excitation spectrum is in excellent quantitative agreement with the predictions of a spin-wave theory generalized to include the full magnetic degrees of freedom of high-spin Co2+ ions in an axially distorted crystal field, coupled by Heisenberg exchange interactions. The magnetic order is found to be stabilized by dominant antiferromagnetic Co2+ - Co2+ interactions acting in a straight line through Co3+. No evidence is found for magnetic scattering from the Co3+ ions, supporting the view that Co3+ is in the S=0 state in this material. © 2009 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70749095112

Important measures to achieve this goal include reducing emissions of nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P2O5) from manure and mineral fertilizers into the environment. In regions with a high livestock density, this measure is expected to affect agricultural production and income. To quantify these effects, an environmental economic model is required that can assess alternatives capable of reducing N and P2O5 potential emissions to water. In this paper, we develop a model that is capable of analysing changes in potential emissions to water of N and P2O5 and apply it to the Netherlands, a country with large nutrient emissions. Compared to a 2015 reference scenario based on current efforts to reduce nutrient emissions, we found that the WFD measures will increase regional transport and export of manure and reduce the number of animals in the Netherlands. Fodder adjustments (defined as lower N and P2O5 input in purchased fodder) to decrease nutrient excretion in manure were a less attractive option than amongst others export, transportation of manure to another region, land use changes or reduction of the number of livestock. Compared to the reference scenario in 2015, total agricultural income will decrease by about €81.5 million per year (about €49/ha per year), although the effects will differ among parts of the Netherlands and agricultural sectors. The average predicted decrease in N emissions from agricultural sites, vulnerable to leaching into bodies of water will be almost 20% or approximately 14.7 kg N/ha per year. The reduction in N emissions to air from animal sheds, manure storage systems, application of animal manure and mineral fertilisers to the crops and grazing animals equals 6.5% or 5 kg ammonia (NH3) per hectare. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is unknown whether this phenomenon is explained by an air pollution-mediated increase in respiratory symptom severity or whether air pollutants decrease the efficacy of short-acting β-agonists (SABAs). Methods: We examined the relationship between the percentage change in FEV1 after SABA use with outdoor air pollution exposure in 85 children with asthma who were 7 to 12 years of age. Outdoor air pollution exposure was determined by measuring nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and fine particulate matter (ie, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter &lt; 2.5 μm [PM 2.5]) levels. These measurements were obtained from the Mexico City Automated Monitoring Network from network sites located within a 5-km radius of each child's home and school. Results: We found that a same-day interquartile increase of 10 parts per billion (ppb) in NO2 concentration was associated with a reduced response of FEV1 to SABA therapy (-15%; 95% CI, -29 to -0.5). This association was also significant when considering NO2 levels in each of the preceding 3 days. An interquartile O 3 increase (16 ppb) in the preceding fifth day was associated with a reduced response to SABA (-11%; 95% CI, -23 to -1); an interquartile PM 2.5 increase (14 μg/m3) was not associated with any significant reductions in the response to SABA therapy. These associations were not observed in children receiving therapy with inhaled corticosteroids. Conclusions: Our results suggest that recent exposure to NO2 and possibly O3 may reduce the response to SABAs in producing bronchodilation in children with asthma. The association between NO2 and FEV1 response to SABA administration may have important implications in understanding how outdoor air pollution levels relate to asthma control. © 2009 American College of Chest Physicians.",,"beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; corticosteroid; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; air pollutant; air pollution; article; asthma; bronchodilatation; child; drug efficacy; environmental exposure; female; forced expiratory volume; home; human; major clinical study; male; Mexico; particulate matter; priority journal; school; school child; spirometer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73149094075

Expert consensus holds that significant health effects are very likely. Public health and health care systems must understand these impacts to properly pursue preparedness and prevention activities. All of medicine will very likely be affected, and certain medical specialties are likely to be more significantly burdened based on their clinical activity, ease of public access, public health roles, and energy use profiles. These specialties have been called on to consider the likely impacts on their patients and practice and to prepare their practitioners. Emergency medicine (EM), with its focus on urgent and emergent ambulatory care, role as a safety-net provider, urban concentration, and broad-based clinical mission, will very likely experience a significant rise in demand for its services over and above current annual increases. Clinically, EM will see amplification of weather-related disease patterns and shifts in disease distribution. In EM's prehospital care and disaster response activities, both emergency medical services (EMS) activity and disaster medical assistance team (DMAT) deployment activities will likely increase. EM's public health roles, including disaster preparedness, emergency department (ED)-based surveillance, and safety-net care, are likely to face increasing demands, along with pressures to improve fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, EM's roles in ED and hospital management, particularly related to building and purchasing, are likely to be impacted by efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy efficiency.

Potential physical effects of climate change within the marine environment, including ocean acidification, changes in winds that drive upwelling and ocean circulation patterns, increasing global sea surface temperatures, and sea level rise, can result in dramatic changes within marine and coastal ecosystems. Often, marine resource managers feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of this issue and are therefore uncertain how to begin to take action. It may seem that they do not have the time, funding, or staff to take on a challenge as large as climate change, and fail to act as a result. Using NOAA's Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary as a case study, this paper outlines the need to act now and presents an easy-to-use process guide, providing managers options to incorporate effectively the influences of climate change into management strategies, as well as mitigate these influences through community outreach and a reduction in workplace emissions. © 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

ETS activity and respiratory carbon demand were measured for samples taken at seamount and open-ocean locations in order to probe the hypothesis of locally enhanced seamount productivity. ETS activity and biomass revealed no consistent diel patterns of feeding activity and vertical migration at Seine and Sedlo Seamounts. Spatial differences of biomass-specific ETS activity were observed at both seamounts and coincided with differences in food abundance and quality. At Seine Seamount in April 2004, biomass-specific ETS activity was on average higher at the seamount locations compared to the open ocean, though the enhancement was of a lower magnitude than spatial and temporal variability and had no apparent influence on zooplankton respiratory carbon demand or biomass. A persistent pattern of reduced zooplankton biomass above the summit location at Seine Seamount in April 2004 and July 2004 resulted in a local reduction of respiratory carbon demand. At Sedlo Seamount in November 2003, large spatial differences in biomass-specific ETS activity observed at the seamount locations resulted in a large range of respiratory carbon demand at the seamount, but were not reflected in zooplankton biomass. The depth-integrated (0-150 m) median respiratory carbon demand of the zooplankton community estimated from day and night hauls was 2.1 mg C m-2 d-1 at Seine Seamount (range: 0.3-6.3) and 2.9 mg C m-2 d-1 at Sedlo Seamount (range: 1.6-12.0). The sporadic nature and low magnitude of locally higher zooplankton respiration rates at the seamounts, which did not result in locally higher zooplankton standing stock biomass, lead us to reject the hypothesis that locally enhanced seamount productivity provides an autochthonous food supply to the resident faunas at Seine and Sedlo Seamounts. Instead, we conclude that the faunas at both seamounts are more likely supported by advection of food from the surrounding ocean. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Other proposals include extending the scope of the levy to emissions trading. This study applies an Integrated Assessment Model to gain insight in the interactions between adaptation costs, residual damages and mitigation costs and to analyse the effectiveness of a 2% levy on both the CDM and emissions trading from developing countries. We show that adaptation is especially important in lower income regions where damages are higher. The revenues of a 2% levy strongly depend on both the climate mitigation target and the burden-sharing regime. A more stringent climate mitigation target results in more emissions trade and, in the longer run, less need for adaptation. Both factors increase the share of adaptation costs that can be funded. The burden-sharing regime strongly affects the revenues of a 2% levy as well: relatively more stringent targets for developed countries increase the revenues of a 2% levy. However, in the next two decades the share of adaptation that can be financed remains well below 20% in most cases. Additional funding mechanisms are therefore necessary to substantially finance adaptation costs in developing countries. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In Brandenburg, increasing average annual temperature and decreasing precipitation in summer have already been observed. For this study, past trends and future effects of climate change on soil moisture dynamics in Brandenburg were investigated, considering regional and specific spatial impacts. Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) were focused on in particular. A decreasing trend in soil water content was shown for the past by analyzing simulation results from 1951 to 2003 using the integrated ecohydrological model SWIM [Krysanova, V., Müller-Wohlfeil, D.-I., Becker, A., 1998. Development and test of a spatially distributed hydrological/water quality model for mesoscale watersheds. Ecol. Model. 106, 261-289]. The trend was statistically significant for some areas, but not for the entire region. Simulated soil water content was particularly low in the extremely dry year 2003. Comparisons of simulated trends in soil moisture dynamics with trends in the average annual Palmer Drought Severity Index for the region showed largely congruent patterns, though the modeled soil moisture trends are characterized by a much higher spatial resolution. Regionally downscaled climate change projections representing the range between wetter and drier realizations were used to evaluate future trends of available soil water. A further decrease of average available soil water ranging from -4% to -15% was projected for all climate realizations up to the middle of the 21st century. An average decrease of more than 25 mm was simulated for 34% of the total area in the dry realization. Available soil water contents in SACs were generally higher and trends in soil moisture dynamics were lower mainly due to their favorable edaphic conditions. Stronger absolute and relative changes in the simulated trends for the past and future were shown for SACs within Brandenburg than for the state as a whole, indicating a high level of risk for many wetland areas. Nonetheless, soil water content in SACs is expected to remain higher than average under climate change conditions as well, and SACs therefore have an important buffer function under the projected climate change. They are thus essential for local climate and water regulation and their status as protected areas in Brandenburg should be preserved. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We extended the conventional approach used to conduct rebuilding analyses to evaluate the sensitivity of outputs from those analyses to two hypotheses about climate effects on recruitment (temporal autocorrelation due to unknown factors, and reduction in expected recruitment due to a delay in the date of spring transition) for an overfished stock, Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus). We found that catch limits, probabilities of rebuilding to target levels, and times for rebuilding were sensitive to assumptions about recruitment, and those assumptions may have an important influence on management decisions. The Pacific Fisheries Management Council currently makes trade-offs between time for rebuilding and catch limits using outputs of rebuilding analyses combined with social and economic considerations, but in the future, account could also be taken of information on climate effects on recruitment.

Coastal ecosystems are therefore sensitive to alteration of both the quantity and lability of terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM) delivered by rivers. The lability of DOM is thought to vary with age, with younger, relatively unaltered organic matter being more easily metabolized by aquatic heterotrophs than older, heavily modified material. This view is developed exclusively from work in watersheds where terrestrial plant and soil sources dominate streamwater DOM. Here we characterize streamwater DOM from 11 coastal watersheds on the Gulf of Alaska that vary widely in glacier coverage (0-64 per cent). In contrast to non-glacial rivers, we find that the bioavailability of DOM to marine microorganisms is significantly correlated with increasing 14 C age. Moreover, the most heavily glaciated watersheds are the source of the oldest (4 kyr 14 C age) and most labile (66 per cent bioavailable) DOM. These glacial watersheds have extreme runoff rates, in part because they are subject to some of the highest rates of glacier volume loss on Earth. We estimate the cumulative flux of dissolved organic carbon derived from glaciers contributing runoff to the Gulf of Alaska at 0.13 0.01 Tg yr-1 (1 Tg = 10 12 g), of which 0.10 Tg is highly labile. This indicates that glacial runoff is a quantitatively important source of labile reduced carbon to marine ecosystems. Moreover, because glaciers and ice sheets represent the second largest reservoir of water in the global hydrologic system, our findings indicate that climatically driven changes in glacier volume could alter the age, quantity and reactivity of DOM entering coastal oceans. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

To better predict these responses, complicated models are increasingly being developed to enable the study of feedback cycles. However, the sparseness of ecological data often limits the direct empirical parameterization of all model parameters. Here we use a Bayesian inverse analysis approach to synthesize empirical data and ecological theory derived from published studies of a coral atoll's enclosed pelagic ecosystem (Takapoto Atoll, French Polynesia). We then use the estimates of flux magnitudes to parameterize probabilistic compartment models with two forms of heterotrophic consumption: (1) ""bottom-up"" donor-controlled heterotrophic consumption and (2) ""top-down"" mass-action heterotrophic consumption. We explore how the flux magnitudes affect the ecosystem's stability properties of resilience, reactivity, and resistance under both assumptions for heterotrophic consumption. The models suggest that the microbial uptake of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) regulates the long term rate of return to steady state following a temporary or pulse perturbation (resilience), and the cycling of carbon between abiotic pools and heterotrophic compartments regulates the short-term response (reactivity). In the bottom-up process model, the sensitivity of steady state masses following a sustained or press perturbation (resistance) is highest for the DOC pool following a sustained change to the microbial uptake rate of DOC. Further, a change in the microbial uptake of DOC propagates through the ecosystem and affects the steady state values of zooplankton. The analysis suggests that the food web is highly dependent on the recycling between the abiotic and biotic carbon pools, particularly as mediated by the microbial consumption of DOC, and this recycling determines how the ecosystem responds to perturbations. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian inverse analysis; Biogeochemical flux; Food web; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Reactivity; Resilience; Resistance; Sensitivity analysis","Bayesian inverse analysis; Biogeochemical flux; Food web; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Reactivity; Resilience; Resistance; Biogeochemical fluxes; Food webs; Inverse analysis; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; Resilience; Analytical geochemistry; Bayesian networks; Biogeochemistry; Dissolution; Earnings; Food additives; Lakes; Markov processes; Monte Carlo methods; Organic carbon; Recycling; Sensitivity analysis; Stability; Aquatic ecosystems; Carbon; Earnings; Ecology; Electric resistance; Lakes; Markov processes; Organic carbon; Reactivity (nuclear); Recycling; Sensitivity analysis; Social networking (online); Stability; Ecosystems; Ecosystems; atoll; Bayesian analysis; carbon cycle; dissolved organic carbon; ecological theory; ecosystem resilience; food web; heterotrophy; inverse analysis; marine ecosystem; Markov chain; microbial activity; Monte Carlo analysis; parameterization; pelagic ecosystem; sensitivity analysis; zooplankton; French Polynesia; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; Polynesia; Takapoto; Tuamotu Archipelago; Anthozoa; Anthozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549120167

This new edition provides an up-to-date guide to the growing markets in South Asia. It offers an analysis of the changes and consequences of high sustainable growth, investigating what has been achieved in the region during the last ten years from a macroeconomic viewpoint, identifying new challenges and clearly defining what has driven the boom. The first part of the textbook presents an analysis of how South Asia is rated against Southeast and East Asia in recent decades in economic and social terms. The second part of the text focuses on South Asia's economic development over 1990s and mid-2000s, and the third and final part identifies those major governance issues, which were responsible for South Asia's underperformance both socially and economically. It is widely recognised that globalisation enhanced global trade, and that trade further increased the region's prosperity. Embracing the view that economists can no longer regard themselves as technocratic guardians of neutral policy advice, the book advocates for a shift in focus from policy reform per se to the more challenging task of implementing institutional reform that will invigorate the capability of the political leadership to bring about rapid, sustained and poverty-reducing growth in South Asia. The central task would be to re-direct the focus of governments in South Asia in order to ensure that the core functions of the state stable, non-distortionary policy climate, a secure foundation of law, investment in basic education, health and infrastructure, protection of the vulnerable and adapting with the climate change are efficiently provided. At the same time, the reform agenda must be sensitive to the goal of ensuring that durable democratic institutions, traditions and values are preserved. This is a fundamental challenge, but one that must be met in order to secure the emergence of a prosperous South Asia in the early part of the twenty-first century.

This affects both the energy consumption and the health of households. The traditional New Zealand household pattern of only heating one room of the house has been unchanged for decades, although there has been substantial market penetration of unflued gas heaters and more recently heat pumps. This paper describes the residential sector and the results of two community-based trials of housing and heating interventions that have been designed to measure the impact of (1) retrofitting insulation and (2) replacing unflued gas heaters and electric resistance heaters with heat pumps, wood pellet burners and flued gas heaters. The paper describes findings on the rebound effect or 'take-back'-the extent to which households take the gains from insulation and heating improvements as comfort (higher temperatures) rather than energy savings, and compares energy-saving patterns with those suggested by an earlier study. Findings on these aspects of household space heating are discussed in the context of the New Zealand government's policy drive for a more sustainable energy system, and the implications for climate change policy.

This study investigates the levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM) in the long-distance buses in Taiwan. Analytical results indicate that pollutants levels in long-distance buses are generally lower than those in urban buses. This finding is attributable to the driving speed and patterns of long-distance buses, as well as the meteorological and geographical features of the highway surroundings. The levels of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) found in bus cabins exceed the proposed indoor VOC guidelines for aromatic compounds, and are likely attributable to the interior trim in the cabins. The overall average CO level is 2.3 ppm, with higher average level on local streets (2.9 ppm) than on highways (2.2 ppm). The average CO2 level is 1493 ppm, which is higher than the guideline for non-industrial occupied settings. The average PM level in this study is lower than those in urban buses and IAQ guidelines set by Taiwan EPA. However, the average PM10 and PM2.5 is higher than the level set by WHO. Besides the probable causes mentioned above, fewer passenger movements and less particle re-suspension from bus floor might also cause the lower PM levels. Measurements of particle size distribution reveal that more than 75% of particles are in submicron and smaller sizes. These particles may come from the infiltration from the outdoor air. This study concludes that air exchange rates in long-distance buses should be increased in order to reduce CO2 levels. Future research on long-distance buses should focus on the emission of VOCs from brand new buses, and the sources of submicron particles in bus cabins. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, carbon corrosion caused by local fuel starvation and during a startup/shutdown (SUSD) procedure is investigated. The present model considers coupled transport of charged and non-charged species, and multiple electrochemical and chemical reactions. In the simulations, the same set of governing equations is solved for the local fuel starvation case and the SUSD case with appropriate boundary conditions and local properties applied to each case respectively. In the local fuel starvation case, a portion of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) is artificially set to have extremely low gas diffusivity in order to mimic the condition when locally the GDL is flooded by liquid water. For the SUSD case, a portion of the anode channel is filled with air, which simulates the purging/refilling in an SUSD procedure. Several mitigation techniques to reduce carbon corrosion are evaluated and it is found that for the local fuel starvation case, using OER (Oxygen Evolution Reaction)-favorable catalysts and using membranes with low O2 diffusivity are two effective techniques for carbon corrosion mitigation. For the SUSD case, using OER-favorable catalysts appears to be the only effective mitigation technique. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A reduced chemical mechanism is coupled with a CFD code in the multi-dimensional CFD model. The pressure profiles predicted by the multi-dimensional CFD model are more accurate than the single-zone model, because the wall heat transfer and in-cylinder turbulence flow are considered. During the combustion process the in-cylinder temperature distribution undergoes a process from inhomogeneity to homogeneity. Both low and high temperature reactions don't occur simultaneously throughout the cylinder. The low temperature reactions are initiated near the piston surface and squish region, and the high temperature reactions are initiated in the combustion chamber core zone and squish region.

The unburned fuel, CH2O and CO emission mainly resides in the bottom, middle and upper part of the piston-ring crevice region, respectively.

Better understanding of how nutrient conservation changes with variations in water availability is crucial for predicting the potential influence of global climate change on plant nutrient-use strategy. Here, green-leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations, N- and P-resorption proficiency (the terminal N and P concentration in senescent leaves, NRP and PRP, respectively), and N- and P-resorption efficiency (the proportional N and P withdrawn from senescent leaves prior to abscission, NRE and PRE, respectively) of Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel., a typical perennial grass species in northern China, were examined along a water supply gradient to explore how plant nutrient conservation responds to water change. Increasing water supply at low levels (< 9000 mL/year) increased NRP, PRP and PRE, but decreased green-leaf N concentration. It did not significantly affect green-leaf P concentration or NRE. By contrast, all N and P conservation indicators were not significantly influenced at high water supply levels (> 9000 mL/year). These results indicated that changes in water availability at low levels could affect leaf-level nutrient characteristics, especially for the species in semiarid ecosystems. Therefore, global changes in precipitation may pose effects on plant nutrient economy, and thus on nutrient cycling in the plant-soil systems. 2009 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Green-leaf nutrient concentration; Leymus chinensis; Nutrient conservation; Nutrient resorption; Water supply gradient","nitrogen; phosphorus; rain; water; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem response; grass; nitrogen cycle; nutrient availability; phosphorus cycle; resorption; semiarid region; soil water; water availability; absorption; article; biomass; cell aging; cytology; metabolism; plant leaf; Poaceae; soil; Absorption; Biomass; Cell Aging; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plant Leaves; Poaceae; Rain; Soil; Water; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Leymus chinensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449564473

Existing protocols generally require estimation of direct emissions (Scope 1) and emissions from direct purchases of energy (Scope 2), but focus less on indirect emissions upstream and downstream of the supply chain (optional Scope 3). Because on average more than 75% of an industry sector's carbon footprint is attributed to Scope 3 sources, better knowledge of Scope 3 footprints can help organizations pursue emissions mitigation projects not just within their own plants but also across their supply chain. In this work, Scope 3 footprints of U.S. economic sectors are categorized using an Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) model to identify upstream emission sources that are likely to contribute significantly to different sectors' footprints. The portions of the upstream footprint captured by the sector's top-10 upstream suppliers are estimated at 3 different levels of specificity: general economy-wide, industry specific, and sector specific. The results show that enterprises can capture a large portion of their total upstream carbon footprint by collecting full emissions information from only a handful of direct suppliers, and Scope 3 footprint capture rates can be improved considerably by sector-specific categorization. Employee commuting and air transportation may be more important (7%-30%) for the services industries, but should not be a focus of detailed Scope 3 footprint estimates for the manufacturing industries (<1% of the total analyzed footprint). Protocol organizations should actively make more specific Scope 3 guidelines available for their constituents by developing sector-specific categorizations for as many sectors as they feasibly can and create broader industry-specific protocols for others. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Capture rate; Carbon footprint; Direct emissions; Economic input-output life cycle assessments; Economic sectors; Emission sources; Emissions mitigation; Footprinting; General economy; Industry sectors; Manufacturing industries; Specific protocol; Air transportation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Purchasing; Societies and institutions; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Leakage (fluid); carbon; ecological footprint; emission inventory; environmental modeling; greenhouse gas; guideline; input-output analysis; life cycle analysis; service sector; article; economic aspect; greenhouse gas; human; life cycle assessment; model; organization; practice guideline; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Industry; Models, Theoretical; Public Policy; United States; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72249114031

Using GHG accounting based on input-output models from Australia and the United States, this work presents specific case study examples and general results for broad industry sectors in both economies to address the development of a complete upstream carbon footprint for screening purposes. This is followed by an analysis of the issues surrounding application of cut-off thresholds and the relationship with system capture rate and efforts in carbon footprint analysis. This knowledge can inform decision makers about where to expend effort in gaining progressively greater accuracy for informed purchasing, investing, claiming carbon credits, and policy-making. The results from this work elucidate several findings: while it is probably true that some companies will know what sources contribute most significantly in the supply chain, this is not likely to be true for all. Contrary to common perception, scope 1&2 emissions are not always more significant than scope-3 sources, and, for some sectors, the largest sources of emissions may be buried further upstream than many companies may have previously perceived. Compiling a list of core elements of significance across all sectors may be problematic because these elements are not necessarily significant for most sectors. Lastly, the application of cut-off thresholds results in highly variable performance in footprint capture rate and is not a reliable criterion for including emission sources in GHG footprints. Input-output analysis is a powerful tool in informing supply-chain GHG accounting, and there is a need for plain language education, training, support materials and information to be made easily accessible to a global business community. © 2009 The International Input-Output Association.","Carbon footprint; GHG accounting; Input-output analysis; Structural path analysis","carbon emission; ecological footprint; emission inventory; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; input-output analysis; numerical model; path analysis; Australia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949342469

Mutations of basic amino acids within IC do not perturb the membrane position, but reduce shedding of the CA IX ectodomain as well as CA IX-mediated cell dissociation.

Although the UK government has not set specific targets for emission reduction or accessibility for the transport sector, all local highway authorities in England are now required to set out five year programmes with commitments on progress on four national shared priorities, which include the reduction of polluting emissions from transport and improved public transport. Transport practitioners have a key role to ensure that the foundations are laid now for the transport sector to be in a position to offer an integrated, resource efficient transport system in urban areas. Research has indicated that the principal barriers to achieving more sustainable transport strategies are poor policy integration and coordination, counterproductive institutional roles, unsupportive regulatory frameworks, weaknesses in pricing, poor data quality and quantity, limited public support and lack of political resolve. This paper reports on a study examining the efficacy of the decision support tools available to local transport officers to achieve more sustainable transport options in 16 local authorities in the UK. Results from two questionnaires and a series of follow-up interviews are combined over a four year period to identify where significant support to transport officers is needed.

In particular there is a clear difference between discourse as knowledge and discourse as ideology. Epistemically the two are very different, with each making different types of claim. The paper examines the influence of an ideological discourse on international forest policy, namely neoliberalism. A variant of classical liberalism, neoliberalism emphasises an increased role for markets, an enhanced role for the private sector and voluntary regulation. It is argued that all three of these principles have systemically penetrated the international soft law on forests that has been negotiated since 1992 and up and including the 2007 Non-Legally Binding Instrument on all Types of Forests. Neoliberal policies also underpin forest certification schemes and the tradeable emission permits systems adopted under the Kyoto Protocol and the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme. Adopting a Foucauldian approach the paper views the construction of neoliberal discourse and its reiteration in the forests issue area as an expression of power that establishes the limits of international forest policy, tending towards certain policies and inhibiting the selection of others. It is argued that contrary to what is often asserted, neoliberalism depends on a strong state, one that introduces market-based disciplines to new areas and creates political space that can be occupied by private sector businesses. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

By examining outcomes in cases of water shortage, legal mechanisms promoting adaptation can be identified and suggestions made for improving those which potentially increase vulnerability. Design/methodology/approach – This paper explores several case studies situated in Western Canada, identified during interviews relating to a broader theme of water governance adaptation as part of the Institutional Adaptation to Climate Change (IACC) Project as well as other case studies carried out in the larger IACC project relating to the institutional adaptation to climate change in Canada and Chile. The outcomes of these case studies are examined in relation to their effect on vulnerability and their inter-relationship to established principles of water law. Findings – This examination provides insight into the actual workings of water law in resolving water conflicts and important modifications in the institution of water law which will increase adaptive capacity.

Ocean weather includes phenomena such as meandering currents and fronts, eddies, the surface mixed layer and sea surface temperature (SST), equatorial and coastally trapped waves, upwelling of cold water, and Rossby waves, all influencing ocean variables such as temperature (T), salinity (S), currents, and sea surface height (SSH). Adequate real-time data input, computing power, numerical ocean models, data assimilation capabilities, atmospheric forcing, and bathymetric/boundary constraints are essential to make such prediction possible. The key observing systems and real-time data inputs are SSH from satellite altimetry, satellite and in situ SST, T, or T and S profiles (e.g., Argo, TAO/Triton, PIRATA moored array in the Atlantic, bathythermographs), and atmospheric forcing. The ocean models dynamically interpolate data in conjunction with data assimilation, convert atmospheric forcing into oceanic responses, and forecast the ocean weather, applying bathymetric/ boundary constraints in the process. The results are substantially influenced by ocean model simulation skill and it is advantageous to use an ocean model that is eddy-resolving (nominally 1/10° or finer), not just eddy-permitting. Because the most abundant ocean observations are satellite surface data, and subsurface data are very sparse in relation to the spatial scales of the mesoscale ocean features that dominate the ocean interior, downward projection of surface data is a key challenge in ocean data assimilation. The need for accurate prediction of ocean features that are inadequately observed, such as mixed layer depth, places a major burden on the ocean model, data assimilation, and atmospheric forcing. The sensitivity of ocean phenomena to atmospheric forcing and the time scale for response affect the time scale for oceanic predictive skill, sensitivity to the initial state versus the atmospheric forcing as a function of forecast length, and thus oceanic data requirements and prediction system design. Outside of surface boundary layers and shallow regions, forecast skill is about one month globally and over many subregions, and is only modestly reduced by using climatological forcing after the end of atmospheric forecasts versus using analysis-quality forcing for the duration. In addition, global ocean prediction systems must demonstrate the ability to provide initial and boundary conditions to nested regional and coastal models that enhance their predictive skill. Demonstrations of feasibility in relation to the preceding phenomena, requirements, and challenges are drawn from the following global and basin-scale ocean prediction systems: BLUElink> (Australia), the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM; USA), Mercator (France), Multivariate Ocean Variational Estimation/Meteorological Research Institute Community Ocean Model (MOVE/MRI.COM; Japan), and the Naval Research Laboratory Layered Ocean Model (NLOM; USA). © 2009 by The Oceanography Society.

The radiative forcings and coupled interactions and feedbacks among the climate system components are critical for decadal-to-centennial predictions. These coupled model integrations are initialized from an arbitrary and relatively stable climate state obtained from a several-century control integration.

It is therefore likely that enrichment of the ocean with anthropogenic CO2 and attendant acidification will have large consequences for marine nutrient biogeochemistry, and for the microbes that mediate many key nutrient transformations. The best available evidence suggests that the nitrogen cycle may respond strongly to higher CO2 through increases in global N2 fixation and possibly denitrification, as well as potential decreases in nitrification. These trends could cause nitrification to become a nitrogen cycle ""bottleneck,"" by increasing the flux of N2 fixed into ammonium while decreasing the fraction being oxidized to nitrite and nitrate. The consequences could include reduced supplies of oxidized nitrogen substrates to denitrifiers, lower levels of nitrate-supported new primary production, and expansion of the regenerated production system accompanied by shifts in current phytoplankton communities. The phosphorus and silicon cycles seem less likely to be directly affected by enhanced CO2 conditions, but will undoubtedly respond indirectly to changing carbon and nitrogen biogeochemistry. A review of culture experiments that examined the effects of increased CO2 on elemental ratios of phytoplankton suggests that for most cyanobacteria and eukaryotes, C:N and N:P ratios will either remain at Redfield values or increase substantially. Natural plankton community CO2 manipulation experiments show much more mixed outcomes, with both increases and decreases in C:N and N:P ratios reported at future CO2 levels. We conclude our review with projections of overall trends in the cycles of nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon over the next century as they respond to the steady accumulation of fossil-fuel-derived CO2 in a rapidly changing ocean.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955581357

Increased volcanism occurs in deglaciating regions. Causal mechanisms could include an increase in magma production owing to the mantle decompression caused by ablation of glaciers and ice caps or a more general pacing of when eruptions occur by the glacial variability. A corollary is that ocean ridge volcanic production should decrease with the rising sea level during deglaciation, with the greatest effect at slow spreading ridges. CO2 output from the increased subaerial volcanism appears large enough to influence glacial/interglacial CO2 variations. We estimate subaerial emissions during deglaciation to be between 1000 and 5000 Gt of CO2 above the long term average background flux, assuming that emissions are proportional to the frequency of eruptions. After accounting for equilibration with the ocean, this additional CO2 flux is consistent in timing and magnitude with ice core observations of a 40 ppm increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration during the second half of the last deglaciation. Estimated decreases in CO2 output from ocean ridge volcanoes compensate for only 20% of the increased subaerial flux. If such a large volcanic output of CO2 occurs, then volcanism forges a positive feedback between glacial variability and atmospheric CO2 concentrations: deglaciation increases volcanic eruptions, raises atmospheric CO2, and causes more deglaciation. Such a positive feedback may contribute to the rapid passage from glacial to interglacial periods. Conversely, waning volcanic activity during an interglacial could lead to a reduction in CO2 and the onset of an ice age. Whereas glacial/interglacial variations in CO2 are generally attributed to oceanic mechanisms, it is suggested that the vast carbon reservoirs associated with the solid Earth may also play an important role. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The mutated enzymes have the dimeric species but the equilibrium between monomer and dimer for these mutants varies from each other, implying that these residues might contribute differently to the dimer stability. Thermal and urea-induced unfolding profiles for wild-type and mutant enzymes appeared as a two-state transition and three-state transition, respectively.

The simulation used a time-dependent, axisymmetric computational model and a low Mach number approximation. Reaction rates were calculated from a two-step global reaction mechanism that considered six species. Studies were conducted with fixed initial velocities for three different cases of CO2 introduction: (1) without dilution, (2) dilution in a fuel stream, and (3) dilution in an oxidizer stream. A single vortex was generated by an axisymmetric jet driven of cold fuel, after a flame development was reached to quasi steady-state condition. The simulation shows that CO2 dilution in a fuel stream leads to a slightly increased vortex radius and more entrainment of surrounding fluids compared to the other dilution methods tested. Thus, dilution of CO2 in a fuel stream enhances the mixing inside a single vortex and increases the stretching of the flame surface. The vorticity transport equation budgets were examined to reveal the mechanisms of vortex formation in the presence of CO2. In the stage of vortex formation, vortex production due to baroclinic torque and vortex destruction due to volumetric expansion were found to be greater in the case of CO2 dilution in a fuel stream than in the other dilution cases. However, after vortex formation, there terms showed the opposite tendencies. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In addition to carbon supply to underlying sediments, the persistent, intermediate depth nepheloid layers emanating from the continental shelves, and bottom nepheloid layers maintained by strong bottom currents associated with the southward flowing Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC), provide conduits for export of organic carbon over the margin and/or to the interior ocean. As a part of a project to understand dynamics of particulate organic carbon (POC) cycling in this region, we examined the bulk and molecular properties of time-series sediment trap samples obtained at 968 m, 1976 m, and 2938 m depths from a bottom-tethered mooring on the New England slope (water depth, 2988 m). Frequent occurrences of higher fluxes in deep relative to shallower sediment traps and low Δ14C values of sinking POC together provide strong evidence for significant lateral transport of aged organic matter over the margin. Comparison of biogeochemical properties such as aluminum concentration and flux, and iron concentration between samples intercepted at different depths shows that particles collected by the deepest trap had more complex sources than the shallower ones. These data also suggest that at least two modes of lateral transport exist over the New England margin. Based on radiocarbon mass balance, about 30% (±10%) of sinking POC in all sediment traps is estimated to be derived from lateral transport of resuspended sediment. A strong correlation between Δ14C values and aluminum concentrations suggests that the aged organic matter is associated with lithogenic particles. Our results suggest that lateral transport of organic matter, particularly that resulting from sediment resuspension, should be considered in addition to vertical supply of organic matter derived from primary production, in order to understand carbon cycling and export over continental margins. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Transmissometry profiles reveal that particle abundances exhibit considerable fine structure, with several distinct layers of elevated suspended particulate matter concentration at intermediate water depths in addition to the presence of a thick bottom nepheloid layer at each station. Excluding surface water samples, the Δ14C values of particulate organic carbon (POC) indicated the presence of a pre-aged component in the suspended POC pool (Δ14C&lt;+38‰). The Δ14C values at the 3000 m station exhibited greater variability and generally were lower than those at the other two stations where the values decreased in a more systematic matter with increasing sampling depth. These lower Δ14C values were consistent with higher relative abundances of terrigenous long-chain fatty acids at this station than at the other two stations. Two scenarios were considered regarding the potential provenances of laterally transported POC: cross-shelf transport of shelf sediment (Δ14C=-140‰) and along-slope transport of the slope sediment proximal to the sampling locations (Δ14C=-260‰). Depending on the scenario, isotopic mass balance calculations indicate allochthonous POC contributions ranging between 15% and 54% in the meso- and bathy-pelagic zone, with the highest proportions at the 3000 m station. Alkenone-derived temperatures recorded on suspended particles from surface waters closely matched in-situ temperatures at each station. However, alkenone-derived temperatures recorded on particles from the subsurface layer down to 250 m were lower than those of overlying surface waters, especially at the 3000 m station, implying supply of phytoplankton organic matter originally produced in cooler surface waters. AVHRR images and temperature profiles indicate that the stations were under the influence of a warm-core ring during the sampling period. The low alkenone-derived temperatures in the subsurface layer coupled with the lower Δ14C values for the corresponding POC suggests supply of OC on resuspended sediments underlying cooler surface waters distal to the study area, possibly further north or west. Taken together, variations in Δ14C values, terrigenous fatty acid abundances, and alkenone-derived temperatures among the stations suggest that input of laterally advected OC is a prominent feature of POC dynamics on the NW Atlantic margin, and is spatially heterogeneous on a scale smaller than the distance between the stations (&lt;150 km). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As indoor measurements in individual homes are not feasible in large epidemiological studies, we evaluated the potential of using readily available data to predict infiltration of ambient PM2.5into residences. Indoor and outdoor light scattering measurements were collected for 84 homes in Seattle, Washington, USA, and Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, to estimate residential infiltration efficiencies. Meteorological variables and spatial property assessment data (SPAD), containing detailed housing characteristics for individual residences, were compiled for both study areas using a geographic information system. Multiple linear regression was used to construct models of infiltration based on these data. Heating (October to February) and non-heating (March to September) season accounted for 36% of the yearly variation in detached residential infiltration. Two SPAD housing characteristic variables, low building value, and heating with forced air, predicted 37% of the variation found between detached residential infiltration during the heating season. The final model, incorporating temperature and the two SPAD housing characteristic variables, with a seasonal interaction term, explained 54% of detached residential infiltration. Residences with low building values had higher infiltration efficiencies than other residences, which could lead to greater exposure gradients between low and high socioeconomic status individuals than previously identified using only ambient PM2.5concentrations. This modeling approach holds promise for incorporating infiltration efficiencies into large epidemiology studies, thereby reducing exposure misclassification. © 2009 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.","Exposure; Indoor; Infiltration; Particulate matter; Residential.","ambient air; article; Canada; environmental exposure; home; indoor air pollution; mathematical model; meteorology; multiple linear regression analysis; residential area; suspended particulate matter; United States; Air Pollutants; British Columbia; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Particle Size; Washington",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69249229778

For the purpose of improving avalanche safety, we studied the snow climate characteristics using meteorological and snow pit data collected from two study plots in the mountain regions. Ten years of meteorological data and 4-10 years of snow pit data were employed in the study. A snow climate classification scheme proposed in North America was used to determine the snow climate of these study plots. The general snowpack characteristics for each snow climate presented in previous studies were used in the present study to determine the snowpack characteristics of the study plots. Both meteorological and snow pit data suggested that the Japan Sea side mountains have the same characteristics as the maritime snow climate in North America. On the other hand, the Pacific Ocean side mountains have unique characteristics caused by a combination of continental and maritime climate influences. The Pacific Ocean side mountains have similar characteristics to the continental snow climate of North America, however, that climate is different in that it is characterized by a large amount of rainfall and a high predominance of faceted crystals and wet grains.

However, mowing can also affect belowground conditions. By decreasing plant carbon supply to soil, mowing can suppress the activity of soil decomposers, diminish plant nutrient availability and thus create a feedback on plant growth. In this study, we first documented the effects of three-year mowing on plant community structure in a species-rich grassland. We found that mowing decreased the total areal cover of woody plants and increased the total cover of leguminous forbs. At the species level, mowing further increased the cover of two non-leguminous forbs, Prunella vulgaris and Sagina procumbens. Mowing did not affect the species number, diversity or evenness of the plant community. To study whether any of these effects could be explained by mowing-induced changes in the soil, and particularly by reduced nutrient availability, we then collected soil from different treatment plots and monitored the growth of nine plant species in these soils in a greenhouse. Plant growth did not differ between soils collected from mowed and unmowed plots, suggesting that our mowing regimes did not impose such changes in soil decomposer activity and nutrient supply that would feedback on plant growth. Moreover, each of the nine species responded equally to the different nutrient availability in different parts of the grassland, which indicates that even if mowing had reduced plant nutrient supply, this would not have led to changes in plant community structure. It appears that those changes in aboveground vegetation that we recorded after three years of mowing were purely due to the aboveground effects, such as frequent cutting of woody plants and enhanced light availability for low-growing forbs. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

To reduce uncertainties of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of agricultural soils in subtropical ecosystem, a four years campaign was started to determine the temporal GHG (CO2 and CH4) fluxes from seven sites of four land use types (1 vegetable field, 3 uplands, 2 orchards, 1 pine forest). The mean annual budgets of CO2, and CH4 were 6.5∼10.5 Mg CO2 ha-1 yr-1, and +0.47 ∼ -2.37 kg CH4 ha-1 yr-1, respectively. Pine forest had significantly lower CO2 emission and higher CH4 uptake than agriculture land uses. Tilled orchard emitted more CO2 and oxidized less CH4 than non-tilled orchard. Upland crops had higher CO2 emissions than orchards, while abrupt differences of CH4 uptake were observed between upland crops and orchards. Every year, the climate was warm and wet from April to September (the hot-humid season) and became cool and dry from October to March (the cool-dry season). Driven by seasonality of temperature and WFPS, CO2 fluxes were significantly higher in the hot-humid season than in cool-dry season. Soil temperature, WFPS, NO3--N and NH4+-N contents interactively explained CH4 uptake which was significantly higher in cool-dry season than in hot-humid season. We conclude that soil C fluxes from different land uses are strongly under control of different climatic predictors along with soil nutrient status, which interact in conjunction with each other to supply the readily available substrates. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to ascertain mass distributions of different SOC pools influenced by land use and evaluate their relationships with carbon mineralization and different soil properties, a 62-day laboratory incubation under a range of moisture (20 to 100% of water-holding capacity) and temperature conditions (5-45 °C) was conducted to measure CO2 evolution from four land-use types, and data from the incubation study were fitted to a three-pool first-order model that separated mineralizable soil organic carbon into active, slow and resistant carbon pools. The results indicate that: (1) The active carbon pool comprised 1.2-3.5% of SOC with a mean residence time of 49-65 days, (2) The slow carbon pool comprised 25.3-60% of SOC with a mean residence time of 2-27 yr, (3) The resistant pool accounted for 36.5-73.9% of SOC in four land-use types. The woodland had the highest resistant carbon pool and lowest active carbon pool, which indicates it to be more stable than other land-use types. Soil carbon derived respiration was well correlated with all the organic carbon pools as well as C:N ratio and soil derived respiration. SOC was positively correlated with slow and resistant carbon pool, and soil derived respiration. CO2 emissions increased (r2 = 0.273-0.544, P &lt; 0.0001) with increasing temperature (up to 40 °C), with emissions reduced at the lowest and highest soil moisture contents. The Q10 values (the factor by which respiration rate increase for a 10 °C increase in temperature) (from 5 °C to 45 °C, at 60% of water-holding capacity) of 1.9 ± 0.2, 2.2 ± 0.3, 2.3 ± 0.3, and 3.2 ± 0.5 were observed for paddy, orchard, woodland and upland, respectively, and decreased with decreasing moisture content when soil water content was less than its optimum value, but an opposite trend was shown when soil retained water at contents higher than the optimum water content. Inclusion of both moisture and temperature in our multiple polynomial models resulted in much better predictions of CO2 (r2 = 0.70-0.78, P &lt; 0.0001) emissions than predictions obtained using temperature (r2 = 0.27-0.54, P &lt; 0.01) or moisture (r2 = 0.29-0.45, P &lt; 0.01) alone. Our study indicates that vegetation type and/or management practices which control soil biological and biochemical properties, were important predictors of C fluxes in this short-term experiment. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper analyzes implications of decentralized forest management for the implementation of REDD. Three possible options for the involvement of local governments in the implementation of REDD are: 1) the central government decides on a national reference level and devolves the implementation to local governments; 2) the central government decides on a national reference level and seeks expressions of interest from local governments to implement REDD in their administrative areas; and 3) the central and local governments decide on a national reference level jointly and local governments implement REDD activities locally.

Man-induced climate-chemistry interaction is a two-way process: Emissions of pollutants change the atmospheric composition contributing to climate change through the aforementioned climate components, and climate change, through changes in temperature, dynamics, the hydrological cycle, atmospheric stability, and biosphere-atmosphere interactions, affects the atmospheric composition and oxidation processes in the troposphere. Here we present progress in our understanding of processes of importance for climate-chemistry interactions, and their contributions to changes in atmospheric composition and climate forcing. A key factor is the oxidation potential involving compounds like O3 and the hydroxyl radical (OH). Reported studies represent both current and future changes. Reported results include new estimates of radiative forcing based on extensive model studies of chemically active climate compounds like O3, and of particles inducing both direct and indirect effects. Through EU projects like ACCENT, QUANTIFY, and the AeroCom project, extensive studies on regional and sector-wise differences in the impact on atmospheric distribution are performed. Studies have shown that land-based emissions have a different effect on climate than ship and aircraft emissions, and different measures are needed to reduce the climate impact. Several areas where climate change can affect the tropospheric oxidation process and the chemical composition are identified. This can take place through enhanced stratospheric-tropospheric exchange of ozone, more frequent periods with stable conditions favoring pollution build up over industrial areas, enhanced temperature induced biogenic emissions, methane releases from permafrost thawing, and enhanced concentration through reduced biospheric uptake. During the last 5-10 years, new observational data have been made available and used for model validation and the study of atmospheric processes. Although there are significant uncertainties in the modeling of composition changes, access to new observational data has improved modeling capability. Emission scenarios for the coming decades have a large uncertainty range, in particular with respect to regional trends, leading to a significant uncertainty range in estimated regional composition changes and climate impact. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is widely distributed in Nature and has been isolated from certain species of bacteria, fungi, invertebrates and plants, which are capable of surviving in a dehydrated state for months or years and subsequently being revived after a few hours of being in contact with water. This disaccharide has many biotechnological applications, as its physicochemical properties allow it to be used to preserve foods, enzymes, vaccines, cells etc., in a dehydrated state at room temperature. One of the most striking findings a decade ago was the discovery of the genes involved in trehalose biosynthesis, present in a great number of organisms that do not accumulate trehalose to significant levels. In plants, this disaccharide has diverse functions and plays an essential role in various stages of development, for example in the formation of the embryo and in flowering. Trehalose also appears to be involved in the regulation of carbon metabolism and photosynthesis. Recently it has been discovered that this sugar plays an important role in plant-microorganism interactions. © 2009 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International.","Abiotic stress; Anhydrobiosis; Arabidopsis; Dehydration; Drought tolerance; Osmoprotectant; Sugar sensing; Transgenic plants; Trehalose","cosmetic; disaccharide; DNA polymerase; food additive; glucose; polydeoxyribonucleotide synthase; polyglutamine; restriction endonuclease; sugar; trehalose; water; abiotic stress; anhydrobiosis; Arabidopsis; bacterium; biosynthesis; carbon metabolism; dehydration; drought tolerance; embryo; enzyme activity; flowering; food preservation; food storage; fungus; human; Huntington chorea; invertebrate; nonhuman; osteoporosis; photosynthesis; plant; plant microorganism interaction; review; room temperature; soil microflora; tissue preservation; transgenic plant; abiotic stress; anhydrobiosis; arabidopsis; dehydration; drought tolerance; osmoprotectant; sugar sensing; transgenic plants; trehalose; Animals; Bacteria; Fungi; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Osmoregulation; Plant Diseases; Plants; Signal Transduction; Soil Microbiology; Symbiosis; Trehalose; Arabidopsis; Fungi; Invertebrata; abiotic stress; anhydrobiosis; arabidopsis; dehydration; drought tolerance; osmoprotectant; sugar sensing; transgenic plants; trehalose",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350050093

Split injection is one of the most powerful tools that decrease soot and NOx emissions simultaneously. At the present work, the effect of split injection on the combustion process and emissions of a direct-injection diesel engine under full-load conditions is investigated by the commercial CFD code AVL-FIRE. The study of injection timing and split injection parameters, including the delay dwell and the fuel quantity injected between injection pulses is carried out. Three different split injection schemes, in which 10-20-25 % of total fuel is injected in the second pulse, have been considered. The results show that 25 % of total fuel injected in the second pulse, reduces the total soot and NOx emissions effectively in DI diesel engines. In addition, the optimum delay dwell between the pulses is about 25°CA. The predicted values of combustion process, emission and delay dwell by this CFD model show a good agreement with the corresponding data of multi-zone phenomenological combustion model in the literature.","Combustion; Emission; NOx; Soot; Split injection","Combustion; Dust; Fuel injection; Fuel purification; Fuels; Smoke; Soot; CFD codes; CFD models; Combustion emissions; Combustion model; Combustion pro-cess; DI diesel engine; Direct injection diesel engines; Fuel quantity; Full-load; Injection pulse; Injection timing; Multi-dimensional modeling; NOx Emissions; Pollutant emission; Split injection; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73949121253

Here we describe the microbial analysis of an enrichment obtained in a novel submerged-membrane bioreactor system and capable of high-rate AOM (286 μmol gdry weight-1 day-1) coupled to sulfate reduction. By constructing a clone library with subsequent sequencing and fluorescent in situ hybridization, we showed that the responsible methanotrophs belong to the ANME-2a subgroup of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea, and that sulfate reduction is most likely performed by sulfate-reducing bacteria commonly found in association with other ANME-related archaea in marine sediments. Another relevant portion of the bacterial sequences can be clustered within the order of Flavobacteriales but their role remains to be elucidated. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses showed that the ANME-2a cells occur as single cells without close contact to the bacterial syntrophic partner. Incubation with 13C-labelled methane showed substantial incorporation of 13C label in the bacterial C16 fatty acids (bacterial; 20%, 44% and 49%) and in archaeal lipids, archaeol and hydroxyl-archaeol (21% and 20% respectively). The obtained data confirm that both archaea and bacteria are responsible for the anaerobic methane oxidation in a bioreactor enrichment inoculated with Eckernförde bay sediment. © 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"methane; RNA 16S; sea water; sulfate; anaerobic growth; archaebacterium; article; biodiversity; bioreactor; classification; genetics; Gram negative anaerobic bacteria; metabolism; microbiology; phylogeny; sediment; Anaerobiosis; Archaea; Biodiversity; Bioreactors; Geologic Sediments; Methane; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater; Sulfates; Sulfur-Reducing Bacteria; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Flavobacteriales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71249123618

In this study, two versions of the terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycle components of the Integrated Science Assessment Model (ISAM) are used to evaluate how variation in nitrogen availability influences terrestrial carbon sinks and sources in response to changes over the 20th century in global environmental factors including atmospheric CO2 concentration, nitrogen inputs, temperature, precipitation and land use. The two versions of ISAM vary in their treatment of nitrogen availability: ISAM-NC has a terrestrial carbon cycle model coupled to a fully dynamic nitrogen cycle while ISAM-C has an identical carbon cycle model but nitrogen availability is always in sufficient supply. Overall, the two versions of the model estimate approximately the same amount of global mean carbon uptake over the 20th century. However, comparisons of results of ISAM-NC relative to ISAM-C reveal that nitrogen dynamics: (1) reduced the 1990s carbon sink associated with increasing atmospheric CO2 by 0.53 PgC yr -1 (1 Pg = 1015g), (2) reduced the 1990s carbon source associated with changes in temperature and precipitation of 0.34 PgC yr -1 in the 1990s, (3) an enhanced sink associated with nitrogen inputs by 0.26 PgC yr-1, and (4) enhanced the 1990s carbon source associated with changes in land use by 0.08 PgC yr in the 1990s. These effects of nitrogen limitation influenced the spatial distribution of the estimated exchange of CO2 with greater sink activity in high latitudes associated with climate effects and a smaller sink of CO2 in the southeastern United States caused by N limitation associated with both CO 2 fertilization and forest regrowth. These results indicate that the dynamics of nitrogen availability are important to consider in assessing the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of terrestrial carbon sources and sinks.

This tool allows comprehensive analysis of alternative systems for management of biomass waste and bioenergy production in regional areas. Different possible options for processing a range of biomass waste streams can be evaluated against multiple criteria including various environmental impacts and cost-effectiveness. The objective is to support the design of integrated biomass waste and bioenergy systems that maximise synergies and optimise tradeoffs between bioenergy production, GHG emissions, recycling of valuable soil nutrients and control of harmful contaminants. This analytical tool is applied to a major agricultural region in Australia, the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area.

As a result, the number of differential and algebraic equations required to determine the constrained-equilibrium state of a system can be very much smaller than the number of species in the system. It follows that only reactions which change constraints are required to determine the dynamic evolution of the system and all other reactions are in equilibrium. The accuracy of the method depends on both the character and number of constraints employed and issues involved in the selection and transformation of the constraints are discussed. A method for determining the initial conditions for highly non-equilibrium systems is also presented. The method is illustrated by applying it to the oxidation of methane (CH4), methanol (CH3OH), and formaldehyde (CH2O) in a constant volume adiabatic chamber over a wide range of initial temperatures, pressures, and equivalence ratios. The RCCE calculations were carried out using 8-12 constraints and 133 reactions. Good agreement with ""Detailed Kinetic Model"" (DMK) calculations using 29 species and 133 reactions was obtained. The number of reactions in the RCCE calculations could be reduced to 20 for CH4, 16 for CH3OH, and 12 for CH2O without changing the results significantly affecting the agreement. It may be noted that a DKM with 29 species requires a minimum of 29 reactions. © 2009 The Combustion Institute.","Detailed modeling; Formaldehyde; Maximum entropy principle; Methane; Methanol; Rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium; Reduced kinetics","Carbon fuels; Changing constraints; Combustion modeling; Constant volumes; Detailed kinetics; Detailed modeling; Differential and algebraic equations; Dynamic evolution; Equilibrium state; Equivalence ratios; Initial conditions; Internal dynamics; Maximum entropy principle; Nonequilibrium system; Number of species; Oxidation of methane; Rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium; Rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium methods; Reacting system; Reduced kinetics; Entropy; Formaldehyde; Maximum principle; Methane; Structures (built objects); Methanol; formaldehyde; methane; methanol; article; chemical reaction kinetics; combustion; controlled study; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; priority journal; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69349102439

However, the environmental factors determining their activity and community structure in different soils are still not fully understood. Here, a bioassay is presented to assess the infectivity of indigenous mycorrhizal communities in twenty soils sampled in the Swiss agricultural belt north of the Alps. This bioassay indicated clear negative relationships between the mycorrhizal colonization of bioassay plant roots and the phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations in plant biomass. Further, comparison of the bioassay results with a range of physico-chemical, biological, and geographic parameters of the soils confirmed a negative relationship between the soil phosphorus status and the mycorrhizal colonization of the plants. Other parameters, such as land use, base saturation, pH, and soil texture, had little explanatory value for patterns in the growth, nutrition, and mycorrhizal colonization of the bioassay plants. The results of this study were compared with those of a previous one that used the same methods, and that examined the influence of soil pollution on mycorrhizal infectivity. It appears that the results of a mycorrhizal infectivity assay could serve as a comprehensive and rather universal indicator of soil quality. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Because of concerns regarding climate change and the high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with conventional coal use, policies to encourage pathways that utilize coal for transportation should seek to reduce GHGs compared to petroleum fuels. This paper compares the GHG emissions of coal-to-liquid (CTL) fuels to the emissions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) powered with coal-based electricity, and to the emissions of a fuel cell vehicle (FCV) that uses coal-based hydrogen. A life cycle approach is used to account for fuel cycle and use-phase emissions, as well as vehicle cycle and battery manufacturing emissions. This analysis allows policymakers to better identify benefits or disadvantages of an energy future that includes coal as a transportation fuel. We find that PHEVs could reduce vehicle life cycle GHG emissions by up to about one-half when coal with carbon capture and sequestration is used to generate the electricity used by the vehicles. On the other hand, CTL fuels and coal-based hydrogen would likely lead to significantly increased emissions compared to PHEVs and conventional vehicles using petroleum-based fuels. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

I argue that although it is important that global environmental challenges are being met with adequate local response, there is a risk that rules and regulations imposed from the outside will erode the capacity of local communities to adapt to environmental change.

In recent years, high rates of fertilizer application and heavy winter mulch have been employed to achieve an earlier harvest of the shoots and a better economic return. Little is known about the potential impact of these intensive management practices on the receiving environment. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted to quantify the effect of winter mulch on soil CO2 efflux, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Materials and methods The field study was established in 6-year-old P. praecox stands for the period between December 2006 and February 2007 in Lin'an County, Zhejiang Province, China. The treatments included a 200mm mulch with rice straw and rice husks, and a control without mulch. Soil CO2 efflux rates and soil temperature changes were measured monthly and comparisons were made between the treatments. Results and discussion Soil CO2 efflux rates in the mulch treatment were 10.98 and 4.27 μmol m-2s-1 in December 2006 and January 2007, respectively, which was eight times greater than soil CO2 efflux rates measured in the non-mulch control treatment in the corresponding months. The significantly higher temperature and increased dissolved organic carbon in the mulch treatment were considered to have contributed to the enhanced soil CO2 emission. Conclusions Heavy winter mulch in a P. praecox plantation can greatly enhance soil respiration rates due to increases in both soil temperature and readily mineralizable labile organic matter. The increased CO2 emissions from soil respiration under winter mulch treatments can potentially reduce the greenhouse gas emission mitigation function of the bamboo forest plantations.

It was found that the presence of CT significantly accelerated the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the iron surface in strong acidic solutions, causing severe corrosion of iron; in return, the iron corrosion was helpful for the reductive dechlorination of CT. The inherent relationship between the dechlorination of CT and the corrosion of iron is attributed to the fact that the adsorbed hydrogen atoms produced during the iron corrosion process are necessary for the dechlorination process of CT. As a result, the removal efficiency of CT is strongly dependent on the extent of iron corrosion in aqueous solutions at different pH values. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

One recycle allows for composition control and is useful when the side objective is to produce synthesis gas for chemicals. The second recycle enables temperature control in the gas turbine by using CO2 as a diluent. The main advantages of the second recycle are that NOx is not produced and that CO2/H2O separation is significantly easier than CO2/N2 separation, which reduces cost if the CO2 is to be sequestered. Models and control systems are developed using process network theory. We introduce a novel method for controlling quality variables and functions of inventories. Dynamic simulations using MATLAB/Simulink models show the response to step changes in setpoints and disturbances. The inventory control method is derived from conservation laws and the second law and it is applicable to process system models of any degree of complexity.

These ecosystem services contribute to improving environmental quality, quality of life, and sustainable urban development. Despite a long history of inserting vegetation in human settlements in China, modern scientific study of this natural-cum-cultural resource did not start until the 1990s. Specifically, the identification and valuation of ecosystem services provided by urban forests are relatively new but fast growing research fields. This paper reviews studies on the major ecosystem services provided by urban forests in China, including microclimatic amelioration (mainly evapotranspiration-cooling effects), carbon dioxide sequestration, oxygen generation, removal of gaseous and particulate pollutants, recreational and amenity. Various valuation techniques have been applied, most of which are still at the embryonic stage. There are rooms to improve the research scope and methods.

A clear improvement of catalytic activity was found over In/WZr catalysts. The highest NO conversion of 70% was achieved over a 1% In/WZr catalyst at 450 °C and 12,000 h-1. In contrast, the maximum NO conversions of WZr, ZrO2 and In/ZrO2 were only 12%, 31% and 20%, achieved at 500, 650 and 600 °C, respectively. Tungstation was observed to influence the properties of catalysts in three aspects: (i) modify the existent state of surface indium species; (ii) determine the activation species of CH4; (iii) cooperate with the loading of indium to enhance the formation and reduction of the intermediates. Differences in the existent state of indium and the activation species of CH4 result in different catalytic activities and mechanisms for CH4-SCR of NO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements and Py-IR analysis showed that indium species on the In/ZrO2 catalyst was in the In2O3 bulk phase due to the lack of Brønsted acid sites. However, the tungstated In/WZr catalyst possessed strong Brønsted acid sites, which was beneficial to the formation of active InO+ species. DRIFTS studies further revealed the reaction intermediates of CH4-SCR of NO on the tungstated and the untungstated catalysts. On In/ZrO2 and ZrO2, the activation species of CH4 was the fully oxidized products CO2 and H2O. While on WZr and In/WZr, HCOO-, the real reductant for CH4-SCR of NO, was detected as the main intermediate species. In addition, the formation of HCOO- and the reduction of nitrate species were greatly accelerated by the synergistic effect between InO+ and tungstation, which might explain the higher catalytic activity of In/WZr in comparison with WZr and In/ZrO2. © 2009.","DeNOx; HCOO-; Indium; InO+; Methane; Selective catalytic reduction; Tungstated zirconia","Acid site; Bulk phase; Catalytic activity; Catalytic performance; DeNOx; HCOO-; InO+; Intermediate specie; IR analysis; Nitrate species; NO conversion; Oxidized products; Reaction intermediate; Reductant; SCR of NO; Selective catalytic reduction of NO; Synergistic effect; Tungstated zirconia; Acids; Catalyst activity; Electrochemical sensors; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Indium; Methane; Reduction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Zirconia; Zirconium alloys; Selective catalytic reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67651165455

This study presents the Sustainable Urban Systems Framework for assessing the causes and effects of climate change involved with the built environment at different scales with a case study of Seoul, South Korea. The Seoul metro region is the sixth most densely populated area in the world, and the region's rapid population growth has resulted in dramatic increases in both energy consumption and land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes. South Korea is now the ninth largest Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emitter in the world and the third largest in Asia. Our results indicate that the system inputs and impacts of the proposed framework (urban population, LULC change, greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, and energy consumption) are closely related to the system pressures of energy security and GHG-reduction requirements. To meet the goal for the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol, Seoul must cut down its annual CO2 emissions by 3.4 million metric tons. The city's current intervention strategies will result in a reduction of only 2.1 million metric tons a year, a deficit of 1.3 million metric tons. Our preliminary results indicate that the Seoul government can strengthen its CO2 reduction strategy by incorporating built environment factors from the Sustainable Urban Systems Framework. By adopting energy-efficient-building standards, CO2 emissions can be reduced by up to 1.34 million metric tons per year, suggesting a promising approach to lowering the city's energy use and GHG emissions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper a combination of measurements and modelling is used to assess the contribution from road traffic emissions. Concentrations of particulate heavy metals in air were measured simultaneously during 1 year at a densely trafficked street and at an urban background site in Stockholm, Sweden. Annual mean concentrations of cadmium were 50 times lower than the EU directive and for nickel and arsenic concentrations were 10 and six times lower, respectively. More than a factor of two higher concentrations was in general observed at the street in comparison to roof levels indicating the strong influence from local road traffic emissions. The only compound with a significantly decreasing trend in the urban background was Pb with 9.1 ng m-3 in 1995/96 compared to 3.4 ng m-3 2003/04. This is likely due to decreased emissions from wear of brake linings and reduced emissions due to oil and coal combustion in central Europe. Total road traffic emission factors for heavy metals were estimated using parallel measurements of NOx concentrations and knowledge of NOx emission factors. In general, the emission factors for the street were higher than reported in road tunnel measurements. This could partly be due to different driving conditions, since especially for metals which are mainly emitted from brake wear, more stop and go driving in the street compared to in road tunnels is likely to increase emissions. Total emissions were compared with exhaust emissions, obtained from the COPERT model and brake wear emissions based on an earlier study in Stockholm. For Cu, Ni and Zn the sum of brake wear and exhaust emissions agreed very well with estimated total emission factors in this study. More than 90% of the road traffic emissions of Cu were due to brake wear. For Ni more than 80% is estimated to be due to exhaust emissions and for Zn around 40% of road traffic emissions are estimated to be due to exhaust emissions. Pb is also mainly due to exhaust emissions (90%); a fuel Pb content of only 0.5 mg L-1 would give similar emission factor as that based on the concentration increment at the street. This is the first study using simultaneous measurements of heavy metals at street and roof enabling calculations of emission factors using a tracer technique. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In California discussions are taking place on another round of criteria pollutant tightening on light duty. Carbon dioxide (CO2) regulations are being discussed in the developed markets. The US mandates on fuel economy and the proposed standards in Europe and California will result in a paradigm shift, wherein technologies previously rejected based on customer value will now be re-evaluated. Heavy-duty regulatory developments are now focused on Europe, where Euro VI regulations have been proposed for about 2013. The regulations are intended to be technology harmonizing with the US and Japanese regulations. Engines are continuing to make very impressive progress, with clean combustion strategies in active development mainly for US light-duty application. Heavy-duty research engines are more focused on traditional approaches, and will provide numerous engine/aftertreatment options for hitting the tight US 2010 regulations. NOx control is focusing on selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for diverse applications. Zeolite catalysts will be the mainstay for Japan, US, and Euro VI applications. The focus is catalyst improvements and system optimization. Lean NOx traps (LNTs) are effective up to about 70-80 per cent deNOx efficiency, and are being used for light-duty applications with significant improvements coming on precious metal utilization. Diesel particulate filter (DPF) technology is in a state of optimization and cost reduction. Very sophisticated management strategies are being utilized, which open up options for new filter materials and alternative system architectures. New catalyst formulations that oxidize soot at the catalyst-soot interface are emerging and are enhancing regeneration in the first commercial applications. Diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) are lighting-off and generating more NO2 for DPF regeneration at lower temperatures.

In many countries, including the UK, legislation is in place to ensure the continued expansion of renewable energy capacity. Onshore wind turbines are expected to play a key role in achieving these aims. However, despite high levels of public support for onshore wind development in principle, specific projects often experience local opposition. Traditionally this difference in general and specific attitudes has been attributed to NIMBYism (not in my back yard), but evidence is increasingly calling this assumption into question. This study used multiple regression analysis to identify what factors might predict attitudes towards mooted wind development in Sheffield, England. We report on the attitudes of two groups; one group (target) living close to four sites earmarked for development and an unaffected comparison group (comparison). We found little evidence of NIMBYism amongst members of the target group; instead, differences between general and specific attitudes appeared attributable to uncertainty regarding the proposals. The results are discussed with respect to literature highlighting the importance of early, continued and responsive community involvement in combating local opposition and facilitating the deployment of onshore wind turbines. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The δfrp1 mutant is deficient in expression of genes for cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) and ICL1, encoding a key enzyme for the assimilation of C2 carbon sources. An explanation for the inability of the δfrp1 mutant to express these genes may be found in constitutive carbon catabolite repression. Cre1 is the transcriptional repressor in filamentous fungi known to repress several CWDE genes and other genes required for assimilation of non-sugar carbon sources. Here, we demonstrate that Frp1 and Cre1 both control the repression/derepression state of such genes. The replacement of CRE1 with GST::CRE1 resulted in a derepressed phenotype in wild-type background, suggesting that this replacement affects Cre1 function. Strikingly, in the δfrp1 mutant the replacement of CRE1 with GST::CRE1 restored pathogenicity, growth on ethanol and expression of ICL1 and CWDE genes. A GFP-Cre1 fusion protein is not degraded nor exported out of the nucleus during growth on ethanol, a derepressing carbon source, suggesting that Cre1 is not likely a target of Frp1 for degradation by the proteasome. We conclude that both proteins function together to regulate transcription of carbon source utilization genes. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"alcohol; cre recombinase; cre recombinase 1; F box protein; F box protein required for pathogenicity 1; proteasome; unclassified drug; article; carbon source; controlled study; degradation; deletion mutant; fungal gene; fungal virulence; fungus growth; fungus mutation; Fusarium oxysporum; gene mutation; gene repression; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein analysis; protein function; wild type; F-Box Proteins; Fungal Proteins; Fusarium; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Lycopersicon esculentum; Plant Diseases; Protein Kinases; Repressor Proteins; Fungi; Fusarium oxysporum; Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450197409

The main objectives of the experimental program were to assess the efficiency of these biocovers in reducing CH4 emissions and to monitor the evolution in space and time of the dynamics and diversity of methanotrophic bacteria that may be responsible for CH4 abatement. Dynamics of methanotroph populations derived from most probable number (MPN) counts exhibited different steps (lag, growth, and collapse phases), with mean abundances decreasing somewhat with depth. Methanotroph diversity, as assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed changes over time in the community structure. These changes were dependent on the sampling depth and only Type I methanotrophs belonging essentially to the genus Methylobacter were retrieved from our samples. Given the youthful character of the system under study, together with the reported behavior of this functional group of methanotrophs, it was concluded that Type I methanotrophs forming the community structure might reflect pioneer species with a potentially high growth rate (r-strategists) that become numerically dominant reducing the evenness of species distribution. These results contribute to the generally limited body of knowledge on methanotroph diversity in landfill cover soils. © Soil Science Society of America.","CCA, Canonical correspondence analysis; DDGE, Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; MDS, Multidimensional scaling; MMO, Methane monooxygenase; MPN, Most probable number; PMMO, Particulate MMO; PMOBio, Passive methane oxidation biocover; SMMO, Soluble MMO","CCA, Canonical correspondence analysis; DDGE, Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; MDS, Multidimensional scaling; MMO, Methane monooxygenase; MPN, Most probable number; PMMO, Particulate MMO; PMOBio, Passive methane oxidation biocover; SMMO, Soluble MMO; Denaturation; Electrophoresis; Functional groups; Gelation; Gels; Methane; Oxidation; Population statistics; Social sciences; Soils; Waste disposal; Land fill; bacterium; canonical analysis; community dynamics; electrokinesis; emission control; growth rate; landfill capping; methane; methanotrophy; microbial activity; pioneer species; population dynamics; soil microorganism; species diversity; species evenness; Canada; North America; Quebec [Canada]; Bacteria (microorganisms); Methylobacter; Methylococcaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949122912

Emissions were measured for 20 major sources, including small stoves and boilers, and the particulate matter (PM) was analyzed for 52 individual compounds together with outdoor and indoor PM10 collected during typical winter pollution episodes. The data were analyzed using chemical mass balance modeling (CMB) and constrained positive matrix factorization (CMF) yielding source apportionments for PM10, B(a)P, and other regulated air pollutants namely Cd, Ni, As, and Pb. The results are potentially very useful for planning abatement strategies in all areas of the world, where coal combustion in small appliances is significant. During the studied pollution episodes in Krakow, European air quality limits were exceeded with up to a factor 8 for PM10 and up to a factor 200 for B(a)P. The levels of these air pollutants were accompanied by high concentrations of azaarenes, known markers for inefficient coal combustion. The major culprit for the extreme pollution levels was demonstrated to be residential heating by coal combustion in small stoves and boilers (&gt;50% for PM10 and &gt;90% B(a)P), whereas road transport (&lt;10% for PM10 and &lt;3% for B(a)P), and industry (4-15% for PM10 and &lt;6% for B(a)P) played a lesser role. The indoor PM10 and B(a)P concentrations were at high levels similar to those of outdoor concentrations and were found to have the same sources as outdoors. The inorganic secondary aerosol component of PM 10 amounted to around 30%, which for a large part may be attributed to the industrial emission of the precursors SO2 and NOx. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Air pollutants; Azaarenes; Chemical mass balance; High concentration; Large parts; Major cities; Outdoor concentrations; Particulate Matter; Pollution episodes; Pollution level; Pollution sources; Positive Matrix Factorization; Residential heating; Road transports; Secondary aerosols; Source apportionment; Urban air quality; Air quality; Boilers; Coal; Coal industry; Electric filters; Heating; Industrial emissions; Lead; Particulate emissions; Pollution; Smoke; Stoves; Coal combustion; coal; aerosol composition; air quality; atmospheric pollution; coal; combustion; emission inventory; heating; heavy metal; industrial emission; mass balance; nitric oxide; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; residential energy; road transport; sulfur dioxide; urban atmosphere; air pollution; air quality; air sampling; article; biomass; combustion; electric power plant; environmental impact; Europe; heating; particulate matter; traffic; urban area; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Arsenic; Coal; Heating; Housing; Metals, Heavy; Particulate Matter; Poland; Urbanization; Central Europe; Cracow; Eurasia; Europe; Malopolskie; Poland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449985256

By adding satellite observations with 2.5 ppm single-shot random error and a bias of 1 ppm, it was possible to reduce the mean regional flux uncertainty by approximately 30%. Unbiased data with 2.5 ppm single-shot precision (0.8 ppm for the monthly mean) halved the flux uncertainty. The aerosol-dependent bias in satellite data with 1 ppm mean variance led to significant absolute errors in the surface CO2 fluxes, highlighting a need for the accurate detection and rejection of biased data.

The evaluating model is developed from per-floor area PV power output variations on the basis of the past 1 year of actual solar insolation. The evaluation of the power variations is represented in terms of a per-floor area standard deviation curve. In case of considering two alternatives, battery-less and battery-installed PV systems, a correlative coefficient curve is calculated, then a total standard deviation curve representing the total PV power variations can be formulated on the basis of a random variable (RV) model. The model is applied as a tool to evaluate the power variation in an energy system. The energy system planning demonstration approaches the optimal planning by minimizing total cost under CO2 emission reduction and the power variation constraints. The results show the impacts of the constraint of power variation that limit the installation of PV system. The constraint results the increase of the proportion of PV system with battery installation against PV system without battery installation. Consequently, the constraint also degrades the maximum potential of the entire system to reduce CO2 emission corresponding to the decrease of PV system. © 2009 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Uncertainty about the best crop and residue sources, technologies for manufacture, future public policy, and the global supply and price of oil make it difficult to predict the best approach. California growers can produce feedstocks from grain, oilseed and woody crops and, in the Imperial Valley, from sugar cane. If the technology for making ethanol or other liquid fuels from cellulose becomes cost-effective, then saline and other wastewaters may be used in biofuel feedstock production of salt-tolerant crops, particularly perennial grasses. However, recent global increases in biofuel production have raised questions about their impacts on food and feed prices, climate change and deforestation. New state laws affecting energy use and mandating greenhouse-gas reductions require that the sustainability of all biof uels be assessed.

Despite widespread recognition that afforestation results in increased evapotranspiration and lower catchment yields, little is known of the impacts of timber plantations on water balance relative to native forest. Native forest trees have been claimed to use water conservatively and enhance groundwater recharge relative to faster-growing alien species, and this argument should motivate native forest preservation and restoration. However, data have been available primarily for leaf-level gas exchange rather than for whole-plant and stand levels. We measured sap flow of dominant tree and tree fern species over eight weeks in native Metrosideros polymorpha forest and adjacent alien timber plantations on the island of Hawai'i and estimated total stand transpiration. Metrosideros polymorpha had the lowest values of sap flux density and whole-tree water use (200 kgm-2 sapwood·d-1, or 8 kg/d for trees of 35 cm mean diameter at breast height, D), substantially less than timber species Eucalyptus saligna or Fraxinus uhdei (33 and 34 kg/d for trees of 73 and 30 cm mean D, respectively). At the stand level, E. saligna and F. uhdei trees had three- and ninefold higher water use, respectively, than native M. polymorpha trees. Understory Cibotium tree ferns were most abundant in M. polymorpha-dominated forest where they accounted for 70% of water use. Overall, F. uhdei plantation had the highest water use at 1.8 mm/d, more than twice that of either E. saligna plantation or M. polymorpha forest. Forest water use was influenced by species composition, stem density, tree size, sapwood allocation, and understory contributions. Transpiration varied strongly among forest types even within the same wet tropical climate, and in this case, native forest had strikingly conservative water use. Comparisons of vegetation cover in water use should provide additional resolution to ecosystem valuation and land management decisions. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","'Ōhi'a; Ecohydrology; Ecosystem services; Forest water budget; Hāpu'u; Hawaii, USA; Heat balance collar; Heat dissipation sensor; Sap flow; Scaling; Tropical forest; Watershed","water; afforestation; comparative study; ecosystem management; introduced species; land management; native species; plantation; restoration ecology; sap flow; secondary forest; transpiration; tropical forest; vegetation structure; water use; article; comparative study; ecosystem; Eucalyptus; evapotranspiration; forestry; Fraxinus; Myrtaceae; physiology; United States; Ecosystem; Eucalyptus; Forestry; Fraxinus; Hawaii; Myrtaceae; Plant Transpiration; Water; Hawaii [United States]; North America; United States; Cibotium; Cibotium glaucum; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus saligna; Filicophyta; Fraxinus; Fraxinus uhdei; Metrosideros macropus; Metrosideros polymorpha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69449103751

One characteristic of these adaptations is the state of dormancy, in which the plants do not exhibit any visible external growth. This paper reviews dormancy and florogenesis as main components of the survival strategies of perennial herbaceous plants. Summer dormancy protects plants from negative effects of water deficit and high temperatures on vegetative and reproductive organs, and forces plant species to schedule their active development in more favorable seasons. Mechanisms of summer survival vary among species and provide different modes of adaptation to harsh environments. The interrelationship between florogenesis and dormancy is most probably controlled in meristems, where the survival strategy of the plant, including vegetative growth, flowering, drought tolerance, and formation of storage organs, is determined. Mechanisms by which summer dormancy confers summer drought survival warrant further investigation for improving agronomic and environmental traits of perennial plants. © Crop Science Society of America.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70749117885

The first theme concerns the emergence and continuation of the APP. The contributions show that the emergence of the APP can be attributed to international factors, including the United States' rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, and its search for an alternative arena for global climate governance, and other countries' wish to maintain good relations with the US; as well as domestic factors, such as the presence of bureaucratic actors in favour of the Partnership, alignment with domestic priorities, and the potential for reaping economic benefits through participation. The second theme examines the nature of the Partnership, concluding that it falls on the very soft side of the hard-soft law continuum and that while being branded as a public-private partnership, governments remain in charge. Under the third theme, the influence which the APP exerts on the post-2012 United Nations (UN) climate change negotiations is scrutinised. The contributions show that at the very least, the APP is exerting some cognitive influence on the UN discussions through its promotion of a sectoral approach.

In addition to direct inhibition of methanogens by feed additives, protozoa are often targeted for inhibition because their close physical association with endo- and ectosymbionts stimulates methanogenesis in the rumen. In this study, we first modified a continuous culture system to maintain a diverse protozoal population (faunated subperiod) and then selectively effluxed them without using any chemical agents (defaunated subperiod). In both subperiods, unsaturated fat (potentially inhibitory to ciliate protozoa, methanogens, and gram-positive bacteria), monensin (assumed to inhibit gram-positive bacteria), and bromoethanesulfonate (BES; a potent inhibitor of methanogens) were used to suppress the respective functional groups of microorganisms. Changes in microbial populations were determined us-ing denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, followed by cloning and DNA sequencing of the excised bands. Neither monensin nor unsaturated fat consistently affected methanogen populations under our conditions in either the faunated or defaunated subperiods. When BES was administered, bands presumptively linked to protozoa-associated methanogens in the faunated subperiod disappeared in the defaunated subperiod. However, there was no noticeable adaptation of the sensitive methanogens to BES. The effect of dietary treatments on bacterial populations in the fermenters was harder to ascertain because of the overriding period effect caused by a different inoculum in each period. Defaunation selectively decreased the intensity of bands associated with ruminococci and clostridia but seemed to increase some Butyrivibrio and related populations. Presence of protozoa influenced both bacterial and archaeal populations, probably by selective predation, competition for substrate, or through symbiotic interactions. © American Dairy Science Association, 2009.","Bacteria; Bromoethanesulfonate; Methanogens; Monensin","Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Butyrivibrio; Ciliophora; Clostridia; Posibacteria; Prokaryota; Protozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68949211052

However, specific and absolute CO2 emissions are among the highest when burning coal for power generation. Therefore, the capture of CO2 from power plants may contribute significantly in reducing global CO2 emissions. This review deals with the oxyfuel process, where pure oxygen is used for burning coal, resulting in a flue gas with high CO2 concentrations. After further conditioning, the highly concentrated CO2 is compressed and transported in the liquid state to, for example, geological storages. The enormous oxygen demand is generated in an air-separation unit by a cryogenic process, which is the only available state-of-the-art technology. The generation of oxygen and the purification and liquefaction of the CO2-enriched flue gas consumes significant auxiliary power. Therefore, the overall net efficiency is expected to be lowered by 8 to 12 percentage points, corresponding to a 21 to 36% increase in fuel consumption. Oxygen combustion is associated with higher temperatures compared with conventional air combustion. Both the fuel properties as well as limitations of steam and metal temperatures of the various heat exchanger sections of the steam generator require a moderation of the temperatures during combustion and in the subsequent heat-transfer sections. This is done by means of flue gas recirculation. The interdependencies among fuel properties, the amount and the temperature of the recycled flue gas, and the resulting oxygen concentration in the combustion atmosphere are investigated. Expected effects of the modified flue gas composition in comparison with the air-fired case are studied theoretically and experimentally. The different atmosphere resulting from oxygen-fired combustion gives rise to various questions related to firing, in particular, with regard to the combustion mechanism, pollutant reduction, the risk of corrosion, and the properties of the fly ash or the deposits that form. In particular, detailed nitrogen and sulphur chemistry was investigated by combustion tests in a laboratory-scale facility. Oxidant staging, in order to reduce NO formation, turned out to work with similar effectiveness as for conventional air combustion. With regard to sulphur, a considerable increase in the SO 2 concentration was found, as expected. However, the H2S concentration in the combustion atmosphere increased as well. Further results were achieved with a pilot-scale test facility, where acid dew points were measured and deposition probes were exposed to the combustion environment. Besides CO2 and water vapour, the flue gas contains impurities like sulphur species, nitrogen oxides, argon, nitrogen, and oxygen. The CO 2 liquefaction is strongly affected by these impurities in terms of the auxiliary power requirement and the CO2 capture rate.

Since the requirements on the liquid CO2 with regard to geological storage or enhanced oil recovery are currently undefined, the effects of possible flue gas treatment and the design of the liquefaction plant are studied over a wide range. © 2009 The Author(s).","Carbon capture; CO2; Emissions; Oxyfuel","argon; carbon dioxide; coal; hydrogen sulfide; nitric oxide; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; oxidizing agent; oxygen; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; burning; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; combustion; cryogenic fluid; fuel consumption; heat transfer; oxygen; power generation; power plant; air pollution; chemical analysis; coal power; combustion; concentration (parameters); controlled study; corrosion; electric power plant; energy yield; environmental protection; flow kinetics; flue gas; fly ash; gas transport; gas waste; generator; greenhouse gas; heat exchange; heat transfer; high temperature; liquefaction; liquid; molecular probe; nonhuman; oxygen concentration; oxygen consumption; oxygen supply; productivity; purification; review; separation technique; storage; waste gas management; water vapor; Air; Carbon Dioxide; Coal; Corrosion; Electricity; Environmental Monitoring; Fossil Fuels; Hot Temperature; Nitrogen Oxides; Oxygen; Power Plants; Temperature",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68949211785

Because of a lack of other commercial sources of energy, the country relies heavily on traditional fuel source, especially firewood. In order to solve the energy problem in rural areas, the country initiated production and distribution of several renewable energy technologies. Among several technologies, biogas has been proved to be viable and emerged as a promising technology. It has been one of the most successful models for the production of clean, environmental friendly, cost effective source of energy and has multiple benefits. In this paper we present the current state and discuss benefits of the biogas technology in Nepal. Improved health, increased crop productivity, saved time for women are some of the major benefits to the users. It provides economic benefit to the country through reduced deforestation and carbon trading. In addition, by reducing green house gas emission, the technology helps in mitigating global warming and climate change. Thus biogas is a renewable, sustainable and clean source of energy that provides multiple benefits; locally and globally. With some exception, cattle dung has been used primarily as an input and the technology is limited to households only. More systematic and comprehensive study supported by research and development is required to use other degradable waste such as municipal waste to produce biogas on a large scale. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Changing land-use strategies that would maintain standing forests may be among the least expensive of climate change mitigation options. Further, secondary tropical forests have been suggested to have great value for their potential to sequester atmospheric C. These options require an understanding of and capability to quantify C dynamics at landscape scales. Because of the diversity of physical and biotic features of tropical forests as well as approaches and intensities of land uses within the neotropics, there are tremendous differences in the capacity of different landscapes to store and sequester C. Major gaps in our current knowledge include quantification of C pools, rates and patterns of biomass loss following land-cover change, and quantification of the C storage potential of secondary forests following abandonment. In this paper we present a synthesis and further analyses from recent studies that describe C pools, patterns of C decline associated with land use, and rates of C accumulation following secondary-forest establishment - all information necessary for climate-change mitigation options. Ecosystem C pools of Neotropical primary forests minimally range from ∼ 141 to 571 Mg/ha, demonstrating tremendous differences in the capacity of different forests to store C. Most of the losses in C and nutrient pools associated with conversion occur when fires are set to remove the slashed forest to prepare sites for crop or pasture establishment. Fires burning slashed primary forests have been found to result in C losses of 62-80% of prefire aboveground pools in dry (deciduous) forest landscapes and 29-57% in wet (evergreen) forest landscapes. Carbon emissions equivalent to the aboveground primary-forest pool arise from repeated fires occurring in the first 4 to 10 years following conversion. Feedbacks of climate change, land-cover change, and increasing habitat fragmentation may result in increases of both the area burned and the total quantity of biomass consumed per unit area by fire. These effects may well limit the capacity for future tropical forests to sequester C and nutrients. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","C storage potential of secondary forests; Carbon sequestration; Clean development mechanism (CDM); Ecosystem C-pool quantification; Fire ecology; Land-use/land-cover change; Nutrient pools; Pastures; REDD strategies; Secondary forests; Tropical forests","carbon; abandoned land; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; biomass; carbon cycle; carbon emission; clean development mechanism; climate change; deforestation; habitat fragmentation; land cover; land use change; Neotropical Region; pasture; regrowth; secondary forest; tropical forest; agriculture; article; biomass; chemistry; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; tree; tropic climate; Agriculture; Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystem; Trees; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68149131543

Montmorillonites being the main components of bentonites are suspected to undergo mineral alteration (particularly illitization or related mineral alteration processes) upon reaction with highly saline solutions. Literature data, however, do not provide a homogenous picture, yet. Possible alteration mechanisms, therefore, are still under discussion. In the present study 36 bentonites from different deposit were reacted in a closed system with a 6 M NaCl solution at 60 °C for 5 months, respectively. Run products were washed and dialysed and finally analyzed with respect to chemical and mineralogical changes by XRF, XRD, CEC, water uptake capacity, and amount of soluble silica. All significant chemical changes could be explained by the expected cation exchange (Na+ for Ca2+/Mg2+). After the experiment, however, the exchange sites were not completely occupied by Na+ despite a 100 fold excess of Na+ compared to the CEC. The presence of carbonates, obviously, interferes with the exchange of Na+ for Ca2+/Mg2+. The presence of gypsum proved to be even more effective and caused the opposite trend (Ca2+ was exchanged for Na+). The cation exchange buffer capacity of carbonates is believed to be particularly effective during dialysis, where the Na+ excess is significantly reduced while carbonate/gypsum dissolution proceeds. The changes of the XRD patterns, particularly the position, shape, and intensity (area) of the basal reflections, could not be attributed to mineral alteration but can be explained by cation exchange, differences of the hydration state, and/or different degrees of preferred orientation, the latter can be explained by particle arrangement. The results of the present study indicate that montmorillonites are stable in NaCl solutions of moderate pH up to 60 °C which is in agreement with most of the available studies. As expected there are no indications for illitization. In addition the study clearly shows the importance of using different chemical, mineralogical, and physical methods in order to unambiguously prove a process as illitization. Literature data indicate that temperatures of &gt; 100 °C can lead to irreversible montmorillonite alteration. The same, of course, holds true for extreme pH values, drying, or the presence of K+. These alteration processes have to be considered specifically. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Genome analysis of Azospirillum brasilense, a nonphotosynthetic, nitrogen-fixing, rhizobacterium, revealed an ORF with homology to β-class carbonic anhydrases (CAs). Biochemical characteristics of the β-class CA of A. brasilense, analysed after cloning the gene (designated as bca), overexpressing in Escherichia coli and purifying the protein by affinity purification, revealed that the native recombinant enzyme is a homotetramer, inhibited by the known CA inhibitors. CA activity in A. brasilense cell extracts, reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and Western blot analyses showed that bca was constitutively expressed under aerobic conditions. Lower β-galactosidase activity in A. brasilense cells harbouring bca promoter: lacZ fusion during the stationary phase or during growth on 3% CO2 enriched air or at acidic pH indicated that the transcription of bca was downregulated by the stationary phase, elevated CO 2 levels and acidic pH conditions. These observations were also supported by RT-PCR analysis. Thus, β-CA in A. brasilense seems to be required for scavenging CO2 from the ambient air and the requirement of CO2 hydration seems to be higher for the cultures growing exponentially at neutral to alkaline pH. © 2009 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

But the essence of the indigenous practices are low external input (LEI) based farming system, organic produce, preferences for taste and quality, and a number of innovations involved. The present paper elucidates the traditional organic rice farming in Uttarakhand, India and its commonalities with the System of Rice Intensification (SRI). In SRI, six principles of rice cultivation are followed: use of small young seedlings, single plant transplantation, wide spacing in square geometry, use of organic manure, limited irrigation instead of flood irrigation, and mechanical weeding. The yield obtained is 60% higher in comparison to conventional transplanting. The cost savings are through the operations such as low seed rate (7.5 kg ha-1), water saving, and mechanical weeding. The increased drudgery in transplanting operations is compensated by other complementary operations like saving of time in weeding, watering, and disease and pest control. The added benefits are higher yield and reduction in emission of greenhouse gases.",,"agricultural practice; cost-benefit analysis; crop yield; greenhouse gas; mountain region; organic farming; rice; weed control; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia; Uttarakhand; Oryza",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350319527

Such atmospheric processes have strong seasonal cycles. Although similar seasonal cycles in VOC emissions from terrestrial ecosystems have been reported, regional emissions inventories generally omit the effect of seasonality on emissions. We compiled measurement data on seasonal variations in monoterpene emissions potentials for two evergreen species (Quercus ilex and Pinus pinea) and used these data to construct two contrasting seasonal response functions for the inclusion in monoterpene emission models. We included these responses in the Niinemets et al. model and compared simulation results to those of the MEGAN model, both with and without its predicted seasonality. The effect of seasonality on regional monoterpene emissions inventories for European Mediterranean forests dominated by these species was tested for both models, using the GOTILWA+ biosphere model platform. The consideration of seasonality in the Niinemets et al. model reduced total estimated annual monoterpene emissions by up to 65% in some regions, with largest reductions at lower latitudes. The MEGAN model demonstrated a much weaker seasonal response than that in the Niinemets et al. model, and did not capture the between species seasonality differences found in this study. Results suggest that previous regional model inventories based on one fixed emission factor likely overestimate regional emissions, and species-specific expressions of seasonality may be necessary. The consideration of seasonality both largely reduces monoterpene emissions estimates, and changes their expected seasonal distribution.

Next, it assesses the options based on establishing benchmarks for measuring policy performance in curbing vehicle emissions simultaneously with core sustainable development priorities. Assessing these options identifies the key variables in designing mitigation commitments, offers criteria for evaluating different approaches and discusses the implications of the leading alternatives. This paper argues that a more pronounced dilemma of synergies exists between vehicle emissions reduction and core development concerns as the major players target emissions too narrowly.

We measured monthly porewater concentrations of sulfate, sulfide, methane (CH4), dissolved inorganic carbon and dissolved organic carbon over a 5-year period in a brackish marsh. Samples were collected using porewater wells (i.e., sippers) in a Schoenoplectus americanus-dominated (C3 sedge) community, a Spartina patens-dominated (C4 grass) community and a mixed (C3 and C4) community within the marsh. Plant communities were exposed to ambient and elevated (ambient + 340 ppm) CO2 levels for 15 years prior to porewater sampling, and the treatments continued over the course of our sampling. Sulfate reduction was stimulated by elevated CO2 in the C3-dominated community, but not in the C4-dominated community. Elevated CO2 also resulted in higher porewater concentrations of CH4 and dissolved organic carbon in the C3-dominated system, though inhibition of CH4 production by sulfate reduction appears to temper the porewater CH4 response. These patterns mirror the typical divergent responses of C3 and C4 plants to elevated CO2 seen in this ecosystem. Porewater concentrations of nitrogen (as ammonium) and phosphorus did not decrease despite increased plant biomass in the C3-dominated community, suggesting nutrients do not strongly limit the sustained vegetation response to elevated CO2. Overall, our data demonstrate that elevated CO2 drives changes in porewater chemistry and suggest that increased plant productivity likely stimulates microbial decomposition through increases in dissolved organic carbon availability. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Elevated CO2; Methane; Nutrients; Porewater; Sulfate reduction; Wetland","ammonium; brackish water; carbon dioxide; dissolved inorganic carbon; dissolved organic carbon; dominance; ecosystem response; grass; herb; inhibition; methane; nutrient availability; phosphorus; plant community; porewater; reduction; sedge; sulfate; water chemistry; well; wetland; Schoenoplectus americanus; Spartina patens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350108674

Sediments were leached sequentially with a series of six chemical treatments designed to approximate different environmental processes that may occur or to selectively extract trace metals contained in different solid phases of the sediments (i.e., exchangeable, reducible, carbonate, organic, acid leachable, and refractory). Results indicate the majority of Pu and Np is similarly distributed within many of the extracted fractions, with the largest percentage (66-97%) of both elements being observed in sediments treated with buffered citrate dithionite (CDB), which targets easily reduced constituents such as Mn and Fe hydrous oxides. While these results do indicate an association of Pu and Np with redox sensitive elements, the environmental implications are unclear given that the CDB treatment is more extreme than naturally occurring conditions. Minor amounts of Np partition differently from Pu in sediments. The NH4-acetate treatment, which is designed to liberate trace metals that are loosely adsorbed onto the surfaces of sedimentary materials such as hydrated iron oxides and humic substances, or present at exchangeable sites in clay minerals, mobilized ∼12% of the total Np while Pu levels were below detection. The H2O2 treatment, which is designed to liberate trace metals bound to organic matter, mobilized ∼8 and ∼1% of Np and Pu, respectively. These results indicate that a minor portion of the total Np may be affected by environmental conditions that have little or no effect on Pu. Between 7 and 24% of the Pu was observed in treatments designed to liberate Pu and Np that are tightly bound to lithogenic phases or refractory silicates. The 240Pu/239Pu observed in accessible and refractory fractions ranged between 0.11 and 0.18. With the exception of one sample, the 240Pu/239Pu isotope ratios measured in the refractory fractions are essentially identical having a mean ratio value of 0.123 ± 0.001 (1σ). The 240Pu/239Pu ratios provide isotopic evidence that suggests a portion of non-fallout contamination has a refractory nature. The presence of similarly low 240Pu/239Pu ratios in refractory fractions of sediments from the Ob and Irtysh Rivers suggests the existence of a source of refractory Pu which is consistent with refractory ""hot particles"" derived from surface tests at the Semipalitinsk test site. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Many cities are developing strategies to reduce their emissions. Here we ask how and why emissions differ between cities. Our study of ten global cities shows how a balance of geophysical factors (climate, access to resources, and gateway status) and technical factors (power generation, urban design, and waste processing) determine the GHGs attributable to cities. Within the overall trends, however, there are differences between cities with more or less public transit; while personal income also impacts heating and industrial fuel use. By including upstream emissions from fuels, GHG emissions attributable to cities exceed those from direct end use by up to 25%.

Lakes were sampled for planktonic crustaceans, rotifers, littoral invertebrates and sub-fossil chironomids, diatoms and cladocerans. Each lake was characterised in terms of water chemistry, morphology, catchment attributes and geographical location. Separate twinspan analyses were undertaken on diatom, chironomid, planktonic crustacean, littoral invertebrate and cladoceran (chydorids only) data to classify sites according to taxonomic composition. For most datasets there was a spatial component to the classification with distinct geographical groups emerging - Norway and Scotland, Finland and Central/Eastern Europe. Constrained ordination methods were employed to examine how species responded to a range of environmental factors, which were aggregated into a series of component groups - proximal environment (the chemical, trophic and physical attributes of the lake), catchment characteristics and geographical location. Several key environmental gradients were identified, which explained significant levels of the variance across several of the biological groups including dissolved organic carbon (chironomids, planktonic crustaceans), temperature (chironomids and littoral invertebrates), chloride/sea-salt (littoral invertebrates, diatoms and rotifers), lake morphology (all groups), calcium/pH (diatoms), nitrate (chydorids, littoral invertebrates, rotifers and planktonic crustaceans) and fish (littoral invertebrates). In some cases these statistical relationships are likely to represent direct ecological constraints and, in others, it is probable that the environmental variable is acting as a surrogate for some other attribute or process. Variance partitioning was undertaken to quantify how much of the variation in each biological group could be uniquely attributed to variables representing the proximal environment, catchment characteristics and geographical location. For most groups the location of the lake tends to explain the greatest variation in species composition across the Lake Districts. The proximal environment was also important but, with the exception of diatoms, secondary to location. Therefore, a strong geographical signal emerged from the analyses. Three distinct limno-regions were identified; Nordic (Scotland and Norway), Sub-Arctic (Northern Finland) and Alpine (Pyrenees, the Alps and Eastern Europe ranges). Our results have implications for the development of regionalisation schemes based on biological responses to environmental gradients; (i) lake 'types' based on environmental factors cannot be extrapolated throughout Europe, even within the relatively narrow gradients found in remote mountain lakes, (ii) biotic response to large-scale variations in environmental conditions, such as those that could be expected with climate change, is likely to vary according to regions because of the biogeographical differences among them. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Environmental gradients; Partial ordination; Regionalisation; Remote mountain lakes; Species composition","Bacillariophyta; Chironomidae; Chydoridae; Crustacea; Invertebrata; Rotifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449562313

Despite significant decrease of NOx emissions in 1986-2005 in the industrial and harbour area near Rotterdam, NO2 concentrations at the urban background remain at the same level since the end of the nineties. Trend analysis of monitoring data revealed that the ozone/NOx equilibrium is a more important factor than increasing direct NO2 emissions by traffic. The latter has recently been identified as an additional NO2 source due to the introduction of oxy-catalytic converters in diesel vehicles and the growing number of diesel vehicles. However, in Rotterdam over the period 1986-2005 direct NO2 emissions by road traffic only increased 3-4%. Due to the importance of the ozone/NOx equilibrium, it is concluded that local NOx emissions in Rotterdam need substantial reduction to achieve lower NO2 urban background levels. This is a relatively costly abatement strategy and, therefore, a ""hotspot"" approach aiming at reducing NOx emissions by local traffic measures is more effective to meet European air quality standards. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Topics for discussion include selection of monitoring sites, sampling and analytical techniques, and the uncertainty estimation for ambient concentration input data. The design framework is illustrated by a case study of a monitoring program for PM source apportionment in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region in which 24-h fine and coarse PM samples were collected using two collocated dichotomous samplers.

Thus, the regional variations in the environmental performance of biobased products are also significant. This study scrutinizes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with two biobased products (i.e., ethanol and soybean oil) whose feedstocks (i.e., corn and soybean) are produced in different farming locations. Methods: We chose 40 counties in Corn Belt States in the United States as biorefinery locations (i.e., corn dry milling, soybean crushing) and farming sites, and estimated cradle-to-gate GHG emissions of ethanol and of soybean oil, respectively. The estimates are based on 1 kg of each biobased product (i.e., ethanol or soybean oil). The system boundary includes biomass production, the biorefinery, and upstream processes. Effects of direct land use change are included in the greenhouse gas analysis and measured as changes in soil organic carbon level, while the effects of indirect land use change are not considered in the baseline calculations. Those indirect effects however are scrutinized in a sensitivity analysis. Results: GHG emissions of corn-based ethanol range from 1.1 to 2.0 kg of CO2 equivalent per kilogram of ethanol, while GHG emissions of soybean oil are 0.4-2.5 kg of CO2 equivalent per kilogram of soybean oil. Thus, the regional variations due to farming locations are significant (by factors of 2-7). The largest GHG emission sources in ethanol production are N2O emissions from soil during corn cultivation and carbon dioxide from burning the natural gas used in corn dry milling. The second largest GHG emission source groups in the ethanol production system are nitrogen fertilizer (8-12%), carbon sequestration by soil (-15-2%), and electricity used in corn dry milling (7-16%). The largest GHG emission sources in soybean oil production are N2O emissions from soil during soybean cultivation (13-57%) and carbon dioxide from burning the natural gas used in soybean crushing (21-47%). The second largest GHG emission source groups in soybean oil production are carbon sequestration by soil (-29-24%), diesel used in soybean cultivation (4-24%), and electricity used in the soybean crushing process (10-21%). The indirect land use changes increase GHG emissions of ethanol by 7-38%, depending on the fraction of forest converted when newly converted croplands maintain crop cultivation for 100 years. Conclusions, recommendations, and perspectives: Farming sites with higher biomass yields, lower nitrogen fertilizer application rates, and less tillage are favorable to future biorefinery locations in terms of global warming. For existing biorefineries, farmers are encouraged to apply a site-specific optimal nitrogen fertilizer application rate, to convert to no-tillage practices and also to adopt winter cover practices whenever possible to reduce the GHG emissions of their biobased products. Current practices for estimating the effects of indirect land use changes suffer from large uncertainties. More research and consensus about system boundaries and allocation issues are needed to reduce uncertainties related to the effects of indirect land use changes. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Direct land use change; Ethanol; Greenhouse gas; Indirect land use change; LCA; Soybean oil","alcohol; soybean oil; article; biomass; biomass production; carbon sequestration; corn; environmental factor; gas analysis; greenhouse gas; land use; priority journal; soybean; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549095842

In this study, we found that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) negatively regulates inflammatory responses mediated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in macrophages. Ahr was induced in macrophages stimulated by LPS, but not by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β plus interleukin (IL)-6, which can induce Ahr in naive T cells. The production of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α by LPS was significantly elevated in Ahr-deficient macrophages compared with that in wild-type (WT) cells. Ahr-deficient mice were more highly sensitive to LPS-induced lethal shock than WT mice. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) deficiency, as well as Ahr deficiency, augmented LPS-induced IL-6 production. We found that Ahr forms a complex with Stat1 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in macrophages stimulated by LPS, which leads to inhibition of the promoter activity of IL-6. Ahr thus plays an essential role in the negative regulation of the LPS signaling pathway through interaction with Stat1. © 2009 Kimura et al.",,"aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; interleukin 10; interleukin 12p40; interleukin 6; lipopolysaccharide; protein p50; STAT1 protein; synaptotagmin I; toll like receptor; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor alpha; animal cell; article; complex formation; controlled study; cytokine production; inflammation; innate immunity; macrophage; mouse; nonhuman; peritoneum macrophage; priority journal; promoter region; regulatory mechanism; signal transduction; wild type; Animals; Blotting, Western; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; DNA Primers; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Gene Expression Regulation; Immunoprecipitation; Inflammation; Interleukin-6; Lipopolysaccharides; Luciferases; Macrophages; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Multiprotein Complexes; NF-kappa B; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Signal Transduction; STAT1 Transcription Factor; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549126213

For the same heat input and total loop length, the results are presented in terms of the ratios of pipe diameter required when a conventional fluid is used to the required pipe diameter with carbon dioxide as the secondary fluid. Results are presented for both laminar and turbulent flow conditions. It is observed that due to its excellent thermo-physical and transport properties and near critical point operation, carbon dioxide gives rise to very compact systems when compared to most of the conventional secondary fluids.

However, these complexes do not have significant absorption in the visible region. In a separate publication, we have reported the successful combination of fac-Re(bpy)(CO)4Cl with a zinc porphyrin that has strong absorption in the visible region to produce the ZnTMP-Re(bpy)(NHAc) dyad(5-|4-[N-4'-(rhenium(I)tricarbonylchloride-4- acetylamino-2,2'-bipyridyl)-car- bamoyl]phenyl}-10,15,20-trimesityl- porphyrinatozinc(II)). In that paper we reported the photochemical reduction of CO2 using excitation of the porphyrin upper excited singlet state, S2 state (visible region), in the dyad. The very wide visible light region is able to be utilized by the sensitizer. In the present work, as regards the detailed molecular mechanism, we have demonstrated the direct electron transfer from the Zn porphyrin S2 state to the Re complex in the dyad by ultrafast transient spectroscopy. The fluorescence of the dyad was quenched by 67% compared to that of ZnTMP(COOMe) (5,10,15-trimesityl-20-[4-(methoxycar- bonyl)phenyl]porphyrinatozinc) in DMF, measured from the steady-state fluorescence spectrum. The lifetime of the ZnTMP-Re(bpy)(NHAc) S2 state was revealed to be 0.53 ps by time-resolved fluorescence and 0.56 ps by transient absorption decay, while that of ZnTMP(COOMe) was 1.6 ps. The porphyrin cation radical was actually identified in the time-resolved absorption spectrum. These are concrete evidence of electron transfer from the porphyrin S2 state to the Re complex. The lifetime of the charge-separated state for ZnTMP- Re(bpy)(NHAc) was also estimated to be 90±10 ps from the time-resolved absorption decay. ©2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Bipyridine; Bipyridyl; Carbon dioxide reduction; Charge-separated state; Direct electron transfer; Electron donors; Electron transfer; Excited singlet state; Molecular mechanism; Photochemical reduction; Porphyrin cations; Re complex; Steady-state fluorescence; Time-resolved absorption; Time-resolved fluorescence; Transient absorption; Transient spectroscopy; Ultra-fast; Visible light region; Visible region; Zinc porphyrins; Zn porphyrin; Absorption; Absorption spectroscopy; Carbon dioxide; Chlorine compounds; Electron transitions; Fluorescence; Free radical reactions; Photocatalysis; Porphyrins; Rhenium; Zinc; Zinc compounds; Rhenium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650757692

Orbital magnetic moments are increased for quaternary compounds compared to the corresponding ternary compounds with x=0 or x=1. The unoccupied spin-resolved partial DOS at the Co atom was extracted from the XMCD data. In the case of Co2 TiSi, Co2 TiGe, and Co 2 TiSn, the Co minority DOS reveals a maximum at 0.5 eV above E F and very low values at EF in agreement with the expectation for half-metallic ferromagnetism. In contrast, Co2 TiSb shows a large minority DOS at the Fermi energy like a normal metal. A substitution of Ti by Mn in Co2 TiSi shifts the minority DOS maximum from 0.5 to 0.9 eV with respect to the Fermi energy. For the series Co 2 MnGa1-x Gex we observe a gradual shift of the minority DOS maximum from 0.7 eV for x=1 to 1.0 eV for x=0, indicating half-metallic ferromagnetism for the whole series. Our results, revealing the distribution of magnetic moments and the relative position of the Fermi energy as a function of the number of valence electrons, confirm the predicted possibility of tailoring the minority band gap using substitutional quaternary Heusler compounds.

Based on combined downscaled results from 23 atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) for three emissions scenarios, we determined the projected spatial shifts in the mediterranean climate extent (MCE) over the next century. Although most AOGCMs project a moderate expansion in the global MCE, regional impacts are large and uneven. The median AOGCM simulation output for the three emissions scenarios project the MCE at the end of the 21st century in Chile will range from 129-153% of its current size, while in Australia, it will contract to only 77-49% of its current size losing an area equivalent to over twice the size of Portugal. Only 4% of the land area within the current MCE worldwide is in protected status (compared to a global average of 12% for all biome types), and, depending on the emissions scenario, only 50-60% of these protected areas are likely to be in the future MCE. To exacerbate the climate impact, nearly one third (29-31%) of the land where the MCE is projected to remain stable has already been converted to human use, limiting the size of the potential climate refuges and diminishing the adaptation potential of native biota. High conversion and low protection in projected stable areas make Australia the highest priority region for investment in climate-adaptation strategies to reduce the threat of climate change to the rich biodiversity of the mediterranean biome. © 2009 Klausmeyer, Shaw.",,"article; Australia; biodiversity; Chile; climate change; conservation biology; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; greenhouse gas; land biome; land use; nonhuman; plant community; population differentiation; Portugal; adaptation; biodiversity; climate; ecosystem; Southern Europe; Adaptation, Physiological; Biodiversity; Climate; Ecosystem; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68149131850

Using the physiological principle of carbon dioxide reactivity of cerebral vasculature, we investigated a recently developed neuromonitoring device (oxygen-to-see, O2C™ device) for simultaneous measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rvCBF), blood flow velocity (rvVelo), oxygen saturation (srvO2), and hemoglobin amount (rvHb) at the capillary venous level in patients subjected to craniotomy. METHODS: Twenty-six neurosurgical patients were randomly assigned to anesthesia with 1.4% or 2.0% sevoflurane end-tidal concentration. After craniotomy, a fiberoptic probe was applied on a macroscopically healthy surface of cerebral tissue next to the site of surgery. Simultaneous measurements in 2 and 8 mm cerebral depth were performed in each patient during lower (35 mm Hg) and higher (45 mm Hg) levels (random order) of arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (Paco2). The principle of these measurements relies on the combination of laser-Doppler flowmetry (rvCBF, rvVelo) and photo-spectrometry (srvO2, rvHb). Linear models were fitted to test changes of end points (rvCBF, rvVelo, srvO2, rvHb) in response to lower and higher levels of Paco2, 1.4% and 2.0% sevoflurane end-tidal concentration, and 2 and 8 mm cerebral depth. RESULTS: RvCBF and rvVelo were elevated by Paco2 independent of sevoflurane concentration in 2 and 8 mm depth of cerebral tissue (P < 0.001). Higher Paco2 induced an increase in mean srvO2 from 50% to 68% (P < 0.001). RvVelo (P < 0.001) and srvO2 (P = 0.007) were higher in 8 compared with 2 mm cerebral depth. RvHb was not influenced by alterations in Paco2 but positively correlated to sevoflurane concentration (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Increases in rvCBF and rvVelo by Paco2 suggest preserved hypercapnic vasodilation under anesthesia with sevoflurane 1.4% and 2.0% end-tidal concentration. A consecutive increase in srvO2 implies that cerebral arteriovenous difference in oxygen was decreased by elevated Paco2. Unchanged levels of rvHb signify that there was no blood loss during measurements. Data suggest that the device allows detection of local changes in blood flow and oxygen saturation in response to different Paco2 levels in predominant venous cerebral microvessels.

In this paper, energy cooperation between an integrated Swedish pulp and paper mill and two nearby energy companies was analysed through economic optimisations. The synergies of cooperation were evaluated through optimisations with different system perspectives. Three changes of the energy system and combinations of them were analysed. The changes were process integration, extending biofuel boiler and turbine capacity and connection to a local heat market. The results show that the single most promising system change is extending biofuel and turbine capacity. Process integration within the pulp and paper mill would take place through installing evaporation units that yield less excess heat but must in this particular case be combined with extended biofuel combustion capacity in order to be beneficial.

Depending on grazing intensity, grasslands tend towards two contrasting systems that differ in terms of species diversity and soil carbon (C) storage. To date, effects of grazing on C cycling have mainly been studied in grasslands subject to constant grazing regimes, whereas little is known for grasslands experiencing a change in grazing intensity. Analysing the transition between C-storing and C-releasing grasslands under low- and high-grazing regimes, respectively, will help to identify key plant-soil interactions for C cycling. 2. The transition was studied in a mesocosm experiment with grassland monoliths submitted to a change in grazing after 14 years of constant high and low grazing. Plant-soil interactions were analysed by following the dynamics of plant and microbial communities, roots and soil organic matter fractions over 2 years. After disturbance change, mesocosms were continuously exposed to 13C-labelled CO2, which allowed us to trace both the incorporation of new litter C produced by a modified plant community in soil and the fate of old unlabelled litter C. 3. Changing disturbance intensity led to a cascade of events. After shift to high disturbance, photosynthesis decreased followed by a decline in root biomass and a change in plant community structure 1.5 months later. Those changes led to a decrease of soil fungi, a proliferation of Gram(+) bacteria and accelerated decomposition of old particulate organic C (&lt;6 months). At last, accelerated decomposition released plant available nitrogen and decreased soil C storage. Our results indicate that intensified grazing triggers proliferation of Gram(+) bacteria and subsequent faster decomposition by reducing roots adapted to low disturbance. 4. Synthesis. Plant communities exert control on microbial communities and decomposition through the activity of their living roots: slow-growing plants adapted to low disturbance reduce Gram(+) bacteria, decomposition of low and high quality litter, nitrogen availability and, thus, ingress of fast-growing plants. Our results indicate that grazing impacts on soil carbon storage by altering plant roots and their control on the soil microbial community and decomposition, and that these processes will foster decomposition and soil C loss in more productive and disturbed grassland systems. © 2009 British Ecological Society.","ARISA; Carbon cycling; Decomposition; Disturbance; Grassland; Management; Microbial community; Nitrogen cycling; Particulate organic matter; PLFA","carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; decomposition; ecosystem management; grassland; grazing; litter; microbial community; nutrient loss; particulate organic matter; plant community; soil carbon; soil microorganism; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68849112197

This change in the political mindset is a result of the increasing frequency of high winds and flooding in Denmark and Europe, as well as in many other places around the world in recent years. This has resulted in an increasing challenge in terms of the planning, design and building of more sustainable buildings in order to reduce the use of energy for heating and cooling in new housing projects by bringing down the emission of CO2 by reducing the amount of fossil fuel consumed by the built environment. This is crucial since carbon dioxide is one of the so-called greenhouse gases that is playing a major role in global warming. There is thus an increased focus on reducing the CO2 level on a national and global scale. This article will look at the architectural and legislative changes in Denmark in relation to the increased political interest in the consequences of climate change. The article also discusses a survey of different types of approaches to the sustainable design of buildings and shows examples of new Danish housing projects that can minimise the use of energy for heating and cooling in the shape of detached houses, as well as a master thesis on high-rise houses. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model was used to evaluate its application as a decision support tool for irrigation management of cotton and maize under South Texas conditions. Simulation of the model was performed to determine crop yield, crop water use, and the relationships between the yield and crop water use parameters such as crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and water use efficiency (WUE). We measured actual ETc using a weighing lysimeter and crop yields by field sampling, and then calibrated the model. The measured variables were compared with simulated variables using EPIC. Simulated ETc agreed with the lysimeter, in general, but some simulated ETc were biased compared with measured ETc. EPIC also simulated the variability in crop yields at different irrigation regimes. Furthermore, EPIC was used to simulate yield responses at various irrigation regimes with farm fields' data. Maize required ∼700 mm of water input and ∼650 mm of ETc to achieve a maximum yield of 8.5 Mg ha-1 while cotton required between 700 and 900 mm of water input and between 650 and 750 mm of ETc to achieve a maximum yield of 2.0-2.5 Mg ha-1. The simulation results demonstrate that the EPIC model can be used as a decision support tool for the crops under full and deficit irrigation conditions in South Texas. EPIC appears to be effective in making long-term and pre-season decisions for irrigation management of crops, while reference ET and phenologically based crop coefficients can be used for in-season irrigation management.","Crop evapotranspiration; Crop model; EPIC; Irrigation management","Crop coefficient; Crop evapotranspiration; Crop model; Crop production; Crop water use; Crop yield; Decision support tools; Deficit irrigation; Environmental policy integrated climate models; EPIC; EPIC model; Field sampling; Irrigated cotton; Irrigation management; Irrigation regimes; Simulation model; Simulation result; Water-use efficiency; Yield response; Artificial intelligence; Biochemical oxygen demand; Cotton; Cultivation; Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Environmental protection; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Lysimeters; Simulators; Soil surveys; Water supply; Crops; cotton; crop yield; decision support system; ecological modeling; evapotranspiration; irrigation; maize; measurement method; model validation; water management; water use efficiency; North America; Texas; United States; Gossypium hirsutum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65849156535

According to the flood pulse concept, the marsh floodplains would have stored large amounts of nutrients and carbon during dry antecedent conditions, which would be released into the overlaying flood water. Field studies were conducted in mid-December 2005 at two sites, one on open floodplain woodland with a sparse canopy of River Red Gum and ground cover dominated by saltbushes and the other on open floodplain with black roly-poly. At each site, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), planktonic bacteria and phytoplankton were monitored daily for a 6-day period from the overlaying water of a floodplain inundated by the environmental water release. Those in mesocosms deployed in situ, containing marsh floodplain sediments that had been inundated artificially, were also monitored. The mesocosm results from both the sites showed that release of nitrogen was rapid, attaining mean concentrations of total nitrogen of 3. 7-14. 8 mg l-1, followed by more gradual increases in total phosphorus (mean concentrations 0. 6-0. 8 mg l-1) and DOC (26. 1-50. 2 mg l-1) within the 6-day experiment; planktonic microbial communities developed concomitantly with the increasing concentrations of nutrients and DOC, attaining mean densities of (6. 0-6. 9) × 106 cells ml-1 of planktonic bacteria and (80. 7-81. 4) × 103 cells ml-1 of phytoplankton; and for each site the overall measured condition of the mesocosm tended to approach that of the Marshes, over the course of the 6-day experiment. The present study (both observational and experimental) demonstrates that the floodplain sediments in the Marshes, which have been exposed to dry antecedent conditions, release nutrients and carbon to the overlaying flood water following inundation. These resources are thought to have been stored during the dry antecedent phase in accord with the flood pulse concept. Based on the mesocosm experiment, the released nutrients and carbon are in turn most likely to be used by microbial components, such as bacteria and algae, which develop within days of inundation of the floodplain sediments. Thus, environmental flow release provides potential for floodplains to attain a series of ecological responses including initial release of inorganic nutrients and dissolved organic matter and increase in planktonic bacteria and phytoplankton. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Dissolved organic matter; Environmental flows; Floodplain inundation; Macquarie Marshes; Nitrogen; Phosphorus","dissolved organic carbon; ecosystem response; experimental study; floodplain; marsh; mesocosm; microbial community; nutrient availability; phytoplankton; Australasia; Australia; Macquarie Marshes; New South Wales; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72149121327

There was an increasing gradient of CH4 flux rates from an unflooded upper-elevation forest site to an occasionally flooded bottomland forest site to a shallow permanently flooded site, and then to a deeper-water permanently flooded site. Depending on the time of year, all sites were sources of methane but only at the upper-elevation forest site, when gravimetric soil moisture content fell below 54%, was atmospheric methane consumed. On average, summer CH4 emission rates were higher than those in other seasons. A multiple regression model with soil temperature and soil redox potential as independent variables could explain 65% of the variation in CH4 flux rates. In the flooded zone, variation in CH4 flux rates was correlated with aboveground plant biomass and stem density of emergent vascular plants, and plant-mediated CH4 transport depended on plant type. The efflux of CH4 to plant biomass (Eff:B) ratio was generally lower in Hydrocotyle umbellata compared to Festuca obtusa. Compared to several other freshwater forested wetlands in the southeastern USA, this spring-fed forested wetland ecosystem was a strong source of atmospheric CH4, likely due to a long hydroperiod and high soil organic matter content. Carbon dioxide fluxes show a reverse spatial pattern than CH4 fluxes with highest CO2 emissions in the non-flooded zone at all times of the year, indicating the dominance of aerobic soil respiration. A multiple regression model also revealed a strong dependency of CO2 fluxes (r 2 = 0.73) on soil temperature and soil redox potential. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Emergent vascular plants; Methane; Redox potential; Spring-fed forested wetland; Temperature","Aerobic soil; Atmospheric methanes; Carbon dioxide flux; Emergent vascular plants; Emission rates; Flooded zones; Flux rates; Forest sites; Forested wetlands; Hydrologic regime; Hydroperiod; Independent variables; Mississippi; Multiple regression model; Plant biomass; Plant types; Redox potential; Soil moisture content; Soil organic matter contents; Soil redox potential; Soil temperature; Spatial patterns; Spring-fed forested wetland; Stem density; Vascular plant; Vegetation control; Atmospheric chemistry; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Geologic models; Groundwater; Methane; Moisture determination; Organic compounds; Regression analysis; Secondary batteries; Soil moisture; Temperature; Wetlands; carbon dioxide; elevation; flood; flux measurement; forest soil; hydrological regime; methane; redox potential; soil emission; soil moisture; soil organic matter; vascular plant; vegetation; wetland; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystems; Ground Water; Hydrology; Methane; Moisture Content; Organic Compounds; Plants; Soil; Wetlands; Clear Springs Wetland; Mississippi; North America; Panola County [Mississippi]; United States; Festuca subverticillata; Hydrocotyle umbellata; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349256476

We studied the effects of the interaction of CO2, water supply and inoculation with a plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR), Pseudomonas mendocina Palleroni, or inoculation with an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus, Glomus intraradices (Schenk &amp; Smith), on aggregate stabilisation of the rhizosphere soil of Lactuca sativa L. cv. Tafalla. The influence of such structural improvements on the growth of lettuce was evaluated. We hypothesised that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration would increase the beneficial effects of inoculation with a PGPR or an AM fungus on the aggregate stability of the rhizosphere soil of lettuce plants. Leaf hydration, shoot dry biomass and mycorrhizal colonisation were decreased significantly under water-stress conditions, but this decrease was more pronounced under ambient vs elevated CO2. The root biomass decreased under elevated CO2 but only in non-stressed plants. Under elevated CO2, the microbial biomass C of the rhizosphere of the G. intraradices-colonised plants increased with water stress. Bacterial and mycorrhizal inoculation and CO2 had no significant effect on the easily-extractable glomalin concentration. Plants grown under elevated CO2 had a significantly higher percentage of stable aggregates under drought stress than under well-watered conditions, particularly the plants inoculated with either of the assayed microbial inocula (about 20% higher than the control soil). We conclude that the contribution of mycorrhizal fungi and PGPR to soil aggregate stability under elevated atmospheric CO2 is largely enhanced by soil drying. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to characterize this remarkable phenomenon, the microbial community and chemical species in snow were analyzed. A core sample of snow which had a colored region was investigated and it revealed vertical shifts in physicochemical characteristics and the microbial community structure. The abundance of particles peaked within the colored layer, and correlated with the amount of reducible Fe(III). The interstitial water of the colored layer was enriched with Fe(II), and characterized by reduced concentration of dissolved methane. The bacterial community in the colored region was characterized by higher relative abundance of iron-reducing bacteria and methanotrophs. Aggregates of the brown particles were found as precipitates in snow melt pools, and were subjected to cloning analyses targeting several different genes. The majority of bacterial 16S rRNA gene clones belonged to the class Betaproteobacteria or the phylum Bacteroidetes. No snow algae were detected in the eukaryotic small subunit rRNA gene clone library. As a possible carbon source to sustain the community in the snow, involvements of carbon dioxide and methane were investigated by analyzing the genes involved in their assimilation. In the analyses of genes for ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, clones related to sulfur oxidizers were obtained. The analysis of particulate methane monooxygenase genes indicated dominance of Methylobacter species. These results emphasized the uniqueness of this phenomenon, and iron reducers of the genus Geobacter are suggested to be the key organisms that could be investigated in order to understand the mechanism of this phenomenon. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Gas mixing between cold and hot regions of the combustion chamber, which is of major importance for the emissions formation, is also accounted for throughout compression, combustion and expansion. Combustion is modeled using a reduced set of chemical reactions coupled with a chemical kinetics solver. A refined zone configuration near the combustion chamber wall was used, in order to obtain a high resolution at the emissions formation regions. The pressure traces and emissions of nine experimental cases were compared to the multi-zone model results. In these cases the equivalence ratio and the boost pressure were varied, while maintaining constant engine speed. The results show adequate agreement with the pressure traces. The emissions trends are also adequately captured, with the absolute values presenting some deviation from the experimental cases especially for the HC and CO emissions at the relatively low air-fuel equivalence ratios. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Particulate source apportionment technology (PSAT) is a tagged species method that apportions concentrations of PM components to their respective primary precursors, e.g., sulfate is apportioned to SOx, nitrate to NOx, etc. The decoupled direct method (DDM) calculates first-order sensitivities of PM concentrations to model inputs. Both tools were applied to two month long (February and July) PM modeling episodes and evaluated against changes in PM concentrations due to various emission reductions. The results show that source contributions calculated by PSAT start to deviate from the actual model responses as indirect effects from limiting reactants or nonprimary precursor emissions become important. The DDM first-order sensitivity is useful for determining source contributions only if the model response to input changes is reasonably linear. For secondary inorganic PM, the response is linear for emission reductions of 20% in all cases considered and reasonably linear for reductions of 100% in the case of on-road mobile sources. The model response for secondary organic aerosols and primary PM remains nearly linear to 100% reductions in anthropogenic emissions. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality models; Anthropogenic emissions; Decoupled direct methods; Efficient method; Emission reduction; Emission sources; First-order sensitivity; Indirect effects; Model inputs; Model response; On-road mobile sources; Particulate Matter; Particulate sources; PM component; Secondary organic aerosols; Source apportionment; Source contributions; Aerosols; Air quality; Concentration (process); Emission control; Particulate emissions; Sensitivity analysis; Permanent magnets; nitrate; sulfate; aerosol property; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric modeling; concentration (composition); emission control; particulate matter; air monitoring; air quality control; article; calculation; comparative study; concentration (parameters); exhaust gas; mathematical model; particulate matter; sensitivity analysis; Air; Air Pollutants; Models, Theoretical; Particulate Matter; United States; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549106482

For nitrate-respiring microbes, Cr(VI) may be not only directly toxic but may also specifically interfere with N reduction. In soil microcosms amended with organic electron donors, Cr(VI), and nitrate, bacteria oxidized added carbon, but relatively low doses of Cr(VI) caused a lag and then lower rates of CO2 accumulation. Cr(VI) strongly inhibited nitrate reduction; it occurred only after soluble Cr(VI) could not be detected. However, Cr(VI) additions did not eliminate Cr-sensitive populations; after a second dose of Cr(VI), bacterial activity was strongly inhibited. Differences in microbial community composition (assayed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) driven by different organic substrates (glucose and protein) were smaller than when other electron acceptors had been used. However, the selection of bacterial phylotypes was modified by Cr(VI). Nine isolated clades of facultatively anaerobic Cr(VI)-resistant bacteria were closely related to cultivated members of the phylum Actinobacteria or Firmicutes. In Bacillus cereus GNCR-4, the nature of the electron donor (fermentable or nonfermentable) affected Cr(VI) resistance level and anaerobic nitrate metabolism. Our results indicate that carbon utilization and nitrate reduction in these soils were contingent upon the reduction of added Cr(VI).

The CWL receives partially treated municipal wastewater with an average COD and TSS of 430 and 130 mg L-1, respectively. Results from the seventh year of operation at a loading rate of 11 g-BOD m-2 d-1 show 60% and 70% COD and BOD reduction, respectively. Low oxygen concentrations, typical to subsurface horizontal CWLs, resulted in almost no nitrification. Major microbial groups were characterized by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) at the beginning, center and end of the CWL and at different depths including the root zone. Relatively uniform microbial population distribution was observed, with some evidence for oxygen translocation by plants to the root zone at areas closer to the CWL outlet. Further, depth was found to have a somewhat higher effect on the distribution of the major microbial groups than distance from the inlet. Eubacteria dominated the microbial population at all points consisting almost always more than 85% of the population. About 50% of the Archaea present in the CWL were methane producers. Sulfate-reducing bacteria were observed in significant numbers with low vertical and longitudinal variations. Nitrifying bacteria were present only sparsely (1-3%), while methanotrophic bacteria were found in higher numbers (∼10% of the population). © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A review of sector and region specific energy efficiency measures resulted in the specification of a global energy demand scenario incorporating strong energy efficiency measures. The corresponding energy supply scenario has been developed in an iterative process in close cooperation with stakeholders and regional counterparts from academia, NGOs and the renewable energy industry. The Energy [R]evolution scenario shows that renewable energy can provide more than half of the world's energy needs by 2050.

We had previously found, through modeling and mass balance analyses of an arid land afforestation experimental project in Western Australia, that a significant amount of litter could have been physically removed from the floors of natural forests. In order to analyze litter carbon dynamics in depth, we investigated the actual mobility of litter in several natural forests in Sturt Meadows in an arid region of Western Australia, and estimated the difference between the removal rate of leaf and woody (twigs and branches) litter on the forest floor. Then we redeveloped a litter carbon dynamics model by incorporating physical removal of litter to show the different mobilities of leaf and woody litters. We also analyzed carbon balances and the effect of differential litter mobility on litter carbon dynamics. Except for twigs in one plot in a high density forest, 29-100% of leaf litter and 10-100% of woody litter was removed annually, demonstrating the physical removal of litter in these natural forests. The main cause of litter removal was wind, not flooding. Decreases in leaf and woody litters could be approximated as first order decay functions in most plots; first order decay or disappearance rate constants were then determined. Estimated disappearance rate constants of leaf and woody litter ranged from 0.19 to 11 and 0.11-12year-1, respectively; most of the constants ranged from 0.19 to 2.0 and 0.11-0.74year-1, respectively. Based on the disappearance rate constant, the mobility of woody litter was estimated to be roughly 20% that of leaf litter, confirming that climatic factors move leaves more easily than twigs. The improved model, which took into account the different mobilities of leaf and woody litters, showed that annual physical removal of litter reached 70-82% of the annual litter fall in Acacia aneura forests, and that roughly 40-60% of the existing litter was removed annually from all sites. Incorporating into the model the difference in mobilities of leaf and woody litters showed that the ratio of annual litter removal to annual litter fall increased about 10% points compared with the assumption of that both litter types had equal mobility. © 2009.","Arid land; Litter mobility; Litter removal","Arid regions; Bioassay; Carbon; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Floors; Forestry; Global warming; Reforestation; Vehicles; Arid ecosystems; Arid lands; Carbon dynamics; Climatic factors; Experimental projects; First-order decays; Mass balance analysis; Western Australia; Rate constants; Carbon; Ecosystems; Forest Litter; Forests; Acacia aneura",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896507344

Since that time, pollution control strategies, tightening exhaust emission standards for industry, improvements in fuel quality, and new stricter vehicle emission standards, etc., have been implemented. This study evaluates the effectiveness of these measures and examines the improvement of Taiwan's air quality. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of change in the concentrations of pollutants (SO2, NOx and particulate matter [PM]) between two three-year periods (from 1996 to1998 and from 2000 to 2002). The pollution levels were generally lower in the latter period. Concentrations at 14 EPA/TW stations in central Taiwan were simulated and source apportionment analyses in three of Central Taiwan's largest cities were conducted using a trajectory transfer-coefficient air quality model. Correlation coefficients (r) between simulations and observations for the monthly means of the concentrations of SO2, NOx, PM2.5 and PM10 during the study periods at the 14 stations are 0.56, 0.63, 0.70 and 0.31, respectively. The sulfur control policy greatly reduced SO2 concentration island-wide, a stringent emission standard put into place for gasoline vehicles reduced NOx concentration along highways, and an emissions tax placed on construction sites, as well as a regular program for road-dust sweeping, reduced primary particulate matter. Among all of the pollution abatement policies implemented, the most effective method for reducing PM2.5 concentrations in the three largest cities involved the reduction of fine ammonium sulfate aerosols from point sources (56-63% of net PM2.5 reduction). The next largest reduction was attributed to a diminishment in primary PM2.5 emanating from point sources (27-56% of net PM2.5 reduction). Secondary particulate matter, especially sulfate, was reduced from distances up to 150 km leeward of major pollution point sources such as Taichung Power Plant. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Empirical data on the design and performance of masonry buildings in Norway are presented, based on a comprehensive analysis of 302 process induced masonry defect assignments over a 20-year period from 1983 to 2002. Analyses of building defects are necessary in order to further develop tools, solutions and preventive measures ensuring high-performance building envelopes. The results illuminate the vulnerability of masonry under varying climatic exposure. The amount of masonry defects in Norway illustrates that it is not only the extreme weather events that need to be studied as a foundation for geographically dependent design guidelines. Driving rain and frost action are the principal climatic challenges to be considered in the pursuit of high-performance masonry structures. Shrinkage and thermal movement, the most frequent defect category, dominate independent of the climatic impact. Merely small errors or mistakes can bring about major and often irreparable defects or damage to masonry structuresA large part of the cases could have been avoided through more detailed engineering and applied knowledge on existing design guidelines. Finally, performance requirements for better design guidelines are presented. The need for design guidelines to ensure local climate adaptation and improved design guidelines on movement joints is also revealed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The depth at which this sinking carbon is converted back to carbon dioxideknown as the remineralization depthdepends on the balance between particle sinking speeds and their rate of decay. A host of climate-sensitive factors can affect this balance, including temperature, oxygen concentration, stratification, community composition and the mineral content of the sinking particles. Here we use a three-dimensional global ocean biogeochemistry model to show that a modest change in remineralization depth can have a substantial impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. For example, when the depth at which 63% of sinking carbon is respired increases by 24 m globally, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall by 10-27 ppm. This reduction in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration results from the redistribution of remineralized carbon from intermediate waters to bottom waters. As a consequence of the reduced concentration of respired carbon in upper ocean waters, atmospheric carbon dioxide is preferentially stored in newly formed North Atlantic Deep Water. We suggest that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are highly sensitive to the potential changes in remineralization depth that may be caused by climate change. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

IT-SOFCs containing the same cathode-electrolyte configuration but equipped with different anodes were compared in terms of performance, steady state operation, and formation of carbon deposits on the anode surface. After proper cell conditioning, similar maximum power densities of 284 mW cm-2 and 310 mW cm-2 were obtained in dry methane fuel at 750 °C for the anodic compositions with and without barium, respectively. The anode containing barium did not show significant carbon deposits after a 200 h time-study in dry methane whereas the anode without barium showed the presence of carbon deposits as evidenced by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Both anode formulations showed carbon deposits when exposed to dry CH4 in ex-situ experiments. The electrochemical profile recorded during the time-study was different in the two systems. In the absence of barium, a slow and progressive increase in performance as a function of time was achieved. On the contrary, the Ba-doped anode achieved optimum performance in a short time. It is determined that the presence of barium reduces carbon deposition under fuel cell conditions and influences the electrochemical behaviour. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

CAP88 estimates radiation dose and the risk of health effects to human populations from radionuclide emissions to air. This program is used by several U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facilities to comply with National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants regulations. CAP88 Mainframe, referred to as version 1.0 on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Web site (http://www.epa.gov/radiation/assessment/CAP88/), was the very first CAP88 version released in 1988. Some DOE facilities including the Savannah River Site still employ this version (1.0) while others use the more user-friendly personal computer Windows-based version 3.0 released in December 2007. Version 1.0 uses the program RADRISK based on International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 30 as its radionuclide database. Version 3.0 uses half-life, dose, and risk factor values based on Federal Guidance Report 13. Differences in these values could cause different results for the same input exposure data (same scenario), depending on which version of CAP88 is used. Consequently, the differences between the two versions are being assessed in detail at Savannah River National Laboratory. The version 1.0 and 3.0 database files contain 496 and 838 radionuclides, respectively, and though one would expect the newer version to include all the 496 radionuclides, 35 radionuclides are listed in version 1.0 that are not included in version 3.0. The majority of these has either extremely short or long half-lives or is no longer in production; however, some of the short-lived radionuclides might produce progeny of great interest at DOE sites. In addition, 122 radionuclides were found to have different half-lives in the two versions, with 21 over 3 percent different and 12 over 10 percent different. © 2009 Health Physics Society.","Dose assessment; Dose, population; Dosimetry; Modeling, dose assessment","radioisotope; radioisotope; air quality control; article; computer model; data base; field emission; half life time; health hazard; priority journal; progeny; radiation dose; radiation exposure; air pollutant; computer program; evaluation; factual database; government; human; legal aspect; mainframe; microcomputer; radiation monitoring; radiation protection; statistics; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollutants, Radioactive; Computers, Mainframe; Databases, Factual; Humans; Microcomputers; Radiation Monitoring; Radiation Protection; Radioisotopes; Software; South Carolina; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69149102640

We modeled the distribution of two forms of pre-European contact intensive agriculture - irrigated pondfields and rain-fed dryland systems - across the Hawaiian archipelago using a GIS approach based on climate, hydrology, topography, substrate age, and soil fertility. Model results closely match the archaeological evidence in defined locations. On a broader scale, we calculate that the youngest island, Hawai'i, could have supported 572 km2 of intensive agriculture, 97% as rain-fed dryland field systems, while Kaua'i, the oldest island, could have supported 58 km2, all as irrigated wetland systems. Irrigated systems have higher, more reliable yields and lower labor requirements than rain-fed dryland systems, so the total potential yield from Kaua'i (∼49k metric tons) was almost half that of Hawai'i (∼97k metric tons), although Kaua'i systems required only ∼0.05 of the agricultural labor (∼8400 workers, versus ∼165,000 on Hawai'i) to produce the crops. We conclude that environmental constraints to intensive agriculture across the archipelago created asymmetric production efficiencies, and therefore varying potentials for agricultural surplus. The implications both for the emergence of complex sociopolitical formations and for anthropogenic transformation of Hawaiian ecosystems are substantial. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Owing to the presence of waterlogged and anaerobic conditions, peatlands are typically a source of methane (CH4), a very potent greenhouse gas. This paper reviews the key mechanisms of peatland CH4 production, consumption and transport and the major environmental and biotic controls on peatland CH4 emissions. The advantages and disadvantages of micrometeoro- logical and chamber methods in measuring CH4 fluxes from northern peatlands are also discussed. The magnitude of CH4 flux varies considerably among peatland types (bogs and fens) and microtopographic locations (hummocks and hollows). Some anthropogenic activities including forestry, peat harvesting and industrial emission of sulphur dioxide can cause a reduction in CH4 release from northern peatlands. Further research should be conducted to investigate the influence of plant growth forms on CH4 flux from northern peatlands, determine the water table threshold at which plant production in peatlands enhances CH4 release, and quantify peatland CH4 exchange at plant community level with a higher temporal resolution using automatic chambers. © 2009 Soil Science Society of China.","global carbon cycle; greenhouse gas; methane oxidation; methanogenesis; methanotrophy","anoxic conditions; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; greenhouse gas; human activity; methane; oxidation; peatland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649946920

Due to low time resolution, actual measurements reflect only momentary CO2 exchange rates. Therefore, a common way to derive seasonal or annual estimates is to establish models describing the response of CO2 exchange to environmental variables, and then to reconstruct the CO2 exchange over the desired time period. There are several alternative ways to obtain the CO2 balance for the entire mire: models can be parameterized by individual sample plots, plant communities or the entire site. Similarly, the CO2 balance can be reconstructed by plots, plant communities or the entire site. We tested how the choice of the modelling and reconstruction approach influences the CO2 exchange estimates for the entire mire and for individual sample plots and plant communities. We measured the CO2 exchange in a spatially heterogeneous sedge-dominated northern aapa mire for two growing seasons. We observed high spatial variation in CO2 balance between the plant communities. We noticed that when the CO2 balances of individual sample plots or plant communities are of interest, using a model appropriate for the entire site may result in biased estimates. In worst case the different modelling approaches may turn the CO2 balance of an individual sample plot from positive to negative. Further, while using the whole ecosystem approach in modelling, the superior ability of chamber method in acknowledging spatial variation is lost. While the modelled growing season CO2 balance of the mire ranged from 232 to 625 g CO2 m-2 depending on the chosen modelling and reconstruction approach, the average estimates still remained within the uncertainty range of one another. Acknowledgement of the spatial variation in plant community level makes the areal estimate more robust to varying weather conditions. Further, the reliability of estimates is improved by explicit formulation of the choices behind the modelling and reconstruction units reflecting the study objectives. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The World Medical Association recently adopted the Declaration of Delhi, committing the medical profession to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. This is new professional territory for many doctors. Even so, the profession has often engaged with issues outside 'the health sector' when the stakes are high, for example leaded petrol, road safety, tobacco, and nuclear weapons. The scientific basis to the declaration merits scrutiny in light of commonly used contrary arguments. Decisions in medicine, as elsewhere, must be taken on the evidence to hand, weighing up the risks, given that complete knowledge is seldom available and time is precious. There are strong analogies between clinical experience and our approach to planetary climate. The relevant context for scientific observations on climate is the world's multigigatonne annual CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions drive changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases, which matters when they are rapid or prolonged. The current variation in global temperature is alarming, even when within 'normal range'. Climate models inform and guide present-day decision-making, and perform well in explaining observed warming. They corroborate other evidence that tells us that CO2 and other greenhouse gases are harmful at current atmospheric concentrations.

They also function as communication media within plant communities, between plants and between plants and insects. Because of the high chemical reactivity of many of these compounds, coupled with their large mass emission rates from vegetation into the atmosphere, they have significant effects on the chemical composition and physical characteristics of the atmosphere. Hence, biogenic volatile organic compounds mediate the relationship between the biosphere and the atmosphere. Alteration of this relationship by anthropogenically driven changes to the environment, including global climate change, may perturb these interactions and may lead to adverse and hard-to-predict consequences for the Earth system.© New Phytologist (2009).","Atmospheric chemistry; Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs); Climate change; Global warming; Plant defence; Plant volatiles; Tritrophic interaction","volatile organic compound; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; atmospheric chemistry; biogenic emission; chemical composition; global climate; global warming; physical property; plant defense; tritrophic interaction; volatile organic compound; astronomy; atmosphere; chemistry; climate; ecosystem; metabolism; plant; review; Atmosphere; Climate; Earth (Planet); Ecosystem; Plants; Volatile Organic Compounds; Hexapoda",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66649108294

In this paper, we present challenges in developing a GHG emissions inventory related to the provision of municipal services. We argue that a consumption-based perspective, illustrated through the use of the carbon footprint (CF), rather than more conventional production-based inventory, provides a more useful and less misleading indicator. We present an analysis of the CF of municipal services provided by the city of Trondheim. The use of data directly from the city's accounting system ensures a reliable calculation of indirect emissions, and, with some minor modifications, also accurate data on direct emissions. Our analysis shows that approximately 93 percent of the total CF of municipal services is indirect emissions, located in upstream paths, underlining the need of introducing consumption-based indicators that takes into account upstream GHG emissions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The adaptive perspective is closely connected to the concept of resilience understood as different views on nature's capacity to absorb shocks, renewal and re-organization. In constructing normative scenarios images of the future are generated illustrating potential ways of living, travelling and consuming products and services where certain goals such as a reduced climate impact are fulfilled. This paper argues that tension arising from climate strategies relying on either adaptation or mitigation strategies, or combining the two strategies, warrant further examination. In this paper the inter-relationships between adaptation and mitigation are discussed by examining processes of citizen-participation in constructing scenarios and applying the concepts of resilience, vulnerability and adaptive capacity. We discuss this using the concept of deliberative planning processes as a means to achieve legitimate, effective and sustainable futures. As a part of this approach, we argue that methods for citizen-participation applied in exploring different science and technology options also provide useful insight for this type of planning processes. The theoretical arguments are combined with examples from environmental scenario construction in practice. The paper brings attention to tensions between sustainability content values, such as reduced climate impact, and more process-oriented values such as legitimacy, learning and participatory scenario construction. Moreover, the concept of open innovation processes is introduced to the context of participatory scenario construction comparing shared ground in terms of user-involvement in search of novel solutions and also increasing robustness of action plans implemented to reduce climate change. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The consequence of the directive is that river basin management plans (RBMPs) shall be prepared which are legally subject to a strategic environmental assessment (SEA). An important environmental factor for the water sector is climate change, especially the changes it causes to the water environment. However, based on an argument of an inadequate knowledge base regarding climate change impacts, the prospect of Danish authorities including climate change in their SEAs of RBMPs is weak. In this paper the connections between climate change and water are reviewed. As a result, it is suggested that climate change needs to be considered in three ways: mitigation, adaptation and baseline adaptation. © IAIA 2009.","Adaptation; Climate change; Mitigation; River basin management plans; Strategic environmental assessment; Water framework directive","adaptation; basin management; best management practice; climate change; climate effect; environmental factor; mitigation; policy implementation; strategic environmental assessment; water planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74849088614

These environmental changes also can affect plants indirectly by altering interactions with other species. Therefore, the effects of global changes on a particular species may depend on the presence and abundance of other community members. We experimentally manipulated atmospheric CO2 concentration and amounts of herbivore damage (natural insect folivory and clipping to simulate browsing) to examine: (1) how herbivores mediate the effects of elevated CO2 (eCO2) on the growth and fitness of Arabidopsis thaliana; and (2) how predicted changes in CO2 concentration affect plant resistance to herbivores, which influences the amount of damage plants receive, and plant tolerance of herbivory, or the fitness consequences of damage. We found no evidence that CO2 altered resistance, but plants grown in eCO2 were less tolerant of herbivory-clipping reduced aboveground biomass and fruit production by 13 and 22%, respectively, when plants were reared under eCO2, but plants fully compensated for clipping in ambient CO2 (aCO2) environments. Costs of tolerance in the form of reduced fitness of undamaged plants were detected in eCO2 but not aCO2 environments. Increased costs could reduce selection on tolerance in eCO2 environments, potentially resulting in even larger fitness effects of clipping in predicted future eCO2 conditions. Thus, environmental perturbations can indirectly affect both the ecology and evolution of plant populations by altering both the intensity of species interactions as well as the fitness consequences of those interactions. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Browsing; Carbon dioxide; Cost; Global change; Herbivory","carbon dioxide; insecticide; aboveground biomass; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); defense behavior; fitness; fruit production; global change; growth rate; herbivory; perturbation; plant community; tolerance; analysis of variance; animal; Arabidopsis; article; drug effect; ecosystem; feeding behavior; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; insect; metabolism; physiology; plant leaf; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Arabidopsis; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior; Genotype; Insecticides; Insects; Plant Leaves; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349122941

To mitigate the impacts of global warming, the Kyoto Protocol was established in 1997 with the objective of reducing global greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission, in particular carbon dioxide (CO2), by 5.2% below 1990 levels. Developed nations that ratified the Protocol are committed to GHG reduction targets while developing nations are encouraged to reduce GHG emissions on a voluntary basis. Since most of the GHGs emissions come from the energy sector, energy policy plays an important role in fulfilling the Kyoto Protocol obligations. This year marks the beginning of the commitment period for the 2012 Kyoto Protocol. In this case, it would be worthwhile to compare the energy policies in Malaysia and Japan as these nations move towards fulfilling their obligations towards the Kyoto Protocol; bearing in mind that both countries ratified the Protocol, but that Japan commits a reduction target of 6% while Malaysia bears no obligation. Based on the comparison, recommendations were made on how a developing nation like Malaysia could adopt the policies implemented in Japan to suit local conditions and contribute significantly to GHG reduction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We compare a ""No Control"" scenario with global sulfur limits and regionally applied reductions. We show that, if no control measures are taken, near surface sulfate increases by about 10-20% over the main transoceanic shipping routes from 2002 to 2012. A reduction of the maximum fuel sulfur (S) content allowed within 200 nautical miles of coastal areas (""global emission control areas"") to 0.5% or 0.1% (5000 or 1000 ppm S, respectively) results in a distinctive reduction in near surface sulfate from shipping in coastal regions compared with the year 2002. The model results also show that if emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) remain unabated, a reduction of the fuel sulfur content favors a strong increase in aerosol nitrate (NO3) which could counteract up to 20% of the decrease in sulfate mass achieved by sulfur emission reductions. The most important impact of shipping on the radiation budget is related to the modification of low maritime stratus clouds resulting in an increased reflectivity and enhanced shortwave cloud forcing. The direct aerosol effect from shipping is small. Our study shows that one can expect a less negative (less cooling) radiative forcing due to reductions in the current fuel sulfur content of ocean-going ships. The global annual average net cloud forcings due to shipping (year 2012) are in the range of -0.27 to -0.58 W/m2 with regional cooling occurring most over the remote oceans. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Aerosol effect; Aerosol nitrates; Annual average; Cloud forcing; Cloud microphysics; Coastal area; Coastal regions; Control area; Control measures; Forcings; Fuel sulfur; Global climate model; Global emissions; Model results; Near-surface; Policy instruments; Policy scenario; Radiation budget; Radiative forcings; Regional cooling; Ship emissions; Shipping routes; Sulfur emissions; Tropospheric aerosols; Atmospheric aerosols; Budget control; Clouds; Coastal zones; Cooling; Emission control; Fuels; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Ocean currents; Ships; Sulfur; Reduction; nitrate; nitrogen oxide; sulfate; sulfur; climate modeling; cloud microphysics; comparative study; cooling; emission control; global climate; nitrogen oxides; pollution policy; radiation budget; shipping; sulfate; aerosol; air quality; article; atmospheric deposition; cloud; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cooling; environmental protection; global climate; policy; sea; seashore; shipping; troposphere; ultraviolet radiation; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Atmosphere; Climate; Computer Simulation; Greenhouse Effect; Nitrates; Nitrogen Oxides; Oceans and Seas; Particulate Matter; Public Policy; Radiation; Sulfates; Transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649972735

It is widely accepted that the poorest communities are the most vulnerable, because they lack access even to the most basic urban services placing them at a comparative disadvantage and challenging their capabilities to take on additional stresses caused by climate change. Such complex vulnerabilities require comprehensive responses that link climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts to the sustainable development of these communities enhancing their adaptive capacity. It is not sufficient to concentrate on either mitigation or adaptation, but a combination of these results in the most sustainable outcomes. Yet, these two strategies do not always complement each other, but can be counterproductive. A similar argument can be made for linking climate change adaptation with sustainable development. In order to avoid these conflicts, priorities need to be set. This calls for a methodology and comparison tool to assess the most cost-effective and appropriate strategies for each community. Strategies need to be evaluated in terms of their negative consequences and priority given to those that minimize these.

The quality of the inventories is of great importance since these data are essential for air pollution impact assessments using dispersion models. In this study, the quality of the emission inventory for fine particulates (PM2.5) is assessed: first, using the calculated source contributions from a receptor model; second, using source apportionment from a dispersion model; and third, by applying a simple inverse modelling technique which utilises multiple linear regression of the dispersion model source contributions together with the observed PM2.5 concentrations. For the receptor modelling the chemical composition of PM2.5 filter samples from a measurement campaign performed between January 2004 and April 2005 are analysed. Positive matrix factorisation is applied as the receptor model to detect and quantify the various source contributions. For the same observational period and site, dispersion model calculations using the Air Quality Management system, AirQUIS, are performed. The results identify significant differences between the dispersion and receptor model source apportionment, particularly for wood burning and traffic induced suspension. For wood burning the receptor model calculations are lower, by a factor of 0.54, but for the traffic induced suspension they are higher, by a factor of 7.1. Inverse modelling, based on regression of the dispersion model source contributions and the PM2.5 concentrations, indicates similar discrepancies in the emissions inventory. In order to assess if the differences found at the one site are generally applicable throughout Oslo, the individual source category emissions are rescaled according to the receptor modelling results. These adjusted PM2.5 concentrations are compared with measurements at four independent stations to evaluate the updated inventory. Statistical analysis shows improvement in the estimated concentrations for PM2.5 at all sites. Similarly, inverse modelling is applied at these independent sites and this confirms the validity of the receptor model results. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate policy under the conservative Howard government (1995-2007) in Australia was largely dictated by fossil fuel and mineral sector interests, and reflected a close alliance with the Bush administration. The Howard government shunned the Kyoto Protocol, refused to set national binding greenhouse gas reduction targets and preferred voluntary cooperative measures with industry. The APP was part of the Howard government's strategy to demonstrate some policy movement on climate change while postponing serious action. Climate change was a key issue in the election of the Rudd Labor government in Australia in December 2007. The Rudd government quickly ratified Kyoto, adopted emission reduction targets, and moved to introduce emissions trading. The Rudd government's decision to continue involvement with the APP, albeit with diminished funding, was a pragmatic one. The APP was supported by industry and provided bridges to China and India-both key countries in the post-2012 UNFCCC negotiations. Finally, in order to assess the long-term outlook of the APP, the article provides a preliminary assessment as to whether the APP advances technology transfer. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Asia Pacific partnership on clean development and climate; Australian climate policy; Technology transfer","clean development mechanism; climate change; emission control; emissions trading; environmental policy; fossil fuel; partnership approach; refuse; technology transfer; Australasia; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71349085594

The inherent problem with such lawmaking moments, however, is just that: they are moments. What Congress and the President do with much fanfare can quickly and quietly slip away in the ensuing years. This is famously so for environmental law. Subsequent legislative amendments, limited budgets, appropriations riders, interpretive agency rulings, massive delays in rulemaking, and simple nonenforcement are more than capable of converting a seemingly uncompromising legal mandate into nothing more than a symbolic aspirational statement. Climate change legislation is especially vulnerable to being unraveled over time for a variety of reasons, but especially because of the extent to which it imposes costs on the short term for the realization of benefits many decades and sometimes centuries later. To be successful over the long term, climate change legislation will need to include institutional design features that insulate programmatic implementation to a significant extent from powerful political and economic interests propelled by short-term concerns. Such design features should include a variety of asymmetric precommitment strategies, which deliberately make it hard (never impossible) to change the law in response to some kinds of concerns while simultaneously providing avenues for change in response to other longer term concerns that are in harmony with the law's central purpose-to achieve and maintain greenhouse gas emissions reductions over time. The traditional objection to lawmaking precommitment strategies-that the present should not be allowed to bind future lawmakers-also has little force in the climate- change context, where the purpose of such strategies is not to protect the present at the expense of the future, but the precise opposite: to protect the future at the expense of the present.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70049111786

While rising atmospheric [CO2] is the driving force behind the greater temperatures and water stress, which threaten to reduce future crop yields, it also has the potential to directly benefit crop physiology. The nature of C4 plant responses to elevated [CO2] has been controversial. Recent evidence from free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments suggests that elevated [CO2] does not directly stimulate C4 photosynthesis. Nonetheless, drought stress can be ameliorated at elevated [CO2] as a result of lower stomatal conductance and greater intercellular [CO 2]. Therefore, unlike C3 crops for which there is a direct enhancement of photosynthesis by elevated [CO2], C4 crops will only benefit from elevated [CO2] in times and places of drought stress. Current projections of future crop yields have assumed that rising [CO2] will directly enhance photosynthesis in all situations and, therefore, are likely to be overly optimistic. Additional experiments are needed to evaluate the extent to which amelioration of drought stress by elevated [CO2] will improve C4 crop yields for food and fuel over the range of C4 crop growing conditions and genotypes. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Climate change; CO2 fertilization; Food security; Maize; Photosynthesis; Sorghum","carbon dioxide; fuel; carbon dioxide; climate change; crop production; crop yield; drought stress; food security; food supply; genotype; maize; photosynthesis; physiological response; sorghum; stomatal conductance; temperature effect; water stress; agriculture; atmospheric deposition; C4 plant; catering service; cell junction; cell level; climate change; crop management; drought; environmental factor; genotype environment interaction; greenhouse gas; harvest; high temperature; nonhuman; photosynthetic rate; plant growth; plant stoma; priority journal; review; water availability; wellbeing; Zea mays",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66749133568

To contribute to the fuel supply, renewable energies such as jatropha appear to be an attractive resource for biodiesel production in India as it can be grown on waste land and does not need intensive water supply. In order to produce biodiesel at a competitive cost, the biodiesel supply chain - from biomass harvesting to biodiesel delivery to the consumers - is analyzed. A mixed integer linear programming model is used in order to determine the optimal number and geographic locations of biodiesel plants. The optimization is based on minimization of the costs of the supply chain with respect to the biomass, production and transportation costs. Three biodiesel blends are considered, B2, B5 and B10. For each blend, 13 scenarios are considered where yield, biomass cost, cake price, glycerol price, transport cost and investment costs are studied. A sensitivity analysis is carried out on both those parameters and the resulting locations of the plants. The emissions of the supply chain are also considered. The results state that the biomass cost has most influence on the biodiesel cost (an increase of feedstock cost increases the biodiesel cost by about 40%) and to a lower effect, the investment cost and the glycerol price. Moreover, choosing the right set of production plant locations highly depends on the scenarios that have the highest probability to occur, for which the production plant locations still produce a competitive biodiesel cost and emissions from the transportation are minimum. In this study, one set of plant locations happened to meet these two requirements. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These new developments - and the corresponding risk management strategies - will change the calculus of interests, powers and strategies for all actors, with significant impacts on the global political economy. Climate change action (such as targets for emissions reductions) will challenge the existing power structures, with the transition to a low-carbon economy creating new winners and losers in the global economy. Today, there is a fresh appreciation about the consequences of bad policy choices. Comparisons have been drawn between the fallout in the global financial system and the kind of risks that unmitigated climate change may bring. Even though the pressure on some resources may have eased since the onset of the global economic downturn in 2008, it is unlikely that the longer term trajectory has been reversed. This calls for renewed understanding and appreciation of the magnitude of risks foreseen. Multiple public goods need to be generated from the same production systems or sectors. In the context of climate change, international cooperation offers the only option that can best serve even narrowly defined national interests.

Ensemble results show increases in road dust, biomass burning, and coal impacts, but secondary organic carbon (SOC) impacts decrease. These results, along with observations, are then used to obtain new source profiles.

Herein, we highlight recent advances made in the electrocatalytic recycling of CO2 and SOMs including (i) the overall trend of research activities made in this area, (ii) the relations between reduction conditions and products in the aqueous phase, (iii) the challenges in the use of gas diffusion electrodes for the continuous gas phase CO2 reduction, as well as (iv) the development of state of the art hybrid techniques for industrial applications. Perspectives geared to fully exploit the potential of zero-gap cells for CO2 reduction in the gaseous phase and the high applicability on a large scale are also presented. We envision that the hybrid system for CO2 reduction supported by sustainable solar, wind, and geothermal energies and waste heat will provide a long term reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and will allow for continued use of the abundant fossil fuels by industries and/or power plants but with zero emissions. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH&amp;Co.

This paper highlights some examples of using ocean state estimations for ocean and climate research. Many assimilation groups from different countries participated in a Climate Variability and Predictability program/Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment global ocean reanalysis evaluation effort in which intercomparisons were performed for a suite of diagnostic quantities and indices, including evaluations against observations.

An intriguing aspect of the recent observations of methane on Mars is that methane concentrations appear to be locally enhanced and change with the seasons. However, methane has a photochemical lifetime of several centuries, and is therefore expected to have a spatially uniform distribution on the planet. Here we use a global climate model of Mars with coupled chemistry to examine the implications of the recently observed variations of Martian methane for our understanding of the chemistry of methane. We find that photochemistry as currently understood does not produce measurable variations in methane concentrations, even in the case of a current, local and episodic methane release. In contrast, we find that the condensationĝ €""sublimation cycle of Marsĝ€™ carbon dioxide atmosphere can generate large-scale methane variations differing from those observed. In order to reproduce local methane enhancements similar to those recently reported, we show that an atmospheric lifetime of less than 200 days is necessary, even if a local source of methane is only active around the time of the observation itself. This implies an unidentified methane loss process that is 600 times faster than predicted by standard photochemistry. The existence of such a fast loss in the Martian atmosphere is difficult to reconcile with the observed distribution of other trace gas species. In the case of a destruction mechanism only active at the surface of Mars, destruction of methane must occur with an even shorter timescale of the order of 1 hour to explain the observations. If recent observations of spatial and temporal variations of methane are confirmed, this would suggest an extraordinarily harsh environment for the survival of organics on the planet. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"methane; atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; detection method; Mars; Martian atmosphere; methane; physics; article; astronomy; atmosphere; chemistry; global climate; photochemistry; physics; priority journal; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Electrochemistry; Exobiology; Extraterrestrial Environment; Mars; Methane; Models, Chemical; Photochemistry; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68449105086

The data provide valuable information about species and provenance choice for plantation establishment in many regions with different climates. However, since climate is changing rapidly, it may become increasingly difficult to choose the right species and provenance to plant.

Rather, building on an expanded definition of research capacity, Northern Ireland needs to capitalise cautiously on the current climate of openness between policy-maker and researcher communities. In so doing, the goals are to develop a shared, cohesive agenda, provide a sound evidence base, improve research support and harness the strengths and pockets of excellence that exist.

The approach of two emission features in the spectrum with increasing flux and their recession with decreasing flux is explained using a model with two physically related clumps of material that are partially superposed in the line of sight. Calculations have shown that, in this type of model, exponential amplification (unsaturated maser emission) in the overlapping parts of the clumps can produce the observed line narrowing with increasing flux. In most cases, the maser spots are inhomogeneous. During the evolution of some flares, the maser condensations may split into separate fragments.

Groundwater is intimately connected with the landscape and land use that it underlies, and most of the landscape and is vulnerable to the anthropogenic activities on the land surface above. Land use affects groundwater resources through changes in recharge and by changing demands for water. Inappropriate land use, particularly poor land management, causes chronic groundwater quality problems. Acute groundwater quality problems are common and arise from unsuitable land use and control, notably through point sources of hazardous chemicals. Current land use instruments have only been designed to address quality issues in groundwater and do not consider recharge. These instruments have been largely ineffective in protecting groundwater from diffuse pollution for several reasons including fragmentation, their general absence of teeth, and their lack of integration into the land use planning system. This paper argues for a more radical approach which would zone land according to its overall vulnerability and resilience to anthropogenic and climatic influence in order to sustainably support the ecosystem services it can deliver. Land use would be matched with the vulnerability of the soil, with geology and water, and with the whole ecosystem. The Water Framework Directive offers a mechanism to do this, but there is no evidence of enough political will to tackle the long-term conflicts between land use and groundwater. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.","Ecosystem services; Groundwater; Land use zoning; Surface water; Vulnerability","baseflow; fragmentation; groundwater resource; human activity; land management; land use; land use planning; recharge; vulnerability; water demand; water quality; water supply; zoning policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73249127129

They exhibit a broad band spectrum with significant emission between near-IR and radio wavelengths. We intend to investigate the possible contribution of the forthcoming ESA Planck mission to the science of UCHII regions by evaluating the possibility of detecting UCHIIs that are bright in the radio regime.Methods. We performed new 7 mm observations of a sample of UCHII regions. The observations were designed to acquire high-frequency radio spectra. For each source in our sample, the free-free radio spectrum has been modeled. Along with far-IR measurements, our spectra allow us to estimate the flux densities of the sources in the millimeter and sub-millimeter bands. We extrapolated and summed the ionized-gas (free-free radio emission) and dust (thermal emission) contributions in the afore mentioned wavelength ranges. The possibility of Planck detecting the selected sources can be assessed by comparing the estimated flux densities to the expected sensitivity in each Planck channel. To obtain a realistic estimation of the noise produced by the Galactic emission, the Planck sky model software package was used.Results. For each target source, from our new 7 mm data and other radio measurements from the literature, important physical parameters such as electron density and their spatial distribution, source geometry and emission measure were derived. We conclude that, in the case of the present sample, located close to the Galactic center, Planck will have a very low detection rate. In contrast, assuming that our sample is representative of the whole UCHII-region population, we derive a very high probability of detecting this kind of source with Planck if located instead close to the anticenter. From the analysis of the ionized-gas properties, we suggest that the selected sample could also be contaminated by other kinds of Galactic objects. © 2009 ESO.","H II regions; ISM: dust, extinction; Radio continuum: ISM; Stars: circumstellar matter; Stars: formation","Broad-band spectrum; Detection rates; Electron densities; Flux densities; Galactic Center; Galactic emission; Galactic plane; Gas properties; H II regions; High frequency HF; High probability; High-mass stars; IR measurements; ISM:Dust ,extinction; Near-IR; Physical parameters; Planck mission; Radio continuum: ISM; Radio emission; Radio measurements; Radio spectra; Radio wavelengths; Sky models; Source geometry; Spatial distribution; Submillimeters; Target source; Thermal emissions; Wavelength ranges; Dust; Ionization of gases; Stars; Leakage (fluid)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70949104234

Given that China's domestic realities inform its international policy choices, understanding how climate change may affect its population and natural resources is critical to global climate stabilization efforts. This article examines how the impacts of climate change on China, and China's response, will drive security challenges domestically, as well as in the greater Asian region and around the world. It shows that the impact of climate change on China will be significant and may have sizable adverse economic implications, particularly on vulnerable east coast economic centers. Water scarcity is a problem that already challenges China's leadership and one that will be exacerbated under projected climate impacts.

The integration of biodiversity issues under the umbrella of sustainable forest management (SFM) is thus vital to achieve conservation goals. A major challenge for SFM is climate change, and science-based assessment and decision support frameworks are required to address climatic uncertainties in management planning. In this contribution we address issues of biodiversity in the context of a climate change vulnerability assessment framework for 164,550 ha of mountain forests managed by the Austrian Federal Forests (AFF). The principal tools applied to study climate-forest-management interactions and their implications for the multiple objectives of SFM were the ecosystem model PICUS v1.4, multi-criteria analysis and a stakeholder dialogue with the AFF. With this study framework as an example, our objective was to highlight the role of biodiversity within climate change vulnerability assessment of SFM. We found only limited climate sensitivity of SFM biodiversity indicators, compared to production-oriented aspects, as a result of strong management-mediated controls on forest structure and composition. Consequently, overall SFM climate vulnerability was decreasing in the assessment framework with increasing preference weight on biodiversity. However, the role and effect of biodiversity within the multi-indicator assessment framework differed strongly over elevation belts.

Because of their simple structures, cubic equations of state (EOS) are preferable to be applied in predicting volumes for engineering applications. This paper evaluates the reliabilities of seven cubic EOS, including PR, PT, RK, SRK, MPR, MSRK and ISRK for predicting volumes of binary CO2 mixtures containing CH4, H2S, SO2, Ar and N2, based on the comparisons with the collected experimental data. Results show that for calculations on the volume properties of binary CO2 mixtures, PR and PT are generally superior to others for all of the studied mixtures. In addition, it was found that the binary interaction parameter has clear effects on the calculating accuracy of an EOS in the volume calculations of CO2 mixtures. In order to improve the accuracy, kij was calibrated for all of the EOS regarding the gas and liquid phases of all the studied binary CO2 mixtures, respectively. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

China's industrial and service sectors are expected to maintain rapid development rate over the next decades, driving up the demand for electric power and heat. However, China's power and industrial process heat generation are heavily relying upon coal-fired thermal power plants resulting in tremendous rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Clean technology such as concentrating solar thermal (CST) needs to play a more important role in power and heat generation in China to accelerate the decarbonisation in the power sector and commercial and industrial process heat generation cost-effectively. This paper attempts to explore the opportunity and challenge of development and deployment of CST in China from both technical and socioeconomic analysis perspectives. It is argued that rapid deployment of CST in China will contribute to enabling sustainable energy supply and environmental securities, as well as improved economic performance in new technology innovation in Asia Pacific area over the next decades. Supportive policy framework should be set up to encourage scaling up CST industry. The success of deployment of CST technology will also allow Chinese power and heat generators to strengthen their competitiveness in the context of intensified global constraint of carbon emissions. Institutional innovation and policy instruments for scaling up this technology and the enabling conditions of successful implementation are also investigated. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

By employing a techno-economic analysis approach, we demonstrate that the current BEE standard implemented in the Chinese cities should be tightened further in order to achieve a socially optimal level. Without considering the externality costs associated with carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, current BEE standards need to be upgraded to the equivalent level of French RT2005 standard coupled with a properly designed district coal-fired Combined Heat and Power (CHP). In contrast, the equivalent efficiency standard of Swedish building code is preferably to be implemented in the case of explicit carbon emission restriction as long as the marginal cost of carbon emission (carbon price) is sufficiently high. The fuel-switching policy (from coal to natural gas) in the urban district heating system would result in significant increase in overall costs if the BEE upgrade is not taken into account simultaneously. It is also found that BEE improvements in northern Chinese cities are more cost-effective than investing in low-carbon technologies such as wind power or Carbon Capture and storage in the EU and US with regard to CO2 emissions mitigation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the various regions, Asia has become the largest contributor of anthropogenic atmospheric mercury (Hg), responsible for over half of the global emission. Based on different emission source categories, the mercury contaminated sites in Asia were divided into various types, such as Hg pollution from Hg mining, gold mining, chemical industry, metal smelting, coal combustion, metropolitan cities, natural resources and agricultural sources. By the review of a large number of studies, serious Hg pollutions to the local environment were found in the area influenced by chemical industry, mercury mining and gold mining. With the probable effects of a unique combination of climatic (e.g. subtropical climate), environmental (e.g. acid rain), economic (e.g. swift growth) and social factors (e.g. high population density), more effort is still needed to understand the biogeochemistry cycle of Hg and associated health effects in Asia.

Plant communities and soil carbon and nitrogen properties were investigated and analyzed. Regression analyses were used to assess the models (linear or quadratic) relating measures of species richness, soil carbon and nitrogen properties to fallow time. We found that species richness (S) increased over the first 20 years but decreased thereafter, and aboveground biomass showed a linear increase along the fallow time gradient. The richness of different functional groups (forb, grass and legume) changed little along the fallow time gradient, but their corresponding above ground biomass showed the U-shaped, humped or linear pattern. Soil microbial carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) in the upper 20 cm showed a U-shaped pattern along the fallow time gradient. However, soil organic carbon (C org) and total nitrogen (TN) in the soil at depth greater than 20 cm showed significant patterns of linear decline along the fallow time gradient. The threshold models of species richness reflected best the recovery over the 15 year fallow period. These results indicated that fallow time had a greater influence on development of the plant community than soil processes in abandoned fields in sub-alpine meadow ecosystem. These results also suggested that although the succession process did not significantly increase soil C, an increase in microbial biomass at the latter stage of succession could promote the decomposability of plant litter. Therefore, abandoned fields in sub-alpine meadow ecosystem may have a high resilience and strong rehabilitating capability under natural recovery condition. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Fallow time gradient; Soil carbon; Soil nitrogen; Species richness; Sub-alpine meadow","Fallow time gradient; Soil carbon; Soil nitrogen; Species richness; Sub-alpine meadow; Biomass; Ecosystems; Forestry; Functional groups; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Regression analysis; Soils; Geologic models; carbon; nitrogen; organic carbon; aboveground biomass; alpine environment; ecosystem resilience; fallow; grass; legume; meadow; plant community; regression analysis; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; species richness; temporal distribution; threshold; article; China; decomposition; ecosystem; fallow; grass; legume; microbial biomass; model; nonhuman; plant community; plant litter; soil analysis; species richness; Carbon; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen; Plants; Soil; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349775500

In order to understand the economic value and investment characteristics of making new plants CCR in China, a typical 600 MW pulverised coal-fired ultra-supercritical power plant, locating in Guangdong province, was examined. Combined with an engineering assessment, costs were estimated for different CCR scenarios. To analyze CCR investment opportunities, the paper applies a cash flow model for valuing capture options and CCR investment. Results were obtained by Monte-Carlo simulation, based on engineering surveys and an IEA GHG CCR study, as well as plant performance information and expert projections on carbon prices, coal prices and electricity prices. CCR investments are justified by factors such as higher retrofitting probabilities, lower early closure probabilities and fair economic return. However, the economic case for CCR largely depends on two factors: (a) whether the original plant is retrofittable without CCR; and (b) the type of investments made, for example, investments essential to CCR tend to be more economic than additional non-essential CCR features such as clutched low pressure turbines. The carbon price and discount rate were found to have significant impacts on the economics of CCR. Overall, it appears that the value of the 'capture options' that CCR generates for retrofitting CCS is significant, and so could justify a modest CCR investment, even assuming the original plant is retrofittable without CCR. It was also found the value of CCR might be significantly understated if the range of potential retrofitting dates is artificially constrained. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of the previous studies could hardly address multiple uncertainties that exist in such systems; this may lead to incomplete, simplified or even false solutions, and could jeopardize the robustness of management decisions. This study is to develop a dynamic inexact stochastic energy systems planning model (DITS-MEM) for managing municipal energy systems and greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions under uncertainty. Through integrating mixed-integer, interval-parameter and two-stage stochastic programming techniques, DITS-MEM can handle not only the uncertainties expressed as interval values and probabilistic distributions associated with GHG-emission reduction targets, but also the dynamics of capacity-expansion issues.

The developed model could reach insight into the interactive characteristics of community-scale energy management systems, and thus capable of addressing specific community environmental and socio-economic features. Through integrating interval-parameter and mixed-integer linear programming techniques within a general optimization framework, the DIP-CEM could address uncertainty (expressed as interval values) existing in related costs, impact factors and system objectives as well as facilitate dynamic analysis of capacity-expansion decisions under such a uncertainty. DIP-CEM was then applied to the City of Waterloo, Canada to demonstrate its applicability in supporting decisions of community energy systems planning and GHG-emission reduction management. One business-as-usual (BAU) case and two GHG-emission reduction cases were analyzed with desired plans of GHG-emission reduction. The results indicated that the developed DIP-CEM could help provide sound strategies for dealing with issues of sustainable energy development and GHG-emission reduction within an energy management system. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These include air dehumidification and deodorization, water purification, and soil improvement due to charcoal's excellent adsorption capacity. Paradoxically, charcoal production might also help curb greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we made charcoal from discarded branches and tops of wood from a Cryptomeria plantation after thinning using a still-operational earthen kiln. Woody biomass was used as the carbonization fuel. The effect of carbonization on carbon fixation was calculated and its benefits evaluated. The results showed that the recovered fixed carbon reached 33.2%, i.e., one-third of the biomass residual carbon was conserved as charcoal which if left on the forest ground would decompose and turn into carbon dioxide, and based on a net profit of US$1.13 kg-1 for charcoal, an annual net profit of US$14,665 could be realized. Charcoaling thus appears to be a feasible alternative to promote reutilization of woody resides which would not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also provide potential benefits to regional economies in developing countries. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In response to such a call, several governments in East Asia recently have required to adopt higher room temperatures in summer. To promote such an idea, the public need to be convinced that such practice would not sacrifice indoor environmental quality, especially thermal comfort of the occupants. To implement such a measure, suitable ventilation system(s) to work under the unconventional conditions should be identified. Stratum ventilation is introduced to demonstrate its feasibility in coping for the unconventional warm condition. A case study, a typical office in Hong Kong under local thermal and boundary conditions, is used to illustrate the performance of this new ventilation mode. Computational results show that under the warm condition, with properly designed supplied air velocity and volume, locations of supply and exhaust, the proposed system has the potential to maintain better thermal comfort with a smaller temperature difference between the head and foot level, lower energy consumption, and better indoor air quality (IAQ) in the breathing zone.

The state has elected to pursue a medium-term strategy that may predict the elected paths of other states seeking to meet interim federal carbon reduction targets. Although much is made of the anticipated 500 Mw of new renewable generating capacity over the coming decade, about 70% of that growth comes from conventional steam boilers using biomass for fuel. As for the rest of the new generating capacity to accommodate growth and early retirements, the political push for lower carbon emissions has essentially eliminated coal and residual fuel oil as options. More nuclear capacity is coming, but lead times are long. Filling the breach is natural gas, which is anticipated to hold a 54% market share among generator fuels by 2017. Over 80% of the planned total new capacity is slated to be natural gas-fired. After tripling between 1997 and 2007, the market share for natural gas-fired power supply in 2017 will roughly equal the entire state power output in 1997. However, Florida's natural gas supply had issues of interruption in fuel deliveries. Several options to solve this problem is suggested.

By pricing risk, insurance provides incentives for reducing risks and adapting to climate change; if these premiums are not affordable to the most vulnerable, donors can combine premium support with risk-reduction measures. In this paper, we examine the costs, benefits and risks of public-private (and donor supported) insurance programmes that offer affordable economic security to vulnerable communities and governments. Insurance mechanisms are of particular interest to climate negotiators seeking strategies that help vulnerable countries adapt to increasing severity and frequency of weather disasters, and we examine the case for including insurance mechanisms in a climate adaptation strategy expected to be agreed in Copenhagen in 2009. We present a proposal for this purpose that has been recently put forward by the Munich Climate Insurance Initiative (MCII), which calls for international solidarity for very low probability and high consequence weather-related events (high-risk layer).

Our knowledge of the inner structure of embedded massive young stellar objects is still quite limited. Thus, it is difficult to decide to what extent the mass accumulation onto forming massive stars differs from the process of low-mass star formation. Aims.We attempt to overcome the spatial resolution limitations of conventional thermal infrared imaging. Methods.We employed mid-infrared interferometry using the MIDI instrument on the ESO/VLTI facility to investigate M8E-IR, a well-known massive young stellar object suspected of containing a circumstellar disk. Spectrally dispersed visibilities in the 8-13 μm range have been obtained at seven interferometric baselines. Results.We resolve the mid-infrared emission of M8E-IR and find typical sizes of the emission regions of the order of 30 milliarcseconds (=45 AU). Radiative transfer simulations were performed to interpret the data. The fitting of the spectral energy distribution, in combination with the measured visibilities, does not provide evidence for an extended circumstellar disk with sizes ≳ 100 AU but requires the presence of an extended envelope. The data are not able to constrain the presence of a small-scale disk in addition to an envelope. In either case, the interferometry measurements indicate the existence of a strongly bloated, relatively cool central object, possibly tracing the recent accretion history ofM8E-IR. In addition, we present 24.5 μm images that clearly distinguish between M8EIR and the neighbouring ultracompact Hii region and which show the cometary-shaped infrared morphology of the latter source. Conclusions. Our results show that IR interferometry, combined with radiative transfer modelling, can be a viable tool to reveal crucial structure information on embedded massive young stellar objects and to resolve ambiguities arising from fitting the SED. © 2009 ESO.","Radiative transfer; Stars: formation; Stars: individual: M8E-IR; Techniques: interferometric","Circumstellar disks; H II regions; Inner structure; Interferometric baselines; Interferometry measurement; Low-mass stars; Mass accumulations; Massive stars; Mid-infrared emission; Mid-infrared interferometry; Radiative transfer simulations; Spatial resolution; Spectral energy distribution; Stars: formation; Stars: individual: M8E-IR; Structure information; Techniques: interferometric; Thermal infrared imaging; Young stellar objects; Disks (structural components); Infrared devices; Interferometers; Radiative transfer; Spectroscopy; Stars; Thermography (imaging); Visibility; Interferometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349957978

As transitional economies emerging from the collapse of the Soviet Union, the republics of Central Asia are particularly vulnerable due to (1) physical geography (which dominated by temperate deserts and semi-deserts), (2) relative underdevelopment resulting from an economic focus on monoculture agricultural exports before 1991, and (3) traumatic social, economic, institutional upheavals following independence. Aridity is expected to increase across the entire Central Asian region, but especially in the western parts of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. Temperature increases are projected to be particularly high in summer and fall, accompanied by decreases in precipitation. We examine the concepts of vulnerability, adaptation, and mitigation in the context of climate change in Central Asia. We explore three major aspects of human vulnerability-food security, water stress, and human health-and propose a set of indicators suitable for their assessment. Non-climatic stresses are likely to increase regional vulnerability to climate change and reduce adaptive capacity due to resource deployment to competing needs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We demonstrate that wildfire area burned (WFAB) in the American West was controlled by climate during the 20th century (1916-2003). Persistent ecosystem-specific correlations between climate and WFAB are grouped by vegetation type (ecoprovinces). Most mountainous ecoprovinces exhibit strong year-of-fire relationships with low precipitation, low Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), and high temperature. Grass-and shrub-dominated ecoprovinces had positive relationships with antecedent precipitation or PDSI. For 1977-2003, a few climate variables explain 33-87% (mean = 64%) of WFAB, indicating strong linkages between climate and area burned. For 1916-2003, the relationships are weaker, but climate explained 25-57% (mean = 39%) of the variability. The variance in WFAB is proportional to the mean squared for different data sets at different spatial scales. The importance of antecedent climate (summer drought in forested ecosystems and antecedent winter precipitation in shrub and grassland ecosystems) indicates that the mechanism behind the observed fire-climate relationships is climatic preconditioning of large areas of low fuel moisture via drying of existing fuels or fuel production and drying. The impacts of climate change on fire regimes will therefore vary with the relative energy or water limitations of ecosystems. Ecoprovinces proved a useful compromise between ecologically imprecise state-level and localized gridded fire data. The differences in climate-fire relationships among the ecoprovinces underscore the need to consider ecological context (vegetation, fuels, and seasonal climate) to identify specific climate drivers of WFAB. Despite the possible influence of fire suppression, exclusion, and fuel treatment, WFAB is still substantially controlled by climate. The implications for planning and management are that future WFAB and adaptation to climate change will likely depend on ecosystem-specific, seasonal variation in climate. In fuel-limited ecosystems, fuel treatments can probably mitigate fire vulnerability and increase resilience more readily than in climate-limited ecosystems, in which large severe fires under extreme weather conditions will continue to account for most area burned. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","Adaptation; Antecedent climate; Climate; Climate change; Drought; Ecoprovinces; Ecosystem management; Fire; Forest; Fuels; Gamma distribution; Resilience","adaptation; climate change; data set; drought; ecosystem management; forest ecosystem; forest fire; mitigation; seasonal variation; vegetation type; wildfire; article; climate; comparative study; ecosystem; fire; history; regression analysis; United States; Climate; Ecosystem; Fires; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Regression Analysis; United States; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66149164353

While it is very important to burn less fossil fuel and to employ alternative energy sources, other carbon-reduction options must also be considered. Given that forests comprise a large portion of the global landbase and that they play a very significant role in the global carbon cycle, it is logical to examine how forest management practices could effect reductions in carbon emissions. Many papers that discuss forest carbon sinks or sources refer only to the short term (<20 years). This paper focuses on the sustainable carbon storage contributions of a forest over the long term. This paper explains that long-term carbon storage and reduced carbon fluctuation can be achieved by a combination of improved forest management and efficient transfer of carbon into wood products. Here we show how three different forest management scenarios affect the overall carbon storage capacity of forest and wood products combined over the long term. We used a timber supply model and scenario analysis to predict forest carbon and other resource conditions over time in the Prince George Forest District, a 3.4-million-ha landbase in northern British Columbia. We found that the high-harvest scenario stores 3% more carbon than the low-harvest scenario and 27% (120 million tonnes) more carbon than the no-harvest scenario even though only 1.2-million ha is in timber harvesting landbase. Our results tell us that forest management practices that maintain and increase forest area, reduce natural disturbances in the forest, improve forest conditions, and ensure the appropriate and timely transfer of carbon into wood products lead to increasing overall carbon storage, thereby reducing carbon in the atmosphere. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Controlled by climatic factors, the plant species diversity of the woodland-steppe ecotone is moderate as compared with the adjacent woodland and steppe communities. From woodland through woodland-grassland and woodland-steppe to steppe, about 2/3 species were replaced at each boundary; only seven herb species were detected to be distributed in all four vegetation zones. Landscape classification based on landform, climate, and vegetation shows that landform condition is most critical to landscape diversity in the studied area. The most fragmented landform in the woodland zone does not necessarily lead to low plant species diversity. However, similar understory species in different woodland types lead to continuous woodland vegetation and, hence, high species richness. High fragmentation in the woodland-steppe zone and discontinuous distribution of woodlands might be a driving factor for lower species richness. Reconstruction of the Holocene climatic changes and vegetation development demonstrates that the highest plant species diversity occurred in the ecotone from 4500 to 2500 14C yr BP at different sites, while the woodland zone extended much farther northwestward. When woodlands retreated from the current ecotone with climatic drying, the fragmentation of woodlands in the current ecotone led to plant species loss. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2009.","Holocene; Inner Mongolia; Landscape diversity; Plant species diversity; Woodland-steppe ecotone","biodiversity; climate conditions; ecotone; habitat fragmentation; Holocene; paleoecology; reconstruction; species diversity; steppe; woodland; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350596057

We simulate sulfate, black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), and mineral dust aerosols using a global coupled chemistry-aerosol model (MOZART-2) driven with NCEP/NCAR reanalysis meteorology for 1997-2003 and emissions approximately representing year 2000. The concentrations of simulated aerosol species in general agree within a factor of 2 with observations, except that the model tends to overestimate sulfate over Europe in summer, underestimate BC and OC over the western and southeastern (SE) U.S. and Europe, and underestimate dust over the SE U.S. By tagging emissions from ten continental regions, we quantify the contribution of each region's emissions on surface aerosol concentrations (relevant for air quality) and aerosol optical depth (AOD, relevant for visibility and climate) globally. We find that domestic emissions contribute substantially to surface aerosol concentrations (57-95%) over all regions, but are responsible for a smaller fraction of AOD (26-76%). We define ""background"" aerosols as those aerosols over a region that result from inter-continental transport, DMS oxidation, and emissions from ships or volcanoes. Transport from other continental source regions accounts for a substantial portion of background aerosol concentrations: 36-97% for surface concentrations and 38-89% for AOD. We identify the Region of Primary Influence (RPI) as the source region with the largest contribution to the receptor's background aerosol concentrations (or AOD). We find that for dust Africa is the RPI for both aerosol concentrations and AOD over all other receptor regions. For non-dust aerosols (particularly for sulfate and BC), the RPIs for aerosol concentrations and AOD are identical for most receptor regions. These findings indicate that the reduction of the emission of non-dust aerosols and their precursors from an RPI will simultaneously improve both air quality and visibility over a receptor region. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Aerosols; Air quality; Inter-continental transport; Optical depth; Source-receptor relationships","Aerosol concentration; Aerosol models; Aerosol optical depths; Background aerosol; Black carbon; Coupled chemistry; Domestic emissions; Dust aerosols; Fine aerosols; Global aerosol; Inter-continental transport; Mineral dust aerosol; NCEP/NCAR; Optical depth; Reanalysis; Source region; Source-receptor relationships; Surface concentration; Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Carbon black; Concentration (process); Dust; Mining; Organic carbon; Ships; Spontaneous emission; Visibility; Atmospheric aerosols; black carbon; organic carbon; sulfate; aerosol; aerosol property; air quality; black carbon; concentration (composition); emission control; geographical distribution; methodology; optical depth; organic carbon; transport process; aerosol; Africa; air quality; article; atmospheric transport; climate; Europe; meteorology; mineral dust; optical depth; oxidation; priority journal; ship; simulation; summer; United States; volcano; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67651045849

One hundred simulations were conducted with fine resolutions and observational constraints, to reproduce spatial and temporal features of observed PM concentrations and to understand the formation mechanism of the episode. Simulated PM concentrations consist of secondary inorganic components, mainly ammonium nitrate, and total carbon in areas with elevated concentrations in the accumulation mode, and consist of mainly dust and sea salt in the coarse mode. Simulated oxidants and nitrate were significantly elevated over the valley, and the latter showed much less amplitude than the former. Simulated PM concentrations were evaluated with observations systematically with spatially and temporally paired method, a more restrictive multivariate method (NMFROC), and a more flexible ""gradient evaluation"" method. The paired evaluation shows that high correlation coefficient (R = ∼0.8) and low fractional error (FE = ∼0.1) could be achieved at stations with elevated 24-h concentration of PM in the accumulation mode in some simulations. The NMFROC method was used to extract useful information from seemingly failed simulations. A ""gradient evaluation"" method is introduced here to extract additional information from simulations. We found that emission reductions of NOx and AVOC showed similar effects on percentage basis in different areas, and both are more effective than reducing NH3 for abating elevated concentrations of accumulation mode PM in California Central Valley during the winter episode.","Aerosol; Gradient evaluation; Photochemical-microphysical transport model","Accumulation modes; Ammonium nitrate; California; Christmas; Coarse mode; Computationally efficient; Concentration of; Correlation coefficient; Elevated concentrations; Emission model; Emission reduction; Evaluation Method; Fine resolution; Formation mechanism; Fractional errors; Gradient evaluation; Inorganic components; Mesoscale meteorological model; Modeling systems; Multivariate methods; Sea salts; Sensitivity Simulation; Temporal features; Total carbon; Transport models; Ammonium compounds; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric movements; Concentration (process); Emission control; Landforms; Three dimensional; Simulators; ammonium nitrate; carbon; nitrate; nitric oxide; volatile organic compound; accumulation rate; aerosol; ammonium nitrate; atmospheric transport; computer simulation; concentration (composition); correlation; formation mechanism; multivariate analysis; numerical model; oxidant; photochemistry; sensitivity analysis; suspended particulate matter; winter; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; article; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric transport; computer simulation; controlled study; dust; particulate matter; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; tropics; United States; winter; California; Central Valley [California]; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71749118970

How the interaction between the last two factors might have influenced water use of these conifers was investigated. An experimental approach was used to test the following hypotheses: (1) the expected beneficial effects of elevated [CO 2] on water-use efficiency (WUE) are reduced or lost during the 24-h light of the high-latitude summer; and (2) elevated [CO2] reduces plant water use over the growing season. • Methods: Measurements of leaf and whole-plant gas exchange, and leaf-stable carbon isotope composition were made on one evergreen (Sequoia sempervirens) and two deciduous (Metasequoia glyptostroboides and Taxodium distichum) 'living fossil' coniferous species after 3 years' growth in controlled-environment simulated Cretaceous Arctic (69°N) conditions at either ambient (400 μmol mol-1) or elevated (800 μmol mol-1) [CO2]. • Key Results: Stimulation of whole-plant WUE (WUEP) by CO2 enrichment was maintained over the growing season for the three studied species but this pattern was not reflected in patterns of WUE inferred from leafscale gas exchange measurements (iWUEL) and δ13C of foliage (tWUEL). This response was driven largely by increased rates of carbon uptake, because there was no overall CO2 effect on daily whole-plant transpiration or whole-plant water loss integrated over the study period. Seasonal patterns of tWUEL differed from those measured for iWUEL. The results suggest caution against over simplistic interpretations of WUEP based on leaf isotopic composition. • Conclusions: The data suggest that the efficiency of whole-tree water use may be improved by CO2 enrichment in a simulated high-latitude environment, but that transpiration is relatively insensitive to atmospheric CO2 in the living fossil species investigated. © The Author 2009.

As temperatures rise, ecosystems with nowhere to go, such as mountains, are considered to be more threatened. However, species survival may depend as much on keeping pace with moving climates as the climates ultimate persistence. Here we present a new index of the velocity of temperature change (km yr-1), derived from spatial gradients (°Ckm-1) and multimodel ensemble forecasts of rates of temperature increase (°C yr-1) in the twenty-first century. This index represents the instantaneous local velocity along Earths surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and has a global mean of 0.42 km yr-1 (A1B emission scenario). Owing to topographic effects, the velocity of temperature change is lowest in mountainous biomes such as tropical and subtropical coniferous forests (0.08 km yr-1), temperate coniferous forest, and montane grasslands. Velocities are highest in flooded grasslands (1.26 km yr-1), mangroves and deserts. High velocities suggest that the climates of only 8% of global protected areas have residence times exceeding 100 years. Small protected areas exacerbate the problem in Mediterranean-type and temperate coniferous forest biomes. Large protected areas may mitigate the problem in desert biomes. These results indicate management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss from climate change. Montane landscapes may effectively shelter many species into the next century. Elsewhere, reduced emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas, or efforts to increase species movement may be necessary. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We investigated the extent to which the political economy of US states, including the relative power of organized labor, predicts rates of fatal occupational injury. Methods. We described states' political economies with 6 contextual variables measuring social and political conditions: ""right-to-work"" laws, union membership density, labor grievance rates, state government debt, unemployment rates, and social wage payments. We obtained data on fatal occupational injuries from the National Traumatic Occupational Fatality surveillance system and population data from the US national census. We used Poisson regression methods to analyze relationships for the years 1980 and 1995. Results. States differed notably with respect to political-economic characteristics and occupational fatality rates, although these characteristics were more homogeneous within rather than between regions. Industry and workforce composition contributed significantly to differences in state injury rates, but political-economic characteristics of states were also significantly associated with injury rates, after adjustment accounting for those factors. Conclusions. Higher rates of fatal occupational injury were associated with a state policy climate favoring business over labor, with distinct regional clustering of such state policies in the South and Northeast.",,"article; controlled study; fatality; health economics; health survey; human; labor management; law; major clinical study; occupational accident; salary; unemployment; United States; economics; employment; government; injury; mortality; occupational disease; occupational health; politics; statistical model; statistics; United States; Economics; Employment; Humans; Models, Statistical; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Health; Politics; State Government; United States; Wounds and Injuries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68849092626

Large ensembles of climate models are increasingly available either as ensembles of opportunity or perturbed physics ensembles, providing a wealth of additional data that is potentially useful for improving adaptation strategies to climate change. Because of the novelty of this ensemble information, there is little previous experience of practical applications or of the added value of this information for impacts and adaptation decision making. This paper evaluates the value of perturbed physics ensembles of climate models for understanding and planning public water supply under climate change. We deliberately select water resource models that are already used by water supply companies and regulators on the assumption that uptake of information from large ensembles of climate models will be more likely if it does not involve significant investment in new modeling tools and methods. We illustrate the methods with a case study on the Wimbleball water resource zone in the southwest of England. This zone is sufficiently simple to demonstrate the utility of the approach but with enough complexity to allow a variety of different decisions to be made. Our research shows that the additional information contained in the climate model ensemble provides a better understanding of the possible ranges of future conditions, compared to the use of singlemodel scenarios. Furthermore, with careful presentation, decision makers will find the results from large ensembles of models more accessible and be able to more easily compare the merits of different management options and the timing of different adaptation. The overhead in additional time and expertise for carrying out the impacts analysis will be justified by the increased quality of the decision-making process. We remark that even though we have focused our study on a water resource system in the United Kingdom, our conclusions about the added value of climate model ensembles in guiding adaptation decisions can be generalized to other sectors and geographical regions.

Rotating disk electrode is used to determine kinetic currents for the ORR in 0.1 M H2SO4 at 298 K and O2 partial pressures from 1 to 0.01 atm. The dependence of the ORR activity on Se/Ru ratio shows volcano-type behavior with ca. 10 fold increase of the mass activity at 0.1 &lt; Se/Ru &lt; 0.3. The reaction order in O2 is close to 1 in the interval of overpotentials from 0.4 to 0.7 V, and is independent of the presence of Se. Regardless the amount of Se, the Tafel slope demonstrates continuous increase from ca. 70 mV/dec at 0.4 V to ca. 140 mV/dec at 0.6 V overpotential. In situ EXAFS spectra are measured at Ru K-edge (in the transmission mode) and Se K-edge (in the fluorescence mode) in argon and oxygen saturated 0.1 M H2SO4 solutions in the interval of electrode potentials from 0.050 to 0.750 V RHE.

This paper reports on findings from comparative cross-cultural mixed-methods research eliciting perceptions of the future among citizens in Norwich (UK) and Rome (Italy). The paper explores how individuals at the two locations interpret socio-economic and climate scenarios, and how they relate environmental change to human behavior. Attitude segmentation was found to be similar in both localities. Although most participants in both locations realized the benefits of a future centered on sustainable resource use and societal welfare, individuals' attitudes and considerations about the future were not largely influenced by the scenarios. Discussions revealed that the credibility of the projections depended on individuals' prior beliefs and their trust in the science portrayed.","Climate change; cross-cultural comparison; participation; perceptions; public; scenarios",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650783502

Drinking water samples were collected from an advanced water treatment plant during March-October 2008. In the formation of DBPs, advanced water treatment processes efficiently removed THMs and HAA5. The concentrations of THMs and HAA5 in finished water were reduced to 13.97 μg/L and 17.67 μg/L, respectively. In this investigation, the AOC was reduced effectively by ozonation and biological activated carbon (BAC) processes. Experimental results of this 6-month investigation indicate that AOC concentrations in the finished water can meet the WTP criterion of 50 μg acetate-C/L in the world.

One of the most significant research questions now being asked focuses on the nature of the pore system in these mudrocks. Our work on siliceous mudstones from the Mississippian Barnett Shale of the Fort Worth Basin, Texas, shows that the pores in these rocks are dominantly nanometer in scale (nanopores). We used scanning electron microscopy to characterize Barnett pores from a number of cores and have imaged pores as small as 5 nm. Key to our success in imaging these nanopores is the use of Ar-ion-beam milling; this methodology provides flat surfaces that lack topography related to differential hardness and are fundamental for high-magnification imaging. Nanopores are observed in three main modes of occurrence. Most pores are found in grains of organic matter as intraparticle pores; many of these grains contain hundreds of pores. Intraparticle organic nanopores most commonly have irregular, bubblelike, elliptical cross sections and range between 5 and 750 nm with the median nanopore size for all grains being approximately 100 nm. Internal porosities of up to 20.2% have been measured for whole grains of organic matter based on point-count data from scanning electron microscopy analysis. These nanopores in the organic matter are the predominant pore type in the Barnett mudstones and they are related to thermal maturation. Nanopores are also found in bedding-parallel, wispy, organic-rich laminae as intraparticle pores in organic grains and as interparticle pores between organic matter, but this mode is not common. Although less abundant, nanopores are also locally present in fine-grained matrix areas unassociated with organic matter and as nano- to microintercrystalline pores in pyrite framboids. Intraparticle organic nanopores and pyrite-framboid intercrystalline pores contribute to gas storage in Barnett mudstones. We postulate that permeability pathways within the Barnett mudstones are along bedding-parallel layers of organic matter or a mesh network of organic matter flakes because this material contains the most pores.

Drawing upon social constructivist science studies and public sphere theories in international relations, the paper traces the communicative contexts in which state actors have struggled to bring meaning to the sink concept and hereby translated the production and validation of knowledge claims into political authority. In particular focus are instances of ""epistemic chaos"" when the lack of consensual knowledge and shared normative commitments has forced states to publicly interpret and justify what counts as credible carbon cycle expertise and good terrestrial carbon management. The empirical tracing of such justificatory arguments begins at the third conference of the parties (COP3) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto in 1997, and ends at COP 10 in Buenos Aires in 2004. Although scientific expertise emerges a central avenue for political bargaining in this negotiation process, the paper does not interpret expert politics as a mere reflection of material power and dominant state interests. Rather, when approaching authoritative knowledge as a product of social relations, the course and outcome of global climate governance appear more inclusive and open-ended. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The low per capita cropland in China makes it impractical to convert cropland to energy crop cultivation as in other countries; development of energy crops must not compete with food and other cash crops for prime cropland. Mulberry planted on marginal lands like land risers, land boundaries and waste slopelands in Ningnan County of China's southwestern Sichuan Province not only yielded enough leaf biomass to support a production of over 6000 t of cocoons in 2005, but also produced large amounts of woody biomass through annual pruning. Mulberry planted on marginal lands would not be replaced by food or other cash crops if cocoon prices drop. The average annual dry matter biomass of pruned mulberry branches is 1.7 kg/plant, or approximately 17.0-22.5 t/ha, which is high compared to the annual biomass growth of many fast growing trees and perennial herbaceous energy crops. Mulberry prunings exceed household needs for fuelwood because household energy requirements are met with multiple sources. Income from cocoons is the major driving force for the expansion of mulberry planting on marginal land, as lack of incentives has accounted for slow development of firewood in China. Large scale development of marginal land-based planting of mulberry can also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, conserve forests and promote biodiversity. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies, however, suffer from two limitations: 1) indentifying or searching the optimal MLP topology to avoid a biased RI assessment inevitably incurs a heavy computational burden, and 2) the model is suitable only for local-scale analysis of ozone variation mechanisms. To tackle both problems, we selected three typical air-quality monitoring sites in Hong Kong as our study targets, as the ozone variations at these sites are inhomogeneously affected by regional and local factors. An MLP model trained by automatic relevance determination (referred to as MLP-ARD), a Bayesian MLP approach, was employed to assess the RI for both regional and local ozone influential variables. The results indicated the following remarks: 1) The MLP-ARD model, due to its high degree of resistance to both the over-fitting and the under-fitting problems, is exempt from identifying or searching the optimal MLP topology when used to obtain an unbiased RI assessment and thus avoid the heavy computational burden. Furthermore, the RI assessment results obtained with the MLP-ARD method are comparable to those of the best assessment method in the literature. Based on these findings, decision-makers can scientifically promulgate a site-specific air pollution control strategy site; 2) Regional-scale analysis of ozone variation is indispensable, as taking the key regional ozone influential variables into account significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the MLP-ARD model, especially on peak ozone days.

This study presents a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) on gasoline and ethanol as fuels, and with two types of blends of gasoline with bioethanol, all used in a midsize car. The focus is on a main application in Brazil, sugarcane based ethanol. The results of two cases are presented: base case-bioethanol production from sugarcane and electricity generation from bagasse; future case-bioethanol production from both sugarcane and bagasse and electricity generation from wastes. In both cases sugar is co-produced. The life cycles of fuels include gasoline production, agricultural production of sugarcane, ethanol production, sugar and electricity co-production, blending ethanol with gasoline to produce E10 (10% of ethanol) and E85 (85%), and finally the use of gasoline, E10, E85 and pure ethanol. Furthermore, a life cycle costing (LCC) was conducted to give an indication on fuel economy in both cases. The results show that in the base case less GHG is emitted; while the overall evaluation of these fuel options depends on the importance attached to different impacts. The future case is certainly more economically attractive, which has been the driving force for development in the ethanol industry in Brazil. Nevertheless, the outcomes depend very much on the assumed price for crude oil. In LCC a steady-state cost model was used and only the production cost was taken into account. In the real market the prices of fuels are very much dependent on the taxes and subsidies. Technological development can help in lowering both the environmental impact and the prices of the ethanol fuels. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to investigate the bacterial composition and community dynamic changes based on PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes during batch culture enrichment. Using the spray-plate method, three bacteria, designated as BL01, BL02 and BL03, which corresponded to the dominant bands in the DGGE profiles, were isolated from the consortium. Sequence analysis showed that BL01, BL02 and BL03 were phylogenetically close to Ochrobactrum sp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas fluorescens, respectively. The degradation of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a model high-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (HMW PAH) compound was investigated using individual isolates, a mixture of the three isolates, and the microbial consortium (BL) originally isolated from the oil port sea water. Results showed that the order of degradative ability was BL > the mixture of the three isolates > individual isolates.

A new approach to the analysis of thermogravimetric data was proposed and developed as applied to complex binary mixtures of carbon-containing materials. This approach was based on (1) the preliminary separation of the thermal degradation of individual carbon-containing mixture components into individual structural constituents and (2) the monitoring of the conversion of each particular structure fragment as a constituent of the mixtures in the course of the cothermolysis of the mixtures of starting components. Based on the approach developed, data on the main synergism effects in the course of cothermolysis in the binary test systems were obtained: the temperature regions of the appearance of these effects were distinguished, the main conclusions were made with respect to particular structure fragments in complex organic wastes responsible for the interaction of components in composite systems, and the directions (positive or negative) of changes in the yields of solid by-products and the degrees of effects (difference between the yields of cothermolysis by-products in each particular region of the appearance of synergistic effects in the systems) were determined.

Two modifications to the conventional impregnation method were performed: one was to precipitate the precursors ((NH4)2PtCl6 and Ru(OH)3) on the carbon support before metal reduction; the other was to add a buffer into the synthetic solution to stabilize the pH. The prepared catalyst showed a much higher activity for methanol electro-oxidation than a catalyst prepared by the conventional impregnation method, even higher than that of current commercially available, state-of-the-art catalysts. The morphology of the prepared catalyst was characterized using TEM and XRD measurements to determine particle sizes, alloying degree, and lattice parameters. Electrochemical methods were also used to ascertain the electrochemical active surface area and the specific activity of the catalyst. Based on XPS measurements, the high activity of this catalyst was found to originate from both metallic Ru (Ru0) and hydrous ruthenium oxides (RuOxHy) species on the catalyst surface. However, RuOxHy was found to be more active than metallic Ru.

There are limitations in obtaining accurate emissions data by field measurements, and in characterizing an entire landfill with only a few such emissions measurements. This paper proposes an emissions prediction approach using numerous ambient air volatile organic compound (VOC) measurements above the surface of a landfill that are more easily obtained. Many large landfills are already collecting ambient air methane data based on existing regulations. The proposed method is based on the inverse solution of the standard Gaussian dispersion equations. However, only the VOC concentrations and locations are required. The locations of maximum likelihood of the point sources are predicted using Voronoi diagrams, and importance sampling is performed to further refine the locations. Point source strengths are calculated using non-negative least squares, and the point emission rates are then summed to give the total landfill emission rate. The proposed method is successfully demonstrated on a series of four landfill case studies. Three hypothetical landfills were selected for validation studies by forward and backward solution of the dispersion equations. The fourth case study is an active central Florida MSW landfill. The proposed method shows promise in accurately and robustly predicting landfill gas emissions, and requires only measured ambient VOC concentrations and locations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The large accumulation of ice (many hundreds of meters) required to create the observed glacial deposits points to significant atmospheric precipitation, snow and ice accumulation, and glacial flow. In order to understand the climate scenario required for these conditions, we used the LMD (Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique) Mars GCM (General Circulation Model), which is able to reproduce the present-day water cycle, and to predict past deposition of ice consistent with geological observations in many cases. Prior to this analysis, however, significant mid-latitude glaciation had not been simulated by the model, run under a range of parameters. In this analysis, we studied the response of the GCM to a wider range of orbital configurations and water ice reservoirs, and show that during periods of moderate obliquity (ε{lunate} = 25-35°) and high dust opacity (τdust = 1.5-2.5), broad-scale glaciation in the northern mid-latitudes occurs if water ice deposited on the flanks of the Tharsis volcanoes at higher obliquity is available for sublimation. We find that high dust contents of the atmosphere increase its water vapor holding capacity, thereby moving the saturation region to the northern mid-latitudes. Precipitation events are then controlled by topographic forcing of stationary planetary waves and transient weather systems, producing surface ice distribution and amounts that are consistent with the geological record. Ice accumulation rates of ∼10 mm yr-1 lead to the formation of a 500-1000 m thick regional ice sheet that will produce glacial flow patterns consistent with the geological observations. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this article, we define the climatic conditions in its area of natural distribution by combining the locations of herbarium specimens with corresponding climatic information, and compare these conditions with those in 83 jatropha plantations worldwide. Most specimens (87%) were found in tropical savannah and monsoon climates (Am, Aw) and in temperate climates without dry season and with hot summer (Cfa), while very few were found in semi-arid (BS) and none in arid climates (BW). Ninety-five percent of the specimens grew in areas with a mean annual rainfall above 944 mm year-1 and an average minimum temperature of the coldest month (Tmin) above 10.5 °C. The mean annual temperature range was 19.3-27.2 °C. The climatic conditions at the plantations were different from those of the natural distribution specimens for all studied climatic variables, except average maximum temperature in the warmest month. Roughly 40% of the plantations were situated in regions with a drier climate than in 95% of the area of the herbarium specimens, and 28% of the plantations were situated in areas with Tmin below 10.5 °C. The observed precipitation preferences indicate that jatropha is not common in regions with arid and semi-arid climates. Plantations in arid and semi-arid areas hold the risk of low productivity or irrigation requirement. Plantations in regions with frost risk hold the risk of damage due to frost. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

CCHP systems can be optimized based on different optimization criterion such as: energy savings, operation cost reduction or minimum environmental impact. In this study, CCHP systems operated following the electric load (FEL) and the thermal load (FTL) strategies are evaluated and optimized based on: primary energy consumption (PEC), operation cost, and carbon dioxide emissions (CDE). This study also includes the analysis and evaluation of an optimized operational strategy in which a CCHP system follows a hybrid electric-thermal load (HETS) during its operation. Results show that CCHP systems operating using any of the optimization criteria have better performance than CCHP systems operating without any optimization criteria. For the evaluated city, the optimum PEC and cost reduction are 7.5% and 4.4%, respectively, for CCHP-FTL, while the optimum CDE reduction is 14.8% for CCHP-FEL. Results also show that the HETS is a good alternative for CCHP systems operation since it gives good reduction of PEC, cost, and CDE.

In this regard, pre-treatment of municipal solid waste prior to landfilling significantly enhance waste stabilization and provides various advantages. So in this regard pre-treatment methods of municipal solid waste were investigated. The major objectives of biological pretreatment are to degrade most easily degradable organic matters of MSW in a short duration under controlled conditions so as to produce desired quality for landfill; and to enhance methanogenic condition in the landfill. Factors affecting the choice of pretreatment processes include the composition of MSW, retention times, odor emissions, fate of toxic chemicals and costs. To investigate the economical pretreatment method prior to landfilling for developing countries four pretreatment simulators were developed at bench scale in the laboratory at different operating conditions forced aeration and leachate recirculation (APSFALR), aerobic pretreatment simulator by natural convection of air with leachate recirculation (APSNCLR), aerobic pretreatment simulator by natural convection of air (APSNC) and anaerobic simulator (AS).The organic matter, pH, temperature, settlement, leachate quantity and quality were monitored regularly. In the leachate quality BOD5, COD, NH4-N, pH and trace metals were analyzed. The molecular size distribution of dissolved organic matters (DOM) in leachate was determined after the pretreatment of 45 days. The results of these methods are compared. The APSNCLR method is economically effective method to reduce the organic matters, leachate COD and BOD5. With the biological pretreatment significant amount of easily biodegradable matters and volume of solids are reduced due to the decomposition of the waste. Landfilling of pretreated waste improves landfill behavior, characteristics, and operation. Leachate quantity, quality and landfill gas emissions also would be reduced. It is predicted by the comparison of carbon content in the fresh and pretreated MSW that resultantly increases the landfill age and decreases in aftercare monitoring period. The volumes of the solids were reduced and density increased significantly in eight weeks pretreatment of MSW due to biodegradation of organic matters. The BOD, COD5 and NH4-N content also reduced significantly as compared to the anaerobic simulator. Pretreatment simulators results are compared and concluded that pretreatment with passive aeration and leachate recirculation is better as compared to the other pretreatment simulators.

Many forests in the western United States are being treated to reduce fuels, yet the effects of these treatments on forest carbon are not well understood. We compared the immediate effects of fuels treatments on carbon stocks and releases in replicated plots before and after treatment, and against a reconstruction of active-fire stand conditions for the same forest in 1865. Total live-tree carbon was substantially lower in modern fire-suppressed conditions (and all of the treatments) than the same forest under an active-fire regime. Although fire suppression has increased stem density, current forests have fewer very large trees, reducing total live-tree carbon stocks and shifting a higher proportion of those stocks into small-diameter, firesensitive trees. Prescribed burning released 14.8 Mg C/ha, with pre-burn thinning increasing the average release by 70% and contributing 21.9-37.5 Mg C/ha in milling waste. Fire suppression may have incurred a double carbon penalty by reducing stocks and contributing to emissions with fuels-treatment activities or inevitable wildfire combustion. All treatments reduced fuels and increased fire resistance, but most of the gains were achieved with understory thinning, with only modest increases in the much heavier overstory thinning. We suggest modifying current treatments to focus on reducing surface fuels, actively thinning the majority of small trees, and removing only fire-sensitive species in the merchantable, intermediate size class. These changes would retain most of the current carbon-pool levels, reduce prescribed burn and potential future wildfire emissions, and favor stand development of large, fire-resistant trees that can better stabilize carbon stocks. © 2009 by the Ecological Society ot America.","Biomass; Carbon sequestration; Carbon-emission costs of different fuels treatments; Forest management; Global warming; Management and treatment of different forest fuels; Sierra Nevada (California, USA) mixed-conifer forest; Teakettle Experimental Forest (USA)","carbon; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; coniferous forest; emission control; emission inventory; forest management; global warming; mixed forest; prescribed burning; thinning; air pollutant; article; conifer; fire; forestry; metabolism; tree; United States; Air Pollutants; California; Carbon; Coniferophyta; Fires; Forestry; Trees; California; North America; Sierra Nevada [California]; United States; Coniferophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549085310

We employ a new framework for evaluating the rainfall regime of tropical forests and from this deduce precipitation-based boundaries for current forest viability. We then examine climate simulations by 19 global climate models (GCMs) in this context and find that most tend to underestimate current rainfall. GCMs also vary greatly in their projections of future climate change in Amazonia. We attempt to take into account the differences between GCM-simulated and observed rainfall regimes in the 20th century. Our analysis suggests that dry-season water stress is likely to increase in E. Amazonia over the 21st century, but the region tends toward a climate more appropriate to seasonal forest than to savanna. These seasonal forests may be resilient to seasonal drought but are likely to face intensified water stress caused by higher temperatures and to be vulnerable to fires, which are at present naturally rare in much of Amazonia. The spread of fire ignition associated with advancing deforestation, logging, and fragmentation may act as nucleation points that trigger the transition of these seasonal forests into fire-dominated, low biomass forests. Conversely, deliberate limitation of deforestation and fire may be an effective intervention to maintain Amazonian forest resilience in the face of imposed 21st-century climate change. Such intervention may be enough to navigate E. Amazonia away from a possible ""tipping point,"" beyond which extensive rainforest would become unsustainable. © 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Adaptation; Carbon dioxide; Drought; Fire; Tropical forests","carbon dioxide; article; biomass; climate change; deforestation; dieback disease; drought; precipitation; priority journal; savanna; simulation; temperature measurement; tropical rain forest; vegetation; water stress; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Droughts; Extinction, Biological; Models, Biological; Rain; Temperature; Trees; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73949146944

Expression of Nrf2, GST and AKR proteins was analyzed in the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, focusing on their responses to dehydration stress. Dehydration/rehydration cycles can generate oxidative stress and this could be ameliorated by enhancing antioxidant defenses. Dehydration to 28% of total body water lost triggered organ-specific changes in nrf2 mRNA expression (a 2-fold increase in liver), total Nrf2 protein (2-4-fold elevation in lung, heart, skin and liver), and a 4.3-fold increase in the content of Nrf2 in the nucleus in muscle. Protein levels of six GST and three AKR family members were assessed and showed organ-specific patterns of expression during dehydration. In particular, GSTP1 was strongly induced in liver, heart and skin, levels rising by 9-, 2.6- and 1.7-fold, respectively, whereas GSTM1 and M3 rose in skeletal muscle, kidney and skin. Selective expression of GSTK1, A3 and T1 also occurred. Dehydration also stimulated organ-specific increases in the levels of AKR family members (AKR1B4, AKR1A3, AFAR1) by 1.5-2-fold. The results show that metabolic responses to dehydration include activation of the Nrf2 transcription factor and selective up-regulation of genes under Nrf2 control. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, the diffusion of distributed cogeneration within urban areas, where air quality standards are quite stringent, brings about environmental concerns on a local level. In addition, partial-load emission worsening is often overlooked, which could lead to biased evaluations of the energy system environmental performance. In this paper, a comprehensive emission assessment framework suitable for addressing distributed cogeneration systems is formulated. Local and global emission impact models are presented to identify upper and lower boundary values of the environmental pressure from pollutants that would be emitted from reference technologies, to be compared to the actual emissions from distributed cogeneration. This provides synthetic information on the relative environmental impact from small-scale CHP sources, useful for general indicative and non-site-specific studies. The emission models are formulated according to an electrical output-based emission factor approach, through which off-design operation and relevant performance are easily accounted for. In particular, in order to address the issues that could arise under off-design operation, an equivalent load model is incorporated within the proposed framework, by exploiting the duration curve of the cogenerator loading and the emissions associated to each loading level. In this way, it is possible to quantify the contribution to the emissions from cogeneration systems that might operate at partial loads for a significant portion of their operation time, as for instance in load-tracking applications. Suitability of the proposed methodology is discussed with respect to hazardous air pollutants such as NOx and CO, as well as to greenhouse gases such as CO2. Two case study applications based on the emission data of real microturbines are illustrated in order to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed assessment techniques. The numerical results exemplify the emission impact of distributed cogeneration systems operating under general and realistic loading conditions with respect to average and state-of-the-art conventional technologies. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Southern Ocean is a heterogeneous system, characterized by a strong seasonality, due to long dark winter. Yet, currently little is known about biogeochemical dynamics during this season, particularly in the deeper part of the ocean. We studied bacterial communities and processes in summer and winter cruises in the southern Drake Passage. Here we show that in winter, when the primary production is greatly reduced, Bacteria and Archaea become the major producers of biogenic particles, at the expense of dissolved organic carbon drawdown. Heterotrophic production and chemoautotrophic CO2 fixation rates were substantial, also in deep water, and bacterial populations were controlled by protists and viruses. A dynamic food web is also consistent with the observed temporal and spatial variations in archaeal and bacterial communities that might exploit various niches.

Production is from eolian dunes of the Jurassic Norphlet sandstone at depths exceeding 6100 m (&gt;20,000 ft) and temperatures greater than 200°C. Reservoir connectivity and compositional variation, including the distribution of nonhydrocarbon gases (H2S and CO2), are critical factors in production strategy. To evaluate the controls on compositional variation and connectivity, detailed molecular and isotopic analyses were conducted for 29 wells. Analysis of volatiles in fluid inclusions suggests that the field was originally filled with oil that subsequently cracked to gas. In addition to the thermal destruction (cracking) of oil, the process of thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) continues to destroy the remaining hydrocarbons through oxidation of gas and reduction of sulfate to form H 2S and CO2. The variable extent of the TSR process at Mobile Bay results in a wide range of hydrocarbon and H2S compositions. Condensates are almost exclusively composed of diamondoids whose composition appears controlled by H2S concentrations. In contrast to hydrocarbon and H2S contents, CO2 concentrations are relatively constant throughout the field. Carbon isotopic ratios for CO 2 correlate positively with those for wet-gas hydrocarbons but are heavier than expected for CO2 originating from hydrocarbon oxidation via TSR. The narrow range of CO2 contents and heavy isotope ratios suggests that CO2 is regulated by water-rock equilibration and carbonate precipitation. The destruction of the hydrocarbon gas and mineralization of the carbon dioxide product create a volume reduction and an associated drop in reservoir pressure. This process creates several internal sinks (or exits) that may control the spill direction for gas in the field. Copyright © 2009. The American Association of Petroleum Geologists.

The short nature of the historical record and potential issues with its reliability in earlier decades, however, has prompted an ongoing debate regarding the reality and significance of the recent rise. Here we place recent activity in a longer-term context by comparing two independent estimates of tropical cyclone activity over the past 1,500 years. The first estimate is based on a composite of regional sedimentary evidence of landfalling hurricanes, while the second estimate uses a previously published statistical model of Atlantic tropical cyclone activity driven by proxy reconstructions of past climate changes. Both approaches yield consistent evidence of a peak in Atlantic tropical cyclone activity during medieval times (around ad 1000) followed by a subsequent lull in activity. The statistical model indicates that the medieval peak, which rivals or even exceeds (within uncertainties) recent levels of activity, results from the reinforcing effects of La-Niña-like climate conditions and relative tropical Atlantic warmth. ©2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Fumigation experiments show that current O3concentrations of 30-50 ppb reduce plant biomass production and reproduction. Visible foliar injury is attributable to peak O3concentrations and relates to fast phenological development and high growth rate. Trees can acclimate to O 3-induced water stress by producing more xeromorphic leaves or needles. The direct effects of O3 on grassland vegetation also translate to changes in the structure and size of the soil microbial community, and ecosystem N cycling. It is necessary to reduce the emission of O3 precursors and maintain high biodiversity to protect northern ecosystems.

We compute and compare these distributions for different network. configurations, ranging from the simple individual compartment, to series and parallel linear compartments, feedback systems, and models assuming a continuous distribution of decay constants. We also derive the transit time and age distributions of some complex, widely used soil carbon models (the compartmental models CENTURY and Rothamsted, and the continuous-quality Q-Model), and discuss them in the context of long-term carbon sequestration in soils. We show how complex models including feedback loops and slow compartments have distributions with heavier tails than simpler models. Power law tails emerge when using continuous-quality models, indicating long retention times for an important fraction of soil carbon. The responsiveness of the soil system to changes in decay constants due to altered climatic conditions or plant species composition is found to be stronger when all compartments respond equally to the environmental change, and when the slower compartments are more sensitive than the faster ones or lose more carbon through microbial respiration.

Here, we investigate the possible connections between this fire-induced watershed heterogeneity and lake metabolism and CO2 dynamics. Plankton respiration, and water-air CO2 fluxes were measured in the epilimnia of 50 lakes, selected to lie within distinct watershed types in terms of postfire terrestrial succession in the boreal region of Northern Québec. Plankton respiration varied widely among lakes (from 21 to 211 μgCL-1 day-1), was negatively related to lake area, and positively related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC). All lakes were supersaturated in CO2 and the resulting carbon (C) flux to the atmosphere (150 to over 3000 mg Cm2 day-1) was negatively related to lake area and positively to DOC concentration. CO2 fluxes were positively related to integrated water column respiration, suggesting a biological component in this flux. Both respiration and CO2 fluxes were strongly negatively related to years after the last fire in the basin, such that lakes in recently burnt basins had significantly higher C emissions, even after the influence of lake size was removed. No significant differences were found in nutrients, chlorophyll, and DOC between lakes in different basin types, suggesting that the fire-induced watershed features influence other, more subtle aspects, such as the quality of the organic C reaching lakes. The fire-induced enhancement of lake organic C mineralization and C emissions represents a long-term impact that increases the overall C loss from the landscape as the result of fire, but which has never been included in current regional C budgets and future projections. The need to account for this additional fire-induced C loss becomes critical in the face of predictions of increasing incidence of fire in the circumboreal landscape. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Boreal; Carbon dioxide flux; Climate; Forest fire; Lakes; Organic carbon; Plankton respiration; Watershed","boreal forest; carbon budget; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; forest fire; global change; heterogeneity; lake; metabolism; phytoplankton; respiration; watershed; Canada; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74549139670

We show that the coupling strength depends sensitively on the type of vibron and is strongly sample dependent. The coupling strength becomes particularly strong when inhomogeneity-induced electronic quantum dots are located near regions where the vibronic mode is associated with large strain. Specifically, we find that the longitudinal stretching mode and the radial breathing mode are coupled via the strong deformation potential, while twist modes couple more weakly via a mechanism involving modulation of the electronic hopping amplitudes between carbon sites. A special case are bending modes: for symmetry reasons, their coupling is only quadratic in the vibron coordinate.

This preferential biodegradation of the organic fractions reduces the landfill emission potential. Although the composition of the input mixture strongly affects the shape of the infrared (IR) spectra, typical bands of components can be selected and used to follow the composting process; that is, changes in the relative absorbances of the band of nitrate (at 1384 cm-1) and in the band of carbohydrates (at 1037 cm -1) have been observed. In addition, different chemometric tools, such as partial leastsquares (PLS), interval PLS (iPLS), backward iPLS (biPLS), and genetic algorithm (GA), have been used to find the most relevant spectral region during the composting process. Chemometric analysis based on the combined and sequential use of iPLS and GA has been revealed as a very powerful tool for the detection in samples of the most relevant spectral region related to the composting process. From the obtained results, it can be concluded that CPMAS 13C NMR supported by FT-IR could provide information about the evolution and characteristics of the organic matter during the composting process in order to avoid contamination problems after its use as amendment in agriculture or after landfilling ©2009 American Chemical Society.","13c nmr; Biodegradation; Compost; FT-IR; Genetic algorithm; Organic matter; Partial least-squares","organic compound; industrial waste; manure; organic compound; soil; animal; article; cattle; chemistry; evaluation; grape; industrial waste; infrared spectroscopy; manure; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; poultry; soil; waste disposal; analysis; Bovinae; evaluation study; industrial waste; infrared spectroscopy; manure; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; procedures; soil; Vitis; Animals; Cattle; Industrial Waste; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Manure; Organic Chemicals; Poultry; Refuse Disposal; Soil; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Vitis; Animals; Cattle; Industrial Waste; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Manure; Organic Chemicals; Poultry; Refuse Disposal; Soil; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Vitis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350306932

The drawdown can be related to net ecosystem exchange when anthropogenic emissions are estimated using a combination of the Vulcan fossil fuel emissions inventory coupled with a source contribution analysis using HYSPLIT. Results show a temporally and spatially averaged net CO2 flux of -9.0 ± 2.4 μmol m-2 s-1 measured from the aircraft data. The average flux from anthropogenic emissions over the measurement area was 0.3 ± 0.1 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1. Large-scale subsidence occurred during the experiment, entraining 1.0 ± 0.2 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1 into the boundary layer. Thus, the CO2 flux attributable to the vegetation and soils is -10.3 ± 2.4 μmol m-2 s-1. The magnitude of the calculated daytime biospheric flux is consistent with tower-based eddy covariance fluxes over corn and soybeans given existing land-use estimates for this agricultural region.

Numerous ancient writings describe plagues and blasts destroying crops and modern civilization still faces many plant disease challenges. Plant pathology has its roots in botany and notable scientists such as Tillet, Prevost, and deBary already had concluded microscopic organisms could cause plant diseases before Robert Koch established the rules of proof of pathogenicity with sheep anthrax. Plant pathologists can be credited with helping improve crop yields and food production throughout the world. However, at a time when there are increasing challenges to crop production, some that potentially may increase the severity or distribution of plant diseases, the training of future plant pathologists appears to be declining, at least in the United States. The ability of the U.S. Land Grant University (USLGU) system to attract and train future generations of plant pathologists may be at risk. Recent data from university plant pathology departments collected by The American Phytopathological Society (APS) documents a decline in the number of students completing advanced degrees in plant pathology, departments with fewer faculty with a diverse expertise in applied plant pathology, fewer stand-alone, single discipline departments of plant pathology, a reduced ability of many departments to offer specific curricular aspects of plant pathology, and a demographic profile that casts an ominous prediction for an unusually large number of faculty retirements over the next decade. The impact of these factors could be a shortage of highly skilled, applied plant pathologists in the U.S. in coming years. The affect also may be felt globally as fewer international students may receive predoctoral and post-doctoral training in plant pathology in the U.S. as faculty retire and are not replaced. On the other hand, this likely will create greater opportunities for universities around the world to take leadership in many aspects of plant pathology education. While a decline in students and young faculty trained in applied and field-level specialties of plant pathology (mycology, bacteriology, plant nematology, forest pathology, epidemiology, etc.) is occurring, those trained in the cellular and molecular host-pathogen interactions specialties appear to be increasing. Many plant pathology faculty hired at USLGUs in the last decade are trained in molecular biology and received their Ph.D. degree in a field other than plant pathology. They are now applying those skills to research numerous aspects of host-pathogen interactions of model pathosystems. A shift to a greater research emphasis on molecular host-pathogen interactions over the last decade is evidenced by the number of research articles published in the three APS journals; Plant Disease, Phytopathology and Molecular PlantMicrobe Interactions (MPMI). From 1985 to 2007, there has been a decline in the number of articles published in Plant Disease (-29%) and Phytopathology (-36%) and a steady increase in those published in MPMI since its inception in 1990 (+111%). With new research tools come new research questions. The tools of molecular biology have allowed us to look deeper into questions than ever before and provided us with a perspective not before seen. As we dissect and decode the genomes of the world's most notorious plant pathogens we get closer and closer to alleviating the global losses and human suffering caused by plant diseases. New ""designer crops"" with engineered traits for drought and cold tolerance, pest resistance, increased levels of micronutrients, healthier oils such as omega fatty acids, and plant-derived pharmaceuticals are all on the horizon. Research in the future likely will focus on new problems, traditionally seen as outside the discipline of plant pathology. The impact of climate change on plant diseases will be significant. As many parts of the world become warmer and drier some plant diseases likely will increase in severity. Pathogens are likely to migrate and survive in more northern latitudes greatly expanding their range and diseases exacerbated by abiotic stresses such as drought and salinity will increase. Plant pathology will continue to evolve as a multidisciplinary science. These changes will open up many new research opportunities. Plant pathology will play a bigger role in global food security. Research into the molecular and cellular interactions of symbiotic and endophytic organisms will help provide answers to food-borne illnesses caused by E. coli and Salmonella and how these and other human pathogens become established in plants in the field. Plant pathologists will team up with biomedical and aeronautical engineers, nanotechnologists, and computer scientists to develop microsensory technology to detect the introduction and spread of pathogens for biosecurity, diagnostics and epidemiological modeling purposes. Traditional areas of plant disease management and the use of biologicals for disease control also will benefit from a better understanding of the molecular and cellular processes and the similarity of virulence mechanisms and pathogen effectors between plant, insect, and vertebrate pathogens likely will bring new insights into human diseases. And last, but not least, there likely will be a resurgence in plant disease management and epidemiological research as the world's dependence on biofuels increases and results in new diseases on intensively cultivated plant species used for biomass production.","Applied plant patology; Future of plant pathology; Plant pathology education; The American phytopathological society - APS; U.S. Land grant university","Escherichia coli; Hexapoda; Ovis aries; Salmonella; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75149144806

Concerning helminths, among the numerous environmental modifications giving rise to changes in infections, climate variables appear as those showing a greater influence, so that climate change may be expected to have an important impact on the diseases they cause. However, the confirmation of the impact of climate change on helminthiases has been reached very recently. Only shortly before, helminthiases were still noted as infectious diseases scarcely affected by climate change, when compared to diseases caused by microorganisms in general (viruses, bacteriae, protozoans). The aim of the present paper is to review the impact of climate change on helminthiases transmitted by snails, invertebrates which are pronouncedly affected by meteorological factors, by focusing on trematodiases. First, the knowledge on the effects of climate change on trematodiases in general is reviewed, including aspects such as influence of temperature on cercarial output, cercarial production variability in trematode species, influences of magnitude of cercarial production and snail host size, cercarial quality, duration of cercarial production increase and host mortality, influence of latitude, and global-warming-induced impact of trematodes. Secondly, important zoonotic diseases such as fascioliasis, schistosomiasis and cercarial dermatitis are analysed from the point of view of their relationships with meteorological factors. Emphasis is given to data which indicate that climate change influences the characteristics of these trematodiases in concrete areas where these diseases are emerging in recent years. The present review shows that trematodes, similarly as other helminths presenting larval stages living freely in the environment and/or larval stages parasitic in invertebrates easily affected by climate change as arthropods and molluscs as intermediate hosts, may be largely more susceptible to climate change impact than those helminths in whose life cycle such phases are absent or reduced to a minimum. Although helminths also appear to be affected by climate change, their main difference with microparasites lies on the usually longer life cycles of helminths, with longer generation times, slower population growth rates and longer time period needed for the response in the definitive host to become evident. Consequently, after a pronounced climate change in a local area, modifications in helminth populations need more time to be obvious or detectable than modifications in microparasite populations. Similarly, the relation of changes in a helminthiasis with climatic factor changes, as extreme events elapsed relatively long time ago, may be overlooked if not concretely searched for. All indicates that this phenomenon has been the reason for previous analyses to conclude that helminthiases do not constitute priority targets in climate change impact studies. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Most importantly, interactions among these drivers frequently generate nonadditive effects that cannot be predicted based on single-factor studies. Our goal was to assess the joint effects of three global change drivers that are especially relevant in Mediterranean ecosystems, namely, fragmentation, reduced habitat quality, and climate change on Centaurea hyssopifolia, a gypsum specialist plant. We carried out a two-year study (2005-2006) in natural populations of this plant in large (>11 ha) and small (<1.5 ha) fragments. Within each fragment, we identified areas of contrasting habitat quality as revealed by plant cover and nutrient content, and within each combination of habitat quality and fragment size we performed a rainfall manipulation experiment simulating the most likely future climate scenario for the region. Survival, growth, phenology, and reproductive success of selected plants were monitored. The three drivers profoundly affected responses of Centaurea hyssopifolia in both study years, phenology being mainly affected by changes in habitat quality and reductions in rainfall and reproductive traits being mainly affected by fragmentation. Plants in sites of poor habitat quality and plants in the dry treatment advanced most of their phenophases (flowering and dispersing earlier) and showed reduced growth rate and increased fraction of senescent leaves. Plants growing in small fragments had lower survival, lower number of viable seeds, and a reduced seed set compared to those from large fragments. We found significant synergistic interactions among drivers. For example, the interaction between fragmentation and habitat quality led to lower survival and lower relative growth in plants from small and poor-quality habitat sites. Our results highlight the importance of studies addressing simultaneously all relevant drivers of global change potentially affecting plant performance under natural conditions. In addition, the complex responses of phenology and reproductive traits of C. hyssopifolia emphasize the need for studies integrating traits from vegetative to reproductive and from the organ to the whole-plant level. © 2009 by the Ecological Society ot America.","Centaurea hyssopifolia; Changes in habitat quality; Climate change; Fitness; Fragmentation; Global change; Gypsophile; Interactions; Mediterranean ecosystem; Phenology","climate change; disturbance; fitness; global change; growth rate; growth response; habitat fragmentation; habitat quality; human activity; Mediterranean environment; phenology; reproductive success; seed set; shrub; survival; viability; Centaurea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69449096991

The spectral feature in the mid-IR region is diagnostic of the mineralogy and spectral signatures of mixtures of minerals that add linearly, and therefore, can be used as an important tool to determine the mineralogy of rocks in the laboratory and remotely for planetary exploration. The greatest challenge in the emission measurement lies in the measurement of the weak thermal photons emitted from geological materials in a laboratory setup, and accurately records the temperature of the rock sample. The present work pertains to the details of a new Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) laboratory that has been developed under the ISRO Planetary Science and Exploration (PLANEX) programme, for emission related mineralogical investigations of planetary surfaces. The focus of the paper is on the acquisition and calibration technique for obtaining emissivity, and the deconvolution procedure to obtain the modal abundances of the thermal emission spectra in the range of 6-25μm using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The basic technique is adopted from the work of Ruff et al (1997).

This paper reviews these national strategies and plans as well as associated implementing policies, and discusses the extent to which these objectives may be achieved. This paper found that the long-term potential of biofuels to contribute to GHG reduction goals will depend not only on the rates of technological development of the second generation biofuels but also on the development of other advanced vehicles. In the medium term, the potential contribution of biofuels to rural development and realising a recycle-based society could become significant depending on the progress of technology for both second generation biofuel production and the collection and transportation of their feedstocks. The potential contribution of biofuels to Japan's energy security is constrained by the availability of imports and the potential of domestic production. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Results are presented from accelerated ageing in natural sea water for nine months, at temperatures of 20, 40 and 60 °C. Nano-indentation was used to study local changes in the resin after ageing. The diffusion kinetics of the low styrene emission resins and their composites are similar to those for standard polyester resins.

We reviewed the literature and climate-change adaptation plans that have been developed in United States, Canada, England, México, and South Africa and found 16 general adaptation strategies that relate directly to the conservation of biological diversity. These strategies can be grouped into four broad categories: land and water protection and management; direct species management; monitoring and planning; and law and policy. Tools for implementing these strategies are similar or identical to those already in use by conservationists worldwide (land and water conservation, ecological restoration, agrienvironment schemes, species translocation, captive propagation, monitoring, natural resource planning, and legislation/regulation). Although our review indicates natural resource managers already have many tools that can be used to address climate-change effects, managers will likely need to apply these tools in novel and innovative ways to meet the unprecedented challenges posed by climate change. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.","Adaptation; Biodiversity; Climate change; Conservation; Management; Restoration; Wildlife","adaptation; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; conservation planning; environmental monitoring; global climate; wild population; wildlife management; adaptation; animal; biodiversity; climate; ecology; environment; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; human; methodology; review; species extinction; wild animal; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Animals, Wild; Biodiversity; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Extinction, Biological; Humans; Africa; Canada; England; Eurasia; Europe; Mexico [North America]; North America; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; United Kingdom; United States; Western Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349202243

Continuous monitoring of ambient total gaseous mercury (TGM) concentrations in the Lake Wabamun area was undertaken at two sites, Genesee and Meadows. The data were analyzed in order to characterise the effect of the coal-fired power plants on the regional TGM. Mean concentrations of 1.57 ng/m3 for Genesee and 1.50 ng/m3 for Meadows were comparable to other Canadian sites. Maximum concentrations of 9.50 ng/m3 and 4.43 ng/m3 were comparable to maxima recorded at Canadian sites influenced by anthropogenic sources. The Genesee site was directly affected by the coal-fired power plants with the occurrence of northwest winds, and this was evident by episodes of elevated TGM, NOx and SO2 concentrations. NOx/TGM and SO2/TGM ratios of 21.71 and 19.98 μg/ng, respectively, were characteristic of the episodic events from the northwest wind direction. AERMOD modeling predicted that coal-fired power plant TGM emissions under normal operating conditions can influence hourly ground-level concentrations by 0.46-1.19 ng/m3. The effect of changes in coal-fired power plant electricity production on the ambient TGM concentrations was also investigated, and was useful in describing some of the episodes.

Scenarios are used to envision how such a significant decarbonization might be achieved through the application of advanced vehicle technologies and fuels, and various options for behavioral change. A Kaya framework that decomposes GHG emissions into the product of four major drivers is used to analyze emissions and mitigation options. In contrast to most previous studies, a relatively simple, easily adaptable modeling methodology is used which can incorporate insights from other modeling studies and organize them in a way that is easy for policymakers to understand. Also, a wider range of transportation subsectors is considered here-light- and heavy-duty vehicles, aviation, rail, marine, agriculture, off-road, and construction. This analysis investigates scenarios with multiple options (increased efficiency, lower-carbon fuels, and travel demand management) across the various subsectors and confirms the notion that there are no ""silver bullet"" strategies for making deep cuts in transport GHGs. If substantial emission reductions are to be made, considerable action is needed on all fronts, and no subsectors can be ignored. Light-duty vehicles offer the greatest potential for emission reductions; however, while deep reductions in other subsectors are also possible, there are more limitations in the types of fuels and propulsion systems that can be used. In all cases travel demand management strategies are critical; deep emission cuts will not likely be possible without slowing growth in travel demand across all modes. Even though these scenarios represent only a small subset of the potential futures in which deep reductions might be achieved, they provide a sense of the magnitude of changes required in our transportation system and the need for early and aggressive action if long-term targets are to be met. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Advantages include promoting awareness of ethical issues and timely review of proposals. However, excessive bureaucracy and inconsistency in obtaining local governance approvals can lead to unacceptable delays. There is also a danger that the current focus on the process of applying for ethical approval may overshadow debate about the principles of ethical research practice. Over-reliance on a checklist approach may perpetuate an erroneous notion of ethical approval being a 'hurdle' to negotiate instead of an ongoing consideration. Unanticipated theoretical and methodological implications for future health services research are critically examined.

Here we illustrate the land-use impact to U.S. habitat types of new energy development resulting from different U.S. energy policies. We estimated the total new land area needed by 2030 to produce energy, under current law and under various cap-and-trade policies, and then partitioned the area impacted among habitat types with geospatial data on the feasibility of production. The land-use intensity of different energy production techniques varies over three orders of magnitude, from 1.9-2.8 km2/TW hr/yr for nuclear power to 788-1000 km2/TW hr/yr for biodiesel from soy. In all scenarios, temperate deciduous forests and temperate grasslands will be most impacted by future energy development, although the magnitude of impact by wind, biomass, and coal to different habitat types is policy-specific. Regardless of the existence or structure of a cap-and-trade bill, at least 206,000 km2 will be impacted without substantial increases in energy efficiency, which saves at least 7.6 km2 per TW hr of electricity conserved annually and 27.5 km2 per TW hr of liquid fuels conserved annually. Climate policy that reduces carbon dioxide emissions may increase the areal impact of energy, although the magnitude of this potential side effect may be substantially mitigated by increases in energy efficiency. The possibility of widespread energy sprawl increases the need for energy conservation, appropriate siting, sustainable production practices, and compensatory mitigation offsets. © 2009 McDonald et al.",,"biofuel; air quality; animal behavior; article; avoidance behavior; biofuel production; biomass energy; climate change; crop production; energy conservation; energy crop; energy yield; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; habitat; habitat use; land use; policy; temperate grassland; United States; water quality; climate; ecosystem; energy conservation; environment; Climate; Conservation of Energy Resources; Ecosystem; Environment; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69249215350

The region showed a strong winter to summer decrease in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC; ∼ 45 μmol/kg) and fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2; ∼ 25 μatm), and an increase in stable carbon isotopic composition of DIC (δ13CDIC; ∼ 0.5‰), based on data collected between November 1997 and July 1999. The observed mixed layer changes are due to a combination of ocean mixing, air-sea exchange of CO2, and biological carbon production and export. After correction for mixing, we find that DIC decreases by up to 42 ± 3 μmol/kg from winter (July) to summer (February), with δ13CDIC enriched by up to 0.45 ± 0.05‰ for the same period. The enrichment of δ13CDIC between winter and summer is due to the preferential uptake of 12CO2 by marine phytoplankton during photosynthesis. Biological processes dominate the seasonal carbon budget (≈ 80%), while air-sea exchange of CO2 (≈ 10%) and mixing (≈ 10%) have smaller effects. We found the seasonal amplitude of fCO2 to be about half that of a study undertaken during 1991-1995 [Metzl, N., Tilbrook, B. and Poisson, A., 1999. The annual fCO2 cycle and the air-sea CO2 flux in the sub-Antarctic Ocean. Tellus Series B-Chemical and Physical Meteorology, 51(4): 849-861.] for the same region, indicating that SAZ may undergo significant inter-annual variations in surface fCO2. The seasonal DIC depletion implies a minimum biological carbon export of 3400 mmol C/ m2 from July to February. A comparison with nutrient changes indicates that organic carbon export occurs close to Redfield values (ΔP:ΔN:ΔC = 1:16:119). Extrapolating our estimates to the circumpolar sub-Antarctic Ocean implies a minimum organic carbon export of 0.65 GtC from the July to February period, about 5-7% of estimates of global export flux. Our estimate for biological carbon export is an order of magnitude greater than anthropogenic CO2 uptake in the same region and suggests that changes in biological export in the region may have large implications for future CO2 uptake by the ocean. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon budget; Carbon isotopes; Oceanic biogeochemistry; Southern Ocean","air-sea interaction; biogeochemistry; biological production; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon isotope; dissolved inorganic carbon; fugacity; human activity; mixed layer; nutrient budget; phytoplankton; seasonal variation; tracer; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349822964

OCO would have been limited in terms of treaty monitoring, too. But its instruments would have been sufficient to monitor metropolitan areas, including large power plants. The potential would be enhanced if a replacement's orbit is modified to emphasize metropolitan areas so big man-made sources could be sampled. Alliant Techsystems Inc.

Although root exudates and root litter are important factors affecting the cycling of nutrients critical to plant growth, many studies remain focused on effects of above-ground litter inputs. Using two species that co-dominate alpine moist meadows as a model system (the phenolic-rich forb Geum rossii, and the fast-growing grass Deschampsia caespitosa), we asked whether C from G. rossii fine roots could reduce D. caespitosa growth. We hypothesized that root C would indirectly reduce D. caespitosa growth by stimulating soil microbes, thus restricting plant N supplies. We predicted that this effect could be overcome by fertilization with N. We also hypothesized that G. rossii root phenolics could allelopathically inhibit D. caespitosa growth, and we predicted that direct, allelopathic inhibition would not be reversible with N additions. Both cellulose and phenolic-rich root C additions inhibited D. caespitosa growth in field microcosms, relative to controls. N additions reversed the negative effects of cellulose on plant growth but did not reverse the inhibitory effects of phenolic-rich C additions. A companion soil incubation experiment showed that both types of C addition reduced N availability relative to controls, and there was a strong negative correlation between N availability and substrate-induced soil respiration. Our results indicate that root C inputs to soil can have substantial, negative effects on plant growth. Reduced plant growth was likely to be caused by (i) indirect interactions between root C and soil microbes lowering plant N supply; and (ii) a mechanism independent of N supply, possibly involving allelopathic effects of G. rossii phenolic compounds on D. caespitosa root growth. Synthesis. Fine root inputs to soil (i.e. phenolic-rich C and cellulose C) reduced a neighbouring plant's growth and the chemical composition of the root C influenced whether growth inhibition could be overcome by increased plant N supply. Negative effects of phenolic-rich root inputs on plant growth could be an under-appreciated factor structuring plant communities, particularly in N-limited systems dominated by phenolic-rich species. © 2009 British Ecological Society.","Allelopathy; Nitrogen cycling; Plant growth; Plant secondary compounds; Plant-soil interaction; Rhizodeposition; Root chemistry; Soil nutrients","cellulose; climate change; growth rate; leaf litter; meadow; moisture content; nutrient cycling; pH; phytochemistry; plant; root; soil fertility; soil microorganism; soil nutrient; soil respiration; Deschampsia cespitosa; Geum; Geum rossii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68849123481

The main aim of this experiment was to study the effect on these emissions of applying mineral or organic fertilizers to a non-irrigated crop under Mediterranean conditions. A secondary aim was to determine whether application of the fertilizer had a residual effect on the N2O and NO pulses observed after the first rainfall events in autumn, and the magnitude of these fluxes. A field experiment was carried out with a barley crop (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Bornova). Untreated pig slurry (UPS), digested pig slurry (DPS), municipal solid waste (MSW) and composted crop residues mixed with sewage sludge (CCR + S) were applied to the soil. The resulting emissions were compared with those from a mineral fertilizer, urea (U), and a control treatment (C), in which no nitrogen was applied. Very low NO and N2O fluxes were measured during the entire experimental period in all treatments. The accumulated N2O emissions from the organic and inorganic fertilizers ranged from 266 to 345 g N2O-N ha-1 and did not show significant differences. Three of the four organic fertilizers had the positive effect of reducing NO emissions (28.82-44.48 g NO-N ha-1) compared with inorganic fertilizer (61.86 g NO-N ha-1). Nitrous oxide pulses were observed in autumn. Negative N2O fluxes were measured on several occasions. The emission factor relating N2O emissions to the N applied as fertilizer, ranged from 0.06 to 0.17% for MSW and DPS, respectively, which is much lower than the default factor proposed by the IPCC. The emission factor which relates N2O emissions to crop production ranged from 241 to 361 mg N2O-N kg-1 for DPS and U, respectively, suggesting that DPS should be promoted in order to reduce N2O emissions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Location: Europe. Methods: We collated data on roe deer population density from 72 localities spanning 25° latitude and 48° longitude and analysed them in relation to a range of environmental factors: vegetation productivity (approximated by the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation) and forest cover as proxies for food supply, winter severity, summer drought and presence or absence of large predators (wolf, Canis lupus, and Eurasian lynx, Lynx lynx), hunter harvest and a competitor (red deer, Cervus elaphus). Results: Roe deer abundance increased with the overall productivity of vegetation cover and with lower forest cover (sparser forest cover means that a higher proportion of overall plant productivity is allocated to ground vegetation and thus is available to roe deer). The effect of large predators was relatively weak in highly productive environments and in regions with mild climate, but increased markedly in regions with low vegetation productivity and harsh winters. Other potentially limiting factors (hunting, summer drought and competition with red deer) had no significant impact on roe deer abundance. Main conclusions: The analyses revealed the combined effect of bottom-up and top-down control on roe deer: on a biogeographical scale, population abundance of roe deer has been shaped by food-related factors and large predators, with additive effects of the two species of predators. The results have implications for management of roe deer populations in Europe. First, an increase in roe deer abundance can be expected as environmental productivity increases due to climate change. Secondly, recovery plans for large carnivores should take environmental productivity and winter severity into account when predicting their impact on prey. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Capreolus capreolus; Forest cover; Lynx; Population density; Red deer; Roe deer; Top-down control; Vegetation productivity; Winter harshness; Wolf","abundance; bottom-up control; deer; environmental factor; forest cover; population density; predation; top-down control; Eurasia; Europe; Canis familiaris; Canis lupus; Capreolus; Capreolus capreolus; Cervidae; Cervus elaphus; Lynx; Lynx lynx",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350413139

In areas with a high livestock density the low availability of nearby arable land, together with the preferred use of chemical fertilizer by arable farmers, results in high off-farm disposal costs for manure. Furthermore, ammonia abatement technologies, such as treatment of exhaust air, are important as ammonia emissions may account up to a quarter of the total nitrogen flux. Firstly, the paper describes and discusses the development of manure treatment in the Netherlands since the 1970's. Manure treatment processes that result in products that compete with and replace the use of chemical fertilizers can (partly) close the nutrient cycle again. From this point of view aerobic treatment of manure (nitrification/denitrification) can not be considered sustainable as nitrogen is taken out of the cycle at high environmental costs. Secondly, the state-of-the-art of techniques for treatment of exhaust air is presented. Besides ammonia, application of air treatment may also reduce environmental emissions of odour and particulate matter (dust). Both manure treatment and treatment of exhaust air are considered essential for sustainable livestock operations in areas with a high livestock density.

Soil was treated with extracts of neem, mata-raton or lambda-cyhalothrin, used as chemical control.

Concentrations of ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) and emissions of CH4, CO2 and N2O were monitored for 7 d. Treating urea-amended soil with extracts of neem, mata-raton or lambda-cyhalothrin reduced the emission of CO2 significantly compared to the untreated soil with the largest decrease found in the latter. Oxidation of CH4 was inhibited by extracts of neem in the unamended soil, and by neem, mata-raton and lambda-cyhalothrin in the urea-amended soil compared to the untreated soil. Neem, mata-raton and lambda-cyhalothrin reduced the N2O emission from the unamended soil incubated at 40%WHC compared to the untreated soil. Extracts of neem, mata-raton and lambda-cyhalothrin had no significant effect on dynamics of NH4+, NO2- and NO3-.

The present study tests whether trait information derived from regional floras can be used in conjunction with pre-existing quadrat data on species presence to derive meaningful relationships between specific morphometric traits and climate. Methods Quadrat records were obtained for 867 species in 404 sites from northern China (38-49°N, 82-132°E) together with information on the presence/absence of Key traits from floras. Bioclimate parameters for each site were calculated using the BIOME3 model. Principal component analysis and correlation analysis were conducted to determine the most important climate factors. The Akaike Information Criterion was used to select the best relationship between each trait and climate. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to explore the relationships between climate and trait occurrence. Key Results The changing abundance of life form, leaf type, phenology, photosynthetic pathway, leaf size and several other morphometric traits are determined by gradients in plant-available moisture (as measured by the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration: α), growing-season temperature (as measured by growing degree-days on a 0° base: GDD0) or a combination of these. Different plant functional types (PFTs, as defined by life form, leaf type and phenology) reach maximum abundance in distinct areas of this climate space: for example, evergreen trees occur in the coldest, wettest environments (GDD 0 &lt; 2500 °Cd, α &gt; 0·38), and deciduous scale-leaved trees occur in drier, warmer environments than deciduous broad-leaved trees. Most leaf-level traits show similar relationships with climate independently of PFT: for example, leaf size in all PFTs increases as the environment becomes wetter and cooler. However, some traits (e.g. petiole length) display different relationships with climate in different PFTs. Conclusions Based on presence/absence species data and flora-based trait assignments, the present study demonstrates ecologically plausible trends in the occurrence of Key plant traits along climate gradients in northern China. Life form, leaf type, phenology, photosynthetic pathway, leaf size and other Key traits reflect climate. The success of these analyses opens the possibility of using quadrat- and flora-based trait analyses to examine climate-trait relationships in other regions of the world.","Akaike Information Criterion; Aridity; Climate gradient; Functional types; Northern China; Plant life form; Plant morphometric traits","abundance; Akaike information criterion; aridity; bioclimatology; canonical analysis; climate variation; correspondence analysis; deciduous tree; evapotranspiration; evergreen tree; growing season; life history trait; meta-analysis; moisture content; morphometry; phenology; photosynthesis; principal component analysis; article; biodiversity; China; climate; geography; histology; meta analysis; photosynthesis; physiology; plant; plant leaf; principal component analysis; quantitative trait; temperature; Biodiversity; China; Climate; Geography; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plants; Principal Component Analysis; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Temperature; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350514258

However the impact of tars, formed during biomass gasification, on the performance and durability of SOFC anodes has not been well established experimentally. This paper reports on the comparison between thermodynamic predictions and experimental measurements of carbon formation arising from the steam reforming of 15 g/Nm3 benzene as a model biomass gasification tar over two commercially available nickel-based SOFC anode materials, Ni/YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) and Ni/CGO (gadolinium-doped ceria). Parallel experiments were performed using 60:40 wt % NiO/YSZ and 50:50 wt % NiO/CGO powders as catalyst material, and the degree of carbon formation was examined by temperature-programmed oxidation. The addition of steam reduced carbon formation on both materials, with Ni/CGO showing slightly more carbon formation compared to Ni/YSZ. This could reflect the differing nickel content in both materials, the activity of the anode material toward tar reforming, and/or the difference in surface area of each material. Carbon formation was excessive for both materials at steam to carbon ratios below 1. However, carbon formation was also present above the thermodynamically stable region for carbon formation with both materials.Tar conversion, and thus CO concentration, was higher for the Ni/YSZ material, whereas the oxidative behavior of ceria in the Ni/CGO anode material resulted in higher CO2 concentrations.

Erosion damages have increased enormously in this region during the last 50 y, most likely due to changes in land-use practices and due to the impact of climatic changes. In order to estimate the effect of vegetation characteristics on surface runoff and sediment loss, we irrigated 22 pasture plots of 1 m2 during 1 h at an intense rain rate of 50mm h-1 in two field campaigns using a portable rain simulator. The rain-simulation plots differed in plant composition (herb versus grass dominance) and land-use intensity but not in plant cover (&gt;90%) nor in soil conditions. Prior to the second rain-simulation campaign, aboveground vegetation was clipped in order to simulate intense grazing. The generated surface runoffs, sediment loss, relative water retention in the aboveground vegetation, and changes in soil moisture were quantified. Runoff coefficient varied between 0.1% and 25%, and sediment loss ranged between 0 and 0.053 g m-2. Thus, high infiltration rates and full vegetation cover resulted in very low erosion rates even under such extreme rain events. Surface runoff did not differ significantly between herb- and grass-dominated plots. However, clipping had a notable effect on surface runoff in the test plots under different land-use intensity. In plots without or with intensive use, surface runoff decreased after clipping whereas in extensively used plots, surface runoff increased after the clipping. This opposite effect was mainly explained by higher necromass and litter presence at the extensively used plots after the clipping treatment. The results obtained here contribute to a better understanding of the importance of vegetation characteristics on surface- runoff formation, thus, on soil-erosion control. Overall, we delineate vegetation parameters to be crucial in soil-erosion control which are directly modified by the land-use management. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Therefore, the quantification of the chemical transformation processes and the spatio-temporal differentiation of the nitrate transport behavior at regional scales are essential. The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) stipulated new sustainable management concepts in the face of climate change and the change of land use systems. Considering the prospective changes, a valid prediction of the substance flux using scale-dependent adapted model tools is a necessity. The objective of this paper is the parameterization of redox based denitrification dynamics in groundwater via the entire flow path from recharge to discharge by the geochemical proxies redox potential and Fe-concentration.

AOM is mediated by distinct groups of archaea, called anaerobic methanotrophs (ANME). ANME co-exist with sulfate-reducing bacteria, which are also involved in AOM coupled SR. The microorganisms involved in AOM coupled to SR are extremely difficult to grow in vitro. Here, a novel well-mixed submerged-membrane bioreactor system is used to grow and enrich the microorganisms mediating AOM coupled to SR. Four reactors were inoculated with sediment sampled in the Eckernförde Bay (Baltic Sea) and operated at a methane and sulfate loading rate of 4.8 L L-1 day-1 (196 mmol L-1 day-1) and 3.0 mmol L-1 day -1. Two bioreactors were controlled at 15°C and two at 30°C, one reactor at 30°C contained also anaerobic granular sludge. At 15°C, the volumetric AOM and SR rates doubled approximately every 3.8 months. After 884 days, an enrichment culture was obtained with an AOM and SR rate of 1.0 mmol gvolatile suspended solids-1 day-1 (286 7mu;mol gdry weight-1 day-1). No increase in AOM and SR was observed in the two bioreactors operated at 30°C. The microbial community of one of the 15°C reactors was analyzed. ANME-2a became the dominant archaea.

A membrane bioreactor was used to enrich for a community of methane-oxidizing sulfate-reducing microorganisms from Eckernförde Bay sediment.

AOM coupled to SR was completely inhibited at 2.4 (±0.1) mM sulfide. AOM occurred with sulfate, thiosulfate, and sulfite as electron acceptors.

New structural standards might undermine private reuse of old buildings on cost grounds. This article examines the potential conflict in terms of benefit trade-offs and the distribution of costs and benefits across current and future populations, examining impact assumptions and the approaches taken to risk of failure in emissions reduction, especially with regard to irreversible impacts.

Surface sediments from eight lakes on eastern Baffin Island and one from northern-most Greenland, spanning a gradient of 20° latitude, showed great variability with respect to Pb concentration and stable isotopic Pb ratios, with little apparent latitudinal trend. To constrain the temporal evolution of regional Pb pollution, a well-dated core from one of the sites, Lake CF8 on east-central Baffin Island, was analyzed geochemically at high stratigraphic resolution. A pronounced decrease in the 206Pb/207Pb ratio occurs in sediments deposited between 1923 and the mid-1970s, likely reflecting alkyl-Pb additives derived from the combustion of fossil fuels at a global scale. A two-component mixing model indicates that 17-26% of the Pb in the labile fraction of sediments deposited in Lake CF8 between 2001 and 2005 is from anthropogenic input. A Pb-Pb co-isotopic plot (206Pb/207Pb vs.208Pb/206Pb ratios) of the Lake CF8 time series data indicates multiple possible sources of industrial Pb pollution. Despite widespread reductions in industrial Pb emissions since the 1970s, there is no evidence for attendant reductions of pollution Pb at Lake CF8. Enhanced scavenging from increased primary production as well as changing precipitation rates as climate warms may represent important factors that modulate Pb deposition to Lake CF8, and Arctic lakes elsewhere. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We address this important problem by constructing a simple model of a prokaryotic metacommunity in which two generalist ecotypes compete for two resources. The first and the second ecotypes have, respectively, a higher preference for particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon. Sinking of POC would lead to a higher abundance of the first ecotype in the deep layer compared to the surface layer, but vertical mixing in turn generates a net upward flux of this ecotype to the surface layer. This upward movement accelerates the shifts in the community composition during the phytoplankton bloom, contributing to a higher efficiency in POC remineralization at the surface layer and reducing the carbon flux to the deep layer. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon cycling; Heterotrophic prokaryotes; Metacommunity; Vertical mixing and sinking","algal bloom; biological pump; carbon flux; community structure; dissolved organic carbon; ecotype; efficiency measurement; generalist; marine ecosystem; microbial activity; microbial community; particulate organic carbon; phytoplankton; prokaryote; spatiotemporal analysis; vertical mixing; algae; Prokaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72549110080

Particular attention has been paid to the changes of the ohmic resistance, relative to the dependence on composition of the CPE, the materials used, the time, and the position of storage. Four types of carbon pastes were examined, and for the interpretation of experimental data, a new simple model of ""close-packing of spheres"" has been applied. This model resembles the percolation theory for solid matter. In our case, however, it is possible to explain not only the ""bent"" or ""broken"" shape of the dependence of the electrode resistance upon the binder:carbon ratio and the corresponding electrochemical current response, but also differences caused by various material used and three various effects observed during the electrode aging. Furthermore, the report presents the significance of practical utilization of the recently introduced carbon paste index (denoted as χCPE), which is a qualitative hitherto unused factor based on the evaluation of cyclic voltammograms for standard redox systems (e.g., [Fe(CN)6]3-/4-) and specifying the electrochemical properties of a CPE.

The study site is characterized by a high frequency of orographic fog. During the day, humid air is transported uphill and causes condensation and fog as it cools. CO2 and water vapor fluxes were measured on two instrumented micrometeorological towers aligned along the valley axis. Despite the large reduction of solar radiation during foggy conditions by 64% as compared to clear situations, the reduction of the CO2 uptake is rather small at tower 1, for which Chamaecyparis is the dominating species within the footprint area. The Chamaecyparis species perform well under these extreme conditions of reduced light. A large section of the footprint area of tower 2 is vegetated with Cryptomeria japonica. CO2 flux comparison at both towers during foggy and non-foggy conditions, and direct tower-totower comparisons showed a significant difference statistically in the CO2 fluxes. While the photosynthesis rate of Chamaecyparis was hardly reduced during fog that of Cryptomeria japonica decreased strongly during foggy conditions. Cryptomeria japonica is less well adapted to the low light conditions. The net water vapor flux was dominated by evaporation of intercepted fog.

We used a 34-yr record of flowering times and flower abundance for four species (two Delphinium [Ranunculaceae] species and two Mertensia [Boraginaceae] species) from a subalpine plant community near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory to test the hypothesis that the phenologies of early-flowering species change more rapidly in response to climatological and other abiotic cues than do late-flowering species, a pattern previously found in plant communities in North America and Europe. We also explored a related hypothesis, that flower abundance of late-flowering species is more responsive to changes in climate than that of early-flowering species. The Delphinium species did not support these hypotheses, but the Mertensia species did. The difference between the peak flowering times of the early and late Mertensia species is expanding, leading to a period of diminished resources for pollinators that specialize on this genus. Mertensia ciliata populations are already severely declining in our study area, possibly as a result of earlier snowmelt. Together, these results show that the reported differences between early and late-flowering species may be widespread, but they are not ubiquitous.","Boraginaceae; Climate change; Delphinium; Flower abundance; Flowering phenology; Frost; Global warming; Mertensia; Ranunculaceae; Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory; Snowmelt","abundance; climate effect; dicotyledon; flower; frost; global warming; hypothesis testing; laboratory method; phenology; plant community; pollinator; snowmelt; wild population; North America; Rocky Mountains; Boraginaceae; Ciliophora; Delphinium; Mertensia (angiosperm); Mertensia ciliata; Ranunculaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349897463

The emission components can be fitted by power-law models with mean photon indices in the range 1.5 < Γ < 2.0. A control sample of regular, dynamically relaxed clusters, without radio haloes but with comparable mean thermal temperatures and luminosities, shows no compelling evidence for similar components. Detailed X-ray spectral mapping reveals the complex thermodynamic states of the radio halo clusters. Our deepest observations, of the Bullet Cluster 1E 0657-56, demonstrate a spatial correlation between the strongest power-law X-ray emission, highest thermal pressure and brightest 1.34 GHz radio halo emission in this cluster. We confirm the presence of a shock front in the 1E 0657-56 and report the discovery of a new, large-scale shock front in Abell 2219. We explore possible origins for the power-law X-ray components. These include inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by relativistic electrons in the clusters; bremsstrahlung from suprathermal electrons energized by Coulomb collisions with an energetic, non-thermal proton population; and synchrotron emission associated with ultrarelativistic electrons. Interestingly, we show that the power-law signatures may also be due to complex temperature and/or metallicity structure in clusters particularly in the presence of metallicity gradients. In this case, an important distinguishing characteristic between the radio halo clusters and control sample of predominantly cool-core clusters is the relatively low central X-ray surface brightness of the former. Our results have implications for previous discussions of soft excess X-ray emission from clusters and highlight the importance of further deep X-ray and radio mapping, coupled with new hard X-ray, γ-ray and TeV observations, for improving our understanding of the non-thermal particle populations in these systems. © 2009 RAS.","Galaxies: clusters: individual: 1E 0657-56, A665, A2163, A2255, A2319, A2744, A2219, A576, A1795, A2204, A478, A2029; Intergalactic medium; Magnetic fields; Radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; X-rays: galaxies: clusters",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350052815

The results are applied to examine a previously proposed scenario for the Ocean Anoxic Event-1a (OAE-1a) caused by an episodic CO2 release due to the Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) formation in the mid-Cretaceous. We developed an atmosphere-ocean biogeochemical cycle model that includes geochemical input to and output from the atmosphere and ocean due to submarine volcanic activity, continental weathering and sedimentation. We made a reference state, and then the state was perturbed in 42 cases of episodic CO2 release with different rates and periods. In all cases, the elevated atmospheric CO2 level results in an increase in phosphate concentration in the ocean caused by intensified weathering. Variations in the marine carbon isotope ratio are characterized by negative-to-positive excursions with a longer timescale for the latter. The deep water becomes anoxic in the cases with the release of a large amount of CO2. These features are also seen in the geological records of OAE-1a. From quantitative comparisons, we found that the amount of CO2 release required to cause OAE-1a is about 8 × 1018 mol, and atmospheric CO2 increases by a factor of three or more (&gt; 3600 ppm) in these cases. The amount can be accounted for by CO2 released due to the OJP formation, if the original magma contained a large CO2 fraction.

In response, we collated field inventory data from 253 plots at four study sites in Cameroon, Uganda and Mozambique, and examined the relationships between field-measured AGB and cross-polarized radar backscatter values derived from ALOS PALSAR, an L-band satellite sensor. The relationships were highly significant, similar among sites, and displayed high prediction accuracies up to 150 Mg ha-1 (±∼20%). AGB predictions for any given site obtained using equations derived from data from only the other three sites generated only small increases in error. The results suggest that a widely applicable general relationship exists between AGB and L-band backscatter for lower-biomass tropical woody vegetation. This relationship allows regional-scale AGB estimation, required for example by planned REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) schemes.

Yet oil presents a much larger problem for democracy: faced with the threats of oil depletion and catastrophic climate change, the democratic machineries that emerged to govern the age of carbon energy seem to be unable to address the processes that may end it. This article explores these multiple dimensions of carbon democracy, by examining the intersecting histories of coal, oil and democracy in the twentieth century. Following closely the methods by which fossil fuels were produced, distributed and converted into other forms of socio-technical organization, financial circulation and political power, the article traces ways in which the concentration and control of energy flows could open up democratic possibilities or close them down; how connections were engineered in the post-war period between the flow of oil and the flows of international finance, on which democratic stability was thought to depend; how these same circulations made possible the emergence of the economy and its unlimited growth as the main object of democratic politics; and how the relations among forms of energy, finance, economic knowledge, democracy and violence were transformed in the 1967-74 oil-dollar Middle East crises.","Coal; Democracy; Middle east; Oil","coal; democracy; geopolitics; oil; twentieth century; Middle East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349244920

It is, however, being trialled by the electricity network company, Vector, in a range of urban locations. Limitations of size mean roof-top wind turbines may not satisfy the total energy requirement of New Zealand houses. Ensuring structural stability and complying with stringent noise standards in New Zealand are further issues. In addition, roof-top turbines may be inefficient in terms of net energy and carbon emissions, performance indicators that are fundamental for the adoption of this technology. This paper considers the feasibility of using roof-top wind turbines in urban houses in New Zealand and, using life cycle assessment, evaluates the net energy and carbon emissions associated with their use. The results indicate that the electricity-generating potential of centralised wind farms in New Zealand using large turbines is 11.3-7 times the generating potential of roof-top turbines mounted on urban houses. In spite of this the roof-top turbines that are currently being trialled, could have the potential to reduce the energy and carbon intensity of New Zealand electricity by 81% and 26%, respectively. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

CBR3 exhibits a higher Km value toward NADPH and more limited carbonyl reductase activities than CBR1, although they are highly homologous to each other in amino acid sequence levels. In the present study, we investigated the origin of the different properties of the enzymes by analyses using several chimeric enzymes. Main Methods: Harr-plot analysis of the amino acid sequences was conducted and as a result, two low-identity regions between human CBR1 and CBR3 were found: these were designated as the N-terminal low-identity region (LirN) and the C-terminal low-identity region (LirC; the substrate-binding region). We genetically constructed chimeric enzymes while focusing on these regions. Key findings: Chimeric CBR1 possessing LirN of CBR3 (CBR1LirN3) exhibited CBR1-like activities but a low coenzyme affinity probably due to a structural alteration in a micro domain, whereas chimeric CBR1 including LirC of CBR3 (CBR1LirC3) was enzymatically similar to CBR3. Furthermore, CBR3LirC1 was similar to CBR1 in both enzymatic activities and coenzyme binding. Significance: These results suggested that LirC, i.e., the substrate-binding loop region, is the origin of the difference between human CBR1 and CBR3 in both catalytic and coenzyme-binding properties. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

These methods help, for project and product classifications, to protect human health and the environment. Comparison of different impact assessment methods along parallel evaluations of real air pollution case studies helps to detect similarities and dependencies between them. The comparison helps and supports the work in both areas by mutually exploiting the merits of both methods. On the other hand, the detected similarities and dependencies also support the accuracy of the assessment work. Materials and methods: Two impact assessment methods are compared to detect the dependencies between them. These are: the damage-oriented Life Cycle Impact Assessment method Eco-indicator 99 (EI99) and the Cost-Benefit Analysis (CAFE CBA) carried out within the framework of the Clean Air for Europe Programme of the European Union. Arithmetic comparison of the two methods' impact indicators is carried out in order to show how differently they assess and evaluate the environmental impacts of the same pollutants. Moreover, air pollution inventories of five industrialized cities in Poland are evaluated in parallel with the two impact assessment methods. The uncertainties of the two methods are also considered and Monte Carlo simulations are completed to obtain probability intervals of impact indicators and overall mean values of the generated populations. Results and discussion: The arithmetic comparison of the impact indicators shows a strict correlation between the two impact assessment methods. This correlation is confirmed by results of the parallel evaluation of the real case studies. The comparison of the overall mean values obtained by the Monte Carlo simulations also shows a clear dependency between the results of the two impact assessment methods. After detecting the dependencies between the two methods, the best guess values of the EI99 indicator are selected and applied to make a ranking of the air pollutants and their emission sources for an industrialized Polish city. Conclusions: It can be concluded that the detected correlation between the two methods (EI99 and CAFE CBA) supports and helps the accuracy of the impact assessment. If the uncertainties of the methods are also considered, it is proved for the examples of real case studies that they correlate in their results. On the other hand, the best guess of the EI99 indicators can be used to rank emissions according to their relative damage to human health and the ecosystem, and to locate emission sources. These results help decision-makers to conclude an efficient environmental conscious policy. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Air pollution; CAFE Programme; Eco-indicator 99; External cost; Impact assessment; Impact indicators; Marginal damage; Uncertainties","air pollution; article; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; environmental impact; environmental protection; life cycle assessment; Monte Carlo method; Poland; priority journal; probability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350616135

Contrarily, reductive carbonylation of impregnated HAuCl4 with FSM-16 using CO (200 torr)/water (20 torr) for 2 h, followed by irradiation with a high-pressureHglamp at 300Kfor 36 h, resulted in the formation ofAunanoparticles (circular; 8-75 nm diameter). These catalysts have been characterized by XRD, N2-sorpitometry, TEM, UV-vis-DRS, CO-FTIR spectroscopy, and then tested for water-gas shift reaction (WGSR) under feeding conditions of PCO=60 torr and PH2O=5 torr. Evidently, Au nanowires exhibited higher activity (3 times) than Au nanoparticles. It has been shown that the activity depends on Au geometry rather than structural characteristics, such as surface area. In-situ FTIR CO adsorption and UV-vis-DRS evidenced major changes on the surface properties of Au nanowires in exposing different oxidation states as well as inducing electron deficiencies exceeding those on Au nanoparticles. Gold nanowires displayed a surface plasmon resonance peak at 525 nm derivatized from distribution in size and dispersion and rather exceeding that at 484 nm exhibited for gold nanoparticles. It has been shown that Au0 species, including nanowires and small aggregated metallic nanoparticles, contribute significantly, if not predominantly, to theWGSactivity. TheTEMstudy provided evidence that reduction pretreatment ofAu nanowires prior to carrying out the reaction results in elimination of the activity due to sintering (from 35 to 53 nm) as well as to the exhibited change in geometry and thus altering the nature of active centers. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Active center; Au nanoparticle; Au nanowires; CO adsorption; CO-FTIR; Electron deficiency; Feeding conditions; Gold Nanoparticles; Gold nanowire; In-situ FT-IR; Metallic nanoparticles; Morphological characteristic; Oxidation state; Reduction pretreatment; Reductive carbonylation; Structural characteristics; Surface area; Surface plasmons; TEM; UV-vis-DRS; Water-gas shift reactions; XRD; Adsorption; Carbon monoxide; Carbonylation; Catalyst activity; Electric wire; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gold deposits; Irradiation; Nanoparticles; Nanowires; Reconnaissance aircraft; Sintering; Surface plasmon resonance; Surface properties; Gold",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349488278

Its use is limited by many side effects, including renal tubular acidosis (RTA), mainly of the distal type. In this study, rats were treated with FK506 and at baseline (after 9 days) systemic acid-base status was similar to that in control animals. However, FK506-treated rats given NH4Cl in the drinking water for 2 days developed a more severe metabolic acidosis than control animals. Urine pH was more alkaline, but net acid excretion was normal. After 7 days of acid load, all differences related to acid-base homeostasis were equalized in both groups. Protein abundance of type IIa Na-Pi cotransporter, type 3 Na +/H+ exchanger, and electrogenic Na+- bicarbonate cotransporter, and both a4 and B2 subunits of the vacuolar H +-ATPase were reduced under baseline conditions, while induction of metabolic acidosis enhanced protein abundance of these transporters in FK506-treated animals. In parallel, protein expression of AE1 was reduced at baseline and increased together with pendrin during NH4Cl loading in FK506 rats. Protein abundance of the Na+-bicarbonate cotransporter NBCn1 was reduced under baseline conditions but remained downregulated during metabolic acidosis. Morphological analysis revealed an increase in the relative number of non-type A intercalated cells in the connecting tubule and cortical collecting duct at the expense of principal cells. Additionally, subcellular distribution of the a4 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase was affected by FK506 with less luminal localization in the connecting tubule and outer medullary collecting duct. These data suggest that FK506 impacts on several major acid-base transport proteins in the kidney, and its use is associated with transient metabolic acidosis and altered expression of key renal acid-base transport proteins.

The GHG accounting was done by distinguishing between direct contributions at the AD facility and indirect upstream or downstream contributions. GHG accounting for a generic AD facility with either biogas utilization at the facility or upgrading of the gas for vehicle fuel resulted in a GWF from -375 (a saving) to 111 (a load) kg CO2-eq. tonne-1 wet waste. In both cases the digestate was used for fertilizer substitution. This large range was a result of the variation found for a number of key parameters: energy substitution by biogas, N2O-emission from digestate in soil, fugitive emission of CH4, unburned CH4, carbon bound in soil and fertilizer substitution. GWF for a specific type of AD facility was in the range -95 to -4 kg CO2-eq. tonne-1 wet waste. The ranges of uncertainty, especially of fugitive losses of CH4 and carbon sequestration highly influenced the result. In comparison with the few published GWFs for AD, the range of our data was much larger demonstrating the need to use a consistent and robust approach to GHG accounting and simultaneously accept that some key parameters are highly uncertain.","Anaerobic digestion; Digestate; Global warming; Greenhouse gas accounting; Municipal solid waste","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Fertilizers; Fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Source separation; Uncertainty analysis; Biogas utilization; Carbon sequestration; Digestate; Fugitive emissions; Greenhouse gas accountings; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Robust approaches; Vehicle fuels; Municipal solid waste; biogas; carbon dioxide; fertilizer; methane; nitrogen oxide; biogas; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; emission; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; municipal solid waste; waste treatment; air pollution; anaerobic digestion; downstream processing; energy conservation; energy consumption; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; municipal solid waste; priority journal; review; soil; uncertainty; waste management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72549093606

Protection and adaptation may mitigate the adverse consequences. This research reviews and assesses the options of protection by homeowners in the coastal zone in the southwest region of Cameroon. The coastal zone of Cameroon is studied because of the observed deleterious effect of recent extreme climatic events. From a research sample of 400 households, the house types and protection strategies - which are of two main types: reactive measures and preventive measures taken to offset adverse effects on property, are studied. A multinomial logit function reveals that income, education, age and gender are significant factors determining household's probability on the selection of protection measures. The study concludes that there are strong implications for adaptation to future climate change, and the ability of homeowners to extensively respond will have to be reinforced not only by communal and public works projects but also through an active government policy to promote climate change adaptation. © 2009 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Coastal residents; Protection options","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; coastal zone; environmental policy; homeowner; strategic approach; vulnerability; Africa; Cameroon; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71349086797

Air quality has manifold effects on health, ecosystems, heritage and climate. In this review the state of scientific understanding in relation to global and regional air quality is outlined. The review discusses air quality, in terms of emissions, processing and transport of trace gases and aerosols. New insights into the characterization of both natural and anthropogenic emissions are reviewed looking at both natural (e.g. dust and lightning) as well as plant emissions. Trends in anthropogenic emissions both by region and globally are discussed as well as biomass burning emissions. In terms of chemical processing the major air quality elements of ozone, non-methane hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and aerosols are covered. A number of topics are presented as a way of integrating the process view into the atmospheric context; these include the atmospheric oxidation efficiency, halogen and HOx chemistry, nighttime chemistry, tropical chemistry, heat waves, megacities, biomass burning and the regional hot spot of the Mediterranean. New findings with respect to the transport of pollutants across the scales are discussed, in particular the move to quantify the impact of long-range transport on regional air quality. Gaps and research questions that remain intractable are identified. The review concludes with a focus of research and policy questions for the coming decade. In particular, the policy challenges for concerted air quality and climate change policy (co-benefit) are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Aerosols; Air quality; Atmosphere; Climate; Co-benefit; Emissions; Oxidation chemistry; Ozone; Transport of pollutants; Troposphere","Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric oxidation; Biomass burning emissions; Biomass-burning; Chemical processing; Climate; Climate change policies; Co-benefit; Hand over; Heat waves; Hot spot; Long range transport; Megacities; Non-methane hydrocarbons; Oxidation chemistry; Ozone transport; Plant emissions; Process view; Regional air quality; Research questions; Scale interactions; Trace-gases; Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric movements; Biomass; Chemical elements; Chemical industry; Methane; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Ozone; Troposphere; Climate change; fossil fuel; halogen; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; aerosol; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; biogenic emission; biomass burning; chemical composition; climate change; literature review; long range transport; oxidation; pollutant transport; pollution policy; trace gas; troposphere; air pollution; air quality; Asia; biodegradation; biomass; climate change; dust; electric power plant; exhaust gas; greenhouse gas; lightning; particulate matter; pollution transport; priority journal; review; secondary organic aerosol; Southern Europe; troposphere; United States; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350036275

Salinity, pH, and pressure change effects on heterotrophic bacterial production (as measured by leucine incorporation) were examined in experiments with surface water from the Delaware Bay, Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean. Bacterial production decreased by 57-67% when salinity of Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay surface water samples were increased from ambient to 60 PSU. Decreasing ambient seawater pH from 8.0 to below 5.0 with CO2 gas reduced production by 96-100%. Decreasing seawater pH by 1.5 units at 33 PSU caused equivalent inhibition to increasing salinity by 27 PSU (pH 8.0). Bacterial production in Pacific Ocean surface water pressurized for 72 h was decreased 40% by increasing salinity, when measured 1 h after decompression. However, production increased 43% with increasing salinity when measured 24 h after decompression. One explanation for these divergent effects between the 1- and 24-h sampling at ambient pH may be community adaptation. Strains amongst the natural assemblage that survived the pressurization by saturating their membrane phospholipids would likely be better adapted to compete for available nutrients under elevated salinity.","Bacterial production; Depressurization; Hydrates; pH; Salinity","Atlantic Ocean; Bacterial assemblages; Bacterial production; Delaware bay; Depressurization; Depressurizations; Desalination technologies; Dissolved organic carbon concentration ([DOC]); Effect of pH; Leucine incorporation; Membrane phospholipids; Microbial assemblage; Pacific ocean; Pressure change; Reduced production; Waste stream; Amino acids; Bacteriology; Desalination; Dissolution; Effluents; Hydration; Hydrostatic pressure; Oceanography; Organic carbon; Phospholipids; Salinity measurement; Seawater; Surface waters; Wastewater treatment; Water filtration; pH effects; concentration (composition); desalination; dissolved organic carbon; effluent; experimental study; heterotrophy; inhibition; lipid; metabolism; microbial activity; pH; salinity; seawater; waste technology; wastewater; water chemistry; Atlantic Ocean; Delaware Bay; North America; Pacific Ocean; United States; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449104761

Although observed cases of canine pulmonary angiostrongylosis have been dutifully reported in the literature, the state of biological knowledge remains too poor to predict future patterns of spread with any confidence. Nevertheless, there is an urgent need to identify areas that are likely to be suitable for parasite establishment. Preliminary attempts to do this using a climatic envelope approach suggest that several new areas are open to colonisation, even without invoking climate change.

Results were compared with polymer-based calibrations of SEC elution times. It was observed that polymer- and PAH-based calibrations provide good mass estimates for material eluting in the resolved (later eluting) part of SEC chromatograms. At elution times shorter that 15 min (i.e., in the ""excluded"" region) there was significant deviation from the PS calibration for both the coal tar pitch and the petroleum-derived samples. In all cases, however, material eluting early during SEC was observed by LD-MS to have higher average masses compared to later-eluting material. The data appears conclusive. An upper limit to the detection of high-mass material by LD-MS appears to have been reached. When comparing mass estimates by LD-MS of SEC elution-fractions of material from the coal tar pitch and petroleum asphaltene, similar molecular mass ranges were found for fractions collected at similar elution times. This provides significant confirmation for the suitability of SEC as a technique for estimating molecular masses of complex hydrocarbon mixtures.

This atmospheric rise in CO 2 results in global climate change. Therefore methods for photochemically transforming CO2 into a source of fuel could offer an attractive way to decrease atmospheric concentrations. One way to accomplish this conversion is through the light-driven reduction of carbon dioxide to methane (CH4(g)) or methanol (CH3OH (l)) with electrons and protons derived from water. Existing infrastructure already supports the delivery of natural gas and liquid fuels, which makes these possible CO2 reduction products particularly appealing. This Account focuses on molecular approaches to photochemical CO 2 reduction in homogeneous solution. The reduction of CO2 by one electron to form CO2 •- is highly unfavorable, having a formal reduction potential of -2.14 V vs SCE. Rapid reduction requires an overpotential of up to 0.6 V, due at least in part to the kinetic restrictions imposed by the structural difference between linear CO2 and bent CO2 •-. An alternative and more favorable pathway is to reduce CO2 though proton-assisted multiple-electron transfer. The development of catalysts, redox mediators, or both that efficiently drive these reactions remains an important and active area of research. We divide these reactions into two class types. In Type I photocatalysis, a molecular light absorber and a transition metal catalyst work in concert. We also consider a special case of Type 1 photocatalysis, where a saturated hydrocarbon links the catalyst and the light absorber in a supramolecular compound. In Type II photocatalysis, the light absorber and the catalyst are the same molecule. In these reactions, transition-metal coordination compounds often serve as catalysts because they can absorb a significant portion of the solar spectrum and can promote activation of small molecules. This Account discusses four classes of transition-metal catalysts: (A) metal tetraaza-macrocyclic compounds; (B) supramolecular complexes; (C) metalloporphyrins and related metallomacrocycles; (D) Re(CO)3(bpy) Xbased compounds where bpy ) =2,′-bipyridine. Carbon monoxide and formate are the primary CO2 reduction products, and we also propose bicarbonate/carbonate production. For comprehensiveness, we briefly discuss hydrogen formation, a common side reaction that occurs concurrently with CO 2 reduction, though the details of that process are beyond the scope of this Account. It is our hope that drawing attention both to current mechanistic hypotheses and to the areas that are poorly understood will stimulate research that could one day provide an efficient solution to this global problem. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72949117212

On three manipulation plots we excluded summer throughfall in the years of 2006/2007 and measured SR fluxes in comparison to three control plots. Using radiocarbon measurements we quantified the contribution of rhizosphere (RR) and heterotrophic respiration (HR) to total SR. In both manipulation years, mean CO2 emissions (±SE) from the throughfall exclusion (TE) plots were smaller than from the control plots with 5.7 t C ha-1 (±0.3) compared to 6.7 t C ha-1 (±0.2) in 2006 and 5.9 t C ha-1 (±0.3) compared to 7.0 t C ha-1 (±0.4) in 2007. Under control conditions, CO2 originated mainly from HR (60-95% of SR). Prolonged drought reduced HR, whereas RR was not affected or even increased slightly. Reduction of CO2 emissions on the TE plots was found up to 6 weeks after differences in matric potential conditions disappeared, possibly either because water repellency inhibited homogeneous rewetting of the organic horizons or because of severe damage to the microbial population. No evidence was found for the release of new, formerly protected substrates by preceding drought. Continuous measurements in 2008 (no manipulation) did not reveal increased CO2 emissions on the TE plots that could compensate for the reduction during the years 2006/2007. Based on our results, we postulate a negative feedback between increased frequency and magnitude of summer droughts and SR in Norway spruce stands.

However, few studies have quantified intra-specific genetic variation in growth response, and the potential for natural and artificial selection to act upon this variation. This study examined intra-specific variation in growth response to elevated CO2 in 29 genotypes of white spruce (Picea glauca), a widely distributed and economically important species of the boreal forest region in North America. Trees were exposed to either ambient (370 μL L-1) or twice-ambient CO2 (740 μL L-1). The opportunity for selection (i.e. the relative variation in fitness) was determined at low and high CO2 levels with size as a measure of fitness and heritability of this variation determined. There was considerable variation among the genotypes in size and response to elevated CO2. The increase in mass at elevated CO2 ranged from 23% to 108% depending upon genotype. In spite of this variation, the genetic correlation between the two environments approached unity, as genotype variance was much greater than the genotype×CO2 variance. Elevated CO2 had no effect on heritability of the size-related traits we examined, and either had no effect on opportunity for selection, or decreased it. We conclude that selection at elevated atmospheric CO2 is unlikely to increase mean plant size in white spruce beyond that observed for present day populations grown at elevated CO2, despite the substantial genetic variation in CO2 response displayed by this species. © 2008 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","Adaptation; Boreal forest; Carbon sequestration; Genotype×environment interactions; Global change; Picea glauca (Moench (Voss))","Picea glauca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67249117306

The role of magmatic water was explicitly considered. The Notch Peak contact-metamorphic aureole in Utah was used to define the stratigraphy of the model domain and rock compositions. Reactions that were considered include the major isograd-defining reactions that occurred in the Notch Peak aureole. The half-space model domain had the laccolith, 2 km thick at the middle apex. Only 1-phase fluid flow was considered. Results show that the evolution of the fluid flow-field is highly dependent on the pressure (P) boundary condition at the top of the model domain. When P at the top boundary is allowed to increase, P in most of the top half of the domain eventually exceeds die lithostatic pressure plus the assumed tensile strength of rocks of 15 MPa. This boundary condition simulates an unvented flow-system. A more realistic boundary condition, one that simulates a system diat is able to vent to the surface, is when Pat the top boundary is held at a hydrostatic pressure. In dus case, the flow-field is determined largely by pressure gradients between die overpressured magmatic fluid exsolving from the pluton and the lower pressures at the domain boundaries. Fracturing is predicted to occur early after pluton emplacement as the pore fluid is heated and metamorphic reactions produce CO2. Although fracturing and reaction-enhanced porosity and permeability influence die local flow-field, die domain-scale flow-field is controlled by long-distance pressure gradients. The domain-scale flow-field and temperature distribution impose die largest control on the distribution of major mineral assemblages in die metamorphic aureole. Transient changes in permeability due to fracturing and volume changes in the solid matrix that accompany reactions have a smaller control on die distribution of minerals. The simulations predict significant overstepping and coeval progress of metamorphic reactions. Reaction rates range from 5x 10-10 to 10-14 kmol/m2/sec, depending on die actual P-T-XC0 2f conditions and die abundance of die rate-controlling mineral. Throughout die metamorphic aureole, XC02f approaches 1 as CO2 evolved by reactions displaces H2O. High pore pressures prevent magmatic H2O from infiltrating die aureole until pressures drop when reactions are approaching completion. Consequently, only in die inner aureole, which is eventually infiltrated by magmatic H2O, can minerals such as wollastonite and vesuvianite be produced. An integrated H2O flux of 3 ×104 kmol/m2 is required to produce die width of die model wollastonite zone by 20 ky. Because of pressure gradients, CO2 diat is produced in die inner aureole flows outward into colder rocks even before diese rocks are heated. The T-XC02 f padis in outer aureole rocks cut across die H2O-CO 2 solvus, which predicts diat in nature H2O and CO 2 should unmix and behave as two separate fluid phases. The average yearly CO2 flux at die top of die model domain, 2.3 ×10 2 mol/m2/y, is comparable to fluxes of metamorphic carbonic fluids in active geodiermal fields.",,"aureole; boundary condition; calc silicate rock; computer simulation; contact metamorphism; crystallization; emplacement; flow field; fluid flow; hydrostatic pressure; laccolith; matrix; numerical model; P-T conditions; permeability; pluton; pressure drop; pressure gradient; reaction kinetics; reaction rate; North America; United States; Utah",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350629000

A hypothesis was designed to address whether foliar application of triacontanol (TRIA) could enhance the crop productivity as well as crop quality. TRIA is known to be a potent plant growth promoting substance for many agricultural and horticultural crops. The hyacinth bean plants grown in soil containing pots, were sprayed with five concentrations of TRIA (10-0 (Control), 10-8, 10-7, 10-6 and 10-5 M) at 15-day intervals. The plant fresh and dry weights, leaf-area, number and dry weight of nodules per plant, total chlorophyll and carotenoid content, nitrate reductase activity, carbonic anhydrase activity, nodule-nitrogen content, leghemoglobin content and leaf N, P, K and Ca contents were analyzed at 60, 90 and 120 days after sowing (DAS). Net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were measured only at 90 DAS. The protein content plus carbohydrate and tyrosinase activity were analyzed in the seeds. Foliar spray of 10-6 M TRIA significantly stimulated most of the studied attributes. At the highest concentration (10-5 M TRIA), values of all attributes were significantly decreased at all three stages. For example, 10-6 M TRIA increased seed-yield and -protein content by 56.3 and 14.5%, respectively when compared to unsprayed plants.

Using these hopping rates, molecular self-diffusivities for a CH4/CF4 binary mixture through an LTA-type zeolite, as well as those for each single component, are calculated at 300 K. The diffusivities of CF4 are in the order of ca. 10-14 m2/s at 300 K and thus are within an extremely slow molecular diffusion regime.

Although some SCS estimates are available, many of them lack scientific rigor. Several interrelated and site-specific factors ranging from agroecological conditions to system management practices influence the rate and extent of SCS under AFS, so that generalizations tend to become unrealistic. Furthermore, widely and easily adoptable methodologies are not available for estimating the SCS potential under different conditions. In spite of these, there is an increasing demand for developing ""best-bet estimates"" based on the current level of knowledge and experience. This document presents an attempt in that direction. The appraisal validates the conjecture that AFS can contribute to SCS, and presents indicative ranges of SCS under different AFS in the major agroecological regions of the tropics.

Although the current, provisional guidelines for calculating product carbon footprints specify that only the bottom-up approach is to be used for this purpose, this paper presents useful applications of input-output analysis that can improve the reliability of the method considerably, by taking full advantage of the strengths of input-output analysis. To this end, we first estimated the global carbon footprint (GCF) of food and consumables in Japan, using a global link input-output (GLIO) model comprising 804 economic sectors in Japan and 230 foreign countries and regions. By visualizing the GCF on a world map, the global distribution (including Middle East and African countries) of the induced CO2 emissions of each of the Japanese sectors were identified. To investigate the scope for reducing the data collection burden for CF practitioners, GCFs were compared with CFs obtained using a single-region input-output model. This showed that there are certain commodity groups with a CF equating to 70% to over 90% of the corresponding GCF, even if the imported goods used for producing a Japanese domestic product are considered environmentally equivalent to their domestically produced counterparts. Furthermore, it was identified which data should preferably be collected by the bottom-up approach to secure CO2 emissions coverage greater than a certain predefined level and keep data and labour costs at a minimum. © 2009 The International Input-Output Association.","Carbon footprint; Completeness; Embodied carbon intensity; Global model; Input-output analysis; Multiregional model; Product category rules; System boundary","bottom-up approach; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; ecological footprint; emissions trading; environmental economics; guideline; input-output analysis; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949384018

The meteorological data with respect to daily precipitation totals were acquired from 27 meteorological stations of the Hellenic National Meteorological Service, which are uniformly distributed over the country. The dry spells concern consecutive dry days (CDD); the largest number of consecutive days with daily precipitation amount less than 1 mm, within a year. The wet spells concern consecutive wet days (CWD); the largest number of consecutive days with daily precipitation amount more than or equal to 1 mm, within a year, as defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), jointly sponsored by the Commission for Climatology (CCl) of the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) World Climate Data and Monitoring Programme (WCDMP), the Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) Programme of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and the Joint WMO-IOC Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM). As results from the analysis, the spatial distributions of the mean annual CDD and the mean annual CWD along with their trends, within the examined period, are presented. The findings indicate that CDD obtain maxima in the Cyclades Islands and the southeastern Aegean Sea, while minima are found in the northwestern Greece. On the contrary, the longest CWD are observed in western Greece and western part of Crete Island and the shortest in the eastern continental Greece and in the majority of the Aegean Sea. On an annual basis, the temporal variability of CWD shows statistically significant (confidence level of 95%) negative trends, mainly in the western region of Greece, while insignificant positive trends for CDD appear almost all over the country with emphasis in the southeastern region. Finally, in order to interpret the drier and wetter periods within the examined period, the 850 hPa and the 500 hPa geopotential height (m) composites of the anomalies from 1958-1996 climatological normal (clino), are analysed using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The procedure for calculating multiple small angle Coulomb scattering of the residues in the target has been modified. Target-backing and residue charge-reset foils, which are often used in heavy ion-induced complete fusion reactions, are included in the code. New version program summary: Program title: TERS v2.0. Catalogue identifier: AEBD_v2_0. Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEBD_v2_0.html. Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland. Licensing provisions: Standard CPC licence, http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html. No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 7309. No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 1 219 555. Distribution format: tar.gz. Programming language: C. Computer: The code has been developed and tested on a PC with Intel Pentium IV processor. Operating system: Linux. RAM: About 8 Mbytes. Classification: 17.7. External routines: pgplot graphics subroutine library [1] should be installed in the system for generating residue trajectory plots. (The library is included in the CPC distribution file.). Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEBD_v1_0. Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 179 (2008) 492. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes. Nature of problem: Recoil separators are employed to select and identify nuclei of interest, produced in a nuclear reaction, rejecting unreacted beam and other undesired reaction products. It is important to know what fraction of the selected nuclei, leaving the target, reach the detection system. This information is crucial for determining absolute cross section of the studied reaction. Solution method: Interaction of projectiles with target nuclei is treated event by event, semimicro-scopically. Position and angle (with respect to beam direction), energy and charge state of the reaction products are calculated by Monte Carlo method. Trajectory of each nuclei inside the separator is then calculated by ion optical transfer matrix method. Ratio of the number of trajectories completing their journey up to the detection system to the total number of trajectories is a direct measure of absolute transmission efficiency of the separator. Reasons for new version: The method for calculating mean squared scattering angle (〈 θ{symbol} 〉2), used earlier [2], was found to be inadequate particularly for low energy heavy residues. Energy loss of beam in the target-backing foil and energy loss of residues in the charge-reset foil (wherever used) needed to be taken into account for better matching of simulated residue parameters with measurements. Summary of revisions:1.A new method [3] for calculating multiple small angle Coulomb scattering of residues in the target has been adopted. The change is incorporated in function Weibull() in the program ters_pti2.c.2.Isotopically enriched targets are made on a thin backing foil (usually made of carbon) quite often. Energy loss of beam in the backing foil (assuming beam is made to pass through the backing foil first, which is the usual practice) need to be taken into account. This calls for minor changes in the input file ters_pti2.inp. Following is the modified list of input parameters in this file with explanation.Zp, Ap, Zt, At -Atomic no. and mass no. of projectile and target.Ep -Projectile energy [MeV] in laboratory.BeamSpot, TarThick -Dia. [mm] of (circular) beam spot and target thickness [mg/cm2].Zback, Aback, BackThick -Atomic no. and mass no. of the backing material and thickness [mg/cm2] of the backing foil.Qvalue, ILPM -Q value [MeV] for CN formation and inverse level density parameter.AlphaNo, ProtonNo, NeutronNo -Numbers of evaporated alphas, protons and neutrons.Salpha[c] -Alpha separation energies [MeV], to be left blank if no alpha evaporation.Sproton[c] -Proton separation energies [MeV], to be left blank if no proton evaporation.Sneutron[c] -Neutron separation energies [MeV], to be left blank if no neutron evaporation.NEVENT -Number of events i.e. residues to be considered by the program (maximum 5 × 105). The parameters in input line number 4 are new in this version. If the target is backed by a carbon foil of thickness 125 μg/cm2, the input line would look like ""6 12 0.125"". If the target is self-supporting, i.e. there is no backing, value of the last parameter (thickness) should be zero. However, the first two parameters must not be left blank or have 0 values. The input line would look like ""6 12 0.0"" in this case.3.A new function ThinFoil() has been introduced in the program ters_tra2.c. A thin foil can be inserted anywhere along the path of the residues by calling this function using the following syntax: Status = ThinFoil(argument list); if (Status == 0) continue; The function is particularly useful to place a residue charge-reset foil (usually made of carbon) after the target and is described in Table 1.{A table is presented}4.There is a minor change in the input file ters_tra2.inp. Following is the modified list of input parameters in this file with explanation.Z0, A0 -Residue atomic number and mass number.E0, A00, q0 -Energy [MeV], mass no. and charge state of the reference particle.NEVENT -Number of events i.e. trajectories to be calculated.5.Program/input files which have been modified in this version are suffixed by ""2"" in their names (before the extension), e.g., ters_pti.c has been renamed ters_pti2.c. The complete list of files included in the distributed code can be viewed in the readme file. Restrictions: The present version of the code is applicable to complete fusion reactions only. Calculation of transmission efficiency has been illustrated with a specific recoil separator, viz. the Heavy Ion Reaction Analyzer (HIRA) [4,5], at IUAC. One has to make necessary changes in the code, while performing calculations for other recoil separators. Also, atomic number of the residual nucleus should not exceed 92, as the method used for calculating stopping power of ions [6] is valid for Z ≤ 92. The code can perform energy loss calculation only in elemental targets and foils (i.e. compounds or alloys are not supported). Further, number of events (NEVENT) in ters_tra2.inp should not exceed the same in ters_pti2.inp. Running time: From few seconds to several minutes depending on the reaction, number of events and separator layout. References: [1] http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/.[2] G.R. Lynch, O.I.

In this paper we conduct a series of numerical simulation experiments to investigate the quantitative significance of climate response uncertainty for economic assessments of climate change. First we characterize climate uncertainty by constructing two probability density functions-a Bayesian model-averaged and a Bayesian updated version-based on a combination of uncertainty ranges for climate sensitivity reported in the scientific literature. Next we estimate the willingness to pay of a representative agent for a range of emissions reduction policies using two simplified economic models. Our results illustrate the potential for large risk premiums in benefits estimates as suggested by the recent theoretical work on climate response uncertainty, and they show that the size and even the sign of the risk premium may depend crucially on how the posterior distribution describing the overall climate sensitivity uncertainty is constructed and on the specific shape of the damage function. © United States Environmental Protection Agency 2009.","Catastrophe; Climate change; Climate sensitivity; Uncertainty","Bayesian networks; Climate models; Economics; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Probability density function; Uncertainty analysis; Atmospheric greenhouse; Catastrophe; Climate change policies; Climate sensitivity; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Numerical simulation experiment; Posterior distributions; Uncertainty; Climate change; Bayesian analysis; catastrophe theory; climate change; environmental economics; environmental protection; greenhouse gas; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76149142167

Firstly, the question of who draws the boundaries around what is to be governed, what is not, and by whom, where each of the contributions highlight conflicts over which projects and sectors should be part of the CDM and which actors should be charged with their management. Secondly, how we define and what we mean by governance, where I argue for a broader notion of governance that adequately captures the range of governing functions exercised by the plurality of state and non-state actors in this domain. Thirdly, each of themes relates to the question of power: power to define what is and is not clean and sustainable development; the power that determines which countries are able to steer CDM investments toward sectors aligned with their overall development priorities, and the combinations of public and private power that demonstrate as well as explain the varieties of carbon governance documented in this special issue. My argument is that the observed diversity of carbon governance reflects differences in governance in general in those countries. It is impossible politically, and unhelpful conceptually, to attempt to understand carbon and clean development governance without reference to the broader political-economic context in which it is embedded and which it seeks to transform. But whether it is in the area of energy, waste, or forests, CDM governance is incorporated within and predated by political structures, institutions, conflicts, and interests that shape the amenability of a sector and country to pressures toward convergence, standardization, and universalization. © SAGE Publications 2009.","CDM; Clean development; Governance; Power","clean development mechanism; governance approach; policy making; standardization; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70749131137

Characterization of fresh, reduced samples, by H2 chemisorption, TEM and FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed of CO and NO, indicated that the promoter is not covering the metal surface. Under dry conditions the rate of N2 formation is lowered on the vanadia-modified alumina but the production of N2O was not altered. As a result the selectivity to N2 decreased markedly on Pd-VOx/γ-Al2O3. FTIR and XPS characterization of used catalysts demonstrated that the negative effect of VOx on N2 formation is due to an oxidized state of Pd that develops under reaction conditions. FTIR analysis of the gas phase products showed that both catalysts produce small amounts of gas phase HNCO and NH3 with the participation of surface -OH groups. FTIR spectra of the catalysts surface under reaction conditions demonstrate the presence of isocyanate (-NCO) and hydrogen containing compounds derived from HNCO. These stable species are not responsible for the production of N2O, but contribute to deactivation of the catalyst. They are rapidly eliminated upon water injection with a brief high production of NH3. Under steady state conditions water increases the CO conversion and the selectivity to N2 and NH3 on Pd/γ-Al2O3. The most notable effect is a marked reduction in N2O production. On Pd-VOx/γ-Al2O3 water increases the conversion of both NO and CO, as well as the NH3 formation. The selectivity to N2 is not altered and it is lower than the ones of NH3 and N2O. On both catalysts the NH3 formation increases due to the rapid hydrolysis of -NCO and HNCO. The H2 participation in the process of NH3 formation is excluded due to the very low activity of Pd/γ-Al2O3 and Pd-VOx/γ-Al2O3 for the water-gas shift reaction. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This diversity of wetland types and habitats provides for diverse biotic communities, many of which are specific to individual wetlands. This paper explores the prospects for southern Australian wetlands under modified water regime and salinity induced by climatic changes. Extended droughts predicted as a consequence of climate change (lower rainfall and higher temperatures) combined with human-induced changes to the natural hydrological regime will lead to reductions in the amount of water available for environmental and anthropogenic uses. Reduced runoff and river flows may cause the loss of some temporary wetland types that will no longer hold water long enough to support hydric communities. Species distributions will shift and species extinctions may result particularly across fragmented or vulnerable landscapes. Accumulation of salts in wetlands shift species-rich freshwater communities to species-poor salt tolerant communities. Wetlands will differ in ecological response to these changes as the salinity and drying history of each wetland will determine its resilience: in the short term some freshwater communities may recover but they are unlikely to survive and reproduce under long term increased salinity and altered hydrology. In the long term such salinized wetlands with altered hydrology will need to be colonized by salt tolerant species adapted for the new hydrological conditions if they are to persist as functional wetlands. As the landscape becomes more developed, to accommodate the need for water in a warmer drying climate, increasing human intervention will result in a net loss of wetlands and wetland diversity. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.",,"Australia; Biotic community; Climatic changes; Drying history; Ecological response; Freshwater community; Higher temperatures; Human intervention; Hydrological condition; Hydrological regime; Long term; Net loss; River flow; Salt tolerant; Shift-and; Short term; Species distributions; Species extinction; Water regime; Climate change; Dewatering; Drought; Hydrology; Salinity measurement; Water; Wetlands; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; climate change; habitat loss; landscape structure; river flow; water availability; wetland; Australasia; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349989275

Here we report measurements of sediment accretion and associated carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus accumulation as sedimentation over feldspar marker horizons placed on floodplains of the non-tidal, freshwater Coastal Plain reaches of seven rivers in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, USA. We then scale these accumulation rates to the entire extent of non-tidal floodplain in the Coastal Plain of each river, defined as riparian area extending from the Fall Line to the upper limit of tidal influence, and compare them to annual river loads. Floodplains accumulated a very large amount of material compared to their annual river loads of sediment (median among rivers = 119%), nitrogen (24%), and phosphorus (59%). Systems with larger floodplain areas and longer floodplain inundation retained greater proportions of riverine loads of nitrogen and phosphorus, but systems with larger riverine loads retained a smaller proportion of that load on floodplains. Although the source and long-term fate of deposited sediment and associated nutrients are uncertain, these fluxes represent the interception of large amounts of material that otherwise could have been exported downstream.

Methods. For this purpose we wrote the code CIGALE (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) that uses model spectra composed of the Maraston (or PEGASE) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based on a modified Calzetti law, spectral line templates, the Dale &amp; Helou dust emission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured AGN. Depending on the input redshifts, filter fluxes were computed for the model set and compared to the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. CIGALE was tested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from SINGS. The reliability of the different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting expectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model grid. Moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometric data on the code results was estimated. Results.For up to 17 filters with effective wavelengths between 0.15 and 160 μm, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effective age of the stellar population at 4000 Å, bolometric luminosity, luminosity absorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-UV. Details of the star formation history (excepting the burst fraction) and the shape of the attenuation curve are difficult to investigate with the available broad-band UV and optical photometric data. A study of the mutual relations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of star formation activity on morphology in the local Universe and indicates a significant drop in this activity at about 1011 M towards higher total stellar masses. The dustiest galaxies in the SINGS sample are present in the same mass range. On the other hand, the far-UV attenuation of our sample galaxies does not appear to show a significant dependence on star formation activity. © 2009 ESO.","Galaxies: fundamental parameters; Galaxies: ISM; Galaxies: stellar content; Infrared: galaxies; Methods: data analysis; Ultraviolet: galaxies","Galaxies: fundamental parameters; Galaxies: ISM; Infrared: galaxies; Methods:data analysis; Ultraviolet: galaxies; Data handling; Dust; Luminance; Photometry; Spectroscopy; Galaxies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70849092918

One large-scale event has been reported where kelp forests along the Norwegian and Russian coast were grazed by sea urchins during the early 1970s. The barren ground area has persisted since. Different theories to explain the grazing event have been presented. This paper seeks to sort and summarize earlier published papers and national reports and to critically examine the most important theories presented to explain the grazing event. The conclusion is that the reason for the event is unknown and it is too late to find causes 40 years after it took place. However, new data and new geographical analysis tools provide insight into the extent and consequences of this dramatic event, and show re-vegetation of kelp forests in the southernmost area. Emphasis in future studies should be given to understand the reasons for shifts between the two ecosystem states and take advantage of the ongoing shift. Such basic ecological knowledge could provide an important basis for better understanding the system and further, to understand the extent to which other observed large-scale changes (e.g. climatic changes, fish stock reductions) affect kelp forest-sea urchin interaction. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Grazing; Kelp forest; Laminaria hyperborea; NE Atlantic; Sea urchin; Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis","brown alga; coastal zone; echinoderm; geographical characteristics; grazing; kelp forest; revegetation; seaweed; theoretical study; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Echinoidea; Laminaria; Laminaria hyperborea; Strongylocentrotus; Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77649104911

However, the strong economic development during the last decades in China has caused a dramatic increase in the number of motorized vehicles, which calls for a quick development of RWIS and its application/services to safeguard the rapid development and to improve the safety of transportation. This study focuses on application of a winter index in China to quantify the need of a RWIS in different parts of China. The index is based on a concept related to various relevant weather parameters including ice, fog, snow, and wind. Its use is flexible in the sense that different types of inputs are possible, which is illustrated by a general view of the situation in China using climatological data and a case study using detailed meteorological data in Northern China. The results reveal that there are varying needs for RWIS in large parts of China. Regions with a great need for RWIS lie in the humid middle and northeastern parts of China. Some regions, however, may have a limited need for fully equipped RWIS stations. Such areas are the unpopulated areas in northwest or the dry regions in north. The results indicate that the introduced method provides useful information for China, both in the general view and in the case study. © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society.","China; Road weather information system (RWIS); Winter index","Climatological data; Dry region; Economic development; International perspective; Large parts; Meteorological data; Northern China; Rapid development; Road weather information system; Weather index; Weather parameters; Automobile parts and equipment; Information systems; Research; Roads and streets; Snow and ice removal; climatology; information system; weather forecasting; winter; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449091666

The generation of AMD is a complex, dynamic process that proceeds via multiple reaction pathways. The role of natural consortia of microbes in AMD generation, however, has received very little attention despite their widespread occurrence in mining environments. Through a combination of geochemical experimentation and modeling, scanning transmission X-ray microscopy, and fluorescent in situ hybridization, we show a novel interdependent metabolic arrangement of two ubiquitous and abundant AMD bacteria: chemoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing Acidithiobacillus sp. and heterotrophic Acidiphilium sp. Highly reminiscent of anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM) consortia, these bacteria are spatially segregated within a planktonic macrostructure of extracellular polymeric substance in which they syntrophically couple sulfur oxidation and reduction reactions in a mutually beneficial arrangement that regenerates their respective sulfur substrates. As discussed here, the geochemical impacts of microbial metabolism are linked to the consortial organization and development of the pod structure, which affects cell-cell interactions and interactions with the surrounding geochemical microenvironment. If these pods are widespread in mine waters, echoing thenowwidespread discovery of AOM consortia, then AMD-driven CO2 atmospheric fluxes from H2SO4 carbonate weathering could be reduced by as much as 26 TgC/yr. This novel sulfur consortial discovery indicates that organized metabolically linked microbial partnerships are likely widespread and more significant in global elemental cycling than previously considered. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Acid mine drainage; Acidiphilium; Acidithiobacillus; Anaerobic methane oxidations; Atmospheric fluxes; Biogeochemical cycle; Carbonate weathering; Cell-cell interaction; Dynamic process; Extra-cellular polymeric substances; Fluorescent in situ hybridization; Macrostructures; Microbial metabolism; Microbial oxidation; Microenvironments; Mine waters; Mining environments; Mining waste material; Multiple reaction pathways; Scanning transmission x ray microscopy; Sulfur oxidation; Bacteria; Bacteriology; Biogeochemistry; Enzyme activity; Groundwater; Metabolism; Methane; Mining; Oxidation; Sulfur; carbonic acid; methane; sulfur; acid mine drainage; atmospheric chemistry; biogeochemical cycle; metabolism; microbial activity; oxidation; polymer; reduction; X-ray spectroscopy; acid mine drainage; Acidiphilium; Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans; anaerobic metabolism; article; biogeochemical cycle; biogeochemistry; cell interaction; chemical environment; fluorescence in situ hybridization; microbial community; microbial metabolism; microenvironment; microorganism; nonhuman; reaction analysis; scanning transmission electron microscopy; sulfur cycle; sulfur oxidizing bacterium; Acidiphilium; Acidithiobacillus; Biodegradation, Environmental; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Models, Biological; Oxidation-Reduction; Plankton; Sulfur; Acidiphilium sp.; Acidithiobacillus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72249104480

Some of these strategies include sorbent injection and chemical additives designed to increase mercury capture efficiency in particulate control devices. These strategies have the potential to impact the fate of other inorganic hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), which typically include As, Be, Cd, Cr, Co, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, and Sb. To evaluate this impact, flue gas samples using EPA Method 29, along with representative coal and ash samples, were collected during recent pilot-scale and field test projects that were evaluating Hg control technologies. These test programs included a range of fuel types with varying trace element concentrations, along with different combustion systems and particulate control devices. The results show that the majority of the trace element HAPs are associated with the particulate matter in the flue gas, except for Se.

A means of optimizing the microgrid needs to be developed. Moreover, microgrids that use proton exchange membrane-type fuel cells (PEM-FCs) may significantly reduce the environmental impact when compared with traditional power plants. The amount of power supplied to the grid divided by the heating value of the fuel is defined as the system generation efficiency. The authors find that when a set of PEM-FCs and a natural gas reformer are connected to the microgrid in an urban area, the annual generation efficiency of the system slightly exceeds 20%. When a PEM-FC follows the electricity demand pattern of a house, it operates at a partial load most of the time, resulting in a low efficiency of the microgrid. A method of improving the generation efficiency of a fuel cell microgrid is proposed, where a supply system of power and heat with a high energy efficiency are constructed. In this paper, a method of installing two or more microgrids is proposed (known as the partition cooperation system). The grids can be connected in an urban area to maximize generation efficiency. Numerical analysis shows that the system proposed in this paper (which has an annual generation efficiency of 24.6-27.6%) has a higher generation efficiency than conventional PEM-FC systems (central generating systems have annual generation efficiencies of 20.6-24.8%).

Carbon based materials have been the focus of many studies of their electron emission properties from fundamental and applied points of view. This is particularly owing to strong atomic bonding in graphite and diamond which provides chemical inertness and sustainability of carbon cathodes under the action of residual gas ion bombardment. Recently great emphasis has been attracted to nanostructured forms of carbons. The field (or cold) emission characteristics of carbon nanotubes are commonly attributed to geometric effects, and other more complex effects associated with field penetration, electronic structure and stationary states. Nanocrystalline diamond films have displayed similar field emission characteristics at relatively low applied fields, and this effect has been assigned to the graphitic carbon inclusions. The efficient field enhancement from these nanodiamond films has been attributed to both morphological effects and grain boundary electrical conductivity. In this paper we review basic theoretical approaches, our computer simulations and recent experimental studies of the electron emission from nanocarbon materials.

These policy judgments range from the seemingly trivial, such as the size of holes in swiss cheese, to matters of life-and-death importance, such as how to limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. According to the statute books, over 1100 Senate-confirmed presidential appointees are supposed to run these agencies and direct these policy decisions, comprising a small but critically important component of a federal workforce of over 2.5 million employees. Yet filling these top-level positions in the federal administrative state is cumbersome, inconsistent, and at times controversial. New administrations are often quick to select the cabinet but take much longer to staff the next few layers. Appointee tenure is short, leading to many new openings a year or two later. Then agency officials flee government service near the end of an administration. Vacancies, particularly if frequent and lengthy, may have detrimental consequences for the modern administrative state. They contribute to agency inaction, foster confusion among nonpolitical employees, and undermine agency legitimacy. More surprising is that vacancies also can have beneficial repercussions for agency performance. Using new data from the Office of Personnel Management (""OPM""), this Article provides a systematic study of executive agency vacancies from President Carter to President George W. Bush. By one measure, Senate-confirmed positions were empty (or filled by acting officials), on average, one-quarter of the time over these administrations. These extensive vacancies have potentially far-reaching implications for constitutional and administrative law. Participants in debates over the unitary theory of the executive might want to spend less time analyzing the legitimacy of restrictions on the president's removal power and pay more attention to the absence of presidential appointments at the front end of the process. Commentators interested in congressional delegation of authority to agencies might consider how agency staffing affects adherence to congressional priorities and may limit broad delegations of authority. And scholars and courts interested in agency deference might contemplate how underlying theories of expertise and political accountability could incorporate empirical realities of political leadership in the federal bureaucracy. Changing legal doctrine may provide one mechanism for improving the staffing of executive agencies. Policy reforms outside of the courts targeted at reducing the number and length of vacancies - including appointee commitments to serve for two to four years, better training for new officials, and advance personnel planning by the White House - will, however, likely be more effective.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73949133605

O3 and particulate matter (PM) levels were estimated using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system and light extinction values were calculated from modeled PM concentrations. First, the base case was established using the emission projections for the year 2009. Then, in each model run, SO2, primary carbon (PC), NH3, NOx or VOC emissions from a particular source category in a certain geographic area were reduced by 30% and the responses were determined by calculating the difference between the results of the reduced emission case and the base case. The sensitivity of summertime O3 to VOC emissions is small in the Southeast and ground-level NOx controls are generally more beneficial than elevated NOx controls (per unit mass of emissions reduced). SO2 emission reduction is the most beneficial control strategy in reducing summertime PM2.5 levels and improving visibility in the Southeast and electric generating utilities are the single largest source of SO2. Controlling PC emissions can be very effective locally, especially in winter. Reducing NH3 emissions is an effective strategy to reduce wintertime ammonium nitrate (NO3NH4) levels and improve visibility; NOx emissions reductions are not as effective. The results presented here will help the development of specific emission control strategies for future attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards in the region. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of the present work was to analyze the acoustic forcing effect on the flow field, the reaction zone, and NOx emission, and to study the mechanisms of NOx reduction and flame stabilization. To analyze of the flow field, a PIV method was used that incorporated two Nd-YAG lasers and a CCD camera. The reaction zone was visualized by taking OH* chemiluminescence images with a 307.1 ± 5 nm narrow band pass filter and an ICCD camera. A flow condition was carefully selected at uF = 150, 200, 250 m/s and uA = 12, 16, 20 m/s, which was sustainable for acoustic excitation in a lifted flame region. The frequency was swept from 150 to 1000 Hz in 5 Hz steps. From the measurements of the flow field, the reaction zone, and NOx emission, we concluded that NOx emission was reduced and minimized at the resonance frequency. The vortex that was generated by acoustic forcing promoted air entrainment and enhanced the fuel-air mixing rate. This premixing effect resulted in a lower flame temperature, and thus lower NOx emissions. In addition, the liftoff height periodically fluctuated due to the stretch effect as the vortex interacted with the flame base. © 2009 Professor T.

However, it is the snowstorms that deposit heavy snowfall in a relatively short period of time that can cause major inconveniences and even life-threatening situations for the residents and visitors to the region. Some of these snowstorms are so extreme as to become legendary, and with increased population in this region a synoptic climatology of these extreme snowstorms can be a useful tool for assessing snowfall potential by operational forecasters. Additionally, the hydrological and climatological implications of extreme Sierra Nevada snowfalls are important for state and local resource- and emergency-planning purposes. A climatology of these snowstorms will be presented. The period of study will include the snowfall seasons (October-May) 1949/50 through 2004/05. A total of 542 snowstorms occurred during these 56 snowfall seasons. These snowstorms were analyzed to determine any common synoptic features. The most intense snowstorms in the highest decile of snowfall totals were analyzed in more detail in order to determine the parameters associated with these strongest snowstorms. Upper-level synoptic and thermodynamic characteristics associated with each snowstorm were then diagnosed to determine what common synoptic hydrodynamic and thermodynamic parameters the snowstorms share. Synoptic patterns were studied using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) model reanalysis data. Wind speeds at 200 hPa, and height anomalies at 500 hPa, were analyzed for each snowstorm from 3 days prior to the start of snowfall and continuing through the end of the storm. Anomalies and the transport of precipitable water were studied in order to determine the relative amount of moisture that was available to each snowstorm. A conceptual model for forecasting the strongest snowstorms was developed.

The resulting donor-acceptor nanohybrid has been characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman and IR spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, elemental analysis, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. The weight of the porphyrins attached to the cup-shaped nanocarbons was determined as 20% by TGA and elemental analysis. The UV/Vis absorption spectrum of CNC-(H2P)n in DMF agrees well with that obtained by the superposition of reference porphyrin (ref-H2P) and cupshaped nanocarbons. The photoexcitation of the CNC-(H2P)n nanohybrid results in formation of the charge-separated (CS) state to attain the longest CS lifetime (0.64 ± 0.01 ms) ever reported for donor-acceptor nanohybrids, which may arise from efficient electron migration following the charge séparation.

Previous studies on the effect of temperature on the microbial oxidation of ferrous-iron were limited to a narrow range of temperatures (30-40 °C) near optimum conditions and mostly to Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. The kinetics of ferrous-iron oxidation by Leptospirillum ferriphilum were studied in continuous culture. In this paper we focus on the effect of temperature (18-45 °C) on these kinetics. The study was based on the assumption that the effect of temperature can be studied independently of other, equally important factors such as pH, dissolved salts, etc. and independent of the reactor context. The experimental data were correlated using both, a simplified ferric-iron inhibitory model and the Pirt Equation. The results showed that the maximum specific ferrous-iron oxidation rate, qF e2 +max increased with increasing temperature to a maximum at 42 °C. This trend can be described adequately by the Arrhenius Equation with an activation energy, Ea of 34.46 kJ mol-1 and frequency factor, K0 of 1.05 × 107 mmol Fe2+(mmolC)-1 h-1. An increase in temperature slightly reduces the steady state carbon biomass in the reactor, while the apparent affinity constant, K′F e2 + increases. The investigation further suggests that at low temperature (18 °C) and beyond the maximum temperature (42 °C), the culture cannot be sustained in a continuous mode. The maximum biomass yield followed a linear decline with increasing temperature, while cell maintenance on ferrous-iron followed a quadratic trend, although the small values indicates that it is not significant, as would be expected in continuous culture. The results indicate that L. ferriphilum is likely to perform optimally, at warm temperatures (25-42 °C) in heap bioleach operations before being taken over by thermophiles at higher temperatures. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Reef-lagoon sediments, sampled from across the expansive (~ 8 km wide) carbonate-dominated windward platform, principally comprise poorly sorted medium- to coarse-grained bioclastic sands, composed of a low diversity of grain constituents - predominantly non-geniculate coralline algal bioclasts. Despite a marked homogeneity in sediment compositional and grain size properties, eight distinct sediment textural groups can be identified that form a heterogeneous mosaic across the contemporary reef-lagoon system. Only along the narrow outer platform margins (reef crest, sand apron and outermost lagoon environments) do we observe consistent (predictable) transitions in sediment textural groups, where physical processes are the primary drivers of selective sediment transport and sorting. In contrast, across the main expanse of the lagoon, the sediment substrates are characterised by an irregular mosaic of texturally-defined sediment groups - formed primarily as a function of sediment bio-retexturing. The burrowing activities of alpheid and callianassid shrimps are particularly important in this respect and impart a distinctly unique textural fabric to the upper sediment horizons in the environments in which the respective organisms occur. The consequence of this is that, at the platform system scale, individual, texturally-defined sediment groups are relatively poor indicators of prevailing hydrodynamic regimes or of local sediment production, reflecting more the biological action of organisms inhabiting the substrate. This has important implications for understanding the development of carbonate sediment fabrics in the context of palaeoenvironmental reconstructions and for interpreting a key diagnostic criteria of carbonate microfacies. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Alpheid; Bioturbation; Callianassa; Carbonate sediments; Microfacies","bioturbation; burrowing; carbonate platform; diagenesis; microfacies; texture; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean islands; Mascarene Islands; Rodriguez Island; algae; Alpheidae; Callianassa; Callianassidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67651165009

Selecting vehicles with the lowest lifetime cost is complicated by the fact that future prices are uncertain, just as selecting securities for an investment portfolio is complicated by the fact that future returns are uncertain. A quadratic program is developed based on modern portfolio theory, with the objective of minimizing the expected lifetime cost of the ""vehicle portfolio"". Constraints limit greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the variance of the cost. A case study is performed for light-duty passenger vehicles in the United States, drawing emissions and usage data from the US Environmental Protection Agency's MOVES and Department of Energy's GREET models, among other sources. Four vehicle technologies are considered: conventional gasoline, conventional diesel, grid-independent (non-plug-in) gasoline-electric hybrid, and flex fuel using E85. Results indicate that much of the uncertainty surrounding cost stems from fuel price fluctuations, and that fuel efficient vehicles can lower cost variance. Hybrids exhibit the lowest cost variances of the technologies considered, making them an arguably financially conservative choice. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Knowledge about the implications of heat exposure to human health is growing, with excess mortality and illness occurring during hot weather in diverse regions. Certain groups, including the elderly, the urban poor, and those with chronic health conditions, are at higher risk. Preventive actions include: establishing heat wave warning systems; making cool environments available (through air conditioning or other means); public education; planting trees and other vegetation; and modifying the built environment to provide proper ventilation and use materials and colors that reduce heat build-up and optimize thermal comfort. However, to inspire local prevention activities, easily understood information about the strategies' benefits needs to be incorporated into decision tools. Integrating heat health information into a comprehensive adaptation planning process can alert local decision-makers to extreme heat risks and provide information necessary to choose strategies that yield the largest health improvements and cost savings. Tools to enable this include web-based programs that illustrate effective methods for including heat health in comprehensive local-level adaptation planning; calculate costs and benefits of several activities; maps showing zones of high potential heat exposure and vulnerable populations in a local area; and public awareness materials and training for implementing preventive activities. A new computer-based decision tool will enable local estimates of heat-related health effects and potential savings from implementing a range of prevention strategies. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Site preference was used to evaluate the importance of denitrification (including nitrifier denitrification) in N2O production. Average flux-weighted SP values for each field ranged between 2.9 and 14.6‰ and, on the basis of SP values for N 2O production from denitrification (0‰) and collectively for nitrification and fungal denitrification (37‰ these values indicate that between 61 and 92% of N2O originated from denitrification. Reduction of N2O ranged from undetectable to as much as 50% of production; and because reduction increases SP, our results underestimate the percentage of N2O from bacterial denitrification.

Its consequences on plant terpenes are however unknown. Terpene emissions of both Rosmarinus officinalis (a terpene-storing species) and Quercus coccifera (a non-storing species) and terpene content of the former, were studied after a middle-term exposure to compost at intermediate (50 t ha-1: D50) and high (100 t ha-1: D100) compost rates, in a seven-year-old post-fire shrubland ecosystem. Some chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (Fv/Fm, ETR, ΦPSII), soil and plant enrichment in phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) were monitored simultaneously in amended and non-amended plots in order to establish what factors were responsible for possible compost effect on terpenes. Compost affected all studied parameters with the exception of Fv/Fm and terpene content. For both species, mono- and sesquiterpene basal emissions were intensified solely under D50 plots. On the contrary leaf P, leaf N levels reached in D50 were partly responsible of terpene changes, suggesting that optimal N conditions occurred therein. N also affected ETR and ΦPSII which were, in turn, robustly correlated to terpene emissions. These results imply that emissions of terpene-storing and non-storing species were under nitrogen and chlorophyll fluorescence control, and that a correct management of compost rates applied on soil may modify terpene emission rate of plants, which in turn has consequences in air quality and plant defense mechanisms. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The VOCs initially measured were formaldehyde, toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene, followed by the subsequent inclusion of styrene and acetaldehyde. The survey in 2000 revealed that the indoor concentrations of formaldehyde and toluene exceeded the guideline values established by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan in more than 27% and 12% of houses surveyed, respectively. This rapidly led to the development of a variety of countermeasures for improving the indoor air environment, such as the amendment of the Building Standard Law (BSL) to a performance-based regulation and the enactment of the Housing Quality Assurance Act, which provides a housing performance indication system. This study presents the changes in the state of indoor air pollution (including the mitigation of indoor air pollution by VOCs as their concentrations decreased) on a nationwide basis in all the types of building structures during the period from 2000 to 2005, when the regulatory measures mentioned above were instituted, and discusses factors associated with these changes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The design of optimal energy resource mixes in climate change mitigation actions is a challenge faced in many places. This optimisation may be implemented according to economic objectives or with a focus on techno-operational aims and within these two main groupings, several different criteria may potentially be applied to the design process. In this article, a series of optimisation criteria are reviewed and subsequently applied to an energy system model of Western Denmark in an analysis of how to use heat pumps for the integration of wind power. The analyses demonstrate that the fact whether the system in question is modelled as operated in island mode or not has a large impact on the definition of the optimal wind power level. If energy savings and CO2 emission reductions beyond the system boundary are not included in the analysis, then it is either not feasible to expand wind power to a high degree or it is conversely more feasible to install relocation technologies that can utilise any excess production. The analyses also demonstrate that different optimisation criteria render different optimal designs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Plant-soil interactions play a central role in the biogeochemical carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and hydrological cycles. In the context of global environmental change, they are important both in modulating the impact of climate change and in regulating the feedback of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O) to the climate system. 2. Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) represent the most advanced tools available to predict the impacts of global change on terrestrial ecosystem functions and to examine their feedbacks to climate change. The accurate representation of plant-soil interactions in these models is crucial to improving predictions of the effects of climate change on a global scale. 3. In this paper, we describe the general structure of DGVMs that use plant functional types (PFTs) classifications as a means to integrate plant-soil interactions and illustrate how models have been developed to improve the simulation of: (a) soil carbon dynamics, (b) nitrogen cycling, (c) drought impacts and (d) vegetation dynamics. For each of these, we discuss some recent advances and identify knowledge gaps. 4. We identify three ongoing challenges, requiring collaboration between the global modelling community and process ecologists. First, the need for a critical evaluation of the representation of plant-soil processes in global models; second, the need to supply and integrate knowledge into global models; third, the testing of global model simulations against large-scale multifactor experiments and data from observatory gradients. 5. Synthesis. This paper reviews how plant-soil interactions are represented in DGVMs that use PFTs and illustrates some model developments. We also identify areas of ecological understanding and experimentation needed to reduce uncertainty in future carbon coupled climate change predictions. © 2009 British Ecological Society.","Carbon; Climate change; DGVM; Feedbacks; GCM; Models; PFT; Plant; Soil","biogeochemical cycle; carbon cycle; climate change; general circulation model; global change; greenhouse gas; hydrological cycle; terrestrial ecosystem; vegetation dynamics; vegetation structure",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68849093435

During acoustic surveys, the methane bubbles can be mistaken as fish. In the stratified Lake Kinneret, the densities and target-strength (TS) values of acoustic targets were measured with a 120-kHz, dual-beam echosounder at night, when the fish schools were dispersed and single targets could be detected. The density and TS of methane bubbles were estimated in the anoxic hypolimnion, where there were no fish. A discretebubble model was applied in combination with a TS vs. methane bubble-size relationship to estimate the methane bubble TS at different depths. This information was used to quantify the densities of methane bubbles and fish, and the fish TS in the epilimnion where both types of target were found. During periods of rapid decrease in water level, methane bubbles could be the principal acoustic targets in the epilimnion, and their TS strongly overlapped that of fish. In some strata, they contributed up to 90-95% of all targets. The amount of methane bubbles in the water column depends on the type of sediment, bottom depth, and the history of sediment degassing. Their presence could be a serious obstacle to the accurate assessment of fish abundance in lakes and reservoirs with varying water levels, where intensive gas emission is a common feature. For such situations, backscattering by methane bubbles must be taken into account to avoid the erroneous quantification of fish abundance. © United States Government, NOAA/NMFS/AFSC 2009.","Acoustic survey; Fish; Lake Kinneret; Methane bubbles; Quantification; Separation; Target strength",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952953410

To avoid generalising explanations with regard to land-use change, interactions between proximate causes and underlying driving forces adopted from a meta-analysis model are explored through 23 in-depth interviews. This was done through collaborative work with farmers in northern Shaanxi Province and focused on the land-use situation between 1982 and 2005. The result reveals five categories of land-use change. The interaction pattern is broken down into eight proximate causes and four underlying driving forces. The dominant underlying driving forces are economic forces with short time horizons arising partly from compensation through policies, changes in crop demand from an expanding nearby market and a need for cash because of an increasingly cash-based lifestyle. The direct proximate causes were vividly described by the farmers as tools or means by which they are adapting to more abstract and indirect factors. These factors were identified as underlying driving forces. Hence, the knowledge and ability to separate the interaction into proximate causes and underlying driving forces are crucial in policy-making. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Climate variability; Drivers for change; Globalisation; Interviews; Land-use change; Shaanxi Province","climate variation; globalization; land use change; land use planning; meta-analysis; policy making; questionnaire survey; smallholder; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Loess Plateau; Shaanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449642649

Air samples taken at inlets and outlets of local scrubbers were analyzed by a self-constructed multi-column GC system equipped with thermal conductivity detection. Three packed columns were integrated into the heart-cut GC system to allow simultaneous analysis of the five target PFCs. The Porapak Q pre-column performs rough separation and cuts eluent groups to two analytical columns for optimal separation. The Molecular Sieve - 5A column separated NF3, CF4, and C3F8 and the second Porapak Q separated SF6 and C2F6. Linearity was greater than 0.995 (R2) for the five PFCs, and the reproducibility was about 4% (relative standard deviation) for NF3, and better than 0.5% for the other four PFCs. DRE for the combustion (CB) and electric-thermal types of local scrubbers was evaluated by taking into account the in-line dilution from air and fuel gases. Both flow and tracer methods were employed to deduce the dilution factors (DFs). For the tracer method, helium was employed as the tracer and injected upstream of the scrubbers and thus mixed with the exhaust gas. With this method, the DFs were determined to be in the range from 4.8 to 5.9 for the CB unit, significantly higher than the value of 3.3 based on the flow method. The DREs for the CB unit for C3F8 were greater than 90% and between 40% and 50% for CF4. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The carbon content of the steels was found to affect the permeability and coercive force, with lower-carbon steels displaying significantly higher permeability and lower coercive force. The decrease in coercive force with reduced carbon content is attributed to fewer carbide inclusions which inhibit domain wall motion. Cooling to 77 K resulted in harder magnetic properties. Averaged over the ten steels tested the maximum permeability decreased by 8%, the coercive force increased by 14%, and the residual and saturation flux densities increased by 4% and 3%, respectively. The change in coercive force when cooled is comparable to the theoretical prediction for iron, based on a model of domain wall motion inhibited by inclusions. The modest changes of the magnetic properties indicate that the stainless steels can still be used in magnetic applications at very low temperatures. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The work presented here responds to these needs and provides the basis for linking air quality issues at the local level with the policy requirements to comply with international agreements on transboundary air pollution and national emissions ceilings. We describe a high resolution module for the UK Integrated Assessment Model which provides a mechanism for introducing structural and behavioural changes in the transport sector into integrated assessment modelling, source-apportionment of local, national and transboundary contributions to air quality, and captures the roadside concentrations of air pollutants in urban street canyons. Focussing upon urban air quality (NO2 and PM10), and both technical and non-technical abatement (changes in behaviour and activity levels), we find that policy measures are required at multiple scales in order to achieve improvements on air quality at the local scale. Contrasting scenarios illustrate that it may be easier to control levels of NO2 than PM10 by using local measures, since PM10 concentrations are dominated by secondary particles and background components. Combining technical and behavioural measures is more likely to be effective in simultaneously achieving reductions in emissions, concentrations and health effects. However, there is a need to assess the cost effectiveness of local abatement measures in relation to the cost effectiveness of national and transboundary measures affecting the long-range components. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Proxy records indicate, however, that the Earths atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations did not fall below about 200-250 parts per million during this period. The stabilization of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations near this minimum value suggests that strong negative feedback mechanisms inhibited further drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide by high rates of global silicate rock weathering. Here we investigate one possible negative feedback mechanism, occurring under relatively low carbon dioxide concentrations and in warm climates, that is related to terrestrial plant productivity and its role in the decomposition of silicate minerals. We use simulations of terrestrial and geochemical carbon cycles and available experimental evidence to show that vegetation activity in upland regions of active orogens was severely limited by near-starvation of carbon dioxide in combination with global warmth over this period. These conditions diminished biotic-driven silicate rock weathering and thereby attenuated an important long-term carbon dioxide sink. Although our modelling results are semi-quantitative and do not capture the full range of biogeochemical feedbacks that could influence the climate, our analysis indicates that the dynamic equilibrium between plants, climate and the geosphere probably buffered the minimum atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over the past 24 million years. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

By studying the martian surface stratigraphically (in terms of the geometrical relations between surface landforms and the substrate) rather than genetically (by form analogy with Earth), we have identified dynamic surfaces across one-fifth of martian longitude. New stratigraphical observations in the Elysium-Amazonis plains have revealed a progressive surface polygonisation that is destructive of impact craters across the region. This activity is comparable to the climatically-driven degradation of periglacial landscapes on Earth, but because it affects impact craters-the martian chronometer-it can be dated. Here, we show that it is possible to directly date this activity based on the fraction of impact craters affected by polygon formation. Nearly 100% of craters (of all diameters) are superposed by polygonal sculpture: considering the few-100 Ma age of the substrate, this suggests that the process of polygon formation was active within the last few million years. Surface polygonisation in this region, often considered to be one of the signs of young, 'plains-forming' volcanism on Mars, is instead shown to postdate the majority of impact craters seen. We therefore conclude that it is post-depositional in origin and an artefact of thermal cycling of near-surface ground ice. Stratigraphically-controlled crater counts present the first way of dating climate change on a planet other than Earth: a record that may tell us something about climate change on our own planet. Parallel climate change on these two worlds-an ice age Mars coincident with Earth's glacial Quaternary period-might suggest a coupled system linking both. We have previously been unable to generalise about the causes of long-term climate change based on a single terrestrial example-with the beginnings of a chronology for climate change on our nearest planetary neighbour, we can. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Extensive peatland areas in Southeast Asia have been degraded through deforestation, drainage and fire, leading to on- and off-site environmental and socio-economic impacts of local to global significance. To address these problems, landscape-scale restoration measures are urgently required. This paper reviews and illustrates, using information from on-going trials in Kalimantan, Indonesia, the current state of knowledge pertaining to (i) land-cover dynamics of degraded peatlands, (ii) vegetation rehabilitation, (iii) restoration of hydrology, (iv) rehabilitation of carbon sequestration and storage, and (v) promotion of sustainable livelihoods for local communities. For a 4500 km2 study site in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, we show a 78% reduction in forest cover between 1973 and 2003 and demonstrate that fire, exacerbated by drainage, is the principal driver of land-use change. Progressive vegetation succession follows infrequent, low-intensity fires, but repeated and high-intensity fires result in retrogressive succession towards non-forest communities. Re-wetting the peat is an important key to vegetation restoration and protection of remaining peat carbon stocks. The effectiveness of hydrological restoration is discussed and likely impacts on greenhouse gas emissions evaluated. Initial results indicate that raised water levels have limited short-term impact on reducing CO 2 emissions, but could be critical in reducing fire risk. We conclude that successful restoration of degraded peatlands must be grounded in scientific knowledge, relevant to socio-economic circumstances, and should not proceed without the consent and co-operation of local communities. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Fire; Greenhouse gas emissions; Hydrology; Land cover change; Peatland degradation; Restoration ecology; Sustainable livelihoods; Tropical peatland","carbon sequestration; deforestation; drainage; environmental impact; fire; greenhouse gas; habitat restoration; hydrology; land cover; land degradation; land use change; lowland environment; peatland; restoration ecology; socioeconomic impact; succession; sustainability; vegetation dynamics; water level; Asia; Eurasia; Indonesia; Kalimantan; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349696652

It is shown that the data on variations in the angular velocity of the Earth's rotation can be used as a universal indicator of climate changes on the planet.

In particular the disposal of waste in landfills generates methane that has high global warming potential. Effective mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is important and could provide environmental benefits and sustainable development, as well as reduce adverse impacts on public health. The European and UK waste policy force sustainable waste management and especially diversion from landfill, through reduction, reuse, recycling and composting, and recovery of value from waste. Energy from waste is a waste management option that could provide diversion from landfill and at the same time save a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, since it recovers energy from waste which usually replaces an equivalent amount of energy generated from fossil fuels. Energy from waste is a wide definition and includes technologies such as incineration of waste with energy recovery, or combustion of waste-derived fuels for energy production or advanced thermal treatment of waste with technologies such as gasification and pyrolysis, with energy recovery. The present study assessed the greenhouse gas emission impacts of three technologies that could be used for the treatment of Municipal Solid Waste in order to recover energy from it. These technologies are Mass Burn Incineration with energy recovery, Mechanical Biological Treatment via bio-drying and Mechanical Heat Treatment, which is a relatively new and uninvestigated method, compared to the other two. Mechanical Biological Treatment and Mechanical Heat Treatment can turn Municipal Solid Waste into Solid Recovered Fuel that could be combusted for energy production or replace other fuels in various industrial processes. The analysis showed that performance of these two technologies depends strongly on the final use of the produced fuel and they could produce GHG emissions savings only when there is end market for the fuel. On the other hand Mass Burn Incineration generates greenhouse gas emission savings when it recovers electricity and heat. Moreover the study found that the expected increase on the amount of Municipal Solid Waste treated for energy recovery in England by 2020 could save greenhouse gas emission, if certain Energy from Waste technologies would be applied, under certain conditions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The study combines in situ, plant-level measurements, a spatial emissions inventory, and a photochemical box model. Maximum plant-level basal emission rates were moderate: 18.1 μgC gdw-1 h-1 (Washingtonia spp., palms) for isoprene and 9.56 μgC gdw-1 h-1 (Fraxinus velutina, Arizona ash) for monoterpenes. Sesquiterpene emission rates were low for plant species selected in this study, with no measurement exceeding 0.1 μgC gdw-1 h-1. The high ambient temperatures combined with moderate plant-level emission factors resulted in landscape emission factors that were low (250-640 μgC m-2 h-1) compared to more mesic environments (e.g., the southeastern United States). The Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (RACM) was modified to include a new reaction pathway for ocimene. Using measured concentrations of anthropogenic hydrocarbons and other reactive air pollutants (NOx, ozone), the box model employing the RACM mechanism revealed that these modest emissions could have a significant impact on air quality. For a suburban location that was downwind of the urban core (high NOx; low anthropogenic hydrocarbons), biogenic terpenes increased time-dependent ozone production rates by a factor of 50. Our study demonstrates that low-biomass density landscapes emit sufficient biogenic terpenes to have a significant impact on regional air quality. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This 2-year study included, an intensive field campaign, TexAQS 2006/Gulf of Mexico Atmospheric Composition and Climate Study (GoMACCS), conducted in August-October 2006. The results reported in this special journal section are based on observations collected on four aircraft, one research vessel, networks of groundbased air quality and meteorological (surface and radar wind profiler) sites in eastern Texas, a balloon-borne ozonesonde-radiosonde network (part of Intercontinental Transport Experiment Ozonesonde Network Study (IONS-06)), and satellites. This overview paper provides operational and logistical information for those platforms and sites, summarizes the principal findings and conclusions that have thus far been drawn from the results, and directs readers to appropriate papers for the full analysis. Two of these findings deserve particular emphasis. First, despite decreases in actual, emissions of highly reactive volatile organic compounds (HRVOC) and some improvements in inventory estimates since the TexAQS 2000 study, the current Houston area emission inventories still underestimate HRVOC emissions by approximately 1 order of magnitude. Second, the background ozone in eastern Texas, which represents the minimum ozone concentration that is likely achievable through only local controls, can approach or exceed the current National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 75 ppbv for an 8-h average. These findings have broad implications for air quality control strategies in eastern Texas.

Perturbations, such as climate or land use change, have the potential to disrupt this balance and alter soil-atmosphere carbon exchanges. As the quantification of soil organic matter stocks is an insensitive means of detecting changes, certainly over short timescales, there is a need to apply methods that facilitate a quantitative understanding of the biological processes underlying soil carbon balance. We outline the processes by which plant carbon enters the soil and critically evaluate isotopic methods to quantify them. Then, we consider the balancing CO2 flux from soil and detail the importance of partitioning the sources of this flux into those from recent plant assimilate and those from native soil organic matter. Finally, we consider the interactions between the inputs of carbon to soil and the losses from soil mediated by biological activity. We emphasize the key functional role of the microbiota in the concurrent processing of carbon from recent plant inputs and native soil organic matter. We conclude that quantitative isotope labelling and partitioning methods, coupled to those for the quantification of microbial community substrate use, offer the potential to resolve the functioning of the microbial control point of soil carbon balance in unprecedented detail. © 2009 New Phytologist.","Isotopic labelling; Natural abundance isotopic methods; Respiration partitioning; Rhizodeposition; Soil carbon balance; Soil microbial communities; Soil organic matter; Soil respiration","carbon; bioactivity; carbon balance; carbon cycle; isotopic analysis; land use change; microbial activity; microbial community; partitioning; perturbation; quantitative analysis; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil respiration; article; bacterium; isotope labeling; metabolism; methodology; microbiology; soil; Bacteria; Carbon; Isotope Labeling; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949095797

The method is flexible with respect to operation, it allows for recovery of energy, it reduces the volume of solid waste significantly(by a factor of 8-10), and advanced flue gas cleaning technologies ensures very low emissions from modern incineration plants. In 2005, 24% of the total reported Danish waste production was incinerated. However, the presence of inorganic constituents such as alkali metals, Cl, S, and heavy metals in the waste constitute an essential challenge in waste incineration, both with respect to operational issues and due to environmental concerns. Formation of acidic pollutants, high mass loading of aerosols, and deposition of potentially corrosive components on heat transfer surfaces are among the encountered problems caused by volatile alkali compounds and heavy metals during combustion, and the potential leaching of heavy metals from the solid residues upon disposal is another major environmental concern. In this work the partitioning of trace elements in a waste-to-energy(WtE) boiler was studied experimentally, based on results from a fullscale measuring campaign at a Danish WtE plant while applying changes in waste composition and grate operation, respectively. The changes in waste composition were applied by adding(one-by-one): dedicated waste fractions, comprising road salt(NaCl), household batteries, automotive shredder waste, CCA (copper-chromate-arsenate)- impregnated wood, PVC, and, shoes, to a base-load waste. Special focus in the present work was on the partitioning of the elements Pb, Zn, Cl, S, Na, and K, which are all considered problematic elements with respect to deposition and corrosion problems. The partitioning of the elements was found to be influenced by various effects, and there was not necessarily a correlation between the input concentration of an element in the feedstock and the amounts recovered in the fly ash and flue gas fractions. The study indicated that Cl and S played an important role for the partitioning of Pb, and maybe also Zn. When firing Cl-rich waste fractions(PVC, salt, shoes), the partitioning of Pb seemed to shift toward increased vaporization(and subsequent recovery in fly ash and aerosol fractions). The full-scale study also implied that organically bound Cl(as in PVC, shoes) was preferably released(as HCl(g)) to the gas phase, whereas the inorganically bound Cl(salt) was recovered in the bottom ash and fly ash fractions(indicating alkali-chloride bonding). Overall, Cl was concluded to be a critical element with respect to deposition and corrosion problems as it(1) enhanced the vaporization of heavy metals,(2) caused increased mass-load of aerosols if present as alkali-chloride in the waste, and(3) caused increased deposition fluxes and increased concentrations of Cl in the deposits. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Acidic pollutant; Bottom ash; Concentration of; Corrosion problems; Critical elements; Denmark; Deposition fluxes; Environmental concerns; Flue gas cleaning; Gasphase; Heat transfer surfaces; Incineration plant; Low emission; Mass loadings; Municipal solid waste incinerations; Operational issues; Road salts; Solid residues; Thermal treatment; Waste composition; Waste fraction; Waste production; Waste to energy; Air cleaners; Air pollution; Ash handling; Atmospheric aerosols; Chromates; Corrosion; Energy conversion; Flue gases; Fly ash; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Heat treatment; Leaching; Lead; Lead alloys; Leakage (fluid); Metal recovery; Metals; Refuse incinerators; Shoe manufacture; Sodium chloride; Solid wastes; Trace analysis; Trace elements; Vaporization; Waste treatment; Zinc; Waste incineration; Aerosols; Air Cleaners; Air Pollution; Ash; Chromates; Combustion; Corrosion; Emission; Energy; Flue Gas; Fly Ash; Gas; Heat Treatment; Leaching; Lead; Wastes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68049120501

Among all catalysts tested, Pd-, Ru- and Rh-based samples exhibited the best catalytic performance, in all reaction conditions examined. The reaction was inhibited by O2, in particular at lower temperatures, while its effect was essentially negligible at higher ones. In the presence of reducing agents and under lean reaction conditions, N2O conversion was comparably enhanced, with C3H8 being more efficient than CH4; however even in the presence of hydrocarbons N2O decomposition is the major pathway for N2O abatement, since reducing agents mainly act as oxygen scavengers reducing and concurrently activating the metal sites. The influence of different co-existing gases (CO, H2O and SO2) on the performance of Pd supported catalysts was also investigated, whereas thermal stability tests in the presence of SO2 indicate a gradual irreversible decrease in activity until a new steady state was established. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","H2O; Metal supported catalysts; N2O decomposition; Reducing agents; SO2","Catalytic conversion; Catalytic performance; Co-existing; Excess oxygen; H2O; Metal catalyst; Metal sites; Metal supported catalysts; N2O decomposition; Oxygen scavengers; Pd-supported catalysts; Reaction conditions; SO2; Steady state; Supported catalysts; Thermal stability; Catalyst supports; Hydrocarbons; Metals; Oxygen; Palladium; Rhodium; Scavenging; Reducing agents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71749116723

In 2009, only 87 plants are under development because of uncertainty over climate change regulations. Governors in 13 states from California to Michigan and Florida have effectively halted construction of new conventional coal-fired power plants by rejecting permits outright or setting CO2 emission standards that would be impossible to meet without carbon capture and storage. According to Jay Apt, a physicist at Carnegie Mellon University, banning new coal generation will increase the consumption of natural gas. Modelling results show increases in natural gas use of 27-56% in Texas, 44-500% in the eastern US, and 92-500% in the Midwest. A doubling of natural gas demand would lead, in turn, to price increases ranging from 175 to 500%, according to the study.",,"carbon dioxide; coal; chemistry; economics; electric power plant; electricity; greenhouse effect; legal aspect; note; policy; pollution; statistical model; time; United States; Carbon Dioxide; Coal; Electricity; Environmental Pollution; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Economic; Power Plants; Public Policy; Time Factors; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70149102854

Questions remain concerning the adverse health effects of coarse particles generated by noncombustion, traffic-related processes and the mechanism of action of PM. Using a time-stratified case-crossover design, we investigated the association between three independent size fractions, coarse (PM10-2.5), intermodal (PM2.5-1), and very fine PMs (PM1), and three health outcomes, respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular mortality in Barcelona, Spain, during the period of March 2003-December 2005. Using existing data, we examined the chemical composition of each fraction to explore the effects of PM from different sources and the mechanisms of action. We found that increased levels of PM1 and PM10-2.5 were associated with increased levels of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality at lag 1 and lag 2. At lag 1, the odds ratio (OR) for a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM1 was 1.028 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.000-1.058] for cardiovascular mortality and 1.063 (95% CI, 1.004-1.124) for cerebrovascular mortality. At lag 1, the odds ratio per a 10 μg/m3 increase of PM10-2.5 was 1.059 (95% CI, 1.026-1.094) for cardiovascular mortality and 1.098 (95% CI, 1.030-1.171) for cerebrovascular mortality. Association with respiratory mortality was only detected for PM2.5-1 at lag 2 (OR, 1.206 per a 10 μg/m3 increase; 95% CI, 1.028-1.416).

Methods: We used attributable fractions and life tables to quantify the benefits for selected health outcomes, based on published concentration-response functions and economic unit values. The mean weighted concentration of PM10 for the study population was estimated through concentration surface maps developed by the local government. Results: The annual mean health benefits of reducing the mean PM10 exposure estimated for the population in the study area (50 μg/m3) to the annual mean value recommended by the World Health Organization (20 μg/m3) were estimated to be 3,500 fewer deaths (representing an average increase in life expectancy of 14 months), 1,800 fewer hospitalizations for cardio-respiratory diseases, 5,100 fewer cases of chronic bronchitis among adults, 31,100 fewer cases of acute bronchitis among children, and 54,000 fewer asthma attacks among children and adults. The mean total monetary benefits were estimated to be 6,400 million euros per year. Reducing PM10 to comply with the current European Union regulatory annual mean level (40 μg/m3) would yield approximately one third of these benefits. Conclusions: This study shows that reducing air pollution in the metropolitan area of Barcelona would result in substantial health and economic benefits. The benefits are probably underestimated due to the assumptions made in this study.

RESULTS: Approximately 1600 (9%) of all childhood asthma cases in Long Beach and 690 (6%) in Riverside were attributed to traffic proximity. Ship emissions accounted for 1400 (21%) bronchitis episodes and, in more modest proportions, health care visits for asthma. Considerably greater reductions in asthma morbidity could be obtained by reducing nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations to levels found in clean coastal communities.

We have prepared an updated genetic and cytogenetic map of the male rainbow trout sex linkage group. Selected sex-linked markers spanning the X chromosome of the female genetic map have been mapped cytogenetically in normal males and genetically in crosses between the OSU female clonal line and four different male clonal lines as well as in outcrosses involving outbred OSU and hybrids between the OSU line and the male clonal lines. The cytogenetic maps of the X and Y chromosomes were very similar to the female genetic map for the X chromosome. Five markers on the male maps are genetically very close to the sex determination locus (SEX), but more widely spaced on the female genetic map and on the cytogenetic map, indicating a large region of suppressed recombination on the Y chromosome surrounding the SEX locus. The male map is greatly extended at the telomere. A BAC clone containing the SCAR (sequence characterized amplified region) Omy-163 marker, which maps close to SEX, was subjected to shotgun sequencing. Two carbonyl reductase genes and a gene homologous to the vertebrate skeletal ryanodine receptor were identified. Carbonyl reductase is a key enzyme involved in production of trout ovarian maturation hormone. This brings the number of type I genes mapped to the sex chromosome to six and has allowed us to identify a region on zebrafish chromosome 10 and medaka chromosome 13 which may be homologous to the distal portion of the long arm of the rainbow trout Y chromosome. © 2009 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics.","Rainbow trout; Recombination; Y chromosome","animal; article; female; genetic recombination; genetics; male; rainbow trout; Y chromosome; Animals; Female; Male; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Recombination, Genetic; Y Chromosome; Danio rerio; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Oryzias; Oryziinae; Salmonidae; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449427805

Here we take one example of such large-scale changes and follow them through a series of impacts down to specific regional and local consequences. We use as our test case changes in the climate of the western United States, and what these changes imply for water deliveries from the Colorado River. Human induced changes in the hydrological cycle of the western United States have recently been demonstrated with very high statistical significance. These changes are downscaled and the high resolution environmental data that results are used to drive a hydrological model of the region. The hydrological implications of the changes are used along with a water budget model of the Colorado System to estimate changes in water available for delivery to farms, commercial activity, and urban centers into the future. We find the current Colorado water deliveries are not sustainable in the face of human-induced climate change, with major shortages expected only 15-20 years into the future. Other regions of the world are also predicted by global climate models to have water problems in the near future. The procedures used here can be a template for estimating detailed impacts on water supplies in these regions.","Climate change; Colorado river; Detection and attribution; Hydrological modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861395796

Agriculture accounts for 48% of GHG emissions in New Zealand, and 10–12% of emissions in most other ‘developed’ countries. Methane (CH4) accounts for 35% of GHG emissions in New Zealand, mostly from ruminal fermentation. Nitrous oxide (N2O) accounts for 17% of GHG emissions in New Zealand, mostly from urinary N, exacerbated by excessive application of nitrogenous fertiliser. Ghg Are Often Expressed As Carbon Dioxide Equivalents (Co2-E), And 1 Kg Ch4 Has A Similar Global-Warming Potential As 21 Kg Co2, Whilst 1 Kg N2O Has The Same Warming Potential As 310 Kg Co2. Methane is derived from H2 produced during ruminal fermentation, and losses account for 6–7% of gross energy in feeds. This is about 9–10% of metabolisable energy intake. Methane production tends to be lower when legumes, rather than grasses, are fed, and emissions are greater (per kg dry matter intake; DMI) when mature grasses and silages are fed. There are small differences between individual animals in their CH4production (g/kg DMI) but there are few profitable options available for reducing CH4 production in ruminants. Emissions of N2O can be reduced by more strategic application of nitrogenous fertiliser, avoidance of waterlogged areas, and use of dicyandiamide in some cooler regions. Ghg Mitigation Should Be Based On Life-Cycle Analyses To Ensure A Reduction In One Ghg Does Not Increase Another. Current And Future Strategies Are Unlikely To Reduce Ghg Emissions By &gt;20%. Food production is central to human survival, and should not be compromised to mitigate GHG emissions. Efforts should be directed toward increasing animal efficiency and reducing GHG emissions/unit edible food. © 2009 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Abatement; Dairy farming; Farm management; Greenhouse gas emissions; Methane; Mitigation; Nitrous oxide; Ruminants","Animalia; Bovidae; Poaceae; agriculture; animal; article; bovids; greenhouse effect; New Zealand; Agriculture; Animals; Greenhouse Effect; New Zealand; Ruminants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73949138481

In the present study, we demonstrated that acute treatment by BaP markedly increased expression of the NADPH oxidase subunit gene neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (NCF1)/p47phox in primary human macrophages; NCF1 was similarly up-regulated in alveolar macrophages from BaP-instilled rats. NCF1 induction in BaP-treated human macrophages was prevented by targeting AhR, through its chemical inhibition or small interference RNA-mediated down-modulation of its expression. BaP moreover induced activity of the NCF1 promoter sequence, containing a consensus AhR-related xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE), and electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that BaP-triggered binding of AhR to this XRE. Finally, we showed that BaP exposure resulted in p47phox protein translocation to the plasma membrane and in potentiation of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced superoxide anion production in macrophages. This BaP priming effect toward NADPH oxidase activity was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase specific inhibitor apocynin and the chemical AhR inhibitor α-naphtoflavone. These results indicated that BaP induced NCF1/p47phox expression and subsequently enhanced superoxide anion production in PMA-treated human macrophages, in an AhR-dependent manner; such an NCF1/NADPH oxidase regulation by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may participate in deleterious effects toward human health triggered by these environmental contaminants, including atherosclerosis and smoking-related diseases. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The catalytic roles of the conserved active-site residues (Tyr51, Lys80 and His113) of AKR2B5 in the conversion of the reactive α-dicarbonyl moiety of PQ are not well understood. Using wild-type and mutated (Tyr51, Lys80 and His113 individually replaced by alanine) forms of AKR2B5, we have conducted steady-state and transient kinetic studies of the effects of varied pH and deuterium isotopic substitutions in coenzyme and solvent on the enzymatic rates of PQ reduction. Each mutation caused a 103-104-fold decrease in the rate constant for hydride transfer from NADH to PQ, whose value in the wild-type enzyme was determined as ∼8 × 102 s-1. The data presented support an enzymic mechanism in which a catalytic proton bridge from the protonated side chain of Lys80 (pK = 8.6 ± 0.1) to the carbonyl group adjacent to the hydride acceptor carbonyl facilitates the chemical reaction step. His113 contributes to positioning of the PQ substrate for catalysis. Contrasting its role as catalytic general acid for conversion of the physiological substrate xylose, Tyr51 controls release of the hydroquinone product. The proposed chemistry of AKR2B5 action involves delivery of both hydrogens required for reduction of the α-dicarbonyl substrate to the carbonyl group undergoing (stereoselective) transformation. Hydride transfer from NADH probably precedes the transfer of a proton from Tyr51 whose pK of 7.3 ± 0.3 in the NAD+-bound enzyme appears suitable for protonation of a hydroquinone anion (pK = 8.8). These results show that the mechanism of AKR2B5 is unusually plastic in the exploitation of the active-site residues, for the catalytic assistance provided to carbonyl group reduction in α-dicarbonyls differs from that utilized in the conversion of xylose. © The Authors Journal compilation. © 2009 Biochemical Society.","Active-site plasticity; AKR2B5; Aldo-keto reductase; Catalytic mechanism; Kinetic isotope effect; Transient state kinetics","Active-site plasticity; AKR2B5; Aldo-keto reductase; Catalytic mechanism; Kinetic isotope effect; Transient state kinetics; Carbonylation; Carrier mobility; Deuterium; Enzymes; Hydrogen; Ketones; pH effects; Phenols; Plasticity; Proton transfer; Protons; Quantum chemistry; Rate constants; Reduction; Substrates; Enzyme activity; 1,2 dicarbonyl derivative; alanine; Candida tenuis xylose reductase; carbonyl derivative; deuterium; fungal enzyme; histidine; hydrogen; hydroquinone; lysine; phenanthrenequinone; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; solvent; tyrosine; unclassified drug; 9,10-phenanthrenequinone; alcohol dehydrogenase; aldehyde reductase; carbonyl reductase (NADPH); nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; phenanthrene derivative; phenanthrenequinone; amino acid substitution; article; Candida; Candida tenuis; catalysis; chemical reaction kinetics; controlled study; enzyme active site; enzyme degradation; enzyme kinetics; enzyme mechanism; enzyme substrate; gene mutation; nonhuman; pH; plasticity; priority journal; proton transport; steady state; wild type; Candida; chemical structure; chemistry; enzymology; kinetics; metabolism; Candida tenuis; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Aldehyde Reductase; Candida; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Molecular Structure; NAD; Phenanthrenes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650300274

Here, we evaluate the effluent composition of a representative multiwalled CNT synthesis by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in order to provide data needed to design strategies for mitigating any unacceptable emissions. During thermal pretreatment of the reactant gases (ethene and H2), we found over 45 side-products were formed, including methane, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This finding suggests several environmental concerns with the existing process, including potential discharges of the potent greenhouse gas, methane (up to 1.7%), and toxic compounds such as benzene and 1,3-butadiene (up to 36000 ppmv). Extrapolating these laboratory-scale data to future industrial CNT production, we estimate that (1) contributions of atmospheric methane will be negligible comparedtootherexistingsourcesand(2)VOCandPAHemissions may become important on local scales but will be small when compared to national industrial sources. As a first step toward reducing such unwanted emissions, we used continuous in situ measures of CNT length during growth and sought to identify which thermally generated compounds correlated with CNT growth rate. The results suggested that, in future CNT production approaches, key reaction intermediates could be delivered to the catalyst without thermal treatment. This would eliminate the most energetically expensivecomponent of CVD synthesis (heating reactant gases), while reducing the formation of unintended byproducts. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Atmospheric methanes; Carbon nanotube synthesis; Catalytic chemical vapor deposition; CVD synthesis; Design strategies; Early evaluation; Environmental concerns; In-situ; Industrial sources; Key reactions; Laboratory scale; Local scale; Multi-walled CNT; Production approach; Reactant gas; Thermal pre-treatment; Thermal treatment; Toxic compounds; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Atmospheric chemistry; Benzene; Butadiene; Carbon nanotubes; Complexation; Effluents; Environmental impact; Ethylene; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heat treatment; Methane; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Synthesis (chemical); Volatile organic compounds; Chemical vapor deposition; 1,3 butadiene; benzene; carbon nanotube; methane; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; volatile organic compound; benzene; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; methane; PAH; strategic environmental assessment; toxic substance; volatile organic compound; article; atmosphere; catalysis; environmental impact; synthesis; temperature; vapor; Environment; Environmental Pollution; Hydrogen; Industry; Nanotubes, Carbon; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Safety; Temperature; Volatile Organic Compounds; Volatilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349709361

The majority of studies report positive resection margins in 20% to 40% of the patients who underwent BCT. This may result in an increased local recurrence (LR) rate or additional surgery and, consequently, adverse affects on cosmesis, psychological distress, and health costs. In the literature, various risk factors are reported to be associated with positive margin status after lumpectomy, which may allow the surgeon to distinguish those patients with a higher a priori risk for re-excision. However, most risk factors are related to tumor biology and patient characteristics, which cannot be modified as such. Therefore, efforts to reduce the number of positive margins should focus on optimizing the surgical procedure itself, because the surgeon lacks realtime intraoperative information on the presence of positive resection margins during breast-conserving surgery. This review presents the status of pre-and intraoperative modalities currently used in BCT.

This represents a major expansion of earlier forest-oriented initiatives under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) that focused on afforestation and reforestation activities. While the scope of REDD projects is still being defined, potential categories include conservation, stock enhancement, and sustainable management, creating a range of new opportunities for forest-related climate projects. The core concept behind REDD is that deforestation trends can be slowed, halted, or even reversed conserving billions of tons of carbon that would otherwise be emitted. To succeed, REDD projects will need to control powerful drivers of deforestation and forest degradation operating at multiple levels and carried-out by a variety of actors, from rural people to political and economic elites. This case study of a REDD pilot project in northwest Cambodia explores how drivers might be contained under a project scenario and how the future international articulation of project design parameters could enable or constrain a global REDD strategy. The paper concludes that to be successful REDD projects will require a hybrid approach in which local drivers are controlled by communities and national drivers are mitigated through policy actions necessitating strong partnerships between diverse institutions. © 2009 The Author.

To address this issue, we evaluated nonnative and native plant response to five of the most commonly-practiced shrubland fuel reduction methods in Mediterranean climates, including (a) fall prescribed fire, (b) winter prescribed fire, (c) spring prescribed fire, (d) fall mastication (slashing) and (e) spring mastication. Treatments were replicated four times in mature northern California chaparral and surveyed for three years after treatment; treatment type was randomly assigned. We found that the effects of treatment type (fire/mastication) were more apparent than the effects of treatment season (fall/winter/spring), but there were some differences among seasons of prescribed fire. Mastication treatments had the highest number of nonnative invasive species. Mastication treatments also had 34% higher nonnative annual grass abundance than the fire treatments. Winter and spring prescribed fire treatments were most resistant to nonnative invasion since these areas had the fewest nonnative species, lowest nonnative species abundances, and highest relative proportions of native plants. In shrublands where controlling nonnative annual grass is an important objective, managers should consider cool season prescribed fire as a viable fuel reduction treatment. In cases where prescribed fire is not feasible, mastication provides an alternative that can exacerbate nonnative grass production in the short term but may maintain native plant seedbanks over the long term if the site remains undisturbed for several decades.

Experiments to date have shown communities composed of fewer species generally capture a smaller fraction of available resources, and achieve lower standing stock biomass than more diverse communities. However, it is uncertain how changes in biodiversity and the resulting alterations in biomass affect the rates of important ecological processes like primary production, which regulates fluxes of CO2 and O2 between the biotic and abiotic components of the environment. Here we show that species richness influences not only the standing stock biomass of primary producers, but also rates of gross primary production measured by changes in O2 concentrations in aquatic systems. We manipulated the richness of five widespread species of algae in laboratory microcosms and then quantified how richness impacts algal biomass, rates of gross primary production (GPP), and the ratio of production to respiration. Algal biomass increased by a factor of 1.82 for each level of species richness, and GPP by a factor of 1.20, for each additional species. Production to respiration ratios increased about 10% for each additional species, indicating that systems with more species were increasingly autotrophic - that is, they produced more O2 than they consumed, and accumulated CO2 faster than they released it. These trends were driven by two highly productive species that became co-dominant in species rich polycultures at the expense of other taxa. Our experiment suggests that changes in biodiversity may influence not only the rates at which O2 and CO 2 are produced and released in ecosystems, but also the total amount of carbon that is sequestered and stored as biomass. © 2009 Oikos.",,"alga; aquatic environment; biomass; carbon sequestration; community composition; ecosystem function; extinction; microcosm; oxygen; primary production; resource availability; species richness; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71949098524

Modelling is an inherently probabilistic exercise, with uncertainty amplified at each stage of the process, from scenario generation to issues of scale, to simulation of hydrological processes, to management impacts. At the basin scale, significant factors affecting hydrological impacts of climate change include latitude, topography, geology, and land use. Under scenarios of future climate change, many basins are likely to experience changes not only in their mean hydrology, but also in the frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events. Impacts of climate change on water quality are largely determined by hydrological changes and by the nature of pollutants as flushingor dilution-controlled. The most significant impact of urban development on water resources is an increase in overall surface runoff and the flashiness of the storm hydrograph. The increase in impervious surface area associated with urban development also contributes to degradation of water quality as a result of non-point source pollution. Modelling studies on the combined impacts of climate change and urban development have found that either change may be more significant, depending on scenario assumptions and basin characteristics, and that each type of change may amplify or ameliorate the effects of the other.

Middle Triassic samples are representative of the Livinallongo Formation of the Dolomites, while Upper Triassic hemipelagites were sampled in the Pignola 2 section, within the Calcari con Selce Formation of the Southern Apennines in Southern Italy. Triassic hemipelagites occur either as nodular limestones with chert nodules or as plane-bedded limestone-marl alternations which are locally silicified. In the Middle Triassic Livinallongo Formation, diagenetic alteration primarily affected the stable isotopic composition of sediment surrounding carbonate nodules, whereas the latter show almost pristine compositions. Diagenesis lowered the carbon and oxygen isotope values of bulk carbonate and introduced a strong correlation between δ13C and δ13O values. In the Middle Triassic successions of the Dolomites, bulk carbonate of nodular limestone facies is most commonly unaltered, whereas carbonate of the plane-bedded facies is uniformly affected by diagenetic alteration. In contrast to carbonate nodules, plane-bedded facies often show compaction features. Although both types of pelagic carbonate rocks show very similar petrographic characteristics, scanning electron microscopy studies reveal that nodular limestone consists of micrite (&lt;5 μm in diameter), whereas samples of the plane-bedded facies are composed of calcite crystals ca 10 μm in size showing pitted, polished surfaces. These observations suggest that nodular and plane-bedded facies underwent different diagenetic pathways determined by the prevailing mineralogy of the precursor sediment, i.e. probably high-Mg calcite in the nodular facies and aragonite in the case of the plane-bedded facies. Similar to Middle Triassic nodular facies, Upper Triassic nodular limestones of the Lagonegro Basin are also characterized by uncorrelated δ13C and δ13O values and exhibit small, less than 5 μm size, crystals. The alternation of calcitic and aragonitic precursors in the Middle Triassic of the Dolomites is thought to mirror rapid changes in the type of carbonate production of adjacent platforms. Bioturbation and dissolution of metastable carbonate grains played a key role during early lithification of nodular limestone beds, whereby early stabilization recorded the carbon isotopic composition of sea water. The bulk carbonate δ13C values of Middle and Upper Triassic hemipelagites from Italy agree with those of Tethyan low-Mg calcite shells of articulate brachiopods, confirming that Triassic hemipelagites retained the primary carbon isotopic composition of the bottom sea water. A trend of increasing δ13C from the Late Anisian to the Early Carnian, partly seen in the data set presented here, is also recognized in successions from tropical palaeolatitudes elsewhere. The carbon isotopic composition of Middle and Upper Triassic nodular hemipelagic limestones can thus be used for chemostratigraphic correlation and palaeoenvironmental studies. © 2009 The Authors.

With industrial activity and population expected to increase for the rest of the century, large increases in greenhouse gas emissions are projected, with substantial global additional warming predicted. This paper examines forces driving CO2 emissions, a concise sector-by-sector summary of mitigation options, and research and development (R&amp;D) priorities. To constrain warming to below approximately 2.5 °C in 2100, the recent annual 3% CO2 emission growth rate needs to transform rapidly to an annual decrease rate of from 1 to 3% for decades. Furthermore, the current generation of energy generation and end-use technologies are capable of achieving less than half of the emission reduction needed for such a major mitigation program. New technologies will have to be developed and deployed at a rapid rate, especially for the key power generation and transportation sectors. Current energy technology research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RDD&amp;D) programs fall far short of what is required.

Ectomycorrhizal and overall microbial community composition was studied at two soil depths in a lysimeter experiment with 7 year old trees of Fagus sylvatica. As a functional parameter, potential enzyme activities were measured in mycorrhizosphere soil and on excised mycorrhizal tips. The degree of mycorrhization, structure and potential enzymatic activities of mycorrhizal communities were only slightly influenced by treatments. Soil enzyme activities were depressed under elevated ozone and stimulated by P. citricola under ambient but not under elevated ozone. Overall microbial community composition (PLFA) and ectomycorrhizal diversity changed with depth. PLFA analyses not only suggested a reaction of the microbial community to elevated ozone but also indicated an increase in plant stress related components. No influence of the biotic stress on ectomycorrhizal or overall microbial community structure was detected. Changes in the mycorrhizosphere community structure and function due to ozone may be explained by the quality of plant derived carbon. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Biotic and abiotic stress; Ectomycorrhizae; Enzyme activities; PLFA; Soil microbial communities","biotic factor; dicotyledon; ectomycorrhiza; enzyme activity; lysimeter; microbial community; ozone; rhizosphere; soil microorganism; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica; Phytophthora; Phytophthora citricola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350349874

Experiments were conducted in rhizobox systems that separate an upper soil-plant compartment from a lower compartment, where roots are excluded from the rhizosphere soil by a nylon membrane. The upper rhizobox compartment received the humic additions, whereas, after roots development, the rhizosphere soil in the lower compartment was sampled and sliced into thin layers. The lux-marked biosensor Pseudomonas fluorescens 10586 pUCD607 biosensor showed a significant increase in the deposition of bioavailable sources of carbon in the rhizosphere of soils when treated with bulk HA, but no response was found for treatments with the separated size-fractions. PCR-DGGE molecular fingerprintings revealed that the structure of rhizosphere microbial communities was changed by all humic treatments and that the smaller and more bioavailable size-fractions were more easily degraded by microbial activity than the bulk HA. On the other hand, highly hydrophobic and strongly associated humic molecules in the bulk HA required additional plant rhizodeposition before their bio-transformation could occur. This work highlights the importance of applying advanced biological and biotechnological methods to notice changes occurring in plant rhizodeposition and rhizosphere microbial activity. Moreover, it suggests correlations between the molecular properties of humic matter and their effects on microbial communities in the rhizosphere as mediated by root exudation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The cases provide an interesting sample, including countries that range from a developed country more pro-active in environmental international negotiations (Germany) to a more conservative developed country (Japan) and a developing country (Brazil). The results have pointed that, as compared to adaptation, mitigation policies (such as energy conservation) have a much longer implementation history and government support at the subnational level, especially in more progressive governments, but adaptation policies have gained space in the policy agenda recently because of the increasing public interest. The success of implementation of climate related policies is linked to the way they are integrated with sectorial policies, with policies of other levels of government, with civil society and within themselves (integration of mitigation-adaptation policies). © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to a locally excited (LE) state emission near 360 nm for both compounds, broad emission bands were observed at longer wavelengths. For 1, the long-wavelength emission bands are pronounced in polar solvents, and their appearance is accompanied by a strong reduction of the LE emission. Electron transfer from the quinuclidine amino group to the locally excited quinoline ring is a likely mechanism that accounts for these observations. For 2, on the other hand, the long-wavelength emission is relatively strong even in nonpolar solvents. Protonation of the quinuclidine amino group by a strong acid in acetonitrile solution leads to an increase of the LE emission at the expense of the long wavelength bands, both for 1 and 2. Upon addition of water to 1 and 2 in acetonitrile, however, the emission spectra change in a very different way: the long wavelength emission of 1 is suppressed, but that of 2 is enhanced. This indicates that the long-wavelength emission of 2 is to be attributed to proton transfer rather than to electron transfer. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy; Acetonitrile solutions; Amino group; Broad emission bands; Electron transfer; Emission spectrums; Locally excited; Locally excited state; Long wavelength bands; Long-wavelength emissions; Non-polar solvents; Organocatalysts; Photophysical properties; Polar solvents; Quinoline rings; Quinuclidine; Strong acids; Absorption spectroscopy; Acetonitrile; Amination; Amines; Electron transitions; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Organic solvents; Proton transfer; Wavelength; Emission spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650799891

The analysis of carbon neutrality of MSW on a life cycle basis shows that MSW is about 67% carbon-neutral, suggesting that only 33% of the CO2 emissions from incinerating MSW are of fossil origin. The waste constitutes a ""renewable biofuel"" energy resource and energy from waste (EfW) can result in a net reduction in CO2 emissions. In this paper, we explore an approach to extracting energy from MSW efficiently - EfW/gas turbine hybrid combined cycles. This approach innovates by delivering better performance with respect to energy efficiency and CO2 mitigation. In the combined cycles, the topping cycle consists of a gas turbine, while the bottoming cycle is a steam cycle where the low quality fuel - waste is utilized. This paper assesses the viability of the hybrid combined cycles and analyses their thermodynamic advantages with the help of computer simulations. It was shown that the combined cycles could offer significantly higher energy conversion efficiency and a practical solution to handling MSW. Also, the potential for a net reduction in CO2 emissions resulting from the hybrid combined cycles was evaluated.

Considering seedling and sapling stages as filter phases in stressful environments, some functional aspects of the regeneration of Polylepis sericea, a species associated to rock outcrops in the Venezuelan Andes, were studied. We characterized microclimatic conditions within a forest, in a forest gap and surrounding open páramo and determined low temperature resistance mechanisms in seedlings, saplings and ramets. Conditions in the forest understory were more stable compared to the forest gaps and open surrounding páramo. Minimum temperatures close to the ground were 3.6 °C lower in the open páramo compared to the forest understory. Maximum temperatures were 9.0 °C higher in the open páramo. Ice nucleation and injury temperatures occurred between -6 and -8 °C for both ramets and saplings, an evidence of frost avoidance to low nighttime temperatures.

The International Panel of Climate Change stated that there would be a steady increase in the ambient temperature during the end of the 21st century. This increase will impact the built environment, particularly the requirements of energy used for air-conditioning buildings. This paper discusses issues related to the potential impact of global warming on air-conditioning energy use in the hot climate of the United Arab Emirates. Al-Ain city was chosen for this study. Simulation studies and energy analysis were employed to investigate the energy consumption of buildings and the most effective measures to cope with this impact under different climate scenarios. The paper focuses on residential buildings and concludes that global warming is likely to increase the energy used for cooling buildings by 23.5% if Al-Ain city warms by 5.9 °C. The net CO2 emissions could increase at around 5.4% over the next few decades. The simulation results show that the energy design measures such as thermal insulation and thermal mass are important to cope with global warming, while window area and glazing system are beneficial and sensitive to climate change, whereas the shading devices are moderate as a building CO2 emissions saver and insensitive to global warming. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Reducing air pollution, providing shade and habitat for arboreal birds, producing oxygen, providing shelter against winds, recreational and aesthetic qualities and architectural applications are the main functions of urban green spaces. With the rapid change of urban area in Mashad city during the past decades, green spaces have been fragmented and dispersed causing impairment and dysfunction of these important urban elements. The objective of this study was to detect changes in extent and pattern of green areas of Mashad city and to analyze the results in terms of landscape ecology principles and functioning of the green spaces. In this research, we classified a Landsat TM and an IRS LISS-III image belonging to the years 1987 and 2006, respectively. We then used a post-classification comparison to determine the changes in green space areas of Mashad city during the 19 years covered by the images. Then, we applied landscape ecology calculations to derive metrics that quantified pattern of the changes in the green areas. The results showed that during 19 years from 1987, a significant decrease had occurred in the extent of urban green spaces with a concomitant fragmentation resulting in downgrading and destruction of the functions and services these areas provide. We conclude that the general quality of life in the central parts of the city has been diminished. We also state that a combination of remote sensing image classification, landscape metrics assessment and vegetation indices can provide a tool for assessing life quality and its trend for urban areas. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The term an agreed outcome suggests a lack of agreement on both the legal form that the likely outcome of this process could take, and the level of ambition that it should reflect. This lack of agreement continues to haunt the process. There are a range of legal form options for a new climate instrumentfrom a set of Conference of Parties decisions to a legally binding instrument, either to replace or supplement the Kyoto Protocoland the choice between them for States is predicated primarily on political and strategic considerations. Nevertheless the legal status, procedural requirements, symbolic signalling effects and regime-building characteristics of different legal form options will play an important role in determining the legal form of the Copenhagen agreed outcome. This article identifies and explores the range of legal form options available to States in the negotiation process, and outlines the political and strategic considerations at play and will ultimately govern choice of legal form. This article argues that one of the most significant factors hindering substantive progress on a post-2012 climate agreement is what is characterized here as the post-Kyoto stress disorder, a lack of trust amongst some developing countries that industrialized countries will, given current and past form, honour their commitments, and/or take the lead in the new climate agreement. This article makes the case that post-Kyoto stress disorder will likely prevent certain legal form options from acquiring traction in the process and favour others.

As a consequence, the incidence of environmental accidents such as oil spills and contamination of soils has increased significantly. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to develop remediation techniques with lower costs, decontamination efficiency and impact minimisation. The aim of this work was to evaluate Sebastiania commersoniana phytoremediation potential in soil contaminated by petroleum. This species, which is a native tree, was selected due to its proven capacity for surviving in areas contaminated by petroleum. Experiments were carried out with soils that were vegetated but non-contaminated, soils that were freshly contaminated (25, 50 and 75 g kg-1) but non-vegetated, and soils that were vegetated and contaminated, samples were collected 60 and 424 days after contamination with the purpose of evaluating the percentage of petroleum degradation in relation to the time. The results obtained in the present study allow us to state that S. commersoniana proves to be tolerant to petroleum contamination with respect to plant's growth. The degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons was evaluated by gas chromatography with a flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) equipped with a capillary column HP-5 (5% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane, 30 m; 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm). According to chromatographic analysis, samples in contact with S. commersoniana showed a significant area reduction of the hydrocarbon peaks. Analysis of the 60-day samples showed a reduction of petroleum hydrocarbons area higher than 60% and the 424-day samples showed a reduction higher than 94%, which demonstrates that a petroleum degradation process is occurring. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.","Petroleum; Phytoremediation; Pollution; Rhizodegradation; Rhizosphere","biodegradation; dicotyledon; gas chromatography; oil spill; petroleum hydrocarbon; phytoremediation; rhizosphere; soil pollution; soil remediation; Brazil; Sebastiania commersoniana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73249127133

Design/methodology/approach – Restoration of the mangrove forest in the Godavari Delta near Kakinada town in the south-eastern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh is carried out with participatory involvement of local communities depending for their livelihood on the mangrove forest. The extent of habitat restoration through reforestation in this area is explored. The possible contribution of restored mangroves in minimising the impacts of sea-level rise due to climate change is highlighted. Reforestation information from 1999 to 2006 is collected from available published work and the Forest Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh. Findings – The positive result of reforestation since the past few years is seen as an increase in mangrove vegetation. The changing landscape due to restoration could stop erosion and salt water incursion up to some extent and help in maintaining the biodiversity of this place. Practical implications – A long-term monitoring with ethnobiological study is required for managing such projects in future. Originality/value – The Godavari Delta mangroves are rich in biodiversity and offer a wide range of ecological services. Adding to habitat degradation, predicted sea-level rise is likely to affect the local human communities. The role of mangroves as an economically viable barrier against sea-level rise has been recognised in other Asian countries. The results from this case study too could be disseminated to various stakeholders involved in sustainable development. The focus of the paper on India is particularly relevant, as the country is going to be integral in climate change debates. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Climatology; Forests; Global warming; India; Seas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993078218

Files such as the mad cow crisis, genetically modified food, and the emerging nanotechnologies have been edified into a public problem, and have given place to a number of experiments and reviews about participatory arrangements. Much less attention has been devoted so far to the application of the TA framework to more local and limited projects-not yet and maybe never reaching the public problem status-and the management of their societal dimensions. Among them, new energy technology represents a very interesting field for investigation: many of the new energy enjoy a global positive public image whereas the local implementation of their implantation often raises societal questions and oppositions. This paper describes an original experiment conducted in the field of new energy technologies during which a participatory technology assessment inspired approach was applied to a number of individual and local projects. A framework methodology called ESTEEM was developed to facilitate such participatory process to take place, and it was tested and evaluated in 5 projects located in 5 different countries over Europe. A detailed discussion of the ESTEEM method and its application to one case study, a Carbon Sequestration project in The Netherlands, is provided. We show that a major question in the application in such participatory framework is to establish a reflective practice of project management based on situated and constructive interactions between project promoters and project stakeholders. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

They are manifested through growing demand for modern energy carriers, a fossil fuel dominated energy system facing a severe resource crunch, the need for creating access to quality energy for the large section of deprived population, vulnerable energy security, local and global pollution regimes and the need for sustaining economic development. Renewable energy is considered as one of the most promising alternatives. Recognizing this potential, India has been implementing one of the largest renewable energy programmes in the world. Among the renewable energy technologies, bioenergy has a large diverse portfolio including efficient biomass stoves, biogas, biomass combustion and gasification and process heat and liquid fuels. India has also formulated and implemented a number of innovative policies and programmes to promote bioenergy technologies. However, according to some preliminary studies, the success rate is marginal compared to the potential available. This limited success is a clear indicator of the need for a serious reassessment of the bioenergy programme. Further, a realization of the need for adopting a sustainable energy path to address the above challenges will be the guiding force in this reassessment. In this paper an attempt is made to consider the potential of bioenergy to meet the rural energy needs: (1) biomass combustion and gasification for electricity; (2) biomethanation for cooking energy (gas) and electricity; and (3) efficient wood-burning devices for cooking. The paper focuses on analysing the effectiveness of bioenergy in creating this rural energy access and its sustainability in the long run through assessing: the demand for bioenergy and potential that could be created; technologies, status of commercialization and technology transfer and dissemination in India; economic and environmental performance and impacts; bioenergy policies, regulatory measures and barrier analysis. The whole assessment aims at presenting bioenergy as an integral part of a sustainable energy strategy for India. The results show that bioenergy technology (BET) alternatives compare favourably with the conventional ones. The cost comparisons show that the unit costs of BET alternatives are in the range of 15-187% of the conventional alternatives. The climate change benefits in terms of carbon emission reductions are to the tune of 110 T C per year provided the available potential of BETs are utilized. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Other types of dryers are available commercially in the market, but they are costly and their total energy input is high. This analysis may be helpful to manufacturers who wish to know the energy requirement of the different components of the systems, and to reduce GHG emissions. Locally grown chilli has been dried to evaluate the energetics of the dryer. Energy payback period has been evaluated when displacing different conventional fuels and found to be 1.1 0, 1.55, 1.32 and 1.77 years in the case of fuelwood, light diesel oil (LDO), coal and natural gas respectively. The energetics of such a simple and affordable dryer should be further analysed to reduce national and global energy demand. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Crops; Diesel fuels; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Natural convection; Solar dryers; Conventional fuel; Diesel oil; Energy payback period; Energy requirements; GHG emission; Global energy demand; Low costs; Total energy; Dryers (equipment)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952017140

The model used in the analysis is a dynamic forest management optimisation model which includes the main carbon flows and benefits from the forest area: tree growth and mortality, litter accumulation, decomposition of dead wood and harvest residues, soil processes, end-use of wood products, and saved greenhouse gas emissions from using wood products instead of more energy intensive materials and fossil fuels. The overall harvest from the region is restricted to the present level, in order to see which carbon benefits can be achieved while keeping a steady supply of timber to the forest industry. Under this restriction, maximising carbon benefit decreases the net present value of timber revenue from the region by 21%. There is more planting and less thinning compared to when timber revenue is maximised. If substitution effects, i.e. saved greenhouse gas emissions from use of wood products, are included in the analysis, it is optimal with more planting and thinning, although the changes are small in this case study because harvest level is held constant. On the other hand, net present value of carbon benefit (in ton CO2-equivalent) is increased by 1.4-1.6 times when substitution effects are included. Changing forest management is a cost effective mitigation option. For a cost of € 0-10 per ton discounted CO2-equivalent, the net present value of carbon benefit from the area can be increased with 0.2-0.3 million tonnes CO2-equivalents on average in every year of the 120 years long planning horizon taking discounting into account (annuity). © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Clone libraries of PCR amplified genes were constructed using DNA extracted from deep-sea vent chimneys (Rainbow and Logatchev hydrothermal vent fields, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Atlantic Ocean; 9°N East Pacific Rise, Pacific Ocean) and from vertically subsampled sediment cores from cold-seep areas (Blake Ridge, western Atlantic Ocean; Florida Escarpment, Gulf of Mexico). Recombinant clones were screened by RFLP and representative dsrAB, mcrA and pmoA genes were sequenced. The dsrAB sequences grouped primarily within the orders Desulfobacterales, Syntrophobacterales and the Gram-positive order Clostridales. Cold-seep mcrA sequences were distributed among the ANME-2c, -2d and -2e groups, which were previously shown to be associated with the anaerobic oxidation of methane. This study also reports the first mcrA sequences from a high-temperature, black smoker chimney (Logatchev) to group within the ANME-2e subgroup. The majority of the remaining hydrothermal vent mcrA sequences were primarily related to thermophilic members of the anaerobic, methanogenic order Methanococcales. A shift in the dominant ANME-2 group with depth in the sediment for both Florida Escarpment and Blake Ridge mcrA libraries was detected. ANME-2d related clones were detected in the top zones of both cores, with the frequency of ANME-2e related clones increasing with depth. All pmoA sequences retrieved from the cold-seep sites were found to be related to Type I methanotrophic members of the γ-proteobacteria, and were primarily distributed among three major clusters of sequences. No Type II pmoA sequences related to methanotrophic members of the α-proteobacteria were detected, suggesting that the methanotrophic communities in these cold-seep areas are dominated by Type I γ-proteobacteria. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Hans Griem, considered the father of modern plasma spectroscopy, provided an excellent foundation for this research. He studied the effect of plasma particles, in particular the fast-moving free electrons, on the Stark-broadening of spectral line shapes in plasmas [H. Griem, Phys. Rev. 125 (1962) 177]. Over the last three decades, X-ray spectroscopy has been used to record the remarkable progress made in inertial confinement fusion research. Four areas of X-ray spectroscopy for laser-fusion experiments are highlighted in this paper: Kα emission spectroscopy to diagnose target preheat by suprathermal electrons, Stark-broadened K-shell emissions of mid-Z elements to diagnose compressed densities and temperatures of implosion cores, K- and L-shell absorption spectroscopy to diagnose the relatively cold imploding shell (the ""piston"") that does not emit X rays, and multispectral monochromatic imaging of implosions to diagnose core temperature and density profiles. The seminal research leading to the original X-ray spectroscopy experiments in these areas will be discussed and compared to current state-of-the-art measurements. © 2009.","Inertial confinement fusion; Laser fusion; Stark broadening; X-ray spectroscopy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350572792

The latter pathway, in particular, would be very efficient for long-term immobilization of U. In nature, Fe(II) is an important reducing agent for U(VI) because it frequently occurs either dissolved in natural waters, sorbed to matrix minerals, or structurally bound in many minerals. Redox reactions between U(VI) and Fe(II) depend not only on the availability of Fe(II) in the environment, but also on the chemical conditions in the aqueous solution. Under natural groundwater condition U(VI) forms complexes with many anionic ligands, which strongly affect its speciation. Carbonate, in particular, is known to form stable complexes with U, raising the question, if U(VI), when complexed by carbonate, can be reduced to UO2. The goal of this study was to find out if Fe(II) when structurally bound in a mineral (as magnetite, Fe3O4) or sorbed to a mineral surface (as corundum, Al2O3) can reduce U(VI) to U(IV) in the presence of HCO3-. Batch experiments were conducted under anaerobic conditions to observe U removal from the aqueous phase by the two minerals depending on HCO3- addition (1 mM), U concentration (0.01-30 μM) and pH value (6-10). Immediately after the experiments, the mineral surfaces were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to obtain information on the redox state of U bound to the solid surfaces. XPS results gave evidence that U(VI) can be reduced both by magnetite and by corundum amended with Fe(II). In the presence of HCO3- the amount of reduced U on the mineral surfaces increased compared to carbonate-free solutions. This can be explained by the formation of Fe(II) carbonates on the mineral surfaces which represent an easily available Fe(II) pool for the U(VI) reduction. A facilitated U(VI) reduction is also considered possible when U is present as a carbonate complex compared to non-complexed U (e.g. uranyl). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration acts as a fertilizer for plant growth. The fertilizing effects of carbon dioxide, as well as increased temperatures from climate change, increase pollen production and the allergen content of pollen grains. In addition, higher temperatures are changing the timing and duration of the pollen season. As regional climates change, plants can move into new areas and changes in atmospheric circulation can blow pollen-and spore-containing dust to new areas, thus introducing people to allergens to which they have not been exposed previously. Climate change also influences the concentrations of airborne pollutants, which alone, and in conjunction with aeroallergens, can exacerbate asthma or other respiratory illnesses. The few epidemiological analyses of meteorological factors, aeroallergens, and allergic diseases demonstrate the pathways through which climate can exert its influence on aeroallergens and allergic diseases. In addition to the need for more research, there is the imperative to take preventive and adaptive actions to address the onset and exacerbation of allergic diseases associated with climate variability and change.","Allergens; Allergic; Asthma; Atopic; Dermatitis; Greenhouse effect; Prevention and control; Rhinitis; Seasonal","Bacteria (microorganisms); allergen; air pollutant; greenhouse effect; human; immediate type hypersensitivity; immunology; meteorological phenomena; pollen; review; Air Pollutants; Allergens; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Hypersensitivity, Immediate; Meteorological Concepts; Pollen",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957360821

This paper explores the conditions under which firms participate in this endeavor. Building on theories of how social activists inspire changes in organizational norms, beliefs, and practices, we hypothesize that shareholder actions and regulatory threats are likely to prime firms to adopt practices consistent with the aims of a broader social movement. We find empirical evidence of direct and spillover effects. In the domain of private politics, shareholder resolutions filed against a firm and others in its industry increase a firm's propensity to engage in practices consistent with the aims of the related social movement. Similarly, in the realm of public politics, threats of state regulations targeted at a firm's industry as well as regulations targeted at other industries increase the likelihood that the firm will engage in such practices.

While new fire monitoring systems are based on fundamental Earth Systems Science (ESS) research, adaptation to the forecasting problem requires special procedures and simplifications. In a reciprocal manner, results from the air quality research community have contributed scientifically to basic ESS. To help exploit research and data products in climate, ESS, meteorology and air quality biomass burning communities, the joint Navy, NASA, NOAA, and University Fire Locating and Modeling of Burning Emissions (FLAMBE) program was formed in 1999. Based upon the operational NOAA/NESDIS Wild-Fire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (WF_ABBA) and the near real time University of Maryland/NASA MODIS fire products coupled to the operational Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) transport model, FLAMBE is a combined ESS and operational system to study the nature of smoke particle emissions and transport at the synoptic to continental scales. In this paper, we give an overview of the FLAMBE system and present fundamental metrics on emission and transport patterns of smoke. We also provide examples on regional smoke transport mechanisms and demonstrate that MODIS optical depth data assimilation provides significant variance reduction against observations. Using FLAMBE as a context, throughout the paper we discuss observability issues surrounding the biomass burning system and the subsequent propagation of error. Current indications are that regional particle emissions estimates still have integer factors of uncertainty. © 2009, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","Aerosol forecasting; biomass burning; modeling; satellite applications","Aerosol analysis; Biomass burning; Burning emissions; Continental scale; Data assimilation; Data products; Earth systems science; Fire monitoring systems; Fire products; Forecasting problems; Global monitoring; Integer factors; Near-real time; Operational systems; Optical depth; Particle emissions; Prediction systems; Propagation of error; Research communities; Satellite applications; Smoke particles; Smoke transport; Transport models; Transport patterns; University of Maryland; Variance reductions; Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Data processing; Fires; Forecasting; Models; NASA; Radiometers; Research; Smoke; Systems science; Uncertainty analysis; Biomass; aerosol; air quality; biomass burning; climate conditions; data assimilation; forecasting method; meteorology; MODIS; monitoring system; numerical model; optical depth; research program; satellite data; smoke",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959482733

Its economy grew at 4% in the year to June 2009, displaying a more resilient response than some of its neighbours. Fiscal stimulus measures, deft monetary policy and cash transfers to the poor served to soften the impact of the crisis. Parliamentary elections in April and presidential elections in July provided further economic stimulus. Election-related spending and the stimulus measures helped maintain formal sector employment levels and the proportion of casual employees in the workforce. Like the cash transfers, payments by parliamentary candidates to voters contributed to household incomes, particularly among the poor. This is reflected in widespread declines in poverty observed in 2009. The crisis, the stimulus package, the direct cash transfers and the election campaign spending combined to create a mechanism of income redistribution in favour of the poor. On 20 October Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Boediono were inaugurated as president and vice president for 2009-14. They announced key economic targets for 2014, including 7% economic growth, 5-6% unemployment and an 8-10% poverty level. It is crucial that the two leaders tackle important reforms - even politically sensitive ones - that will remove obstacles to faster and more employment-friendly growth. However, the plan for their first 100 days focuses on a series of small, politically non-sensitive reforms designed to demonstrate their commitment to, and create momentum for, wider reform. This strategy is unlikely to create an impression that the government is serious about more substantial and essential reforms. Nor is it likely to generate the economic impact necessary to bring the economy closer to the government's key economic targets. The slow expansion of infrastructure since the 1997-98 crisis is a major obstacle to future high and sustained economic growth. Despite some signs of improvement in recent years, Indonesia's rate of infrastructure investment remains far below pre-crisis levels. Tackling this problem should be a high priority for the government. While pursuing ways to grow faster, Indonesia - one of the world's largest CO2 emitters-needs to respond more vigorously to climate change. The leaders have pledged to place climate change mitigation high on their policy agenda. Yet little has been said about how, as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, Indonesia should support her people's adaptation to its effects. The government needs to give high priority to adaptation and promote it at the international level. © 2009 Indonesia Project ANU.",,"economic growth; economic impact; financial crisis; household income; monetary policy; political reform; poverty determinant; regional development; unemployment; Indonesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74749088888

This model is then applied to make predictions on vehicle emission levels on basis of the Austrian fleet composition until 2020. The output is compared to the results based on the most common emission tool for the calculation of vehicle emissions in Central Europe - the recent version (2.1) of the 'Handbook Emission Factors for Road Transport'. The discussion is focused on NOx and particulate matter (PM), since these pollutants are considered to be the most critical for the local air quality level. The NOx emission levels of recent modern diesel vehicle generations observed in several real world driving conditions were observed to be clearly higher than demanded in the type approval procedure. Due to the growing number of modern diesel engine concepts equipped with coated catalytic exhaust after treatment, the fraction of NO2 of the total tailpipe NOx emissions is predicted to continue to increase in the next few years. Bearing in mind the upcoming tightening of the NO2 air quality limits and the steady increase of traffic volumes, excesses of the NO2 air quality limits at roadside locations have to be expected to an increasing extent for the beginning of the next decade. The issue of particle emissions originated from the diesel engine combustion process can be regarded as being technically solved due to the extensive introduction of diesel particle filters in the vehicle fleet if these systems will prove a high efficiency over the entire vehicle life in real world operation conditions. However, PM emissions from road transport will continue to be in the focus of public attention due to particle emissions caused by dust re-suspension and abrasion processes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We expected the Pool species to show lower inter-annual variation than the Opportunistic species. This hypothesis was tested in a 10-year study of the species composition of the vegetation along two permanent transects. The results showed high cumulative species richness (95 species) with large differences between years and a predominance of annual species (77). The proportion of Pool species during these 10 years was low (39%) when compared to opportunists (61%). In dry years the Opportunistic species were dominant and declined during wet years. The number of Pool species was correlated with the amount of rainfall. A large number of these species revealed a preference for wet years. No negative interaction between annuals/perennials and pools/non-pools species was found, suggesting that competition was not a major process during the survey. The intensity of the drought and flood stress, related to climate fluctuations, seems to be the main factors controlling the species composition of the vegetation of this unstable habitat. However, beyond the inter-annual fluctuation of the species composition of the vegetation a directional change was noticed. This directional change could result from a recovery process of the vegetation during the first years of the study after a severe flood which extirpated most of the Opportunistic species of the pool. In the last years this directional change of the species composition of the vegetation is less clear and random recruitment of the Opportunistic species from the surrounding forested habitats could contribute to explain inter-annual changes. The data collected over these 10 years led to the speculation of hypotheses on the consequences of climate change. The expected reduction of humid years and of rainfall regionally may lead to important changes in the species composition of the vegetation of the temporary pools in Morocco. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Climate change; Hydrology; Inter-annual dynamics; Morocco; Plant community; Temporary pools","Climate fluctuations; Directional changes; First year; Interannual; Interannual variation; Negative interaction; Plant communities; Plant community; Recovery process; Species composition; Species richness; Temporary pools; Drought; Dynamics; Hydrology; Lakes; Metal recovery; Salinity measurement; Vegetation; Water; Climate change; annual variation; climate change; community dynamics; ephemeral pool; hypothesis testing; Mediterranean Water; plant community; precipitation assessment; vegetation dynamics; Africa; Morocco; North Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71349084123

This research compares a pedogenic carbonate record from southeastern Turkey with three other local or regional sources of palaeoenvironmental information in order to evaluate the correlation of this new proxy with other independent data from the area: (1) ancient plant macroremains from archaeological sites as ecological indicators, (2) stable carbon isotope composition of ancient plant macroremains available in the literature and from our own investigations in six mid-Holocene archaeological sites, and (3) modelled Holocene precipitation and temperature changes in the northern Fertile Crescent. Comparison involved selected palynological and isotopic data from lacustrine sediments as well as speleothem isotopic records in Near Eastern locations available in the literature. Although the data show a certain amount of variation of proxy records on the regional scale, for the northern Fertile Crescent (Upper Mesopotamia) they suggest three pronounced features of the Holocene environmental history: (1) a trend toward warmer temperatures may have affected the area during the early Holocene (between ca. 10,000-6000 cal BP), (2) increased moisture availability and relatively high temperatures in the mid-Holocene (ca. between 5000 and 4000 cal BP), and (3) a significant decrease in moisture availability around 4000 cal BP. Further research is needed to enhance the chronological resolution of both pedogenic carbonate and plant macrofossil records.

This article reports iF estimates for urban winter wood smoke emissions. We used two approaches, incorporating spatiotemporal statistical models for (1) winter wood smoke fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions and concentration and (2) concentrations of levoglucosan (a wood smoke particulate marker). Empirical data used in our models were measured in Vancouver, Canada during 2004-2005. We used Monte Carlo simulations to quantify uncertainty. The estimated geometric mean iF (units: per million) is 13 (one geometric standard deviation range: 6.6-24) for wood smoke PM2.5 and 15 (4.5-50) for levoglucosan. These iF estimates are comparable to or slightly larger than iF values for urban vehicle emissions reported in the literature.

One promising method is recently used by the USEPA. It employs a vertical radial plume mapping (VRPM) algorithm using optical remote sensing techniques. We evaluated this method to estimate emission rates from simulated distributed methane sources. A scanning open-path tunable diode laser was used to collect path-integrated concentrations (PICs) along different optical paths on a vertical plane downwind of controlled methane releases. Each cycle consists of 3 ground-level PICs and 2 above ground PICs. Three- to 10-cycle moving averages were used to reconstruct mass equivalent concentration plum maps on the vertical plane. The VRPM algorithm estimated emission rates of methane along with meteorological and PIC data collected concomitantly under different atmospheric stability conditions. The derived emission rates compared well with actual released rates irrespective of atmospheric stability conditions.

Thirteen metallic species have been considered. A comparison among the various roofing materials yields a ranking of their runoff pollution potential, which highlights that aluminum, coated products, and stainless steel display the lower emission levels, before zinc and copper materials. Lead materials appear to release more metallic species, and tend to do so in quite large quantities. Whatever the material family considered, older materials apparently release more metallic species with higher levels of emission. In considering zinc emissions from zinc-based materials, it is clear that surface coatings significantly reduce zinc emissions (40% less for the Zn 3(PO 4) 2 surface-treated Anthra zinc, compared to natural zinc; and 99% less for prepainted galvanized steel compared to standard galvanized steel). In the case of Anthra zinc however, surface treatment induces the release of Ni into the runoff, and Ni constitutes a priority pollutant in the European Water Framework Directive (2000/60 CE). A high level of consistency with literature data has been found for Zn runoff when considering runoff rates reported at the same inclination. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Coated products; Copper materials; Emission level; European Water Framework Directive; Field exposure; Galvanized steels; Literature data; Metal roofing; Metallic species; Priority pollutants; Roof runoff; Roofing materials; Runoff pollution; Runoff rates; Surface coatings; Alumina; Aluminum coated steel; Building materials; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Galvanized metal; Galvanizing; Roofs; Runoff; Stainless steel; Water conservation; Zinc; Surfaces; aluminum; copper; lead; metal; nickel; runoff; stainless steel; steel; zinc; aluminum; comparative study; construction material; database; European Union; lead; nickel; pollution monitoring; roof; steel; zinc; article; building material; chemical analysis; controlled study; data base; field study; France; material coating; urban area; water contamination; Aluminum; Construction Materials; Environmental Monitoring; France; Housing; Manufactured Materials; Metals; Models, Statistical; Nickel; Phosphates; Rain; Steel; Water Movements; Water Pollutants; Zinc; Zinc Compounds; Eurasia; Europe; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68049140916

Seawater-derived sulphate is a notable component only in the lower sandur (δ34S-SO4 = +6.8‰ VCDT). δ34S-SO4 in the Skeidará glacial melt river range from +3.4 to +8.8‰ δ34S. The higher values occur during a flood event and reflect geothermal sulphate contributions from the Grímsvötn caldera. 'Kettle-hole lakes' formed since the November 1996 jökulhlaup form important ecological niches and show evidence of coupled sulphide oxidation and carbonate and possibly silicate dissolution and have the lowest δ34S-SO4 values (average -0.8‰) attributed to higher proportions of sulphide oxidation-derived SO42- and/or bacterially mediated sulphide oxidation. The hydrochemistry of eastern sandur groundwater is influenced by a hydrothermal source of reduced sulphur from the Grímsvötn caldera or a localized area of geothermal springs, and contrasts with the hydrochemistry of the majority of groundwaters and the Sulá and Gígjukvísl rivers in western and central Skeidarársandur. These have lower [Ca2+ + Mg2+], [Na+ + K+] and SO4 2- concentrations and δ34S values consistent with sulphate derived from the oxidation of igneous sulphides. In comparison to catchments dominated by atmospherically transported sulphate, catchments such as this where the sulphur system is dominated by internal sources (rock-derived and geothermal) will not be sensitive to the temporal decreasing trends in contributions from long-range airborne sulphate resulting from reductions of sulphur emissions in North America and Europe.

We propose a new approach to global sustainability in which we define planetary boundaries within which we expect that humanity can operate safely. Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. We have identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing upon current scientific understanding, we propose quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere &lt;350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W m-2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80% of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone (&lt;5% reduction in O3 concentration from pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N yr-1) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use (&lt;4000 km3 yr-1 of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change (&lt;15% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of &lt;10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which we have not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading. We estimate that humanity has already transgressed three planetary boundaries: for climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle. Planetary boundaries are interdependent, because transgressing one may both shift the position of other boundaries or cause them to be transgressed. The social impacts of transgressing boundaries will be a function of the social-ecological resilience of the affected societies. Our proposed boundaries are rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps. Filling these gaps will require major advancements in Earth System and resilience science. The proposed concept of ""planetary boundaries"" lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the ""planetary playing field"" for humanity if we want to be sure of avoiding major human-induced environmental change on a global scale. © 2009 by the author(s).","Atmospheric aerosol loading; Biogeochemical nitrogen cycle; Biological diversity; Chemical pollution; Climate change; Earth; Global freshwater use; Land system change; Ocean acidification; Phosphorus cycle; Planetary boundaries; Stratospheric ozone; Sustainability","aerosol; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric pollution; biodiversity; climate change; Earth; environmental change; nature-society relations; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen fixation; radiative forcing; safety; saturation; seawater; social impact; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73849121092

Results obtained from the model are compared with a measure of anthropogenic habitat disturbance (Human Footprint). My results suggest a high probability of occurrence in large parts of southern Central America, at the northern and north-eastern coast of South America, and in the Andes of Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela. The Andean region harbouring a diverse amphibian fauna, which is highly threatened due to anthropogenic habitat alteration, appears to be at highest risk for further spread.

The following work presents an analysis of these impacts using the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions (CAMx). CAMx is a state-of-the-science, ""one-atmosphere"" Eulerian photochemical dispersion model that has been widely used in the assessment of gaseous and particulate air pollution (ozone, fine [PM 2.5], and coarse [PM10] particulate matter). Meteorology and emissions inventories developed by the Western Regional Air Partnership Regional Modeling Center for regional haze analysis and planning are used to establish an ozone baseline simulation for the year 2002. The predicted range of values for ozone in the national parks and other Class I areas in the western United States is then evaluated with available observations from the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET). This evaluation demonstrates the model's suitability for subsequent planning, sensitivity, and emissions control strategy modeling. Once the ozone baseline simulation has been established, an analysis of the model results is performed to investigate the regional impacts of oil and gas development on the ozone concentrations that affect the air quality of Class I areas. Results indicate that the maximum 8-hr ozone enhancement from oil and gas (9.6 parts per billion [ppb]) could affect southwestern Colorado and northwestern New Mexico. Class I areas in this region that are likely to be impacted by increased ozone include Mesa Verde National Park and Weminuche Wilderness Area in Colorado and San Pedro Parks Wilderness Area, Bandelier Wilderness Area, Pecos Wilderness Area, and Wheeler Peak Wilderness Area in New Mexico.

For some of the sites, small phyllosilicate outcrop sizes relative to the TES field of view likely hinder phyllosilicate mineral detection. Porous texture and/or small particle size (<∼60 μm) associated with the phyllosilicate-bearing surfaces may also contribute to non-detections in the thermal infrared data sets, in some areas. However, in Mawrth Vallis and Nili Fossae, low phyllosilicate abundance (<10-20 areal %, depending on the phyllosilicate composition) is the most likely explanation for non-detection. TES data over Mawrth Vallis indicate that phyllosilicate-bearing surfaces also contain significant concentrations (>15%, possibly up to ∼40%) of a high-silica phase such as amorphous silica or zeolite. High-silica phase abundance over phyllosilicate-bearing surfaces in Mawrth Vallis is higher than that of surrounding surfaces by 10-15%. With the exception of these high-silica surfaces in Mawrth Vallis, regions examined in this study exhibit similar bulk mineralogical compositions to that of most low-albedo regions on Mars; the MSL scientific payload will thus be able to provide important information on surface materials typical of low-albedo regions in addition to investigating the origin of phyllosilicate and/or sulfate deposits. With the exception of Gale crater, all of the landing sites have relatively low dust cover compared to classic high-albedo regions (Tharsis, Arabia and Elysium) and to previous landing sites in Gusev Crater, Utopia Planitia, and Chryse Planitia. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In Mexico, one household in four still cooks with biomass fuel, but there has been no evaluation of the health impact of reducing indoor air pollution. Objectives: To evaluate the health impact of the introduction of an improved biomass stove (Patsari; Interdisciplinary Group for Appropriate Rural Technology [GIRA], Patzcuaro, Mexico) in Mexican women. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Central Mexican state of Michoacán. Households were randomized to receive the Patsari stove or keep their traditional open fire. A total of 552 women were followed with monthly visits over 10 months to assess stove use, inquire about respiratory and other symptoms, and obtain lung function measurements. Statistical analysis was conducted using longitudinal models. Measurements and Main Results: Adherence to the intervention was low (50%). Women who reported using the Patsari stove most of the time compared with those using the open fire had significantly lower risk of respiratory symptoms (relative risk [RR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-0.95 for cough and RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.77 for wheezing) adjusted for confounders. Similar results were found for other respiratory symptoms as well as for eye discomfort, headache, and back pain. Actual use of the Patsari stove was associated with a lower FEV1 decline (31 ml) compared with the open fire use (62 ml) over 1 year of follow-up (P = 0.012) for women 20 years of age and older, adjusting for confounders. Conclusions: The use of the Patsari stove was significantly associated with a reduction of symptoms and of lung function decline comparable to smoking cessation.","Biomass fuels; Longitudinal models; Lung function tests; Respiratory symptoms","adult; article; backache; biomass; confounding variable; coughing; equipment; eye discomfort; female; forced expiratory volume; headache; household; human; longitudinal study; lung function; Mexico; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; risk factor; rural area; smoke; statistical analysis; stove; women's health; Adult; Air Pollution, Indoor; Biomass; Cookery; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Fires; Follow-Up Studies; Heating; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Longitudinal Studies; Mexico; Respiratory Function Tests; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Risk; Rural Population; Smoke; Spirometry; Women's Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349468017

This is critical to public policy since increasing the mode share of bicycling, commuter rail, and school bus has the potential to reduce emissions, save on expensive auto infrastructure, encourage healthier lifestyles, reduce congestion, and support liveable communities. The tour-based model presented in this paper simulates household interactions as part of the mode choice process. Model parameters are estimated using a choice-based sample of tours in the Toronto Area and a genetic algorithm. The model shows very good results for commuter rail and school bus modes, but limited success for the drive access subway, taxi, and bicycle modes.

The Michigan climate initiative involved combining a stepwise, fact-based, stakeholder decision process and technical analyses to formulate a consensus-based climate action plan. This paper reports on the results of work conducted by policy analysts and facilitators of the policy-making process in response to state government and stakeholder decisions on three key aspects. First is the choice of policy actions used to establish a comprehensive portfolio of actions and economy-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) goals and targets. Second is the design of policy instruments to use to implement these specific GHG mitigation actions. Third is the decision on whether the state should pursue its target for net GHG reduction through sector based policies and measures, a regional cap and trade program, or both combined. We summarize the results of applying a formal model for analyzing the implications of alternative environmental policies and instruments. The model was applied to data on the financial costs/savings and applicability of a spectrum of GHG reduction options developed by a consensus of stakeholders from all segments of the Michigan population. We conclude that a combination of sector-based measures and market incentive-based policies could attain a low cost, high co-benefit solution if Michigan joined with other Midwestern States in developing the cap and trade aspect of its climate action plan. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Climate change economics; Environmental policy instruments; Greenhouse gas mitigation costs; Regional cooperation; Stakeholder processes","action plan; climate change; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; implementation process; international cooperation; policy analysis; policy development; regional policy; stakeholder; Michigan; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70949085243

The a-Si:H Thin Film Transistor has enabled the active matrix liquid crystal display that has become the standard. However, the technology is still not perfect and suffers from visual artefacts, especially when trying to render video rate images. Field emission displays (FED) have promised to resolve these issues, but lithographic limitations in the technology have so far failed to deliver a technology that is truly manufacturable. Carbon nanotube technology has shown promise but also shows a number of limitations. This paper describes a new approach to field emission technology and a route to manufacture. Conventional FEDs utilise the confining effects of electric fields at sharp fabricated microtips. It has been found that laser processed hydrogenated amorphous silicon shows remarkable field emission properties that can be readily exploited in display manufacture. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon after breakdown in an electric field forms filamentary regions that show stable field emission. The structure after breakdown, or conditioning, may have an inhomogeneous nano-scale granular structure. The filamentary channels can be determined by the distribution of the nano-particles and act as the source of emission. Gated filaments are a route to low voltage emission. This concept has been extended to form a two dimensional plane for field emission, but without the breakdown or conditioning step. The interaction of profiled excimer laser beams with thin films of hydrogenated amorphous silicon in contact with certain metals leads to surface roughening and the creation of nano particles. There is little confinement of the external field, yet large enhancement factors are found and emission is found at low thresholds and without hysteresis. The laser processing creates the conditions for a high internal electric field that is responsible for field emission. The uniform nature of the emission and the surface roughening effect makes the material a suitable candidate for simple fabrication of displays using materials and tools that are familiar to the industry. The laser processed material is coated with an insulator and metal and etched to form self aligned gated structures that extract electrons at low voltage. The electrons impinge on a phosphor plate through a vacuum space to form a display that is potentially superior to existing flat panel displays in terms of cost, speed and power consumption.","Field emission displays; Hydrogenated amorphous silicon; Laser processing","Amorphous silicon; Carbon nanotubes; Electric fields; Excimer lasers; Flat panel displays; Hydrogenation; Laser beams; Liquid crystal displays; Liquid crystals; Manufacture; Nanoparticles; Thin film transistors; Thin films; A-Si:H thin film transistor; Active matrix liquid crystal displays; Carbon nanotube technology; Field emission property; Granular structuress; Internal electric fields; Laser process; Two dimensional plane; Field emission displays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76149103560

For the most part, the task of writing the history of air pollution regulation in this period has fallen to historians who been predisposed to play up the leadership of public health and women reformers, while playing down the role of business reformers and casting anti-regulation businessmen and their organizations as the villains against which the public health and women reformers struggled. This article will use an examination of movements to regulate industrial smoke and the stenches of the meatpacking industry in Chicago, New York City, St. Louis, and several other cities to tell a different, much more complex story, one that recognizes the business community's conflicted role in these movements. It will show that, while it is true that business interests actively opposed regulation, often bringing it to a standstill, they also played crucially important, positive leadership roles in movements whose success often hinged on the ability of environmental reformers to forge broad coalitions. It argues that only by investigating the ambiguities of business's complex role, including its leadership role, will historians be able to explain the political strategies that led to progress in these early movements to regulate industrial air pollution.","Business leadership in environmental reform; Pollution regulation in the U.S",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960569799

The lake with a mire showed large and synchronous changes in the planktonic to benthic (P: B) ratio of diatoms and concentrations of TOC inferred from near-infrared spectroscopy. During periods of warm temperatures, high precipitation, and long ice-free conditions, we inferred high TOC in the lake, and the diatom community was dominated by planktonic species. The stable carbon isotopic (δ13C) values of sediment organic matter were negatively correlated with inferred TOC concentration and P: B ratio. We suggest that the changes in TOC and P: B ratio were a result of changing climate, permafrost degradation, and related changes in the catchment. Terrestrial organic matter, by its strong effect on the penetration of light through the lake water, possibly affected the habitats available for benthic photosynthesis and thus the δ13C of the sediment organic matter. The large changes in recent times may also be because of unusually long ice-free periods, warmer temperatures, and other associated limnological changes. The lake with no mire next to the lake showed only minor changes in lake-water TOC during the same period and P: B ratio remained almost constant until the past 5 yr, when the P: B ratio increased rapidly. The observed changes in P: B ratio within this lake may be because of complex interactions of several climate-related variables. © 2009, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",,"benthos; climate effect; community dynamics; concentration (composition); diatom; dominance; lake ecosystem; mire; permafrost; photosynthesis; primary production; subarctic region; total organic carbon; Bacillariophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67949084933

But the world's land resources are far too varied in their soils, native and managed vegetation, water resources and climatic norms and extremes to expect that a single, globally comprehensive strategy can be applied to meet such goals. Rather, lessons to guide programs aimed at achieving sustainability can be assembled from experience gained in discrete geographic, climatic and edaphic regions. One such region is the semiarid to subhumid North American Great Plains (hereafter NAGP), a region that since settlement has experienced many periods of economic boom and many of economic distress. Originally a grassland, its vulnerability to soil erosion, environmental problems associated with the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and the overuse of surface and ground water is typical of other important grasslands converted to agriculture in South America and in the European and central Asiatic regions of the former Soviet Union. In addition, there is reason to believe that many of these grassland regions, most located in continental interiors, may be further stressed by climate changes caused by rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. One action that can potentially contribute to climate change mitigation is the production of herbaceous biomass, for which the NAGP region is well suited.

It explores how land use decisions will be affected by future changes in the climate, but also the feedbacks from land use change to the global climate system through greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. Past changes in land use were characterised by decreasing areas of agricultural use and increasing areas of forested and urbanised land. This has led to UK land use being a net sink for GHGs, mostly due to forestation. However, existing forests have on average passed their age for maximum net removals of carbon from the atmosphere. In the next decade at least, net removals from UK forests are likely to decrease significantly. Longer term scenarios of future land use change are consistent in their expectation of further declines in the agricultural area used for food production - offset to some extent by increased bioenergy cropping - along with increases in forested and urban areas. These trends are broadly consistent with the observed past land use change, but are calculated from various assumptions about future changes in drivers rather than by extrapolation from the past. Socio-economic and technological changes are likely to be the most important drivers for land use, with climate change having a smaller influence. The land use changes represented in these scenarios would likely reduce GHG emissions and enhance carbon sinks. These trends would be reinforced by small future changes in the climate, but large climatic changes are likely to cause net GHG fluxes to switch from being a sink to a source. Land use change will also be moderated by potential policy goals that seek to reduce GHG emissions from land and/or increase the size of land-based sinks. This includes strategies to reduce carbon and nitrogen emissions through increased efficiency, afforestation and biofuel production. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.","Carbon sources and sinks; Climate change; Greenhouse gas fluxes; Land use change","afforestation; agricultural land; bioenergy; biofuel; carbon emission; carbon sink; climate change; emission control; energy crop; energy efficiency; forest cover; greenhouse gas; land use change; land use location; land use planning; nitrogen; policy approach; socioeconomic impact; strategic approach; technological change; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73249125664

This implies that planning for sustainable urbanisation has the potential to minimise climate change threats. While there is a pressing need for this potential to be realised globally, the current level of success in fast growing cities of the developing world is very limited. An approach to overcome this limitation has recently been successful in Dhaka, one of the fastest growing global megacities. It involved the identification of a strategic framework for the city. This framework was then combined with a locally-informed model of sustainable urbanisation to produce the Dhaka Metropolitan Development Planning Support System (DMDPSS). This paper discusses the climate change adaptation and mitigation issues that can be addressed through such a method in Dhaka, using a scenario-based approach. Two alternative development options (constrained and unconstrained) are constructed and analysed. A common set of indicators are used: first to evaluate which alternative is more sustainable; and then the mitigation and adaptation issues addressed. Results show that the 'constrained' scenario, which includes a series of development limitations, is both more sustainable and can address more mitigation and adaptation issues than the other alternative. The scenario analysis, however, is only a part of the strategic framework needed for Dhaka. Indeed other factors, such as dissemination of facts and issues, and the ease and equity of communication in the community, are critical both for progress towards sustainability and to enhance community resilience to climate change. The paper concludes that the optimum combination of adaptation and mitigation measures can be identified in fast growing cities by using systems, such as the DMDPSS, based on the core principles of sustainable development. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

At this pressure, partition coefficients and separation factors for solanesol/nicotine were calculated for different initial nicotine/solanesol compositions and a strong influence of composition was found.

This alga is the source of plastids for the mollusc (sea slug) Elysia chlorotica which enable the animal to survive for months solely by photoautotrophic CO2 fixation. The 1633-bp V. litorea prk gene was cloned and the coding region, found to be interrupted by four introns, encodes a 405-amino acid protein. This protein contains the typical bipartite target sequence expected of nuclear-encoded proteins that are directed to complex (i.e. four membrane-bound) algal plastids. De novo synthesis of PRK and enzyme activity were detected in E. chlorotica in spite of having been starved of V. litorea for several months. Unlike the algal enzyme, PRK in the sea slug did not exhibit redox regulation. Two copies of partial PRK-encoding genes were isolated from both sea slug and aposymbiotic sea slug egg DNA using PCR. Each copy contains the nucleotide region spanning exon 1 and part of exon 2 of V. litorea prk, including the bipartite targeting peptide. However, the larger prk fragment also includes intron 1. The exon and intron sequences of prk in E. chlorotica and V. litorea are nearly identical. These data suggest that PRK is differentially regulated in V. litorea and E. chlorotica and at least a portion of the V. litorea nuclear PRK gene is present in sea slugs that have been starved for several months.","Alga; Calvin cycle; Elysia chlorotica; Kleptoplast; Mollusc; Phosphoribulokinase; Photosynthesis; Plastid; Redox regulation; Stramenopile; Symbiosis; Vaucheria litorea","algae; Animalia; Elysia chlorotica; Mollusca; Opisthobranchia; Vaucheria litorea; phosphoribulokinase; phosphotransferase; vegetable protein; amino acid sequence; animal; article; chemistry; enzymology; genetics; green alga; metabolism; molecular genetics; mollusc; nucleotide sequence; photosynthesis; plant; protein motif; sequence alignment; sequence homology; statistical model; Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Chlorophyta; Likelihood Functions; Molecular Sequence Data; Mollusca; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor); Photosynthesis; Plant Proteins; Plants; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71249149970

However, climate effects are not considered when cost-effective abatement targets for these pollutants are established, nor are they included in current international climate agreements. We construct air pollution abatement scenarios in 2030 which target cost-effective reductions in RF in the EU, USA, and China and compare these to abatement scenarios which instead target regional ozone effects and particulate matter concentrations. Our analysis covers emissions of PM (fine, black carbon and organic carbon), SO2, NOx, CH4, VOCs, and CO. We find that the effect synergies are strong for PM/BC, VOC, CO and CH4. While an air quality strategy targeted at reducing ozone will also reduce RF, this will not be the case for a strategy targeting particulate matter. Abatement in China dominates RF reduction, but there are cheap abatement options also available in the EU and USA. The justification for international cooperation on air quality issues is underlined when the co-benefits of reduced RF are considered. Some species, most importantly SO2, contribute a negative forcing on climate. We suggest that given current knowledge, NOx and SO2 should be ignored in RF-targeted abatement policies. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we assess future abatement strategies in terms of how much they reduce the climate impact of black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) from contained combustion. We develop global scenarios which take into account regional differences in climate impact, costs of abatement and ability to pay, as well as both the direct and indirect (snow-albedo) climate impact of BC and OC. To represent the climate impact, we estimate consistent region-specific values of direct and indirect global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature potential (GTP). The indirect GWP has been estimated using a physical approach and includes the effect of change in albedo from BC deposited on snow. The indirect GWP is highest in the Middle East followed by Russia, Europe and North America, while the total GWP is highest in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. We conclude that prioritizing emission reductions in Asia represents the most cost-efficient global abatement strategy for BC because Asia is (1) responsible for a large share of total emissions, (2) has lower abatement costs compared to Europe and North America and (3) has large health cobenefits from reduced PM10 emissions. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Munksgaard.",,"abatement cost; black carbon; climate effect; combustion; emission control; global warming; organic carbon; prioritization; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350559033

King County is a leader in the United States in the development and implementation of meaningful climate change efforts in local government. The county, in conjunction with ICLEI, recently produced a workbook on Preparing for Climate Change at the Local, Regional, and State levels. While the vast majority of local governments in the United States have only taken limited steps to respond to global warming, King County stands out as aggressively looking to move in a new direction. The King County Climate Plan is based on the conviction that climate change is both a problem and an opportunity for communities to improve environmental quality through mitigation of greenhouse gases and simultaneously build resilience to adapt to global climate change. Its exceptional combination of responsibilities in planning and opportunities makes this an invaluable experience to other local governments throughout the world. The work to be presented is a case study that examines the underlying issues and challenges faced by this jurisdiction in adopting its climate change plan; the development and adoption of the plan; issues associated with monitoring and sustaining these efforts; and the broader challenges of building more resilient and adaptive communities. The case study will focus both on procedural issues, as well as, on the types of mitigation and adaptive responses. One aspect of the paper will examine King County's efforts to link climate change efforts/policy/plans to other critical community concerns (e.g., issues of equity and race), and to the economic opportunities that have become critical motivators to successfully as moving forward the county attempts to establish itself as a global leader in meeting the challenges of global climate change. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This study is based on high-resolution sampling of two stratigraphic successions, located in Valdorbia (Umbria-Marche Apennines) and Monte Mangart (Julian Alps), Italy, which represent expressions of the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event in deep-water pelagic sediments. These successions are characterized by the occurrence of black shales showing relatively low total organic carbon concentrations (compared with coeval strata in Northern Europe), generally &lt;2% and low hydrogen indices. On this basis, they are similar to other Toarcian black shales described from the Tethyan region. The positive and negative carbon-isotope records from the two localities permit a high-resolution correlation such that ammonite biostratigraphy information from Valdorbia can be transferred to those parts of the Monte Mangart section that lack these fossils. Spectral analyses of δ13Corg values and of CaCO3 percentages from the sedimentary records of both the Valdorbia and Monte Mangart sections reveal a strong cyclic pattern, best interpreted as an eccentricity signal which hence implies a duration of ca 500kyr for the negative carbon-isotope excursion. Based on the carbon-isotope curves obtained, the high-resolution correlation between the Italian successions and a section in Yorkshire (Northern Europe) confirms the supposition that the apparent mismatch between the dating of the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event in the Boreal and Tethyan realms is an artefact of biostratigraphy. © 2009 The Authors.

Further, constituents such as bitumen or heavy oil are ill-defined on a molecular basis and their critical and other properties are not accessible experimentally. This imposes additional challenges for the development of reliable thermodynamic models. Group contribution methods that estimate thermodynamic properties based on measurable or known molecular structures present a computational option. In this contribution the appropriateness of group contribution methods proposed by Crampon et al. and Marrero and Gani in combination with the Peng-Robinson equation of state as a basis for such calculations is evaluated. Liquid-liquid-vapour three phase zones for ternary mixtures containing n-decylbenzene and n-eicosane + light hydrocarbons provide illustrative test cases. The results are compared to experimental data and to modeling results obtained using other thermodynamic models available in the literature. The performance of group contribution computations is further tested by predicting the phase behaviour trends that are observed experimentally for such mixtures. The results show that the group contribution method developed by Marrero and Gani out performs the Peng-Robinson equation of state by generating accurate phase behaviour and phase behaviour trend predictions for all cases evaluated. In combination with the group contribution based interaction parameter computation method (PPR78) developed by Jaubert et al., it has the potential to predict the phase behaviour of mixtures containing ill-defined hydrocarbons such as bitumen and heavy oil. Ill-defined hydrocarbon speciation continues to present significant experimental and computational challenges. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Although the general climate evolution of the south Pacific since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is coherent with terrestrial records in southern South America and Polynesia, the details of the dynamics of the shifting Westerlies, the South Pacific Convergence Zone and the South Pacific Anticyclone during the glacial-interglacial transition and the Holocene, and the large scale controls on precipitation in tropical and extratropical regions remain elusive. Here we present a high-resolution reconstruction of lake dynamics, watershed processes and paleohydrology for the last 34 000 cal yrs BP based on a sedimentological and geochemical multiproxy study of 8 cores from the Raraku Lake sediments constrained by 22 AMS radiocarbon dates. This multicore strategy has reconstructed the sedimentary architecture of the lake infilling and provided a stratigraphic framework to integrate and correlate previous core and vegetation studies conducted in the lake. High lake levels and clastic input dominated sedimentation in Raraku Lake between 34 and 28 cal kyr BP. Sedimentological and geochemical evidences support previously reported pollen data showing a relatively open forest and a cold and relatively humid climate during the Glacial period. Between 28 and 17.3 cal kyr BP, including the LGM period, colder conditions contributed to a reduction of the tree coverage in the island. The coherent climate patterns in subtropical and mid latitudes of Chile and Eastern Island for the LGM (more humid conditions) suggest stronger influence of the Antarctic circumpolar current and an enhancement of the Westerlies. The end of Glacial Period occurred at 17.3 cal kyr BP and was characterized by a sharp decrease in lake level conducive to the development of major flood events and erosion of littoral sediments. Deglaciation (Termination 1) between 17.3 and 12.5 cal kyr BP was characterized by an increase in lake productivity, a decrease in the terrigenous input and a rapid lake level recovery, inaugurating a period of intermediate lake levels, dominance of organic deposition and algal lamination. The timing and duration of deglaciation events in Easter Island broadly agree with other mid- and low-latitude circum South Pacific terrestrial records. The transition to the Holocene was characterized by lower lake levels. The lake level dropped during the early Holocene (ca 9.5 cal kyr BP) and swamp and shallow lake conditions dominated till mid Holocene, partially favored by the infilling of the lacustrine basin. During the mid- to late-Holocene drought phases led to periods of persistent low water table, subaerial exposure and erosion, generating a sedimentary hiatus in the Raraku sequence, from 4.2 to 0.8 cal kyr BP. The presence of this dry mid Holocene phase, also identified in low Andean latitudes and in Patagonian mid latitudes, suggests that the shift of storm tracks caused by changes in the austral summer insolation or forced by ""El Niño-like"" dominant conditions have occurred at a regional scale. The palm deforestation of the Easter Island, attributed to the human impact could have started earlier, during the 4.2-0.8 cal kyr BP sedimentary gap. Our paleoclimatic data provides insights about the climate scenarios that could favor the arrival of the Polynesian people to the island. If it occurred at ca AD 800 it coincided with the warmer conditions of the Medieval Climate Anomaly, whereas if it took place at ca AD 1300 it was favored by enhanced westerlies at the onset of the Little Ice Age. Changes in land uses (farming, intensive cattle) during the last century had a large impact in the hydrology and limnology (eutrophication) of the lake. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, various spatial disaggregation methods of traffic emissions of carbon monoxide are presented and evaluated for a large city (Santiago de Chile). Previous methods have used a simplified road network as a proxy for deriving spatial patterns of emissions. However, these approaches resulted in underestimation of emissions in urban centers, industrial zones and highly loaded roads, as well as overestimation in residential zones. Here we modify these methods by adding data correlated with the emissions (e.g. traffic counts, vehicles mean speed, road capacity) solving partially or completely the indicated problems. After an accuracy-simplicity analysis two methodologies stand out over the others: using traffic count classification and using a land use map, both combined with a simplified road network. Both are top-down approaches that correlate well (∼0.9) with the reference emissions and capture emission peaks (within 30% relative error). Hence the proposed changes allow an improved balance between accuracy and costs (monetary, availability of data and time to obtain data). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Temperature-dependent lifetime measurements have allowed us to measure a large splitting of ΔE= (6.0±0.2) meV between the dark and the bright exciton as well as the spin-flip rates between these two states.

With the aim of understanding the importance of nitrogen (N) uptake into developing embryos, we analysed two mutants of AAP1 (At1g58360), an amino acid transporter that was localized to Arabidopsis embryos. In mature and desiccated aap1 seeds the total N and carbon content was reduced while the total free amino acid levels were strongly increased. Separately analysed embryos and seed coats/endosperm of mature seeds showed that the elevated amounts in amino acids were caused by an accumulation in the seed coat/endosperm, demonstrating that a decrease in uptake of amino acids by the aap1 embryo affects the N pool in the seed coat/endosperm. Also, the number of protein bodies was increased in the aap1 endosperm, suggesting that the accumulation of free amino acids triggered protein synthesis. Analysis of seed storage compounds revealed that the total fatty acid content was unchanged in aap1 seeds, but storage protein levels were decreased. Expression analysis of genes of seed N transport, metabolism and storage was in agreement with the biochemical data. In addition, seed weight, as well as total silique and seed number, was reduced in the mutants. Together, these results demonstrate that seed protein synthesis and seed weight is dependent on N availability and that AAP1-mediated uptake of amino acids by the embryo is important for storage protein synthesis and seed yield. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Amino acid transport; Embryo; Endosperm; Nitrogen partitioning; Seed uptake; Storage protein","AAP1 protein, Arabidopsis; amino acid; amino acid transporter; Arabidopsis protein; carbon; messenger RNA; nitrogen; plant RNA; Arabidopsis; article; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant seed; prenatal development; Amino Acid Transport Systems, Neutral; Amino Acids; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Carbon; Nitrogen; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Plant; Seeds; Arabidopsis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68849103549

Using a computable general equilibrium model of the world economy, we explore the economic viability of hydrogen transportation in several different tax and carbon stabilisation policy scenarios. For each scenario, various combinations of hydrogen fuel price and vehicle mark-ups are used as inputs to explore what technological improvements in terms of cost reductions would be necessary for the technology to penetrate the market. The effect of introducing reduced-carbon fuel substitutes, such as ethanol-blend fuels, on the economic viability of hydrogen transportation is also explored. Hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles could make a significant contribution to decarbonisation of transportation if production of hydrogen itself is not carbon-intensive. For those involved in hydrogen research, this analysis provides cost targets that would need to be met for hydrogen transportation to be economically viable within the next century. Cost targets needed for the technology to penetrate in the USA are such that the hydrogen fuel would need to be in the range of 1 to 1.7 times the 1997 price of gasoline and the vehicle mark-up of an average fuel cell automobile would need to be no more than 1.3 to 1.5 times an average conventional vehicle.",,"fuel cell; general equilibrium analysis; hydrocarbon; research work; technological development; transportation economics; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350316535

We report here on the results from an extensive computer model developed over the last decade to simulate and compare the societal benefits of deploying various alternative transportation options including hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids fueled by gasoline, diesel fuel, natural gas, and ethanol, and all-electric vehicles powered by either batteries or fuel cells. These simulations compare the societal benefits over a 100-year time horizon of each vehicle/fuel combination in terms of reduced local air pollution, greenhouse gas pollution, and oil consumption compared to gasoline cars. The model demonstrates that partially electrified vehicles such as hybrids and plug-in hybrids will appreciably cut greenhouse gas pollution and oil consumption, particularly if biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol can displace a large amount of gasoline. But if we are to achieve an 80% reduction in greenhouse gases below 1990 levels, eliminate most oil imports and most urban air pollution, then society must transition to all-electric vehicles powered by some combination of fuel cells and batteries. We cannot achieve our transportation sector goals if most vehicles still rely on internal combustion engines for some of their motive power. We conclude that society must rely on a portfolio of alternative vehicles to achieve our societal objectives, beginning with hybrids, plug-in hybrids, biofuels, and transitioning to all-electric fuel cell and battery electric vehicles over time. © 2009 Professor T.

The objective of the study presented here was to determine the relationship between air pollution from particulate matter less than or equal to 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10; mostly PM2.5, or particulate matter &lt;2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter) and health effects measured as the daily number of deaths, hospital admissions, and emergency room visits for cardiovascular, respiratory, and acute respiratory infection (ARI) diseases. The Air Pollution Health Effects European Approach (APHEA2) protocol was followed, and a multivariate Poisson regression model was fitted, controlling for trend, seasonality, and confounders for Temuco during 1998-2006. The results show that PM10 had a significant association with daily mortality and morbidity, with the elderly (population &gt;65 yr of age) being the group that presented the greatest risk. The relative risk for respiratory causes, with an increase of 100 μg/m3 of PM10, was 1.163 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.057-1.279 for mortality, 1.137 (CI 1.096-1.178) for hospital admissions, and 1.162 for ARI (CI 1.144-1.181). There is evidence in Temuco of positive relationships between ambient particulate levels and mortality, hospital admissions, and ARI for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. These results are consistent with those of comparable studies in other similar cities where wood smoke is the most important air pollution problem.

It emphasizes thatit is not the growth in (urban or rural) populations thatdrives the growth in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but rather, the growth in consumers and in their levels of consumption. A significant proportion of the world's urban (and rural) populations have consumption levels thatare so low thatthey contribute little or nothing to such emissions. If the lifetime contribution to GHG emissions of a person added to the world's population varies by a factor of more than 1,000 depending on the circumstances into which they are born and their life choices, it is misleading to see population growth as the driver of climate change. A review of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions levels for nations, and how they changed between 1980 and 2005 (and also between 1950 and 1980), shows little association between nations with rapid population growth and nations with high GHG emissions and rapid GHG emissions growth; indeed, it is mostly nations with very low emissions per person (and often only slowly growing emissions) thathave had the highest population growth rates. The paper also discusses how in the much-needed planning for global emissions reduction, provision must be made to allow low-income, low-consumption households with GHG emissions per person below the global ""fair share"" level to increase their consumption. © 2009 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).","Climate change; Consumption; Greenhouse gas emissions; Population growth; Urbanization","carbon dioxide; climate change; emission control; environmental planning; greenhouse gas; growth rate; population growth; urban population; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350134452

This study investigates chemical and H, C, N, O isotopic changes in high volatile bituminous coal near two Illinois dike contacts and compares observed patterns and trends with data from other published studies and from artificial maturation experiments. Our study pioneers in quantifying isotopically exchangeable hydrogen and measuring the D/H (i.e., 2H/1H) ratio of isotopically non-exchangeable organic hydrogen in kerogen near magmatic contacts. Thermal stress in coal caused a reduction of isotopically exchangeable hydrogen in kerogen from 5% to 6% in unaltered coal to 2-3% at contacts, mostly due to elimination of functional groups (e.g., {single bond}OH, {single bond}COOH, {single bond}NH2). In contrast to all previously published data on D/H in thermally matured organic matter, the more mature kerogen near the two dike contacts is D-depleted, which is attributed to (i) thermal elimination of D-enriched functional groups, and (ii) thermal drying of hydrologically isolated coal prior to the onset of cracking reactions, thereby precluding D-transfer from relatively D-enriched water into kerogen. Maxima in organic nitrogen concentration and in the atomic N/C ratio of kerogen at a distance of ∼2.5 to ∼3.5 m from the thicker dike indicate that reactive N-compounds had been pyrolytically liberated at high temperature closer to the contact, migrated through the coal seam, and recombined with coal kerogen in a zone of lower temperature. The same principle extends to organic carbon, because a strong δ13Ckerogen vs. δ15Nkerogen correlation across 5.5 m of coal adjacent to the thicker dike indicates that coal was functioning as a flow-through reactor along a dynamic thermal gradient facilitating back-reactions between mobile pyrolysis products from the hot zone as they encounter less hot kerogen. Vein and cell filling carbonate is most abundant in highest rank coals where carbonate δ13CVPDB and δ18OVSMOW values are consistent with thermal generation of 13C-depleted and 18O-enriched CO2 from decarboxylation and pyrolysis of organic matter. Lower background concentrations of 13C-enriched carbonate in thermally unaffected coal may be linked to 13C-enrichment in residual CO2 in the process of CO2 reduction via microbial methanogenesis. Our compilation and comparison of available organic H, C, N isotopic findings on magmatic intrusions result in re-assessments of majors factors influencing isotopic shifts in kerogen during magmatic heating. (i) Thermally induced shifts in organic δD values of kerogen are primarily driven by the availability of water or steam. Hydrologic isolation (e.g., near Illinois dikes) results in organic D-depletion in kerogen, whereas more common hydrologic connectivity results in organic D-enrichment. (ii) Shifts in kerogen (or coal) δ13C and δ15N values are typically small and may follow sinusoidal patterns over short distances from magmatic contacts. Laterally limited sampling strategies may thus result in misleading and non-representative data. (iii) Fluid transport of chemically active, mobile carbon and nitrogen species and recombination reactions with kerogen result in isotopic changes in kerogen that are unrelated to the original, autochthonous part of kerogen. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

During a period of one year, the SkySails-System was tested on a research ship (MS ""Beaufort""). Based on measurements, a mathematical model for the kite power was developed. The energy savings and emission reduction potentials for several mercantile ship types using the SKS-System on 15 international routes are calculated: For a 600 m2 kite fitted to a typical multipurpose freighter travelling at 15knots on e.g. the north Atlantic route (with high wind potential), a saving of energy from 5% (East-West- direction) to 21% (West-East-direction) can be expected in average.

Due to their high electrical efficiencies as well as fuel and application flexibilities, high temperature fuel cells offer great potential to meet the demands of the future energy supply. The fuel gases hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which are electrochemically convertible in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), have to be generated by reformation or gasification of hydrocarbons, or in the case of pure hydrogen, as fuel gas, by electrolysis. For these generating processes energy is required. This generally leads to a deterioration of SOFCsystem efficiencies. At state of the art combined processes, the reformation or gasification reactor and the SOFC are usually separated. The heat required for the endothermic reforming is generated by partial oxidation (POx) of the supplied fuel or by using the waste heat of the exhaust gases. At the Institute for Heat- and Fuel-Technology of the Technische Universität Braunschweig, an innovative planar SOFC-stack-design with indirect internal reforming and without bipolar plates was developed. Due to the thermal and material couplings, the SOFC-waste heat can be directly used to supply the endothermic reforming process. Additionally, a part of the hot anode off-gas, consisting mainly of water vapor, is recycled as a reforming agent. Therefore, based on the principle of the chemical heat pump, depending on the fuel used, system efficiencies of more than 60% can be achieved, even though the SOFC itself reached only an electrical efficiency of approximately 50%. Additionally, due to the cascaded SOFC structure resulting in high fuel utilization, postcombustion of the waste gases is no longer necessary. Because of the SOFC membrane allowing only an oxygen-ion flow and thus representing an air separation unit and the SOFC design without the mixing of anode and cathode flows, a simple CO2-separation can be realized by condensing the water vapor out of the anode off-gas. Another advantage of the newly developed stack design is its parallel interconnection, which leads to higher reliability concerning single stack levels. The aim of the work was a first dimensioning of the new stack design for natural gas as a fuel and its energetical analysis concerning operation and feasibility.

This assessment pertains to the aerosol at its ambient concentration and thermodynamic state (i.e., σep (X) either free of or corrected for sampling artifacts) and includes the following ACRF routine methods: Raman lidar, micropulse lidar (MPL), and in situ aerosol profiles (LAP) with a small aircraft. Profiles of aerosol optical depth τp(λ), from which the profiles of σep (λ) are derived through vertical differentiation, were measured by the NASA Ames Airborne Tracking 14-channel Sun photometer (AATS-14); these data were used as benchmark in this evaluation. The ACRF IAP σep (550 nm) were lower by 11% (during AIOP) and higher by 1% (during ALIVE) when compared to AATS-14. The ACRF MPL σep(523 nm) measurements were higher by 24% (AIOP) and 19-21% (ALIVE) compared to AATS-14, but the correlation improved significantly during ALIVE. In the AIOP, a second MPL operated by NASA showed a smaller positive bias (13%) with respect to AATS-14. The ACRF Raman lidar σep (355 nm) measurements were larger by 54% (AIOP) and by 6% (ALIVE) compared to AATS-14. The large bias in the Raman lidar measurements during AIOP stemmed from a gradual loss of Raman lidar sensitivity starting about the end of 2001 going unnoticed until after AIOP. A major refurbishment and upgrade of the instrument and improvements to a data processing algorithm led to the significant improvement and very small bias in ALIVE. Finally, we find that during ALIVE the Raman lidar water vapor densities ρw are 8% larger when compared to AATS-14, whereas in situ measured ρw aboard two different aircraft are smaller than the AATS-14 values by 0.3-3%.",,"Aircraft; Atmospheric radiation; Data processing; Electromagnetic waves; Light extinction; NASA; Optical radar; Radiometry; Water vapor; Aerosol extinction; Aerosol lidars; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol profiles; Airborne tracking; Ambient concentrations; Atmospheric radiation measurement programs; Climate research; Data processing algorithms; Field campaign; In-situ; Operation period; Positive bias; Raman LIDAR; Raman lidar measurement; Routine method; Sampling artifacts; Small aircraft; Sun photometers; Thermodynamic state; Vertical differentiation; Vertical profile; Water vapor density; Water vapor profile; Atmospheric aerosols; accuracy assessment; aerosol property; algorithm; concentration (composition); lidar; photometer; radiation budget; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72049095054

However, there are historical examples where new products or technologies expanded rapidly and achieved a high output in a relatively short period of time. This paper explores the possibility of a 'technological breakthrough' in the renewable energy sector, using a partial equilibrium model of energy generation with endogenous R&D. Our results indicate, that due to increasing returns-to-scale, a multiplicity of equilibria can arise. In the model, two stable states can coexist, one characterized by a lower and one by higher supply of renewable energy. The transition from the low-output to the high-output equilibrium is characterized by a discontinuous rise in R&D activity and capacity investments in the renewable energy sector. The transition can be triggered by a rise in world energy demand, by a drop in the supply of fossil fuels, or by policy intervention. Under market conditions, the transition occurs later than in the social optimum. Hence, we identify a market failure related to path-dependence and technological lock-in, that can justify a strong policy intervention initially. Paradoxically, well-intended energy-saving policies can actually lead to higher emissions, as they reduce the incentives to invest in renewable energies by having a cushioning effect on the energy price. Hence, these policies should be supplemented by other instruments that restore the incentives to invest in renewable energies. Finally, we discuss the influence of monopoly power in the market for innovations. We show that market power can alleviate the problem of technological lock-in, but creates a new market failure that reduces static efficiency. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

One exception is the class of hydrogen bonds donated by heterocyclic side chain carbons. Histidine is capable of particularly strong interactions through the Cε1 and Cδ2 carbons when the imidazole is protonated or bound to metal. Given the frequent occurrence of metal-bound histidines in metalloproteins, we characterized the energies of these interactions through DFT calculations on model compounds. Imidazole-water hydrogen bonding could vary from -11.0 to -17.0 kcal/mol, depending on the metal identity and oxidation state. A geometric search of metalloprotein structures in the PDB identified a number of candidate His C-H···O hydrogen bonds which may be important for folding or function.

X-ray scattering in combination with heavy-atom labeling is a powerful and highly appropriate method to reveal the position of a certain amino acid residue within a lipid bilayer with respect to the membrane normal axis up to a resolution of several ångstrøm. Herein, we report the synthesis of a new iodine-labeled amino acid building block. This building block is intended for peptide incorporation to provide high intensities for electron density difference analysis of X-ray reflectivity data and improve the labeling potential for the lipid bilayer head-group and water region. The novel building block as well as the commercially available non-iodinated analogue, required for X-ray scattering, was implemented in a transmembrane peptide motif via manual solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) following the fluorenylmethyl-oxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-strategy The derived peptides were reconstituted in lipid vesicles as well as in highly aligned multilamellar lipid stacks and investigated via circular dichroism (CD) and X-ray reflectivity. Thereby, it has been revealed that the bulky iodine probe neither causes conformational change of the peptide structure nor lamellar disordering of the membrane complexes. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Four periods of 5-7 days were chosen, one from each season, which had wind pattern characteristics representative of typical local climatological conditions, in order to study the local versus non-local impacts on ozone transport and formation. To account for the complex terrain, the horizontal resolution of the smallest modelling domain was 3 km. Model results were compared with measurements to demonstrate the capability of the model to reproduce ozone concentrations in the region. The comparison was favourable with a mean bias of -1.1 ppb. The importance of local emissions on ozone formation and destruction was identified with the use of three different emission scenarios. Generally the influence of regional emissions on the average ozone concentration was small. However during periods when mountain-sea wind systems were well developed and synoptic scale winds were weak, the influence of local emissions from the urban area was at its greatest.

Whereas the molecular biology polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis approach provides a deeper insight into the bacterial biofilm diversities, Raman spectrometry analyses the chemical composition of the extracellular polymer substances (EPS), microorganisms embedded in EPS as well as other substances inside biofilm (inorganic compounds and humic substances). Microscopy images the spatial distribution of biofilms on the two different filter materials. In addition, bacterial bulk water populations were compared with biofilm consortia using the molecular fingerprint technique mentioned. Population analysis demonstrated the presence of more diverse bacterial species embedded in a matrix of EPS (polysaccharides, peptides, and nucleic acids) on the sand filter materials. In contrast to this, activated carbon granules were colonised by reduced numbers of bacterial species in biofilms. Besides α-, β-, and γ-Proteobacteria, a noticeable specific colonisation with Actinobacteria was found on activated carbon particles. Here, the reduced biofilm formation came along with a decreased EPS synthesis. The taxonomy profiles of the different biofilms revealed up to 60% similarity on the same filter materials and 32% similarity of different materials. Similarity of adherent communities from filter materials and bulk water populations from the filter effluent varied between 36% and 58% in sand filters and 6-40% in granular activated carbon filters.

Direct absorption by ozone is also calculated and averages 10% of that of BC below 4 km but becomes dominant above this altitude. Variability in BC absorption is large due to source variability and clouds. Average BC heating rates are much smaller than those associated with BC and other absorbing aerosol components in global hotspot regions.

Using gridded output of atmospheric deposition from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, the Watershed Deposition Tool (WDT) calculates average per unit area and total deposition to selected watersheds and subwatersheds. CMAQ estimates the wet and dry deposition for all of its gaseous and particulate chemical species, including ozone, sulfur species, nitrogen species, secondary organic aerosols, and hazardous air pollutants at grid scale sizes ranging from 4 to 36 km. An overview of the CMAQ model is provided. The somewhat specialized format of the CMAQ files is not easily imported into standard spatial analysis tools. The WDT provides a graphical user interface that allows users to visualize CMAQ gridded data and perform further analyses on selected watersheds or simply convert CMAQ gridded data to a shapefile for use in other programs. Shapefiles for the 8-digit (cataloging unit) hydrologic unit code polygons for the United States are provided with the WDT; however, other user-supplied closed polygons may be used. An example application of the WDT for assessing the contributions of different source categories to deposition estimates, the contributions of wet and dry deposition to total deposition, and the potential reductions in total nitrogen deposition to the Albemarle-Pamlico basin stemming from future air emissions reductions is used to illustrate the WDT capabilities. © 2009 American Water Resources Association.","Atmospheric deposition; Management tool; Nitrogen loading; Total Maximum Daily Load; Watershed analysis","Atmospheric deposition; Management tool; Nitrogen loading; Total Maximum Daily Load; Watershed analysis; Aerosols; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospherics; Graphical user interfaces; Hydraulic models; Landforms; Meteorological problems; Nitrogen; Organic pollutants; Ozone; Sulfur; Watersheds; Deposition; air quality; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; spatial analysis; visualization; water quality; watershed; Albemarle Basin; North America; North Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68749108536

One of these issues is how best to deal with the impacts of climate change on our nation's treasured landscapes. Fortunately, a recent surge of research and theorizing in the social sciences on communication about climate change can inform natural resource communication efforts. What insights can scholars share with communication practitioners and public land managers? What communication principles will help them create effective strategies for communicating about climate change? How can scholars best communicate the complexity of climate change impacts and nuances of changes at landscape scales? To begin to address these questions, Colorado State University researchers, in partnership with the Office of the Governor of the State of Colorado, hosted a 3-day workshop on the challenges and opportunities associated with communicating about climate change on public lands in the western United States.

Iowa produces more ethanol than any other state in the United States, and it also produces the most corn. Thus, an examination of the impacts of higher crop prices on CRP land in Iowa can give insight into what we might expect nationally in the years ahead if crop prices remain high. We construct CRP land supply curves for various corn prices and then estimate the environmental impacts of cropping CRP land through the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model. EPIC provides edge-of-field estimates of soil erosion, nutrient loss, and carbon sequestration. We find that incremental impacts increase dramatically as higher corn prices bring into production more and more environmentally fragile land. Maintaining current levels of environmental quality will require substantially higher spending levels. Even allowing for the cost savings that would accrue as CRP land leaves the program, a change in targeting strategies will likely be required to ensure that the most sensitive land does not leave the program. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Agricultural markets; Conservation Reserve Program; Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model; Environmental quality; Ethanol","Agricultural markets; Agricultural productions; Carbon sequestration; Conservation Reserve Program; Corn-based ethanol; Cost saving; Current levels; Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model; Environmental policy integrated climate models; Environmental quality; Environmentally sensitive; Growing demand; Land supply; Nutrient loss; Soil erosion; Agricultural products; Agricultural runoff; Costs; Crops; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Erosion; Ethanol; Environmental protection; alcohol; agricultural market; agricultural practice; carbon sequestration; climate modeling; conservation management; cost-benefit analysis; cropping practice; environmental impact; environmental policy; environmental quality; ethanol; maize; nutrient loss; savings; soil erosion; sustainable development; alcohol production; article; carbon sequestration; climate; controlled study; corn; cost; cost control; crop production; environment; environmental impact; environmental protection; land use; model; nutrient; policy; soil erosion; United States; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Costs and Cost Analysis; Ethanol; Iowa; Zea mays; Iowa; North America; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349772928

It focuses on the possibilities of cofiring SARs with sugarcane bagasse, a similar physicochemical resource which is currently being commercially converted into electricity in state-of-the-art cogeneration plants. It also assesses the climate mitigation potentials of the resource through its eligibility for Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) as well as its socioeconomic benefits. A mix of 70% bagasse and 30% SARs was found to be the most appropriate cofiring option to avoid slagging in furnaces due to the inherent high ash content of SARs; this scenario required a 35% collection of SARs from sugarcane fields, which would increase the net export of surplus electricity in cogeneration plants by around 37% per tonne of cane harvested. SAR conversion into electricity is estimated to displace around 230 kg of subbituminous coal and 560 kg of CO2 per tonne. This feature can enable such a project to be eligible for CERs in line with bagasse cogeneration plants, which already qualify for these emission reductions.

Across all sites (n = 56), sedimentary C:N was primarily related to variables reflecting allochthonous organic matter and nutrient fluxes, with 67% of the variance explained by watershed vegetation type, watershed area, mean slope, and salmon spawner densities. In a subset of sites with nutrient data (n = 41), 63% of variance in C: N was explained by precipitation and watershed vegetation type. Sediment &lt;515N was most strongly related to salmon spawner densities, but C:N and watershed area: lake area ratios explained significant residual variance (total 55%). In sites with nutrient data, salmon spawner densities, vegetation type, and spring nitrate explained 62% of the variance in δ15N. Sediment C: N and δ15N values exhibited distinct interregional variation, typically varying inversely. Regional δ15N-salmon density relationships (regression slopes) varied strongly with total annual precipitation (r2 = 0.89, p = 0.016, n = 5), suggesting watershed organic matter and nutrient loading vary predictably in relation to regional biogeoclimatic conditions.

The cellular role of selenoprotein T (SelT), manifesting a CxxU motif in a thioredoxin-like fold and localized to Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum, is not known. To examine its biological function, we knocked down SelT expression in mouse fibroblast cells and found that SelT deficiency alters cell adhesion and enhances the expression of several oxidoreductase genes, while decreasing the expression of genes involved in cell structure organization, suggesting the involvement of SelT in redox regulation and cell anchorage. Furthermore, we found that the loss of SelT elevates expression of another selenoprotein, selenoprotein W (SepW1).

Purpose: This study tested the effect of college-level contextual factors on students' binge drinking. Methods: The 2006 National College Health Assessment data collected from 76,542 students in 113 U.S. 4-year colleges were analyzed using the Hox five-step hierarchical random effects logistic regression models. Results: College-level variables, such as percentages of male students, marijuana users, Black students, and students with Greek affiliation, significantly predicted students' binge drinking above and beyond student-level predictors. An intraclass correlation was 0.10 in the null model, indicating that 10% of students' binge drinking could be explained by differences among colleges. Significant cross-level interactions were found between college-level variables and student-level variables. Conclusions: In order to reduce binge drinking in college, the findings underscore the need for active intervention within the college climate that addresses drinking. © 2010 The Society of Behavioral Medicine.","Binge drinking; College climate; Multilevel model","alcohol; adult; article; cannabis addiction; drinking behavior; ethnic group; female; human; male; psychological aspect; questionnaire; sex difference; statistical model; statistics; student; United States; university; Alcohol Drinking; Ethanol; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Logistic Models; Male; Marijuana Abuse; Questionnaires; Sex Factors; Students; United States; Universities; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949918370

Both in developed and developing countries, subsidies are implemented under two major premises: (1) to increase public transport use and to reduce externalities, such as greenhouse gas emissions and congestion, and (2) to make transport more affordable, particularly for the poorest. This paper focuses on the latter. Despite the widespread implementation of subsidies, there are virtually no quantitative assessments of their distributional incidence, making it impossible to determine if these policy instruments are pro-poor. Using different tools to quantitatively evaluate the incidence and distributive impacts of subsidy policy options, this paper analyses the findings of a series of research papers that have studied urban public transport subsidy policies in developed and developing countries. Available evidence indicates that current public urban transport subsidy policies do not make the poorest better off. Supply side subsidies-provided to the operator-are, for the most part, neutral or regressive; while demand side subsidies-provided to the user-perform better, although many of them do not improve income distribution. Considering that the vast majority of developing countries justify public urban transport subsidies on social grounds, as a means to improve the mobility, and thus welfare, of the poorest, it is imperative to move away from supply side subsidies towards demand side subsidies and integrate transport social concerns into wider poverty alleviation efforts, which include the possibility of channelling subsidies through monetary transfer systems or through other welfare instruments (food subsidies, health services and education for the poor). © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",,"developing world; income distribution; policy implementation; public transport; socioeconomic impact; subsidy system; transportation policy; urban transport; welfare impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449120605

During the last 40years, however, India has witnessed a decline in gravity-flow irrigation and the rise of a booming 'water-scavenging' irrigation economy through millions of small, private tubewells. For India, groundwater has become at once critical and threatened. Climate change will act as a force multiplier; it will enhance groundwater's criticality for drought-proofing agriculture and simultaneously multiply the threat to the resource. Groundwater pumping with electricity and diesel also accounts for an estimated 16-25 million mt of carbon emissions, 4-6% of India's total. From a climate change point of view, India's groundwater hotspots are western and peninsular India. These are critical for climate change mitigation as well as adaptation. To achieve both, India needs to make a transition from surface storage to 'managed aquifer storage' as the center pin of its water strategy with proactive demand- and supply-side management components. In doing this, India needs to learn intelligently from the experience of countries like Australia and the United States that have long experience in managed aquifer recharge. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.","adaptation; climate change; groundwater; India; irrigation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958598969

A composite analysis approach was used to identify linkages between extreme flow and timing measures and climate indices. The approach involves determining the 10 highest and 10 lowest values of various climate indices from the data record. Extreme flow and timing measures for each station were examined for the years associated with the 10 largest values and the years associated with the 10 smallest values. In each case, a re-sampling approach was applied to determine if the 10 values of extreme flow measures differed significantly from the series mean. Results indicate that several stations are impacted by the large scale climate indices considered in this study. The results allow the determination of any relationship between stations that exhibit a statistically significant trend and stations for which the extreme measures exhibit a linkage with the climate indices.","Canada; Climate change; Flood analysis; Low-flow events; Trend analysis","Canada; Climate index; Composite analysis; Data records; Extreme flows; High flow; Hydrometric stations; Large scale climate signals; Local scale; Low flow; Low-flow events; Re-sampling approach; Reference hydrometric basin networks; Teleconnections; Trend analysis; Engineering; Technology; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871148603

Land management practices, therefore, are sought that will reduce erosion and PM10 emissions during the summer fallow phase of the rotation. Horizontal soil flux and PM10 concentrations above adjacent field plots (&gt;2 ha), with plots subject to conventional or undercutter tillage during summer fallow, were measured using creep and saltation/suspension collectors and PM10 samplers installed at various heights above the soil surface. After wheat harvest in 2004 and 2005, the plots were either disked (conventional) or undercut with wide sweeps (undercutter) the following spring and then periodically rodweeded prior to sowing wheat in late summer. Soil erosion from the fallow plots was measured during six sampling periods over two years; erosion or PM10 loss was not observed during two periods due to the presence of a crust on the soil surface. For the remaining sampling periods, total surface soil loss from conventional and undercutter tillage ranged from 3 to 40 g m-2 and 1 to 27 g m-2 while PM10 loss from conventional and undercutter tillage ranged from 0·2 to 5·0 g m-2 and 0·1 to 3·3 g m-2, respectively. Undercutter tillage resulted in a 15% to 65% reduction in soil loss and 30% to 70% reduction in PM10 loss as compared with conventional tillage at our field sites. Therefore, based on our results at two sites over two years, undercutter tillage appears to be an effective management practice to reduce dust emissions from agricultural land subject to a winter wheat-summer fallow rotation within the Columbia Plateau. © 2009 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Air quality; Particulates; PM10; Wind erosion","Aerodynamic diameters; Agricultural land; Columbia Plateau; Conventional tillage; Dust emission; Effective management; Fallow plots; Field plot; Land management practices; National Ambient Air Quality Standards; Pacific Northwest; Particulate Matter; Particulates; PM10; PM10 concentration; PM10 emissions; Sampling period; Soil erosion; Soil flux; Soil loss; Soil surfaces; Summer fallow; Surface soil; US Environmental Protection Agency; Wheat harvest; Wind erosion; Wind erosions; Wind-blown dust; Winter wheat; Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Air quality; Dust; Environmental Protection Agency; Land use; Rotation; Soils; Wastewater treatment; Erosion; agricultural land; air quality; dust; fallow; land management; management practice; particulate matter; soil erosion; soil surface; tillage; wind erosion; Columbia Plateau; North America; United States; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69749120966

Six landscape strategies were studied, using different combinations of trees, lawn, and an overhead shade mesh. The effects of these treatments were tested during the summer season in two semi-enclosed courtyards located at an urban settlement in the arid Negev Highlands of southern Israel. Compared to a non-vegetated exposed courtyard, which on average reached a maximum air temperature of 34 °C in mid-afternoon, a similar courtyard treated with shade trees and grass yielded a daytime temperature depression of up to 2.5 K, while shading the courtyard with a fabric shading mesh, counter-intuitively, caused a relative increase of nearly 1 K. Unshaded grass was found to cause only a small air temperature depression and had the highest water requirement. However when the grass was shaded, either by the trees or by the shade mesh, a synergic effect produced greater cooling as well as a reduction of more than 50% in total water use. The ""cooling efficiency"" of these strategies was calculated as the ratio between the sensible heat removed from the space and the latent heat of evaporation, with the latter representing the amount of water required for landscape irrigation. This measure is proposed as a criterion for evaluating landscape strategies in arid regions, where water resources are scarce. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We present results from a participatory scenario study conducted in collaboration with the municipality of Delta in SW British Columbia, Canada. This study applies a participatory capacity building approach for climate change action at the local level where the sources of emissions and the mechanisms of adaptation reside and where climate change is meaningful to decision-makers and stakeholders alike.

It begins with a review of the evidence regarding environmental influences on obesity. Then it draws from that evidence to cite examples of climate change prevention and preparedness efforts that could also benefit the obesity problem. Climate change is a global environmental issue predicted to negatively impact children's health. In the United States, many regions are expected to experience worse air quality, increased vector-borne disease, and changes in food availability. Children's size, developmental stage, and long life expectancy make them unique when considering health effects from the environment. Furthermore, in the latter part of this century, the children of today will become seniors, a group also vulnerable to predicted health impacts from climate change. These vulnerabilities will contribute to existing health disparities that are due, in part, to unequal risk factors in communities of color and low income. Improved air quality, healthier diets, and increased physical activity are all potential results of climate change interventions. Unintended potential negative consequences are also discussed and careful pre-intervention assessment is emphasized. Interdisciplinary collaborations for research and solutions are needed for large scale environmental issues such as climate change and their impact on multi-factorial health problems including childhood obesity. Carefully selected climate change-related efforts can simultaneously address current children's health problems, future population health concerns, and ultimately result in more equitable health for all. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"air quality; child health; climate change; developmental stage; food availability; health policy; morbidity; vulnerability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73849152059

Historically, soil erosion led to great reductions of soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in China. Fortunately, with the economic development and remarkably effective soil erosion control measures in subtropical China over the past 20 years, soil erosion has been greatly decreased. As a result, soil organic carbon sequestration has gradually increased due to the rapid recovery of vegetation in the area. However, little information exists concerning the potential of soil carbon sequestration in the area. This paper introduces a case study in Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, China, which used to be a typical area with significant soil loss in subtropical China. This work represents a systematic investigation of the interrelations of carbon sequestration potential with soil erosion types, altitudes, soil types and soil parent materials. In this study, 284 soil samples were collected from 151 sampling sites (51 are soil profile sites) to determine soil physicochemical properties including organic carbon content. Soil organic carbon distribution maps of the surface layer (0-20. cm) and whole profile (0-100. cm) were compiled by linking soil types to the polygons of digital soil maps using GIS. Assuming that SOC was lost following the destruction of native vegetation, these lands hold great promise for potentially sequestering carbon again. The potential of soil carbon sequestration in the study area was estimated by subtracting the organic carbon status in eroded soils from that in non-eroded soils under undisturbed forest. Results show that the potential of SOC in the surface layer is 4.47. Tg. C while that in the whole profile is 12.3. Tg. C for the entire county. The greatest potential for carbon sequestration (3.72. Tg. C) is found in severely eroded soil, while non-eroded soil has the smallest potential. Also, soil carbon sequestration potential decreases with increasing altitude. Soils at altitudes of <300. m show the greatest potential (5.01. Tg. C), while those of >800. m have the smallest potential (0.25. Tg. C). Among various soil types, red earths (Humic Acrisols) have the greatest potential of carbon sequestration (5.32. Tg. C), and yellow earths (Ferralic Cambisols) have the smallest (0.15. Tg. C). As for soils derived from various parent materials, soils derived from phyllite possess the greatest carbon sequestration potential, and soils from Quaternary red clays have the smallest. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; China; Eroded areas; Potential","Acrisols; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sequestration potential; China; Economic development; Eroded areas; Eroded soils; Global carbon cycle; Global climate changes; Jiangxi Province; Organic carbon contents; Parent materials; Phyllite; Physicochemical property; Potential; Rapid recovery; Red clay; Red earth; Sampling site; Sequestering carbon; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil erosion; Soil loss; Soil maps; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic carbon sequestration; Soil organic carbon storages; Soil profiles; Soil sample; Soil types; Study areas; Subtropical China; Surface layers; Systematic investigations; Undisturbed forests; Climate change; Erosion; Forestry; Tropics; Soils",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76649135448

In southeastern China (Xiashu Experimental Forest, Jiangsu Province), we used an automated LI-8100 soil CO2 flux system to quantify diurnal variation of soil respiration in a secondary oak forest and a pine plantation. We found that soil respiration in the pine plantation was significantly higher than that in the secondary oak forest. There were similar patterns of soil respiration throughout the day in both the secondary oak forest and the pine plantation during our 7-month study (March-September 2005). The maximum of Rs occurred between 4:00 pm and 7:00 pm. The diurnal variations of Rs were usually out of phase with soil surface (0.5 cm) temperature (Tg). However, annual variation in Rs correlated with surface soil temperature. Soil respiration reached to a maximum in June, and decreased thereafter. The Q10 of Rs in the secondary oak forest was significantly higher than that in the pine plantation. The higher Q10 value in the secondary oak forest implied that it might release more CO2 than the pine plantation under a global-warming scenario. Our results indicated that land-use change from secondary forest to plantation may cause a significant increase in CO2 emission, and reduce the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration in southeastern China. © The Ecological Society of Japan 2009.","Land-use change; Pine plantation; Q10; Secondary oak forest; Soil respiration","carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; coniferous tree; deciduous forest; global warming; land cover; land use change; plantation; secondary forest; soil carbon; soil respiration; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350367557

We developed a robotic stride assistance system (SAS) to automatically control the walk ratio during walking. Our aim was to quantify the effects of a walking exercise with the SAS on walking performance and glucose metabolism during walking in community-dwelling elderly adults. METHODS: For 3 months, 15 women (72-85 years old) performed the walking exercise twice weekly for 90 min/session. We assessed walking for 5 m at a comfortable speed before and after the intervention. Positron emission tomography with [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was used to assess muscle activity during an unassisted 50-min walk. RESULTS: Walking speed was improved by the intervention and FDG uptake by the gluteus minimus, gluteus medius and rectus femoris, and pelvic muscles (iliacus and gluteus muscles) were reduced. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a walking intervention program using an applied robotic system is useful for improving the walking ability and the efficiency of muscle activities during walking in the elderly.",,"aged; article; female; gait; human; instrumentation; joint characteristics and functions; kinesiotherapy; physiology; positron emission tomography; robotics; skeletal muscle; walking; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Exercise Therapy; Female; Gait; Humans; Muscle, Skeletal; Positron-Emission Tomography; Range of Motion, Articular; Robotics; Walking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950365625

Also, the influences of equal biaxial tensile loads on the isochromatic fringes, stress fields and stress intensity factors near the mixed mode crack-tip have been investigated. The results show that, when an equal lateral tensile load is added to the specimen under uniaxial tensile load, the asymmetric isochromatic fringes about the line of crack gradually become symmetric, and the slope of the isochromatic fringe loop near the crack-tip is inclined towards the crack surface according to the increasing of the inclined angle of crack. Furthermore, the shapes of distribution of all stress components are changed from asymmetric to symmetric. In the equal biaxial tensile load condition against the uniaxial tensile load condition, the values of stress intensity factors are changed little, and only the region of compressive stress of σx/σO is changed when β = 0°, but the values of KI/K0 are increased and those of KII/K0 become almost zero, namely, we have the mode I condition when β = 15°∼45°. © KSME &amp; Springer 2009.","Equal biaxial tensile load; Hybrid method for photoelasticity; Mixed mode crack; Stress fields; Stress intensity factors","Biaxial tensile; Central cracks; Crack surfaces; Equal biaxial tensile load; Hybrid method; Hybrid method for photoelasticity; Inclined Angle; Isochromatic fringes; Mixed mode crack; Plane problem; Polycarbonate plates; Stress component; Stress field; Stress fields; Tensile loads; Asphalt pavements; Crack propagation; Cracks; Elasticity; Hybrid sensors; Photoelasticity; Physical optics; Stress intensity factors; Tensile stress",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350614200

Saturation of the SASE FEL power has been achieved at wavelengths ranging from 50 to 60 nm. The pulse energy has reached ∼30μJ at 60 nm. The observed fluctuation of the pulse energy is about 10% (standard deviation) for several hours, which agrees with the expectation from the SASE theory showing the stable operation of the accelerator. The SASE FEL has been routinely operated to provide photon beams for user experiments over a period of a few weeks. Analysis on the experimental data gave the normalized-slice emittance at the lasing part is around 0.7π mmmrad.

Besides this effect, it can also help to reduce air pollutant emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM). In this paper, exhaust emission characteristics of in-use buses and light duty trucks operating on palm methyl ester (PME) and coconut methyl ester (CME) in Bangkok, Thailand are compared with petroleum diesel by chassis dynamometer emission testing. The test fuels are 100% petroleum diesel, PME20 (20% PME and 80% petroleum diesel) and CME20 (20% CME and 80% petroleum diesel). The overall test results show that nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from PME20 are slightly higher compared with those from diesel. CO and PM emissions from PME20 and CME20 are lower than those from diesel, and larger reductions were observed for PM especially in CME20. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are almost comparable with no significant difference among the different fuel types. This study indicates that utilization of PME and CME might reduce local air pollutant emissions without increasing tailpipe CO2 emissions, and also indicates that CME has greater reduction potential than PME.","Biodiesel; Coconut methyl ester; Exhaust emissions; Palm methyl ester; Thailand","Air pollutant emission; Bangkok , Thailand; Chassis dynamometers; Coconut methyl ester; Emission testing; Exhaust emission; Fuel types; Light duty trucks; Methyl esters; Palm methyl ester; Palm methyl esters; Particulate Matter; Petroleum diesel; PM emissions; Reduction potential; Test results; Thailand; Alternative fuels; Automobiles; Biodiesel; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Dynamometers; Esterification; Esters; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Trucks; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951736549

However, fewer studies focus on the intra-national context within industrialized countries and the potential disparate impacts and benefits of climate change mitigation on lower socioeconomic groups and communities of color. In this article we investigate the costs and benefits of climate change mitigation strategies-some of which have been specified in the Scoping Plan for the implementation of the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32).

These barriers increasingly shift from the technical to the economic and institutional. The most general types of barriers are due to technological 'lock-out' or to carbon 'lock-in' [Unruh, G., 2000. Understanding carbon lock-in. Energy Policy 28(12), 817-830 (Elsevier)]. These barriers necessitate the development of a strategic approach to deploy or introduce renewable energy technology. Existing energy policy has mostly relied upon financial subsidies, market-based instruments such as renewable portfolio standards, and production tax credits to stimulate the installation and use of equipment to generate electricity from renewable sources. These strategies target mostly system-level decisions of end users. The purpose of this paper is to present an innovation perspective on the renewable energy deployment process by introducing the innovation value-added chain (IVC) framework. The analytical objective of IVC is to evaluate the impact of a new innovation on the various stakeholders and players in the development and deployment processes. A deployment or innovation strategy that causes minimal disruption, enhances existing competencies, or expedites new learning by the players has a higher chance to succeed. We draw upon two sets of system integration costs data for grid-connected distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems in Japan and the United States and demonstrate conspicuously different dynamic learning behaviors. These two deployment models can be understood in terms of how the IVCs are organized and how PV system integration projects are performed in the field. In addition, IVC-based findings can inform the targeted application of conventional financial subsidies for learning investment not only at the PV system level, but also at the (localized) system integration level. This would involve other stakeholders, thus suggesting new energy policy space. We highlight some future research directions using the IVC framework. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the following step the uses of ethanol for hydrogen production by steam reforming is analyzed and some comparison with natural gas steam reforming is performed. The sugar cane industry in Brazil, in a near future, in the hydrogen era, could be modified according to our purpose, since besides the production of sugar, and ethylic and anhydric alcohol, Brazilian sugar cane industry will also be able to produce biohydrogen. Fuel cells appear like a promising technology for energy generation. Among several technologies in the present, the PEMFC (proton exchange membrane fuel cell) is the most appropriate for vehicles application, because it combines durability, high power density, high efficiency, good response and it works at relatively low temperatures. Besides that it is easy to turn it on and off and it is able to support present vibration in vehicles. A PEMFC's problem is the need of noble catalysts like platinum. Another problem is that CO needs to be in low concentration, requiring a more clean hydrogen to avoid fuel cell deterioration. One part of this paper was developed in Stockholm, where there are some buses within the CUTE (clean urban transport for Europe) project that has been in operation with FC since January 2004. Another part was developed in Guaratinguetá, Brazil. Brazil intends to start up a program of FC buses.

Don plantations in south-western Australia, a region that is predicted to undergo severe rainfall reduction in future decades. The process-based model CenW was applied to four locations where it had previously been tested. Climate change scenarios under four emission scenarios for the period from 2005 to 2066 were considered, in addition to simulations under the current climate. Results showed that stem wood production and NEP were little affected by moderate climate change. However, under the most pessimistic climate change scenario (Special Report on Emission Scenarios A2), stem wood production and NEP decreased strongly. These results could be explained by the trade-off between the positive effect of rising atmospheric CO2 on plant water use efficiency and the negative effects of decreasing rainfall and increasing temperatures. Because changes in heterotrophic respiration (RH) lagged behind changes in plant growth, and because RH rates were increased by higher temperatures, NEP was more negatively affected than stem wood production. Stem wood production and NEP also strongly interacted with location, with the site currently having the wettest climate being least affected by climatic change. These results suggest that realistic predictions of forest production and carbon sequestration potential in the context of climate change require (1) the use of modelling tools that describe the important feedbacks between environmental variables, plant physiology and soil organic matter decomposition, (2) consideration of a range of climate change scenarios and (3) simulations that account for a gradual climate change to capture transient effects.","Carbon sequestration; CenW; Modelling; Net ecosystem exchange; Net primary production","carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate prediction; coniferous forest; net ecosystem production; net primary production; numerical model; precipitation intensity; soil organic matter; temperature effect; trade-off; water stress; water use efficiency; Australia; Pinus radiata; carbon; carbon dioxide; rain; water; article; Australia; climate change; growth, development and aging; metabolism; pine; temperature; theoretical model; wood; Australia; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Models, Theoretical; Pinus; Rain; Temperature; Water; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73349126143

We present here some comparisons between airglow data that have been newly interpreted with the advanced kinetic model Trans-Mars. A series of numerical one-dimensional kinetic models, in the Trans-* family [Lilensten, J., Blelly. P.L., 2002. The TEC and F2 parameters as tracers of the ionosphere and thermosphere. J. Atmos. Solar-Terrestrial Phys. 64, 775-793] has been developed over the last years to take into account of airglow processes and yield altitude line profiles in planetary upper atmospheres (Earth, Venus, Titan and Mars). Trans-Mars is the last evolution of these simulations, applied to Mars. Electron and photon cross sections have been recently updated. The computed model line profiles are comparable to those of Fox and Dalgarno [1979b. Ionization, luminosity, and heating of the upper atmosphere of Mars. J. Geophys. Res. 84, 7315-7333] and Shematovich et al. [2008. Monte Carlo model of electron transport for the calculation of Mars dayglow emissions. J. Geophys. Res. (Planets) 113(E12), 2011]. Nearly 70000 limb UV spectra recorded by SPICAM between October 2004 and May 2006 are analysed in order to obtain altitude emission profiles on the main dayglow emissions. A variable point spread function (PSF) determined statistically throughout the wavelength range is used to estimate precisely the intensity of the airglow. This includes the Cameron bands (a3 Π - X1 Σ) of CO, the CO2 + ultraviolet doublet (B2 Σu + - X2 Πg) at 289.0 nm and the oxygen emission at 297.2 nm. Instrumental uncertainties of the emissions remain under 15%. Five groups of comparable orbits are selected to prepare for the data interpretation. The seasonal and solar activity effects on the dayside CO 'Cameron Bands', CO2 + and OI(2972 Å) emissions are discussed in light of previous studies. These emissions exhibit for equatorial latitudes two maxima of intensity for LS = 140{ring operator} and 290{ring operator} (around Mars' perihelion) and one local minimum at LS ∼ 40{ring operator}. The peak at LS = 140{ring operator} is corroborated by the neutral density profiles shown by Forget et al. [2008. The density and temperatures of the upper martian atmosphere measured by stellar occultations with Mars Express SPICAM. J. Geophys. Res., 1-25, submitted for publication] using SPICAM stellar occultation mode; these authors linked this sudden increase to a dust storm covering a large part of the planet, a quite unexpected event at this time of the year. A first comparison of altitude profiles of emission lines between data and the kinetic transport model shows a very similar shape and altitude peak when Viking CO2 densities are divided by a factor 3 and uncertainties in the cross sections are taken into account. Overall intensities are, however, overestimated by our model by 25% on average for Cameron and CO2 + emissions. The limits of the model and further improvements both on the data analysis and on the model are presented. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is referred to the district of Pisa, in Italy. Technical feasibility was analysed by comparing process schemes and safety issues, while environmental impacts were studied by applying the methodology of life cycle assessment. Scenarios involving upgrading of crude sunflower oil (refined oil and biodiesel) require complex plants and the management of dangerous materials, and they produce considerable amounts of wastewater. These scenarios need larger plant size, more complex organization (farm cooperatives) and higher costs than the simple mechanical operations associated with crude oil production. On the other hand the use of low-quality fuels in internal combustion engines can lead to short engine lifetime and high pollutant emissions. The life cycle analysis shows that the biofuel upgrading processes (refining and transesterification) and oil transport have a low influence on the environmental impact, compared to seed cultivation, which is the most impacting step. However fuel upgrading allows a significant reduction in polluting emission during combustion; as a consequence biodiesel results the most sustainable biofuel. © 2009 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.",,"Biomass productions; Complex plants; Crude oil; Crude oil production; Life cycle analysis; Life-cycle assessments; Low qualities; Mechanical operations; Methyl esters; Oil transport; Plant size; Pollutant emission; Polluting emission; Process schemes; Safety issues; Sunflower oil; Technical feasibility; Biodiesel; Biomass; Combustion; Crude petroleum; Environmental impact; Esterification; Esters; Internal combustion engines; Life cycle; Refining; Vegetable oils; Wastewater; Petroleum refining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949152229

METHODS: Eleven healthy active male volunteers were cooled during a 40-min period using three different methods: ice packs to the neck, axillae, and groin (ICE); water spray and fan (FAN); and 2 L of chilled (20°C) intravenous saline administered during a 20-min period (IV). Rate of decrease in Tc, cardiovascular responses, and any incidence of reported adverse effects were investigated. Trials were presented in a counterbalanced order with the volunteers' body core temperature being elevated to 40.0°C on three occasions via an intermittent walk-run (2 min at 6 km•h and 4 min at 10 km•h) protocol conducted within a climate-controlled chamber (34.2 ± 0.5°C and 62.3 ± 3.1% relative humidity). RESULTS: Rate of Tc reduction during the first 20 min of ooling was greater for FAN compared with ICE (0.09 ± 0.02°C•min vs 0.07 ± 0.02°C•min, P < 0.05), whereas IV did not differ with the other trials (0.08 ± 0.01°C•min, P > 0.05). Three participants complained of numbness or paresthesia in their arm or hand during administration of the chilled saline, although these symptoms resolved within 5 min of ceasing the infusion. CONCLUSIONS: All three cooling techniques reduced Tc and would be suitable for first aid application in a field setting during transportation to adequate medical facilities. Chilled IV saline did not produce any contraindications, providing a suitable alternative for Tc cooling.

However, neither the mechanisms by which soil CH4 oxidation is enhanced by afforestation, nor how long after forest planting tree-dependent responses in CH4 oxidation become detectable are fully known. Here, we investigated the effects of different-aged stands (5-20 y) of the exotic pine (Pinus radiata (D. Don)) on CH4 oxidation and methanotrophic community structure in soils, compared with adjacent, long-established pastures. Two of the pastures were on volcanic soils and two were on non-volcanic soils. Although the CH4 fluxes in soils from these young stands were not significantly different from those in the associated pastures, the rate of oxidation of added 13CH4 was higher in the pine soils. Both fluxes and 13CH4 oxidation rates were higher in the volcanic than the non-volcanic soils. Combined phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and stable isotope probe (SIP) analyses suggested that type II methanotrophs (PLFA C18:1ω7) were most active in all soils followed by uncultivable bacteria (C17:0ai). Molecular analysis of the methanotrophic community structure using pmoA (particulate methane monooxygenase) genes suggested that a particular type II methanotroph (TRF 35) was dominant in all soils, but more so in the pine than in pasture soils. A type I methanotroph (TRF 245) was more prevalent in the pasture than in associated pine soils, whereas TRF 128 (a type II methanotroph) was slightly more dominant in soils under pine. Cloning and sequencing data suggest TRFs 35 and 128, which differ from one another, belong to distant relatives of Methylocapsa sp; TRF 245 is related to Methylococcus capsulatus. Land-use change resulted in changes in soil bulk density, porosity, moisture contents and in methanotrophic community structure. Methane oxidation rates were most closely related to soil moisture, as well as to the methanotrophic community structure, and nitrate-N, extractable C and total C concentrations. Stepwise multiple regression also suggested a weak effect (P = 0.06) of stand age on CH4 oxidation rate. By contrast, the responses of the methanotrophic community structure to this land-use change were more readily detected by the specific molecular analyses, and indicated a predominance of type II methanotrophs in pine soils. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been applied effectively to the ignition of PDEs as well as internal combustion engines.

Despite their short duration, periods of significant N2O emissions during soil thaws in winter and spring are an important portion of the total annual emissions from agricultural lands. The goal of this study was to understand the effects of tillage, moisture content and manure application on N2O emissions from agricultural soils at low temperatures. We summarize here both field and laboratory experiments. The field chamber study was focused on quantification of N2O flux from a field (Hudson clay loam: fine, illitic, mesic Glossaquic Hapludalf) growing corn (Zea mays L.) located in upstate New York. The field was moldboard plowed in the fall and then fertilized with liquid dairy manure. Intact soil cores were collected from the site both before and after field treatments for subsequent laboratory incubation that included freeze-thaw cycles. The results demonstrated that tillage reduced N2O emissions in non-manured soils by 20-30% in the 35-50 days following the tillage event, attributed to improved aeration resulting from reduced bulk densities and pore space saturation. The maximal emission of 200 μg N m-2 h-1 was found at soil temperatures greater than 5 °C and at WFPS between 40 and 70%. Subsequent application of liquid manure caused an increase in the total intensity of N2O emission. The emission of N2O from manure-amended soils was not limited to thawing events: emissions began at soil temperatures below 0 °C and continued even after complete soil freezing. The tillage history prior to manure application was found to have a significant influence on N2O emission during freezing/thawing cycles following manure application. The subsequent total winter N2O emissions were greater from the field areas that were tilled earlier in the fall, particularly in the first few freeze-thaw cycles, during which the maximum N2O fluxes occurred.Increasing soil saturation in a wet area formed during a spring thaw caused increasing N2O emissions up to a maximum of 200 μg N m-2 h-1 at ∼60-70% saturation. However, emissions dropped dramatically with further increases in soil moisture, decreasing to 50 μg N m-2 h-1 in the most saturated areas (90% saturated). Overall, maximal emissions were found at temperatures greater than 5 °C and at water filled porosities between 40 and 70%. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The SEM studies for this ratio indicate, well developed grain growth due to the formation of optimum nucleation centers with increased Mg content. The superconducting transition for optimized sample was observed at 33.5 K by four-probe resistivity technique. The amount of carbon doped into the sample was determined from a well known method by analyzing the change in the in-plane lattice parameter. The susceptibility studies of sample showed Wohlleben effect in field cooled plot confirming the superconductivity in the sample. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It is today north of the climatic limit of cereal cultivation and the economy is primarily based on fisheries. The pollen content of two peat profiles from the outer coastal island Sørøya (c. 70.5°N) were examined. Increased anthropogenic influence was seen in the pollen assemblages at 600-100 BC, AD 150-550, AD 1300-1550 and AD 1700-2000, as well as a general environmental shift around AD 950, probably towards a wetter climate and more open vegetation. The results largely confirm the general held view on agrarian expansion phases in North Norway. These different phases are discussed from a regional, historical, economic and environmental perspective. During the early Iron Age the arctic limit for agriculture is extended northward along the coast into the Barents Sea area, probably during periods of more favourable climate. From the late Middle Ages onwards the development towards an efficient market economy allowed better exploitation of the marine recourses, which reduced the dependence on climatically sensitive agrarian activities. © The Author(s), 2009.","Agriculture; Archaeology; Arctic; Barents Sea; Climate change; Coastal land use; Cultural landscape; Fisheries; Late Holocene","archaeology; cereal; climate change; coastal structure; cultivation; cultural landscape; economic conditions; gadoid fishery; historical perspective; human activity; hunter-gatherer; Iron Age; land use; market conditions; Middle Ages; paleoclimate; palynology; peat; regional development; transition zone; vegetation type; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Eurasia; Fennoscandia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349210252

S. membership in the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP) constituted an important element in the Bush administration's voluntary and non-committing 'soft-law' approach to climate change. With the inauguration of President Barack Obama, the U. S. has embarked on a shift in its climate policy towards a legislative, 'hard-law' strategy. Obama's approach implies that the distribution of interests in Congress becomes more significant. In this article, we assess the rules and procedures governing the relationship between the president and the Congress embedded in the U. S. Constitution and explore implications of a stronger congressional involvement in U. S. climate policies for President Obama's ability to realise his climate policy ambitions at both the domestic and the international levels. We argue that the strong relationship between natural resource dependence (coal and oil) and opposition to climate policies is a constant feature of the U. S. climate policy debate. In order to succeed, Obama must break the enduring gridlock characterising congressional debate in this policy area by designing policies that, through compromise and compensation, can mobilise the support of oil- and coal-state representatives in Congress. The acceptability of an international climate treaty in Congress, moreover, depends inter alia on the resolution of the difficult issue of developing country participation. Success may be enhanced by using the APP and the Major Economies Initiative as informal arenas for negotiation and sector-based cooperation, thus providing a much-needed supplement to the UN-based negotiation process. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate; Hard-law; International climate treaty; Major Economies Initiative; Soft-law; U.S. climate policy","clean development mechanism; climate change; economic activity; environmental policy; international agreement; natural resource; partnership approach; policy analysis; political power; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450256311

The SCF membrane was a dense membrane approximately 2 mm thick while the BSCF membrane had a 400 μm dense layer supported on a 2.2 mm porous BSCF layer. Both membranes exhibited good mechanical integrity and stability under reaction conditions, and the membrane effect on methane conversion was roughly proportional to the apparent oxygen production of the membranes. Methane conversion and water production increase simultaneously in the presence of the membrane and the membranes improve catalyst longevity as well as activity. Results suggest that membrane oxygen reacts with hydrogen at the membrane surface to form water that can then participate in the reaction set via steam reforming. Among the combinations of membrane and catalyst tested, the Pt/CeZrO2 catalyst on the BSCF membrane produced the highest methane conversion and H2:CO ratios as well as the most water. This test also yielded the greatest net membrane oxygen production, with more than three times the oxygen production of the BSCF test with the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst. The SFC membranes exhibited steady state net oxygen production of zero or less. Negative membrane oxygen production values are attributed to the reduction of CO2 to CO on the membrane surface with incorporation of the oxygen into the membrane material. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The test site was located in Otsego County, Michigan, and was part of the Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (MRCSP) program. The injection target was a deep saline rock formation, named the Bass Islands Dolomite, at a depth of 1049-1071 m (3442-3 514 ft). Rock core tests on this formation suggested an average permeability of 22 md and porosity of 13% across 22 m (72 ft). Hydraulic monitoring included metering injection at the wellhead and downhole pressure and temperature logging in the injection well and a nearby deep monitoring well. Pressure response curves were analyzed for a step- rate injection and shut-in recovery tests. Downhole pressure in the injection well was approximately 13,800-13,930 kPa at injection rates of 400-600 t CO 2 per day. Step-rate injection testing suggested that injection rates of several hundred thousand metric tons CO2 per year may be sustainable in a single well. Injection test pressure falloff analysis showed that the overall reservoir permeability may be more than twice as high as indicated from rock core tests. This successful test provides extremely valuable field information on all aspects of the CO2 storage feasibility for both the test region and the broader deployment of the technology.

Based on texture, major element geochemistry, and clay mineralogy, the mineral parent materials were crudely stratified, with a silty material of likely aeolian origin overlying sandy gravelly colluvium. Discontinuous organic matter-enriched horizons occurred 50 cm or more below the active layer, and contained abundant partially decomposed plant detritus. Eight accelerator radiocarbon dates, ranging from 350±40 to 3680±40 14C years BP, suggested that incorporation of organic materials within and below the active layer was geologically recent, and had likely occurred by a combination of cryoturbation and slope processes. The widespread and rapid initiation of mass movements on slopes containing permafrost that followed forest fires in 2004 on the Klondike Plateau may be an analogue for the processes that contributed to organic matter burial in these Cryosols. These soils may represent a significant reservoir of C, as similar sites occupy at least 15% of a representative portion of the Plateau. This reservoir may be vulnerable to mobilization if future climatic warming increases the frequency of forest fires and resulting slope instability.","Cryoturbation; Mass movement; Soil organic carbon; Turbic cryosol; Yukon Territory","clay mineral; cryoturbation; forest fire; landscape structure; mass movement; radiocarbon dating; slope stability; soil chemistry; soil classification; soil horizon; soil organic matter; soil texture; warming; Canada; North America; Yukon Territory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350475264

However, pressure is mounting globally for international aviation to be included in post-Kyoto arrangements. In the absence of international collective action, a number of so-called carbon offsetting schemes have emerged that allow individual travellers and companies to compensate for their international air travel emissions. These schemes offer technological solutions, such as planting sink forests to sequester emissions. To consider the implications of future collective action, this paper presents a case study assessment of the physical feasibility of five schemes for all short duration journeys to and from New Zealand. This is the first comprehensive national-level case study assessment of competing offsetting options for international aviation emissions in the peer-reviewed literature. The CO2-e emissions produced by the air travel of international visitors to New Zealand, and for New Zealand residents travelling overseas, is calculated in this paper to be 7893 and 3948 Gg, respectively, in 2005. It is then shown that no single offsetting scheme targeted inside the country appears physically and/or politically realistic. This indicates the sheer size of these emissions, and the challenge that the international community faces for collective action on this matter. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate variability is one such issue that is impacted by, and impacts on, several other areas (e.g. coastal processes, infrastructure, health and regional economies). These interdependencies create challenges for local governments to scale up management responses to tackle issues at a regional scale. Critical to this process of scaling up is the concept of adaptive capacity, which is affected by a range of contextual, institutional and procedural factors. Research is being undertaken to support local governments in the Sydney region to improve their adaptive capacity to deal with the impacts of climate variability and change; hence, the chapter is more about testing 'new solutions' than about reporting on them.

However, biodiesel utilization presents several challenges, including decreased fuel energy density and increased emissions of smog-generating nitrogen oxides (NOx). These negative aspects can likely be mitigated via closed-loop combustion control provided the properties of the fuel blend can be estimated accurately, on-vehicle, in real-time. To this end, this paper presents a method to practically estimate the biodiesel content of fuel being used in a diesel engine during steady-state operation. The simple generalizable physically motivated estimation strategy presented utilizes information from a wideband oxygen sensor in the engine's exhaust stream, coupled with knowledge of the air-fuel ratio, to estimate the biodiesel content of the fuel. Experimental validation was performed on a 2007 Cummins 6.7 l ISB series engine. Four fuel blends (0%, 20%, 50%, and 100% biodiesel) were tested at a wide variety of torque-speed conditions. The estimation strategy correctly estimated the biodiesel content of the four fuel blends to within 4.2% of the true biodiesel content. Blends of 0%, 20%, 50%, and 100% were estimated to be 2.5%, 17.1%, 54.2%, and 96.8%, respectively. The results indicate that the estimation strategy presented is capable of accurately estimating the biodiesel content in a diesel engine during steady-state engine operation. This method offers a practical alternative to in-the-fuel type sensors because wideband oxygen sensors are already in widespread production and are in place on some modern diesel vehicles today. © 2009 by ASME.","Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Biofuels; Diesel engines; Diesel fuel; Estimation; Fuel flexibility; Oxygenation; Virtual sensing","Air fuel ratios; Alternative diesel fuel; Biodiesel blends; Closed-loop; Combustion control; Developing strategy; Diesel vehicles; Engine operations; Estimation strategies; Exhaust stream; Experimental validations; Fuel blends; Fuel energy; Fuel flexibility; Fuel types; Steady-state operation; Torque-speed; Virtual sensing; Wide-band; Acoustic variables control; Air pollution; Alternative fuels; Automobile parts and equipment; Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Engines; Estimation; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Oxygen sensors; Oxygenation; Oxygenators; Sensors; Biodiesel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73649147952

Hydrogen fugacity in the fluid phase was controlled by the Mo-MoO2 or Fe-FeO buffers, using a specially modified double-capsule method. The oxygen fugacity in the samples was controlled by adding different amounts of water, stearic acid, anthracene, and docosane to a graphite charge. At high P-T conditions, the degree of decomposition of the heavy hydrocarbons added to the charge was ≥99.9%. The composition of the fluids coexisting with graphite/diamond in the buffered experiments varied from H2O ≫ H2 &gt; CH4 (at fO2 somewhat lower than the ""water maximum"") to H2 &gt; CH4 &gt; (C2H4 + C2H6)&gt;C3H8 (in C-H system). In the C-H system the maximum concentrations of major species in the synthesized fluid were: H2 = 79 mol.% and CH4 = 21 mol.%. The composition of the H2-rich fluids, which were synthesized at 6.3 GPa and 1400-1600 °C for the first time, differs considerably from that of the ultra-reduced CH4-rich fluids stable at 2.0-3.5 GPa and 1000-1300 °C. Thermodynamic calculations of the reduced C-O-H fluids at the P-T conditions of the experiments revealed CH4-rich compositions (CH4 ≫ H2 &gt; (C2H4 + C2H6)&gt;C3H8), which however drastically differed from the synthesized compositions. The rates of diamond nucleation and growth in the experiments depended on the fluid composition. Diamond crystallization had a maximum intensity in the pure aqueous fluids, while in the H2-rich fluids no diamond formation was observed.

There is a strong common signal among the chronologies. For the common interval AD 1890-1999, three dominant patterns of tree growth across the Bolivian Altiplano were identified. The first pattern which explains 52% of the total variance in tree growth is associated with years of above- or below-average tree growth across the whole region. The second and third patterns, which are related to significantly lower common variance (13 and 8%, respectively), are associated with contrasting positive and negative anomalies of growth between the northern and southern sectors, and between the central-western sector and the rest of the region, respectively. In order to determine the climatic significance of the spatial variations of P. tarapacana growth, the interannual patterns in tree growth were compared with spatial anomalies in precipitation across the region. Uniform patterns of above (below) average tree growth are associated with positive (negative) precipitation anomalies in the preceding year that are uniformly distributed across the whole Altiplano. In the westernmost areas of the Altiplano, summer rainfall accounts for more than 80% of total annual precipitation. Therefore, relationships between tree growth and summer or annual precipitation are, in most cases, similar. Contrasting patterns of tree growth are related to opposite anomalies in precipitation during the preceding year in the different sub-regions in the Altiplano (north versus south, central versus north and south). Climatic preconditioning of tree growth was also identified for individual years. For instance, extremely reduced growth in the year 1967 reflects dry conditions in the two preceding years (1965-1966). Long-term intervals (3 or more years) with reduced tree growth resulted from several consecutive years with low precipitation. Our results indicate that the network of tree-ring chronologies of P. tarapacana in the Bolivian Altiplano has the potential to provide annually-resolved precipitation reconstructions in this region for the past 5-7 centuries. This is a valuable source to document decadal-to-century-scale precipitation variability in the Altiplano and its relation to large-scale ocean-atmosphere circulation features. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, ecological significance of the various S forms and the impacts of human intervention and climate on the amount and structural composition of these compounds are still poorly understood. We investigated the long-term influences of anthropogenically mediated transitions from natural to managed ecosystems on molecular-level speciation, biogeochemical dynamics, and the apparent temperature sensitivity of S moieties in temperate, subtropical, and tropical environments with mean annual temperature (MAT) ranging from 5°C to 21°C, using elemental analysis and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Land-use and land-cover changes led to the depletion of total soil S in all three ecoregions over a period of up to 103 years. The largest decline occurred from tropical forest agroecosystems (67% Kakamega and 76% Nandi, Kenya), compared to losses from temperate (36% at Lethbridge, Canada, and 40% at Pendleton, USA) and subtropical (48% at South Africa) grassland agroecosystems. The total S losses correlated significantly with MAT. Anthropogenic interventions profoundly altered the molecular-level composition and resulted in an apparent shift in oxidation states of organic S from native ecosystems composed primarily of S moieties in intermediate and highly reduced oxidation states toward managed agroecosystems dominated by organic S rich in strongly oxidized functionalities. The most prominent change occurred in thiols and sulfides, the proportion of which decreased by 46% (Lethbridge) and 57% (Pendleton) in temperate agroecosystems, by 46% in subtropical agroecosystems, and by 79% (Nandi) and 81% (Kakamega) in tropical agroecosystems. The proportion of organic S directly linked to O increased by 81%, 168%, 40%, 92%, and 85%, respectively. Among the various organic S functionalities, thiols and sulfides seem to have higher apparent temperature sensitivity, and thus these organic S moieties may become prone to losses due to land-use changes, even from the cooler regions of the world if MAT of these regions rise in the future. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","C-bonded S; Ester-bonded S; Land use; Organic S; Oxidized S; Reduced S; Sulfates; Sulfides; Sulfonates; Synchrotron radiation; XANES","sulfur; sulfur derivative; agricultural ecosystem; biogeochemical cycle; forest ecosystem; land use; molecular analysis; oxidation; speciation (chemistry); sulfate; sulfide; sulfonate; XANES spectroscopy; article; climate; comparative study; ecosystem; human; Kenya; North America; oxidation reduction reaction; soil; South Africa; temperature; time; Climate; Ecosystem; Humans; Kenya; North America; Oxidation-Reduction; Soil; South Africa; Sulfur; Sulfur Compounds; Temperature; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66149165758

This paper presents scenario assessments of whole-system effects of technologies for reducing GHG emissions from livestock model farms using slurry-based manure management. Changes in housing and storage practice, mechanical separation, and incineration of the solid fraction derived from separation were evaluated in scenarios for Sweden, Denmark, France, and Italy. The results demonstrated that changes in manure management can induce significant changes in CH4 and N2O emissions and carbon sequestration, and that the effect of introducing environmental technologies may vary significantly with live- stock farming practice and interact with climatic conditions. Shortening the in-house manure storage time reduced GHG emissions by 0-40%. The largest GHG reductions of 49 to, in one case, 82% were obtained with a combination of slurry separation and incineration, the latter process contributing to a positive GHG balance of the system by substituting fossil fuels. The amount and composition of volatile solids (VS) and nitrogen pools were main drivers in the calculations performed, and requirements to improve the assessment of VS composition and turnover during storage and in the field were identified. Nevertheless, the results clearly showed that GHG emission estimates will be unrealistic, if the assumed manure management or climatic conditions do not properly represent a given country or region. The results also showed that the mitigation potential of specific manure management strategies and technologies varied depending on current management and climatic conditions. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Carbon sequestration; Incineration; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Slurry separation","agroecology; anthropogenic source; assessment method; carbon sequestration; emission control; global warming; greenhouse gas; incineration; livestock farming; manure; methane; mitigation; nitrous oxide; separation; slurry; waste disposal; waste management; Denmark; France; Italy; Sweden; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74549117753

This soot deposition problem occurs frequently in all diesel cars. However, when a vehicle is placed under the conditions of sudden start and sudden acceleration after city mode driving for a long time, the deposited soot is abruptly blown up with the soot produced during fuel combustion. In the present study, the main cause of the abrupt outburst of deposited soot is investigated to overcome this adverse phenomenon. First, we eveloped a method to quantify the amount of the exhausted soot particles (or the accumulated soot particles) by measuring the opacity that represents the contamination level of the exhaust gas due to soot particles. Using this measuring scheme for deposited soot, we found the critical conditions for engine speeds and load conditions at which soot particles are emitted into the air without accumulation in the exhaust system using main muffler composed of three chambers. In order to meet these critical conditions and thus to drastically reduce soot accumulation, the exhaust system using the main muffler applied in this study must be designed to ensure that the flow velocity of the exhaust gas is higher than 62 m/s when the back pressure at the exit of the turbocharger is under 0.08 bars.

Moreover, soot-free combustion can be observed under all of the operating conditions, which allows a high ratio of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) for NOx reduction without being restricted by the NOx-soot tradeoff. The effects of a high ratio of exhaust gas recirculation on performance and exhaust emissions from aDMEengine were investigated. The results showed that EGR ratio has significant effects on power output and fuel consumption. NOx emission is considerably reduced with the decrease of oxygen concentration, and a higher level of EGR results in a greater reduction in NOx emission. Ultralow NOx emissions have been realized under a high ratio of EGR operations, however, accompanied with the increase of HC and CO emissions. High EGR ratios need to be applied under low loads, but low EGR ratios are sufficient for high loads. Considering all of the operating conditions, optimized EGR ratios were selected, and the tests were conducted under the European Steady-State Test Cycle. As expected, NOx emissions from a DME engine can easily meet the Euro IV limit with optimized EGR ratios. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemical structure; CO emissions; Dimethyl ether fuels; Exhaust emission; Exhaust gas recirculation; Gaseous products; High load; Low load; NOx Emissions; Nox reduction; Operating condition; Oxygen concentrations; Oxygen content; Performance and emissions; Power out put; Test cycles; Combustion; Ethers; Gas emissions; Industrial furnaces; Oxygen; Soot; Synthetic fuels; Leakage (fluid)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72449137712

To explore the capability of advanced oxidation processes for the rapid removal of biocides, we examined the total organic carbon (TOC) reduction of 4-chloro-3,5-dimethylphenol (PCMX) with a combination of UV/O3. Moreover, the related important parameters, including the mass transfer coefficient and light utilization efficiency, in PCMX degradation were determined. The UV/O3 experimental results showed a pronounced synergistic effect, leading to the nearly complete elimination of TOC within 75 min. Thus, the effect of operating variables was investigated as a function of pH, ozone dosage, bulk temperature and the initial concentration of PCMX. The efficiency of PCMX mineralization increased with an increase in ozone dose up to 3.1 g h-1, and a decrease in the initial concentration from 250 to 100 mg L-1. The optimal pH value was 4.0, and the preferred bulk temperature was 20 °C on the basis of the influence of temperature on reaction rate and ozone solubility. The major aromatic intermediates identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry were 2,6-dimethylbenzene-1,4-diol, 2,6-dimethylbenzo-1,4-quinone, 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)benzo-1,4-quinone, and 2,6-dimethylbenzo-1,4-aldehyde. Quantitative determination of related carboxylic acid and inorganic anions was done by ion chromatography.

Ten-year model climatologies show that the simulation with the original ZM scheme produces a typical double ITCZ bias, whereas all biases related to the spurious double ITCZ and overly strong cold tongue in precipitation, sea surface temperature (SST), wind stress, ocean thermocline, upper-ocean currents, temperature, and salinity are dramatically reduced when the revised ZM scheme is used. These results demonstrate that convection parameterization plays a critical role in the formation of double ITCZ bias in the CCSM3. To understand the physical mechanisms through which the modifications of the convection scheme in the atmospheric model alleviate the double ITCZ bias in the CCSM3, the authors investigate the impacts of convection schemes on the atmospheric forcing and feedback in the uncoupled Community Atmospheric Model, version 3 (CAM3). It is shown that the CAM3 simulation with the original ZM scheme also produces a signature of double ITCZ bias in precipitation, whereas the simulation with the revised ZM scheme does not. Diagnostic analyses have identified three factors on the atmospheric side (i.e., the sensitivity of convection to SST, the convection- shortwave flux-SST feedback, and the convection-wind-evaporation-SST feedback) that may contribute to the differences in the coupled simulations. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric feedbacks; Atmospheric forcing; Atmospheric model; Community atmospheric model; Community climate system model; Convection parameterization; Coupled simulation; Diagnostic analysis; Model climatology; Physical mechanism; Sea surface temperatures; Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Model structures; Ocean currents; Parameterization; Submarine geophysics; Wind stress; Simulators; air-sea interaction; atmosphere-ocean coupling; atmospheric forcing; atmospheric modeling; climate feedback; climate modeling; computer simulation; convection; feedback mechanism; intertropical convergence zone; oceanic current; parameterization; sea surface temperature; thermocline; wind stress; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69249155054

We found that a CA-rich sequence (termed CA motif) in the amiE translation initiation region was important for Crc binding. The small RNA CrcZ (407 nt) containing 5 CA motifs was able to bind the Crc protein with high affinity and to remove it from amiE mRNA in vitro. Overexpression of crcZ relieved catabolite repression in vivo, whereas a crcZ mutation pleiotropically prevented the utilization of several carbon sources. The sigma factor RpoN and the CbrA/CbrB two-component system, which is known to maintain a healthy carbon-nitrogen balance, were necessary for crcZ expression. During growth on succinate, a preferred carbon source, CrcZ expression was low, resulting in catabolite repression of amiE and other genes under Crc control. By contrast, during growth on mannitol, a poor carbon source, elevated CrcZ levels correlated with relief of catabolite repression. During growth on glucose, an intermediate carbon source, CrcZ levels and amiE expression were intermediate between those observed in succinate and mannitol media.

Using 22 Rh/YSZ/Pt type cells it was found that the reduction of NO in presence of 1.1 kPa O2 and 0.36 kPa C2H4 can be efficiently electropromoted with 340% rate enhancement, reaching 95% NO conversion with 100% selectivity to N2 in the temperature range from 280 to 340 °C. The apparent Faradaic efficiency is larger than unity for both the NO reduction and the C2H4 oxidation reaction. At elevated temperatures (≥300 °C) and high reactant conversions it was found that after current interruption, the catalytic rates do not return to their initial values but remain in a new highly active steady state. It appears that this highly active state is not a genuine intrinsic permanent NEMCA state but is manifestation of steady-state multiplicity in the monolithic reactor resulting from near complete gaseous O2 consumption. Thus the low and high activity steady states corresponding to zero applied potential appear to correspond to high and low average PO2 in the reactor. The latter is the result of the near complete reactant conversion under the preceding electropromoted operation. These highly active permanent NEMCA states may be quite useful for practical applications. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, to fulfill the liabilities of the Kyoto Protocol, she has to review her status and make strategic plans to hold the emissions at the levels specified in the protocol. For this purpose, in this study employing data envelopment analysis (DEA), Turkey's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and local/regional pollutants compared to the European Union (EU) countries have been put in place. Since the data on Malta and Cyprus was inadequate, these two nations were excluded from the evaluation. As a candidate for EU, Turkey is required to reduce the emissions by 8% until 2012 within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol. Two models were considered in this performance work: (i) the first model for the input energy consumption, GHG and local/regional pollutants (total GHG, CO2, F (emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds), CO, NO2, SO2) has been considered as the output value. (ii) In the second model, the values entered in the sectoral energy consumption have been considered as GHG emissions and local/regional pollutants output. Model 2 was taken into account in which different inputs were employed to observe the impacts of input values causing GHG emissions on emission. DEA technique is used, which holds the output constant in the direction which should reduce the input. For this purpose, the effect of sectoral energy consumption on total emission was identified and it was aimed to identify on which energy resources the strategy developed for emission reduction should be. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An overall energy policy is suggested for use by political leaders, along with specific goals on climate change and national security. This report proposes a timetable by which the climate change and national security goals should be accomplished. Converting these political goals into a cost-effective energy plan that would continue to get long-term political support would be the task of the technical community. A generic process is described which applies to all future energy systems and would give guidance to the technical community on how to create a mix of energy sources and conservation. This generic process is then tested on three possible energy futures. One energy future proposes that all of our electricity should come from renewable sources within 10 years. It is shown to be inadequate and would exacerbate environmental risks. The second possible energy future adds far more nuclear energy and coal plants with carbon capture and sequestration to the above renewable-only proposal. This second plan was a significant improvement over the all-renewable energy proposal, but does not address how transportation might be accomplished in the future. Converting coal to liquid fuels is identified as the major means to produce liquid fuels, as long as non-carbon dioxide emitting sources of process heat/hydrogen are employed in this coal conversion process. The third proposal, called an Energy Family approach, places first emphasis on conservation and then creates a mix of energy sources, renewable, nuclear, coal, natural gas, and some oil that could meet all the energy demands of a modern society, while staying within environmental and national security limits. This third approach appears to be most likely to get continuing support. There can be significant progress through ""Second Generation"" conservation, which extracts much more energy from our existing electrical generation and transmission system. Coal would have to undergo a major transformation from producing electricity to producing liquid fuels for transportation. Transportation and space heating and cooling would be far more electrified. Nuclear power would have to be expanded to replace many of the phased out coal plants, to provide electricity for transportation, and to supply high-temperature process heat and hydrogen. Long-term programs need to be put in place to assure nuclear power's continuing contribution. Finally, energy storage is a component which is often overlooked, but is essential. It could overcome fundamental renewable energy difficulties of variability and the possibility of wind power to create electrical grid instabilities. It is shown that an Energy Family approach could accelerate the development of renewable energy. © 2009 International Association for Mathematical Geology.","Climate change; Coal; Conservation; Energy family; Energy storage; Environment; National security; Natural gas; Nuclear power; Oil; Political stalemate; Renewable energy; Second generation conservation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949654632

To date it has been most widely applied to the Late Cretaceous and Tertiary of the mid- to high latitudes because of concerns over the relative dearth of calibration sites in modern low-latitude warm climates, and the loss of information associated with the lack of marginal teeth on leaves in paratropical to tropical vegetation. This limits CLAMP's ability to quantify reliably climates at low latitudes in greenhouse worlds of the past. One of the reasons for the lack of CLAMP calibration samples from warm environments is the paucity of climate stations close to potential calibration vegetation sites at low latitudes. Agriculture and urban development have destroyed most lowland sites and natural vegetation is now largely confined to mountainous areas where climate stations are few and climatic spatial variation is high due to topographic complexity. To attempt to overcome this we have utilised a 0.5° × 0.5° grid of global interpolated climate data based on the data set of New et al. (1999) supplemented by the ERA40 re-analysis data for atmospheric temperature at upper levels. For each location, the 3-D climatology of temperature from the ECMWF re-analysis project was used to calculate the mean lower tropospheric lapse rate for each month of the year. The gridded data were then corrected to the altitude of the plant site using the monthly lapse rates. Corrections for humidity were also made. From this the commonly returned CLAMP climate variables were calculated. A bilinear interpolation scheme was then used to calculate the climate parameters at the exact lat/long of the site. When CLAMP analyses using the PHYSG3BR physiognomic data calibrated with the climate station based MET3BR were compared to analyses using the gridded data at the same locations (GRIDMET3BR), the results were indistinguishable in that they fell within the range of statistical uncertainty determined for each analysis. This opens the way to including natural vegetation anywhere in the world irrespective of the proximity of a meteorological station. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, the impacts of pyrolysis biochar on the soil system need to be assessed before initiating large scale biochar applications to agricultural fields. We compared CO2 respiration, nitrous oxide (N2O) production, methane (CH4) oxidation and herbicide retention and transformation through laboratory incubations at field capacity in a Minnesota soil (Waukegan silt loam) with and without added biochar. CO2 originating from the biochar needs to be subtracted from the soil-biochar combination in order to elucidate the impact of biochar on soil respiration. After this correction, biochar amendments reduced CO2 production for all amendment levels tested (2, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60% w/w; corresponding to 24-720 t ha-1 field application rates). In addition, biochar additions suppressed N2O production at all levels. However, these reductions were only significant at biochar amendment levels &gt;20% w/w. Biochar additions also significantly suppressed ambient CH4 oxidation at all levels compared to unamended soil. The addition of biochar (5% w/w) to soil increased the sorption of atrazine and acetochlor compared to non-amended soils, resulting in decreased dissipation rates of these herbicides. The recalcitrance of the biochar suggests that it could be a viable carbon sequestration strategy, and might provide substantial net greenhouse gas benefits if the reductions in N2O production are lasting.","Biomass; Carbon; Char; Charcoal; Pyrolysis; Respiration","Biomass; Carbon; Charcoal; Greenhouse gases; Herbicides; Nitrogen oxides; Pyrolysis; Silt; Weed control; Agricultural fields; Biochar amendments; Carbon sequestration; Char; Dissipation rates; Greenhouse gas production; Herbicide retention; Respiration; Carbon dioxide; acetochlor; atrazine; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; charcoal; greenhouse gas; herbicide; laboratory method; pyrolysis; silty loam; soil amendment; soil analysis; soil chemistry; soil respiration; article; biomass energy; biotransformation; carbon sequestration; controlled study; degradation; greenhouse gas; loam soil; nitrous oxide emission; oxidation reduction potential; pyrolysis; soil amendment; soil respiration; United States; wood chip",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349211609

The same fuels can, however, give similar results if used in centralised plants to generate electricity that can then power heat pumps. A greater emphasis on the use of heat pumps would also facilitate the use of non-fossil electricity and the future application of carbon capture and storage to reduce emissions from any centralised fossil fuel use. Carbon capture and storage and electricity can give cuts in carbon dioxide emissions of 75% or more compared with local direct use of gas and overall negative emissions with biomass. Centralised hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage can also be combined with distributed combined heat and power. Given the potential effectiveness of these combined centralised/ distributed approaches for emissions reductions, it is important that further work is undertaken so that they can be accurately evaluated as additional policy options.

This study offers a classification of vernacular environmental design traditions across the subcontinent based on the Koppen-Grieger climatic regions and a detailed study of thermal comfort in traditional and modern dwellings, in two of the eight regions, using environmental performance modelling. The results show that traditional passive techniques provide a high degree of comfort for a longer part of the day while potentially minimizing energy use. Some problems were identified in adopting the passive strategies to the present context.

Plants harbouring homozygous AtSUC2 null alleles accumulate sugar, starch, and anthocyanin in mature leaves, have severely delayed development and stunted growth and, in previous studies, failed to complete their life cycle by producing viable seed. Methods An AtSUC2 allele with a T-DNA insertion in the second intron was analysed. Full-length transcript from this allele is not produced, and a truncated protein translated from sequences upstream of the insertion site did not catalyse sucrose uptake into yeast, supporting the contention that this is a null allele. Mutant plants were grown in a growth chamber with a diurnal light/dark cycle, and growth patterns recorded. Key Results This allele (SALK-038124, designated AtSUC2-4) has the hallmarks of previously described null alleles but, despite compromised carbon partitioning and growth, produces viable seeds. The onset of flowering was chronologically delayed but occurred at the same point in the plastochron index as wild type. Conclusions AtSUC2 is important for phloem loading and is therefore fundamental to phloem transport and plant productivity, but plants can complete their life cycle and produce viable seed in its absence. Arabidopsis appears to have mechanisms for mobilizing reduced carbon from the phloem into developing seeds independent of AtSUC2.","Arabidopsis thaliana; AtSUC2; Phloem; Phloem loading; Plant productivity; Sucrose; Symporter; Transporter","bacterial DNA; carrier protein; cellulose; cotransporter; proton; starch; sucrose; sucrose transport protein, plant; T DNA; T-DNA; vegetable protein; allele; biological production; dicotyledon; DNA; life cycle; mutation; phloem; pigment; protein; starch; sucrose; viability; Arabidopsis; article; carbohydrate metabolism; cytology; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; mutation; phloem; plant epidermis; plant leaf; plant seed; seedling; transport at the cellular level; Arabidopsis; Biological Transport; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Cellulose; DNA, Bacterial; Membrane Transport Proteins; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Mutation; Phloem; Plant Epidermis; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Protons; Seedling; Seeds; Starch; Sucrose; Symporters; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350514732

A desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to become more energy self-sufficient is driving this change. Theoretically, local level management is desirable because it achieves these goals through improvements in the three areas of energy efficiency, energy conservation and switching to renewable energy sources. The analysis of 10 of the first community energy plans in Canadian communities, ranging in population size from 500 to one million, finds that communities are choosing policies and programs centred on increasing energy efficiency and conservation while renewable energy receives much less attention. Municipal operations were called upon to set higher targets than the general community. Communities that recognized the substantial potential of renewable energy often focused on technologies that the municipal sector could implement, such as bio-fuels for their transportation fleet. Wind, passive solar design, solar photovoltaics and solar thermal options were only recommended in a few cases. Overall, only one of the five larger communities (Calgary) recommended implementing multiple renewable energy technologies while three of the five smaller communities proposed multiple renewable energy sources. The implication is that smaller and more remote communities may be the most willing to lead in the planned introduction of renewable energy systems. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerical predictions can provide detailed information on the combustion process thus playing a significant role in understanding the basic mechanisms for pollutant formation. In simulations of conventional pulverised coal combustion the gasification by CO2 or H2 O is usually omitted since its overall contribution to char oxidation is negligible compared to the oxidation with O2. In flameless combustion, however, due to the strong recirculation of hot combustion products, primarily CO2 and H2 O, and the thereby reduced concentration of O2 in the reaction zone the local partial pressures of CO2 and H2 O become significantly higher than that for O2. Therefore, the char reaction with CO2 and H2 O is being reconsidered. This paper presents a numerical study on the importance of these reactions on pollutant formation in flameless combustion. The numerical models used have been validated against experimental data. By varying the wall temperature and the burner excess air ratio, different cases have been investigated and the impact of considering gasification on the prediction of NO formation has been assessed. It was found that within the investigated ranges of these parameters the fraction of char being gasified increases up to 35%. This leads to changes in the local gas composition, primarily CO distribution, which in turn influences NO formation predictions. Considering gasification the prediction of NO emission is up to 40% lower than the predicted emissions without gasification reactions being taken into account. © 2009 The Combustion Institute.","Char gasification; Coal combustion; Flameless combustion; Simulation","Basic mechanism; Char gasification; Char oxidation; Char reaction; Combustion pro-cess; Concentration of; Excess air ratios; Experimental data; Flameless; Flameless combustion; Gas combustion; Gas compositions; Gasification reaction; Hot combustion; NO emissions; NO formation; Numerical models; Numerical predictions; Numerical studies; Pollutant formation; Pulverised coals; Reaction zones; Recirculations; Simulation; Wall temperatures; Coal; Coal industry; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Gas generators; Gasification; Leakage (fluid); Oxidation; Smoke; Thermochemistry; Coal combustion; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; nitric oxide; air pollution; article; chemical composition; coal gasification; coal power; combustion; computer prediction; computer simulation; controlled study; high temperature; oxidation; oxygen concentration; pressure; priority journal; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68049126565

Knowing the temperature of the surface of the TBC and at the interface between the bondcoat and the thermally grown oxide (TGO) under realistic conditions is highly desirable. As the major life-controlling factors for TBC systems are thermally activated, therefore linked with temperature, this would provide useful data for a better understanding of these phenomena and to assess the remaining lifetime of the TBC. This knowledge could also enable the design of advanced cooling strategies in the most efficient way using minimum amount of air. The integration of an on-line temperature detection system would enable the full potential of TBCs to be realized due to improved precision in temperature measurement and early warning of degradation. This, in turn, will increase fuel efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions. The concept of a thermal-sensing TBC was first introduced by Choy, Feist, and Heyes (1998, ""Thermal Barrier Coating With Thermoluminescent Indicator Material Embedded Therein,"" U.S. Patent U.S. 6974641 (B1)). The TBC is locally modified so it acts as a thermographic phosphor. Phosphors are an innovative way of remotely measuring temperatures and also other physical properties at different depths in the coating using photo stimulated phosphorescence (Allison and Gillies, 1997, ""Remote Thermometry With Thermographic Phosphors: Instrumentation and Applications,"" Rev. Sci. Instrum., 68(7), pp. 2615-2650). In this study the temperature dependence of several rare earth doped EB-PVD coatings will be compared. Details of the measurements, the influence of aging, the composition, and the fabrication of the sensing TBC will be discussed in this paper. The coatings proved to be stable and have shown excellent luminescence properties. Temperature detection at ultrahigh temperatures above 1300°C is presented using new types of EB-PVD TBC ceramic compositions. Multilayer sensing TBCs will be presented, which enable the detection of temperatures below and on the surface of the TBC simultaneously. © 2009 by STS Ltd. and Cranfield University.","Heat flux gauge; Luminescence; Phosphorescence; Remote monitoring; Sensor TBC; Thermal barrier coating; Thermographic phosphor; YAG","Heat flux gauges; Remote monitoring; Thermal barrier; Thermographic phosphors; YAG; Coatings; Condition monitoring; Design; Gages; Heat flux; Light emission; Metal working; Phosphorescence; Phosphors; Remote control; Sensors; Surfaces; Thermography (temperature measurement); Turbomachine blades; Thermal barrier coatings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149439182

An improved assessment of the present and future oceanic carbon sink is therefore necessary to provide recommendations for long-term global carbon cycle and climate policies. The formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) is a unique fast track for transporting anthropogenic CO2 into the ocean's interior, making the deep waters rich in anthropogenic carbon. Thus the Atlantic is presently estimated to hold 38% of the oceanic anthropogenic CO 2 inventory, although its volume makes up only 25% of the world ocean. Here we analyze the inventory change of anthropogenic CO2 in the Atlantic between 1997 and 2003 and its relationship to NADW formation. For the whole region between 20°S and 65°N the inventory amounts to 32.5 ± 9.5 Petagram carbon (Pg C) in 1997 and increases up to 36.0 ± 10.5 Pg C in 2003. This result is quite similar to earlier studies. Moreover, the overall increase of anthropogenic carbon is in close agreement with the expected change due to rising atmospheric CO2 levels of 1.69% a -1. On the other hand, when considering the subpolar region only, the results demonstrate that the recent weakening in the formation of Labrador Sea Water, a component of NADW, has already led to a decrease of the anthropogenic carbon inventory in this water mass. As a consequence, the overall inventory for the total water column in the western subpolar North Atlantic increased only by 2% between 1997 and 2003, much less than the 11% that would be expected from the increase in atmospheric CO2 levels.

However, it is uncertain (1) to what degree the reduction in criteria pollutants will impact urban air quality, and (2) how the reductions in pollutant emissions and concomitant urban air quality impacts compare to ultralow emission gasoline-powered vehicles projected for a future year (e.g., 2060). To address these questions, the present study introduces a ""spatially and temporally resolved energy and environment tool"" (STREET) to characterize the pollutant and GHG emissions associated with a comprehensive hydrogen supply infrastructure and HFCVs at a high level of geographic and temporal resolution. To demonstrate the utility of STREET, two spatially and temporally resolved scenarios for hydrogen infrastructure are evaluated in a prototypical urban airshed (the South Coast Air Basin of California) using geographic information systems (GIS) data. The well-to-wheels (WTW) GHG emissions are quantified and the air quality is established using a detailed atmospheric chemistry and transport model followed by a comparison to a future gasoline scenario comprised of advanced ICE vehicles. One hydrogen scenario includes more renewable primary energy sources for hydrogen generation and the other includes more fossil fuel sources.

The latter site also produced evidence for a younger, Final Palaeolithic occupation of the locality by people of the Federmessergruppen. Both sites are particularly well preserved, largely due to their burial beneath volcanic deposits of the late glacial Laacher See eruption. We conducted a program of AMS radiocarbon dating and stable isotope analyses with the aim of improving understanding of the chronological history and ecological setting of the two sites. Previously published radiocarbon dates appeared to indicate that the earliest Magdalenian occupation at Gönnersdorf fell around 12,900 uncalibrated 14C yr BP, while the earliest occupation at Andernach may have been more than 500 radiocarbon years earlier. The AMS determinations presented here revise this impression and suggest that the onset of occupation at the two sites was in fact simultaneous and prior to the warming of Greenland Interstadial GI 1e. At Gönnersdorf, a chronological hiatus exists between the main Magdalenian faunal assemblage and mega-faunal remains interpreted as collected sub-fossil material. At Andernach-Martinsberg, there is a clear chronological hiatus between the Magdalenian occupation and subsequent Federmessergruppen activities at the site. However, an intermediate radiocarbon date on an atypically preserved horse bone is suggestive of ephemeral human visits to the site between these well demonstrated phases. A date of similar age on an elk bone from Gönnersdorf may indicate broadly contemporaneous human presence at Gönnersdorf too. Stable isotope analysis of faunal remains from Gönnersdorf and Andernach-Martinsberg was conducted with the aim of both reconstructing and comparing local environmental conditions at the two sites, and also potentially identifying subtle variations in the chronological development of the two sites not detectable at the level of precision of current radiocarbon dating techniques. No spatial trends in the faunal isotope signatures were observed within each site. In the case of samples with both radiocarbon and isotope data, no chronological pattern was observed for the isotope results. The Magdalenian faunal isotope signatures at the two sites resembled each other, suggesting comparable climatic and environmental conditions. The faunal δ13C signatures at Gönnersdorf and Andernach-Martinsberg were similar to those at contemporary European sites. While the faunal δ15N values were similar to those at contemporary sites in Germany, the UK, and Belgium, they were lower than those from the South of France. This difference in δ15N values is thought to relate to regional differences in the timing of changes in soil and plant nitrogen cycling in response to ameliorating climatic conditions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

EU environmental policy and legislation have been developed and shaped by six environment action programmes for over 30. years. The first batch of environmental legislation put in place the framework for dealing with specific problems such as waste oil. This was built upon by legislation that developed standards for landfills and incinerators for example whilst the third batch of legislations introduced recycling directives which put in place the necessary organisation and finances to assist the recycling of key waste flows such as end-of-life vehicles. Some lack of clarity in the wording of the directives meant that implementation among member states was variable and the current legislation seeks to harmonise and streamline environmental law making it simpler and more enforceable. The chapter then goes on to discuss some of the key pieces of legislation that are likely to be of most relevance to composite materials. A number of key changes have been proposed in some areas, for example, the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from passenger vehicles and potential areas for further legislation are highlighted. © 2010 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.",,"Carbon dioxide; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Recycling; Solid wastes; Carbon dioxide emissions; End-of-Life Vehicles; Environmental law; Environmental legislations; Environmental policy; Passenger vehicles; Recycling wastes; Specific problems; Laws and legislation",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902434546

We review the potential for this mechanism [reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD)] to provoke ecological damages and promote ecological cobenefits. Nations could potentially participate in REDD by slowing clear-cutting of mature tropical forest, slowing or decreasing the impact of selective logging, promoting forest regeneration and restoration, and expanding tree plantations. REDD could also foster efforts to reduce the incidence of forest fire. Potential ecological costs include the accelerated loss (through displaced agricultural expansion) of low-biomass, high-conservation-value ecosystems, and substitution of low-biomass vegeta- tion by monoculture tree plantations. These costs could be avoided through measures that protect low-biomass native ecosystems. Substantial ecological cobenefits should be conferred under most circumstances, and include the maintenance or restoration of (1) watershed functions, (2) local and regional climate regimes, (3) soils and biogeochemical processes, (4) water quality and aquatic habitat, and (5) terrestrial habitat. Some tools already being developed to monitor, report and verify (MRV) carbon emissions performance can also be used to measure other elements of ecosystem function, making development of MRV systems for ecological cobenefits a concrete possibility. Analysis of possible REDD program interven- tions in a large-scale Amazon landscape indicates that even modest flows of forest carbon funding can provide substantial cobenefits for aquatic ecosystems, but that the functional integrity of the landscape's myriad small watersheds would be best protected under a more even spatial distribution of forests. Because of its focus on an ecosystem service with global benefits, REDD could access a large pool of global stakeholders willing to pay to maintain carbon in forests, thereby providing a potential cascade of ecosystem services to local stakeholders who would otherwise be unable to afford them. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Carbon; Climate; Deforestation; Degradation; Ecosystem services; Land-use and land-cover change; REDD; Tropical conservation; Watersheds; Xingu river basin","carbon emission; clean development mechanism; cost-benefit analysis; deforestation; ecological economics; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; emission control; environmental economics; habitat fragmentation; habitat restoration; Index of Biotic Integrity; land cover; land use change; nature conservation; selective logging; United Nations; willingness to pay; Amazonia; Brazil; Xingu River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71549136024

Using a threshold modeling approach, we quantify spatial, climatic, and acrossseason autoregressive effects under contrasting regimes of low and high densities of planktivorous fish (capelin and herring). Main findings: (1) zooplankton biomass is mainly influenced by capelin feeding, first in the offshore parts of the western Barents Sea in spring and subsequently farther east and north in summer, whereas direct effects of herring are quantitatively less important; (2) effects of climate are stronger during the zooplankton increase phase in spring than in summer and are better predicted using the North Atlantic Oscillation index than using reconstructed sea surface temperature and Atlantic water influx; (3) regional anomalies in zooplankton biomass persist from spring to summer but not from summer to the subsequent spring, indicating that the observed fluctuations have little effect on next year's dynamics; and (4) effects of climatic variation and planktivorous fish interact: climatic (and autoregressive) effects are mainly evident when and where the effect of feeding is weak.

Recently, the Council has undertaken risk-averse management actions, in light of uncertainty about the effects of warming trends (and loss of sea ice) and resulting changes to fishing activities in the North Pacific. The Council has assessed whether opportunities for unregulated fishing could result from changes in fish distribution, has closed the Arctic Ocean to all commercial fishing pending further research, and has established extensive area closures where fishing with bottom-trawl gear is prohibited to protect vulnerable crab habitat and to control the northern expansion of the trawl fleet into newly ice-free waters. In cases where linkages between climate variables and fish distributions can be identified, the Council is developing adaptive management measures to respond to varying distributions of fish and shellfish. Finally, the Council has also tried to re-examine existing information to gain a better understanding of climate and ecosystem effects on fishery management. The pilot Fishery Ecosystem Plan for the Aleutian Islands maps interactions among climate factors and ecosystem components and suggests indicators for the Council to monitor. © 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The montane distribution of this group creates natural allopatry among members and offers an excellent opportunity to explore geographic models of speciation. Using a multilocus approach, we obtained data from one nuclear (c-myc) and three mitochondrial (12S, 16S, and COI) gene regions from 40 individuals within the C. podiciferus complex. Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed a basal split that placed samples from western Panama as sister to Costa Rican (CR) samples, corroborating a previous suggestion that the former lineage may represent an undescribed species. Within the CR clades we found six distinct haplogroups whose distributions largely corresponded to geographic features and included instances of sympatry. Divergence estimates were used to develop a preliminary evolutionary timeframe for the diversification of the C. podiciferus complex. Based on collective evidence, we hypothesize that movement of the CR haplogroups has occurred between currently isolated areas of suitable habitat via second order climatic fluctuations during the Pleistocene. The levels of genetic differentiation within the C. podiciferus complex are remarkable given the relatively small geographic area (ca. 8000 km2) of occurrence. This diversity emphasizes the need for further study and taxonomic revision to aid in conservation planning for this complex which, like many amphibians, has experienced recent population declines. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This interest was catalyzed by basic scientific experiments showing that iron limits primary production in certain regions of the ocean. The approach-considered a form of ""geoengineering""-is to induce phytoplankton blooms through iron addition, with the goal of producing organic particles that sink to the deep ocean, sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. With the controversy surrounding the most recent scientific iron fertilization experiment in the Southern Ocean (LOHAFEX) and the ongoing discussion about restrictions on large-scale iron fertilization activities by the London Convention, the debate about the potential use of iron fertilization for geoengineering has never been more public or more pronounced. To help inform this debate, we present a synoptic view of the two-decade history of iron fertilization, from scientific experiments to commercial enterprises designed to trade credits for ocean fertilization on a developing carbon market. Throughout these two decades there has been a repeated cycle: Scientific experiments are followed by media and commercial interest and this triggers calls for caution and the need for more experiments. Over the years, some scientists have repeatedly pointed out that the idea is both unproven and potentially ecologically disruptive, and models have consistently shown that at the limit, the approach could not substantially change the trajectory of global warming. Yet, interest and investment in ocean fertilization as a climate mitigation strategy have only grown and intensified, fueling media reports that have misconstrued scientific results, and conflated scientific experimentation with geoengineering. We suggest that it is time to break this two-decade cycle, and argue that we know enough about ocean fertilization to say that it should not be considered further as a means to mitigate climate change. But, ocean fertilization research should not be halted: if used appropriately and applied to testable hypotheses, it is a powerful research tool for understanding the responses of ocean ecosystems in the context of climate change. © 2009 by The Oceanography Society.

Using an unusually large number of both failed and successful documented introductions of parakeets (Aves: Psittacidae) in Europe, we test two of the major hypotheses on the establishment success of invading species, namely the climate-matching and the human-activity hypothesis. Location European human population centres where ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri) and/or monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) introductions have occurred. Methods Data on ring-necked and monk parakeet introductions in Europe were gathered from various sources, including published books and articles, but also from unpublished reports and local grey literature. Information was verified with experts from the region under consideration. In order to test the climate-matching hypothesis, we verified whether the climatic factors that determine the parakeets' native ranges also explain establishment success in Europe. Parakeet occurrence data from the native ranges were analysed using the presence-only modelling method Maxent, and correlations between parakeet establishment and climatic and anthropogenic variables in Europe were assessed using both stepwise logistic regression and the information-theoretic model selection approach. Results The establishment success of ring-necked and monk parakeets was found to be positively associated with human population density, and, both in the native and in the introduced regions, parakeet occurrence was negatively correlated with the number of frost days. Thus, parakeets are more likely to establish in warmer and human-dominated areas. Main conclusions The large number of independent parakeet introductions in Europe allows us to test the often-used climate-matching and human-activity hypotheses at the species level. We show that both hypotheses offer insight into the invasion process of monk and ring-necked parakeets. Our results suggest that, in the future, parakeet establishment probability may increase even further because global warming is likely to cause a decrease in the number of frost days and because urbanization and human populations are still increasing. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate-matching hypothesis; Establishment success; Europe; Human-activity hypothesis; Invasive alien species; Monk parakeet; Myiopsitta monachus; Psittacidae; Psittacula krameri; Ring-necked parakeet","biodiversity; biological invasion; bird; environmental risk; global warming; hypothesis testing; invasive species; probability; regression analysis; urbanization; Eurasia; Europe; Aves; Myiopsitta; Myiopsitta monachus; Psittacidae; Psittacula krameri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449710841

The global economic cost has been so high that there has been substantial investigation into the reasons behind the crisis and the failings in regulation and governance which allowed it to happen. This offers the potential to examine the transferability of the lessons learned in terms of regulatory failings for sectors beyond the financial services and markets. Having assessed the validity of the approach, this article investigates the potential implications of four identified generic categories of regulatory failure for the sphere of environmental regulation. Despite the obvious disparity between the nature of the respective regulated communities, this analysis shows that there are some interesting comparisons to be drawn between recent failures of financial regulation and threats and challenges that currently or potentially exist in environmental regulation. As a result, a number of areas have been identified as risk factors which it may be prudent for regulators and policy makers to consider in relation to the regulation of the environment and regulating for the orderly conduct of the rapidly growing carbon markets. These factors include: an increased risk of sole reliance on economic instruments to deliver environmental objectives, due to the fallibility of previously accepted assumptions about market behaviours; risks to liquidity management within carbon markets by inadequate regulation of liquidity control or high levels of trading in highly structured securitised derivatives; an appreciation of the strength of the 'herd instinct' in the overexploitation of common environmental resources at the level of both the regulated and the regulator; and, finally, a need to guard against regulatory complicity in short-termist, economically driven behaviours which are detrimental to environmental sustainability and, in some cases, also to long term economic interests.",,"capitalism; environmental economics; environmental management; environmental policy; environmental risk; financial services",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72549107410

Materials and methods Surface sediment samples (146 in total) were collected at various points along the Swedish coast and offshore areas. In addition, bulk deposition was sampled, monthly, at a single site in northern Sweden during 1 year. The concentrations of tetra- through octa-substituted CDD/Fs were determined in both matrices. Results Highly elevated concentrations of PCDD/Fs were found at many sites in coastal areas and concentrations were also slightly elevated in some offshore areas. Homologue profiles varied substantially amongst samples from coastal sites, while those from offshore and other pristine sediments were relatively similar. The offshore sediments showed different profiles from those observed in the deposition samples. Sediment levels of PCDD/Fs were not generally significantly correlated to organic carbon levels, except in some pristine areas. Comparison of data obtained in this and previous studies suggest that both their levels and profiles are similar today to those observed 20 years ago in coastal and offshore areas. The only detected trend is that their levels appear to have decreased slightly in the offshore area of the Bothnian Sea. Discussion The localization of hotspot areas along the coast, the lack of consensus between PCDD/F profiles of sediments and general background, and their weak correlations with organic carbon suggest that PCDD/Fs in the study area largely originate from local/regional emissions. However, due to complicating factors such as sediment dynamics and land upheaval, it is not possible to conclude whether these pollutants derive from recent emissions or from a combination of recent emissions and re-distribution of previous inputs. Conclusions The results show that: elevated levels of PCDD/Fs are present in both coastal and offshore areas of the Baltic Sea, the major hotspots are close to the shore, and there are large variations in profiles, indicating that local emissions are (or have been) the major causes of pollution. Recommendations and perspectives In order to identify other hotspot areas and trace sources, comprehensive analysis of PCDD/Fs in surface sediments is needed in all areas of the Baltic Sea that have not been previously investigated. The high levels of PCDD/Fs observed in surface sediments also indicate a need to elucidate whether they are due mainly to current emissions or a combination of recent pollution and re-distribution of historically deposited pollutants. To do so, better understanding of sediment dynamics and present-day inputs, such as riverine inputs, industrial effluents, and leakage from contaminated soil is required. There are indications that contaminated sediments have a regional impact on fish contamination levels. However, as yet there is no statistically robust evidence linking contaminated sediments with elevated levels in Baltic biota. It should also be noted that the Baltic Sea is being massively invaded by the deep-burrowing polychaete Marenzielleria ssp., whose presence in sediments has been shown to increase water concentrations of hydrophobic pollutants. In awareness of this, it is clear that high levels in sediments cannot be ignored in risk assessments. In order to investigate the emission trends more thoroughly, analysis of PCDD/Fs in offshore sediment cores throughout the Baltic Sea is also recommended. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Baltic sea; Homologue profiles; Patterns; PCDDs; PCDFs; Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins; Polychlorinated dibenzofurans; Sediment; Sources","chemical pollutant; coastal sediment; correlation; hydrophobicity; industrial emission; industrial practice; organic carbon; pristine environment; risk assessment; sampling; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Polychaeta; Tetra; 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; benzofuran derivative; chlorinated dibenzofurans; drug derivative; polychlorodibenzo 4 dioxin; polychlorodibenzo-4-dioxin; article; chemistry; environmental monitoring; sea; sediment; Sweden; water pollutant; Benzofurans; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Oceans and Seas; Sweden; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69849113333

The DPF was deactivated in order to ensure the non-regeneration state and was just used as a soot filter trap upstream of the three-way catalyst. The goal of the research was to investigate the efficiency of emission conversion for an automotive diesel engine with a general three-way catalyst normally used for gasoline-powered vehicles under near-stoichiometric combustion operation. A modified single-cylinder engine was used for the experiments that considered throttled diesel combustion at 65-90kPa intake pressure to achieve near-stoichiometric conditions, and a common rail injection system with 90MPa injection pressure was used for mixture preparation and to avoid spray wall impingement. The results showed that the three-way catalyst was able to reduce NO x and CO emissions by up to nearly 98 per cent, and the DPF trapped soot emissions up to 99.6 per cent for near-stoichiometric operation. However, the particular palladium/rhodium catalyst formulation used in the study was less effective for HC emissions, which were only reduced by up to 57 per cent. It is concluded that the use of the present proposed three-way catalyst/DPF aftertreatment system provides significant promise for future efficient, low emission diesel engines. © IMechE 2009.","Aftertreatment; Conversion efficiency; Equivalence ratio; Stoichiometric diesel combustion; Three-way catalyst","Aftertreatment; CO emissions; Common rail injection system; Diesel combustion; Diesel particulate filters; Equivalence ratio; Experimental studies; HC emissions; Injection pressures; Intake pressure; Low emission; Pollutant emission; Simultaneous reduction; Single-cylinder engines; Soot emissions; Spray wall impingement; Stoichiometric diesel combustion; Three way catalysts; Three-way catalyst; Air filters; Automobile parts and equipment; Catalysis; Catalyst regeneration; Combustion; Conversion efficiency; Diesel engines; Engine cylinders; Fuel filters; Hydrocarbons; Particulate emissions; Reduction; Smoke; Soot; Carbon monoxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349328109

When a lower forest biomass availability estimate was used to determine how much electricity (methanol fed into fuel cells) could be produced in Indonesia, more than 10 million households or about 12,000 villages (20% of the total rural villages in Indonesia) would be supplied annually with electricity. Collecting forest biomass at the higher end of the estimated available biomass and converting it to methanol to supply fuel cells could provide electricity to more than 42 million households annually. This would be approximately 52,000 villages, or 86% of the total rural villages in Indonesian. When electricity is produced with bio-methanol/fuel cells, it could potentially supply from half to all of the current electricity consumed in Indonesia. By generating electricity using bio-methanol/fuel cells instead of from fossil fuels, from 9 to 38% of the total carbon currently emitted each year in Indonesia could be avoided. In contrast, substituting this same amount of bio-methanol for gasoline could provide all of the annual gasoline needs of Indonesia and contribute towards reducing their carbon emissions by about 8-35%. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Addition of powdered activated carbon (0.14 g carbon/cm3 membrane) reduced pseudo-steady-state flux through thin HDPE membranes by approximately 60%. Breakthrough curves for activated carbon-containing membranes were best described by a model in which sorption to the carbon was limited by the rate of diffusion from the bulk membrane to the carbon particle surfaces. Field-scale estimates based on this model show a substantial (over 10 orders of magnitude) reduction in flux for the activated carbon-containing HDPE compared with pure HDPE. The flux of 2,3′,4′, 5-tetrachlorobiphenyl through a composite membrane with thin layers of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with 0.05 g carbon/cm3 and pure HDPE was 69% lower than expected for a similar layered membrane without the sorptive scavenger.

A note on the use of temporal frequency distributions in studies of prehistoric demography. Journal of Archaeological Science 34, 1868-1877.] that explored the problem of taphonomic bias. Taphonomic bias refers to the tendency for younger things to be over-represented relative to older things in the archaeological record due to the operation of destructive processes like erosion and weathering. Using a database of radiocarbon dated volcanic deposits from Bryson, R.U., Bryson, R.A., Ruter, A. [2006. A calibrated radiocarbon database of late Quaternary volcanic eruptions. Earth Discussions 1, 123-124.], we develop an empirical model of taphonomic bias. In contrast to our prior study in which we modeled taphonomic bias as an exponential function wherein the likelihood of site loss remains constant through time, we argue that the probability of site destruction actually decreases with site age. We further demonstrate how this model can be used to correct temporal frequency distributions and extract demographic histories.

The issues in the internal constraints mentioned are related to the function of several elements of the company. As a business organization, corporation is unable to achieve its goal to successfully implement GCG principles since it is not support by its internal elements' functions. Two of several numbers of internal elements of a company are ethical work climate and leadership style of the top management. To prove the correlation between internal function of organization (in this case ethical work climate and transformational leadership) and the successful implementation of GCG principles, this study proposes two hypotheses to be empirically tested on thirty surveyed organizations; eleven of which are state-owned companies and nineteen are private companies.

The residential sector is a substantial consumer of energy in every country, and therefore a focus for energy consumption efforts. Since the energy consumption characteristics of the residential sector are complex and inter-related, comprehensive models are needed to assess the technoeconomic impacts of adopting energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies suitable for residential applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review of the various modeling techniques used for modeling residential sector energy consumption. Two distinct approaches are identified: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach treats the residential sector as an energy sink and is not concerned with individual end-uses. It utilizes historic aggregate energy values and regresses the energy consumption of the housing stock as a function of top-level variables such as macroeconomic indicators (e.g. gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation), energy price, and general climate. The bottom-up approach extrapolates the estimated energy consumption of a representative set of individual houses to regional and national levels, and consists of two distinct methodologies: the statistical method and the engineering method. Each technique relies on different levels of input information, different calculation or simulation techniques, and provides results with different applicability. A critical review of each technique, focusing on the strengths, shortcomings and purposes, is provided along with a review of models reported in the literature. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It then characterizes signatory campuses with respect to such variables as their size, location, and type. Findings – The paper shows that there is no typical signatory among the 379 ACUPCC charter members. Many types of institutions, public and private, small and large, and located throughout the USA, have pledged to become climate neutral through this commitment. Practical implications – Understanding more about how USA higher education is responding to global climate change is an important component of the larger discussions surrounding this critical issue. Originality/value – Higher education has a vital role to play in global climate change mitigation and adaptation, but there has been little prior scholarly attention to this topic.

Spheroids were transfected with CA9 (or empty vector) and imaged confocally (using fluorescent dyes) for both intracellular pH (pHi) and pH in the restricted extracellular spaces (pHe). With no CA9 expression, spheroids developed very low pHi (∼6.3) and reduced pHe (∼6.9) at their core, associated with a diminishing gradient of acidity extending out to the periphery. With CA9 expression, core intracellular acidity was less prominent (pHi = ∼6.6), whereas extracellular acidity was enhanced (pHe = ∼6.6), so that radial pHi gradients were smaller and radial pHe gradients were larger. These effects were reversed by eliminating CA9 activity with membrane-impermeant CA inhibitors. The observation that CA9 activity reversibly reduces pHe indicates the enzyme is facilitating CO2 excretion from cells (by converting vented CO2 to extracellutar H+), rather than facilitating membrane H+ transport (such as H+ associated with metabolically generated lactic acid). This latter process requires titration of exported H+ ions with extracellular HCO3-, which would reduce rather than increase extracellular acidity. In a multicellular structure, the net effect of CA9 on pHe will depend on the cellular CO2/lactic acid emission ratio (set by local oxygenation and membrane HCO3- uptake). Our results suggest that CO2-producing tumors may express CA9 to facilitate CO2 excretion, thus raising pHi and reducing pHe, which promotes tumor proliferation and survival. The results suggest a possible basis for attenuating tumor development through inhibiting CA9 activity. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Carbonic anhydrase; Emission ratio; Empty vector; Extracellular; Extracellular space; Fluorescent dyes; Human colon; Intracellular pH; Isoform; Membrane-impermeant; Multicellular spheroid; Multicellular structure; Net effect; Tumor development; Tumor proliferation; Body fluids; Cell membranes; Enzyme activity; Enzymes; Growth kinetics; Lactic acid; Organic acids; Oxygenation; Tumors; pH effects; bicarbonate; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase IX; fluorescent dye; hydrogen; isoenzyme; lactic acid; article; carbon dioxide excretion; carcinogenesis; cell growth; cell membrane transport; cell pH; cell proliferation; cell strain HCT116; cell structure; cell survival; controlled study; enzyme activity; extracellular space; genetic transfection; human; human cell; multicellular spheroid; oxygenation; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; proton transport; regulatory mechanism; tumor growth; Acids; Antigens, Neoplasm; Bicarbonates; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Anhydrases; Carcinoma; Cell Line, Tumor; Colonic Neoplasms; Fluorescein; Gene Expression; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Spheroids, Cellular; Tumor Cells, Cultured",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67749145635

We distinguish between the formal elements contained in the legislation and the discursive impacts, particularly in relation to public health concerns and about cap and trade and market mechanisms. Drawing from interviews, public documents, and legislative archives, we document the process by which these diverse environmental justice elements were incorporated into AB 32 to ask a seemingly simple question. Is California really ""best in show"" when it comes to climate and environmental justice policy? The complex politics involved in the drafting and passage of the legislation show to what extent environmental justice organizations played in AB 32's passage. We then argue that understanding the contentiousness in how AB 32 was drafted lends insight and context to the ongoing conflicts over the implementation of AB 32, specifically the role of cap and trade and market mechanisms more generally. Given the historical and continuing prominence of California in national and environmental policy development, the intersection of environmental justice movements with the development of state policy, described here, has larger implications for the broader climate justice movement and the complicated engagement between social movements and policy-making. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"climate change; environmental justice; environmental legislation; policy making; public health; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73849147119

Regional air quality modeling for 2001 and 2050 was conducted using CMAQ Modeling System with meteorology from the GISS Global Climate Model, downscaled regionally using MM5, keeping boundary conditions of air pollutants, emission sources, population, activity levels, and pollution controls constant. BenMap was employed to estimate the air pollution health outcomes at the county, state, and national level for 2050 caused by the effect of meteorology on future ozone and PM2.5 concentrations. The changes in calculated annual mean PM 2.5 concentrations show a relatively modest change with positive and negative responses (increasing PM2.5 levels across the northeastern U.S.) although average ozone levels slightly decrease across the northern sections of the U.S., and increase across the southern tier. Results suggest that climate change driven air quality-related health effects will be adversely affected in more than 2/3 of the continental U.S. Changes in health effects induced by PM2.5 dominate compared to those caused by ozone. PM 2.5-induced premature mortality is about 15 times higher than that due to ozone. Nationally the analysis suggests approximately 4000 additional annual premature deaths due to climate change impacts on PM2.5 vs 300 due to climate change-induced ozone changes. However, the impacts vary spatially. Increased premature mortality due to elevated ozone concentrations will be offset by lower mortality from reductions in PM2.5 in 11 states.

Here we report the results of simulations conducted with an ocean general circulation and biogeochemistry model (OGCBM) to quantify the importance of each source at different spatial scales at quasi-equilibrium. Overall, we find sediment derived iron is more important than dust derived iron in sustaining SO export production (by 1.4 to 9 times). Although dust iron is important in certain geographic sectors of the SO, this largely depends on the dust model employed. Apparent geographical correlations between dust deposition and export production can be misleading, since sediment iron can be transported to similar regions.

The goal of surgical procedures should be 'optimal reduction of volume and secretion with preservation of function'. For a period of about 25 years, laser surgery of the inferior turbinate has been considered a simple and effective surgical treatment with a low complication rate that has been in widespread use by many ENT surgeons. Various trials have demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of a series of different laser systems including carbon dioxide, Nd:YAG, potassium-titanyl-phosphate, and diode laser. Laser surgery generally induces significant increases of the total volume of the nasal cavity. Several studies have provided evidence that the expression degree of local inflammatory cytokines and chemical mediators can be attenuated by the treatment. The mucociliary function of the inferior turbinate seems to be preserved after CO2laser intervention. A breakthrough in the surgical procedures available for allergic patients who severely suffer from both intractable hypertrophic inferior turbinates and unregulated nasal secretion was introduced in Japan.Posterior nasal neurectomy is a novel alternative method in which neural bundles are selectively cut or cauterized from the sphenopalatine foramen. Resection of the posterior nasal nerve at this point enables surgeons to inhibit the parasympathetic nerve function of the nasal mucosa with no troublesome complications such as decrease of lacrimal secretion. The procedure simultaneously provides interruption of the somatic afferent innervation to the turbinate mucosa. Herein we assess the clinical effectiveness of this surgical procedure based on objective and measurable monitoring parameters and discuss the underlying therapeutic mechanisms. copyright © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Acoustic rhinometry; Allergic rhinitis; Cedar pollinosis; Chemokines; Cytokines","cytokine; allergic rhinitis; carbon dioxide laser; ciliary motility; diode laser; human; Japan; laser surgery; neodymium laser; nose congestion; nose mucosa; nose obstruction; nose surgery; parasympathetic nerve; postoperative complication; priority journal; review; sensory nerve; turbinate",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350327523

However, studies to date have largely focused on the role of substrate quality in the regulation of this important process. As such, we know little about the role of other ecological drivers in shaping bacterially mediated C cycling. Here we examine the manner in which planktonic bacterial abundance (BA), productivity (BP), respiration (BR), and growth efficiency (BGE), and thus C cycling are affected by elevated pH, an ecological factor that occurs commonly in highly productive aquatic systems. We undertook our study in lakes of the Mackenzie Delta region of Canada. These lakes routinely experience high pH caused by rapid macrophyte photosynthesis. Two different experiment types were employed: first, a series of short-term experiments was used to assess the direct effects of elevated pH on bacteria experiencing differing pH levels in situ. Second, longterm mesocosms were used to explore the effect of elevated pH on bacteria over longer time scales and in the presence of other trophic levels. Bacterial productivity and BR slowed dramatically with elevated pH over the short term, potentially uncoupling bacterial processing of organic matter from its in-lake production and causing a switch away from biomass creation and toward C mineralization. With longer term exposure, bacterial communities adapted to the direct stress of elevated pH, but responses at higher trophic levels caused a cascade that mediated the effect of alkalization on bacteria, in a manner that could well vary among aquatic ecosystems. Our study establishes elevated pH as a key driver of bacterial C cycling and energy flow in aquatic systems with high autotrophic productivity. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","Alkalization; Bacterial growth efficiency; Bacterial production; Bacterial respiration; Carbon cycling; Community adaptation; Ecological stressors; High productivity; Mackenzie Delta; pH; Trophic cascades; Western Canadian Arctic","fresh water; abundance; bacterium; carbon cycle; energy flow; experimental study; lake; mesocosm; pH; photosynthesis; respiration; animal; article; bacterium; chemistry; ecosystem; invertebrate; metabolism; microbiology; pH; photosynthesis; physiology; time; Animals; Bacteria; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Invertebrates; Photosynthesis; Time Factors; Water Microbiology; Canada; Canadian Arctic; North America; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650657118

Film cooling was via a straight circular hole of 4mm in diameter located in the middle section of the blade angled 30 deg along the streamwise direction and 90 deg along the spanwise direction. The Reynolds (ReD) number based on the mainstream velocity and the film hole diameter was fixed at 3191, and the rotating speed (ω) was either 0 rpm or 800 rpm; the film cooling blowing ratios ranged from 0.4 to 2.0, and two averaged density ratios of 1.02 and 1.53 were employed with air and carbon dioxide (CO2) as the coolant, respectively. Thermochromic liquid crystal was used to measure the solid surface temperature distributions. Experimental results showed the following: (1) In the stationary case, the blowing ratio has a significant influence on the nondimensional heat transfer coefficient (hg/h0) especially in the near hole region. (2) The film trajectory in rotation had an obvious deflection in the spanwise direction, and the deflection angles on the suction surface are larger than those on the pressure surface. This was attributed to the combined action of the Coriolis force and centrifugal force. (3) In the rotating case, for CO2 injection, the magnitude of heat transfer coefficient on the pressure surface is reduced compared with the stationary case, and the blowing ratio has smaller effects on hg/h0 distribution. However, on the suction surface, the heat transfer coefficient at x/D&lt;1.0 is enhanced and then rapidly reduced to be also below the stationary values. For air injection, rotation also depresses the hg/h0 for both the pressure and the suction surface.

Microstructural characterization revealed that the cracks were of the ductile intergranular mode, which could be related to localized plastic deformation alongside the grain boundaries. The microstructure of the heat-affected zone was distinguished from the base metal by a coarser grain structure and intergranular oxidation in addition to higher hardness indicating the presence of residual stresses from the welding process. Intergranular oxidation was found to result in a mixture of Cr and Fe oxides enveloping a Ni-rich solid-solution adjacent to the grain boundary. Therefore, the observed ductile intergranular cracking could be related to localized plastic deformation in the relatively ""soft"" zone of Ni-rich solid-solution. Most evidence indicated that the failure occurred because of improper welding atmosphere leading to internal oxidation under relatively low oxygen potential, which is oxidizing to Cr and to a lesser extent Fe, and reducing to Ni. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Results revealed that individuals who experience low conflict and high facilitation in the direction of work-to-family are more likely to report their perception of the psychological contract to be fair.

Among the most substantial and positive results of this approach are reduction of private vehicle traffic for shopping purposes, energy consumption and also air pollution. For this purpose, District 1, of Tehran, among total 22 districts of this metropolitan, has been selected because of high traffic and air pollution level. Using distribution of 500 questionnaires, including 10 closed questions, randomly among the habitants, this study aims to analysis data according to data frequency method and relation between daily inner travels and traveled distances for shopping purposes. The results show that among total habitants (320,800) of the study area, 87,241 persons possess private vehicle which result in approximately 89,867 trips for shopping purposes (supermarkets or grocery stores). Suffering from high level of air pollution, 55% of respondents greatly considered e-shopping to play a crucial role in reduction of different kinds of pollution, while 10% have rejected the efficiency of this method and the other 39% have not had any clear idea. Finally, it is concluded that e-shopping is an effective method in reduction of air pollution and can lead to considerable decrease of energy consumption (71%) and air pollution (39%) resulted from substitution of delivery vans with personal trips for supermarket goods.","Air pollution; E-shopping; Energy consumption; Tehran; Traffic","fuel; air pollution; article; energy consumption; human; questionnaire; socioeconomics; traffic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73249120248

Issues of fundamental importance associated with nanocarbon coatings are reducing stress, improving adhesion and compatibility with substrates. In this work new nanocomposite coatings with improved toughness based in nanocrys- talline phases of metals and ceramics embedded in amorphous carbon matrix are being developed within the frame of a research project: nc-MeNxCy/a-C(Me) with Me = Mo, Si, Al, Ti, etc. Carbide forming metal/carbon (Me/C) composite films with Me = Mo, W or Ti possess appropriate properties to overcome the limitation of pure DLC films. These novel coating architectures will be adopted with the objective to decrease residual stress, improve adherence and fracture toughness, obtain low friction coefficient and high wear-resistance. Nanocomposite DLC's films were deposited by hybrid technique using a PVD-Physically Vapor Deposition (magnetron sputtering) and Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD), by the use of CH 4 gas. The parameters varied were: deposition time, substrate temperature (180 °C) and dopant (Si + Mo) of the amorphous carbon matrix. All the depositions were made on silicon wafers and steel substrates precoated with a silicon inter- layer. The characterisation of the film's physico-mechanical properties will be presented in order to understand the influence of the deposition parameters and metal content used within the a-C matrix in the thin film properties. Film microstructure and film hybridization state was characterized by Raman Spectroscopy. In order to characterize morphology SEM and AFM will be used. Film composition was measured by Energy-Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) and by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The contact angle for the produced DLC's on silicon substrates were also measured. Thin film adherence was studied by micro-scratch test. Residual stresses in the produced coatings will be analysed by bending technique.

In the case of New Mexico, about 90% of the 1.8 million inhabitants depend on ground brackish water as their only source of potable water in many areas of the state. This report presents a technically-supported, economically-feasible and environmentally friendly proposal to desalinate brackish water to supply potable water to inland, isolated communities in southwest New Mexico. Several existing technologies were reviewed to identify opportunities for optimization by combining them to provide potable water and reduce the waste stream. Alternatives were studied and experimentation was conducted for some of them. The alternatives proposed were the use of natural coagulants for pretreatment, various solar collectors' arrangements for energy supply, reverse osmosis (RO), low temperature multi-effect distillation (LT-MED), multi-stage flash distillation (MSF), solar distillation (SD), and electrodialysis for desalination process; Spirulina cultivation and SD for waste treatment, and deep well injection (DWI) for waste disposal. Some alternatives were eliminated because they are either technologically or economically not feasible for this case and present high environmental impact. Three plant configurations were analyzed. Option A involves using the linear Fresnel systems (LFS) to produce steam for the first effect of a nine-effect evaporation plant. The number of effects was determined to achieve the optimal relation between equipment investment costs and steam production cost. This plant operates 8 h per day with solar energy and the rest of the 24 hour operating time is provided with fossil fuels. The waste produced will be further evaporated with SD to minimize its flow and the concentrated brine will be injected into a deep well. Option B has the same elements as option A, except that it does not consider the SD, but direct brine injection into a deep well. Option C considers the use of SD as the only process for distillation with DWI as the waste disposal method. The selection criteria for the best configuration were optimal use of solar energy resources, minimization of fossil fuel consumption and waste stream generation and disposal. Operation requirements and economic analysis were considered to select a proposal easy to implement and operate in rural isolated communities. For the following reasons option A is the best configuration to cover the necessity of potable water in New Mexico: (A) the plant is easy to construct and operate. In addition, it can handle different ranges of brackish water flow. (B) The 76% water recovery of the system almost matches the recovery achieved in a RO plant (80%), with the advantage that maintenance costs are reduced and treatment flowrates cannot be matched by the RO plant. (C) Use of the LFS reduces the emission of combustion gases to the atmosphere by 33%. This manifests as a positive point in a LCA evaluation. (D) The minimum environmental impact of the process facilitates the public involvement plan (PIP) because it gives the plant an environmentally responsible image in terms of avoiding greenhouse gases emissions. (E) The return on investment (ROI) is 10.2% at a price of $5.00/m3 of desalinated water, which is superior to the estimated minimum attractive rate of return (MARR) used for LT-MED plants as 9.5% annually. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The experiment was carried out in the following four treatments: (1) fallow, (2) fallow + biogas slurry, (3) spring barley, and (4) spring barley + biogas slurry. The CO2 evolution rate ranged between 15 and 120 mg C m-2 h-1 in both fallow treatments and showed a significant exponential relationship with the soil temperature at 5 cm depth. According to the extrapolation of the CO2 evolution rates into amounts per hectare, approximately 200 kg C ha-1 or 27% of the biogas slurry derived C were mineralized to CO2 during a 50 days' period to 18 June in the fallow treatment with biogas slurry. An additional amount of up to 29.5 kg inorganic N ha-1 could be calculated as the sum of NH4-N already present in biogas slurry at the time of amendment and from the amount of biogas slurry mineralized in the soil to NO3-N. A good agreement between measured and modelled stocks of inorganic N at 0-60 cm depth was obtained after having five-fold increased soil organic C turnover compared to the default values of the model DNDC. The mineralization data are in line with an amount of up to 21 kg ha-1 more N transferred by the barley plants to their aboveground biomass in biogas slurry treatment. The N not accounted for by the aboveground plant biomass could be explained by the belowground plant-derived N. CO2 evolution from the soil surface, inorganic N content at 0-60 cm depth and N transfer into barley aboveground biomass lead apparently to similar results after the application of biogas slurry. The soil ATP content after harvest of the barley was significantly larger in the two treatments with biogas slurry, especially in the fallow treatment indicating a positive effect on the soil microbial community. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

An extended WRAP tool methodology has been developed and is illustrated through assessing the relative carbon dioxide performance of different aggregate sourcing options for the large redevelopment project known as Masshouse, in the centre of Birmingham, UK. Previously unconsidered factors such as aggregate quality and highway congestion have been included. It is shown that significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions can be achieved where sitederived demolition waste is reprocessed for use on site as a recycled aggregate and that relative haulage distances are of particular importance to overall carbon dioxide emissions. As these outcomes depend upon the distances to materials sources and sinks in Birmingham, it is concluded that the carbon dioxide emissions associated with aggregate sourcing are not just a function of material type but also of local conditions. Therefore, the developed methodology provides a useful decision-making framework for assessing aggregate sourcing that accounts for factors such as distribution of materials sources and sinks, aggregate grade, and the effects of road speed and congestion.","Environment; Recycling & reuse of materials; Urban regeneration","As distribution; Birmingham; Carbon dioxide emissions; Demolition wastes; Environment; Haulage distance; Highway congestion; Local conditions; Recycled aggregates; Redevelopment project; Road speed; Urban regeneration; Waste and resources action programme; Carbon dioxide; Demolition; Estimation; Global warming; Motor transportation; Recycling; Urban planning; Aggregates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952910256

This paper evaluates the primary transportation alternatives and determines which hold the greatest potential for averting societal threats. We developed a dynamic computer simulation model that compares the societal benefits of replacing conventional gasoline cars with vehicles that are partially electrified, including hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids fueled by gasoline, cellulosic ethanol and hydrogen, and all-electric vehicles powered exclusively by batteries or by hydrogen and fuel cells. These simulations compare the year-by-year societal benefits over a 100-year time horizon of each vehicle/fuel combination compared to conventional cars. We conclude that all-electric vehicles will be required in combination with hybrids, plug-in hybrids and biofuels to achieve an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels, while simultaneously cutting dependence on imported oil and eliminating nearly all controllable urban air pollution from the light duty vehicle fleet. Hybrids and plug-ins that continue to use an internal combustion engine will not be adequate by themselves to achieve our societal objectives, even if they are powered with biofuels. There are two primary options for all-electric vehicles: batteries or fuel cells. We show that for any vehicle range greater than 160 km (100 miles) fuel cells are superior to batteries in terms of mass, volume, cost, initial greenhouse gas reductions, refueling time, well-to-wheels energy efficiency using natural gas or biomass as the source and life cycle costs. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.",,"Alternative vehicles; Battery electric vehicles; Computer simulation model; Conventional gasoline; Fuel option; Greenhouse gas reductions; Hybrid electric vehicle; Lifecycle costs; Light-duty vehicle fleet; Motor vehicle; Oil dependence; Plug-in; Plug-ins; Societal benefits; Time horizons; Urban air pollution; Air quality; Biofuels; Biomass; Cell membranes; Cellulosic ethanol; Electric automobiles; Energy efficiency; Ethanol; Fleet operations; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Gasoline; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Hydrogen; Internal combustion engines; Leakage (fluid); Vehicle wheels; Vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650726529

The climatic impacts of forests are not limited to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, however, and a growing body of research suggests that albedo-related climatic changes stemming from land-use change may diminish or counteract the climatic benefits of sequestration. Because forests are generally darker than bare or agricultural land they absorb relatively more solar radiation, which may exert a local warming influence. This phenomenon is known as the ""albedo effect."" Thus, a ""carbon-only"" accounting approach that ignores albedo impacts can significantly overestimate the climatic benefit of offsets, in particular, afforestation. In the worst case this could result in a forest offset actually contributing to warming and, in general, may reduce the environmental effectiveness of some forest offsets. Therefore a cap-and-trade system design question is whether to recognize the albedo effect into forest offset accounting frameworks. We propose that forest offset design moves toward a ""carbon-equivalent"" accounting approach that aggregates the climatic impacts of sequestration and of surface albedo when evaluating forest offset projects. This change would result in climate mitigation efforts taking a more targeted geographic approach that emphasizes maintaining or increasing forest cover in the tropics, and that avoids afforestation in boreal and high-latitude temperate regions. Currently developing regional cap-and-trade systems in North America, however, give afforestation projects priority for offset consideration. By staying on the current path, efforts in these initiatives directed toward forest offsets may be inefficient or ineffective and, at worst, counterproductive, in large parts of the area they cover. Incorporating both carbon and albedo effects into policymaking will lead to more informed and effective forest offset design. © 2009 by the Society of American Foresters.","Albedo effect; Cap-and-trade; Climate change; Forest management; Offsets","Agricultural land; Atmospheric greenhouse; Cap-and-trade; Carbon sequestration; Climatic changes; Climatic impact; Current paths; Environmental effectiveness; Forest cover; Forest management; Land-use change; Large parts; Net carbon flux; Policy making; Surface albedo; System design; Temperate regions; Worst case; Agglomeration; Agriculture; Commerce; Design; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Industrial emissions; Land use; Reforestation; Sun; Solar radiation; afforestation; albedo; carbon sequestration; climate change; emissions trading; forest management; greenhouse gas; land use change; Agglomeration; Agriculture; Commerce; Design; Forest Management; Greenhouse Gases; Land Use; Reforestation; Sun Light",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72449210250

Mountainous areas tend to have more varied and more extreme weather than lowlands. The EMERGE program has the primary aim of assessing the status of remote mountain and sub-arctic lakes throughout Europe for the first time. In this study, we describe the main features of the climate, ice-cover durations and recent temperature trends of these areas. The main weather characteristics of European mountain and sub-arctic lakes are their cold temperatures and year-round precipitation. Mean annual temperatures are generally close to 0°C, and maximum summer temperatures reasonably close to 10°C. Maritime versus continental settings determine the main differences in annual-temperature range among lake districts (10.5°C in Scotland to 26.7°C in Northern Finland), and a similar factor for ice-cover duration. Radiation ranges from low (120 W m-2) in the high latitude sub-arctic and high (237 W m-2) in the southern ranges of the Pyrenees and Rila. Similarly, precipitation is high in the main Alpine chain (250 cm year-1 in the Central Southern Alps) and low in the continental sub-arctic (65 cm year-1 in Northern Finland). The main temporal patterns in air temperature follow those of the adjacent lowlands. All the lake districts warmed during the last century. Spring temperature trends were highest in Finland; summer trends were weak everywhere; autumn trends were strongest in the west, in the Pyrenees and western Alps; while winter trends varied markedly, being high in the Pyrenees and Alps, low in Scotland and Norway and negative in Finland. Two new, limnological case studies on Lake Redon, in the Pyrenees, highlight the sensitivity of remote lakes to projected changes in the global climate. These two case studies involve close linkages between extreme chemical-precipitation events and synoptic wind-patterns, and between thermocline behaviour and features of the large-scale circulation.

The regulation is also projected to transform the state's energy infrastructure by essentially forcing the petroleum industry to turn to other technologies, such as electric, hydrogen, biofuels, etc. The standard is also expected to drive the availability of plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel-cell powered cars while promoting investments in electric charging stations and hydrogen fueling stations.

Disruptions in these associations have been correlated with coral disease, but little is known about the series of events involved in the shift from mutualism to pathogenesis. To evaluate structural and functional changes in coral microbial communities, Porites compressa was exposed to four stressors: increased temperature, elevated nutrients, dissolved organic carbon loading and reduced pH. Microbial metagenomic samples were collected and pyrosequenced. Functional gene analysis demonstrated that stressors increased the abundance of microbial genes involved in virulence, stress resistance, sulfur and nitrogen metabolism, motility and chemotaxis, fatty acid and lipid utilization, and secondary metabolism. Relative changes in taxonomy also demonstrated that coral-associated microbiota (Archaea, Bacteria, protists) shifted from a healthy-associated coral community (e.g. Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and the zooxanthellae Symbiodinium) to a community (e.g. Bacteriodetes, Fusobacteria and Fungi) of microbes often found on diseased corals.

High-resolution middle Miocene (16-13 Ma) benthic foraminifer stable isotope records from the South China Sea reveal a reorganization of regional bottom waters, which preceded the globally recognized middle Miocene ∼ 1‰ δ18O increase (13.8 Ma) by 100,000 years. An observed reversal of the benthic foraminifera δ13C gradient between ODP Sites 1146 (2092 m) and 1148 (3294 m; 13.9-13.5 Ma) is interpreted to reflect an increase in the southward flux of low δ13C deep (&gt; 2000 m) Pacific Ocean waters (Flower and Kennett, 1993; Shevenell and Kennett, 2004). Large-scale changes in Pacific intermediate and deep ocean circulation, coupled with enhanced global carbon cycling at the end of the Monterey Carbon Isotope excursion, likely acted as internal feedbacks to the Earth's climate system. These feedbacks reduced the sensitivity of Antarctica to lower latitude-derived heat/moisture and facilitated the transition of the Earth's climate system to a new, relatively stable glacial state. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This method allowed evaluating the detail that is suitable to achieve in an estimate and to justify possible simplifications in this kind of noise source description. Noise measurements were carried out simultaneously, at different distances from the power plants that were taken into account.

This paper shows that aggregate abatement costs fall as flexibility increases. However, limited flexibility creates rents so that increasing flexibility raises costs in some Member States. Costs are reduced more by the CDM than by non-ETS trade. The CDM warrants market reduces costs by a small amount only; market power is a real issue. However, the warrants market is obsolete in case there is non-ETS trade. The CDM leads to price convergence between the ETS and non-ETS market. There would be one price for carbon in the European Union if the proposed limits on CDM access are relaxed slightly. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As a consequence, the incidence of environmental accidents such as oil spills and contamination of soils has increased significantly. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to develop remediation techniques with lower costs, decontamination efficiency and impact minimisation. The aim of this work was to evaluate Sebastiania commersoniana phytoremediation potential in soil contaminated by petroleum. This species, which is a native tree, was selected due to its proven capacity for surviving in areas contaminated by petroleum. Experiments were carried out with soils that were vegetated but noncontaminated, soils that were freshly contaminated (25, 50 and 75 g kg-1) but non-vegetated, and soils that were vegetated and contaminated, samples were collected 60 and 424 days after contamination with the purpose of evaluating the percentage of petroleum degradation in relation to the time. The results obtained in the present study allow us to state that S. commersoniana proves to be tolerant to petroleum contamination with respect to plant's growth. The degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons was evaluated by gas chromatography with a flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) equipped with a capillary column HP-5 (5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane, 30 m; 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm). According to chromatographic analysis, samples in contact with S. commersoniana showed a significant area reduction of the hydrocarbon peaks. Analysis of the 60-day samples showed a reduction of petroleum hydrocarbons area higher than 60% and the 424-day samples showed a reduction higher than 94%, which demonstrates that a petroleum degradation process is occurring. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.","Petroleum; Phytoremediation; Pollution; Rhizodegradation; Rhizosphere",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73649092812

We investigate efficiency gains achieved by integrating climate impacts of air pollutants into air quality strategies for the EU region. The pollutants included in this study are SO2, NH3, VOC, CO, NOx, black carbon, organic carbon, PM2.5, and CH4. We illustrate the relative importance of climate change effects compared to damage to health and crops, as well as monetary gains of including climate change contributions. The analysis considers marginal abatement costs and compares air quality and climate damage in Euros. We optimize abatement policies with respect to both climate and health impacts, which imply implementing all measures that yield a net benefit. The efficiency gains of the integrated policy are in the order of 2.5 billion Euros, compared to optimal abatement based on health and crop damage only, justifying increased abatement efforts of close to 50%. Climate effect of methane is the single most important factor. If climate change is considered on a 20- instead of a 100-year time-scale, the efficiency gain almost doubles.

Modern solar X-ray imagers do not completely resolve the problem of deriving detailed diagnostics of faint hard X-ray sources in the presence of stronger ones. This is the case for the impulsive phase of solar flares in which footpoint sources are usually stronger man loop-top ones. Alms. Hares mat are partially occulted by the solar limb provide the most hopeful source of knowledge about hard X-ray loop-top sources. This work attempts to fill the gap between the published survey of partially occulted flares observed by RHESSI (Krucker &amp; Lin 2008, ApJ, 673, 1181) and the extensive Yohkoh database. Methods. Among the 1286 flares in the Yohkoh Hard X-ray Telescope Flare Catalogue (Sato et al. 2006, Sol. Phys., 236, 351), for which the hard X-ray images were presented, we identified 98 events that occurred behind the solar limb. We investigated their hard X-ray spectra and spatial structure. Results. In most cases, we found that the hard X-ray spectrum of partially occulted flares consists of two components, non-thermal and thermal, which are cospatial to within 4 arcsec. For rest events, the components are separated, the non-thermal component clearly appearing to be situated higher. The photon energy spectra of the partially occulted flares are systematically steeper than spectra of the non-occulted flares. We can explain mis difference as a consequence of intrinsically dissimilar conditions in coronal parts of flares, in comparison with the footpoints that usually dominate the hard X-ray emission of disk flares. At least two reasons for the difference should be taken into consideration: (1) stronger contamination of hard X-rays by emission from thermal plasma; and (2) different mechanisms in which non-thermal electrons radiate their energy. For events unbiased by the thermal component, the difference, Δγ = -γ̄ - γ̄FP, equals 1.5. We found a lack of correlation between the altitude of flares and the hard X-ray power-law index γ. Conclusions. A schematic picture, in which a thin-target mechanism is responsible for the hard X-ray emission of loop-top sources and a thick-target mechanism for emission by footpoint sources, is modified by the presence of some coronal thick-target sources.

The National Forest Inventory (NFI) provides information on the current status of the forest but there is a need to predict future carbon sequestration under alternative forest management and land-usechange scenarios. Problems such as data aggregation and choice of appropriate growth models, among others, are important points to be considered for the development of national/regional simulators of carbon sequestration. The objective of the present presentation is to compare the use of alternative simulators, based in different levels of data aggregation as input, for the case of the Portuguese forests: from intensive plantations (Eucalyptus globulus) to private poorly-managed pine plantations (Pinus pinaster) to slowgrowing sparse oak stands (Quercus suber and Quercus ilex ssp. rotundifolia). There is a lot of variation concerning the available data and the existing growth models for each of the species and forest types. Therefore, different methodologies had to be adapted for each case, which makes this case study an interesting one. Finally, preliminary estimations for the period of 1995-2005, obtained with each of the proposed methodologies, will be presented.",,"carbon sequestration; climate change; data acquisition; estimation method; forest inventory; forest management; growth modeling; Kyoto Protocol; land use change; simulation; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Eurasia; Europe; Portugal; Southern Europe; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus globulus; Ilex; Pinus pinaster; Quercus ilex; Quercus suber; Rotundifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349593904

The ozone level at a location is contributed by local production, regional transport, and background ozone. This study combines detailed emission inventory, air quality modeling, and census data to investigate the source-receptor relationships between nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions and population exposure to ambient O3 in 48 states over the continental United States. By removing NOx emissions from each state one at a time, we calculate the change in O3 exposures by examining the difference between the base and the sensitivity simulations. Based on the 49 simulations, we construct state-level and census region-level source-receptor matrices describing the relationships among these states/regions. We find that, for 43 receptor states, cumulative NOx emissions from upwind states contribute more to O3 exposures than the state's own emissions. In-state emissions are responsible for less than 15% of O3 exposures in 90% of U.S. states. A state's NOx emissions can influence 2 to 40 downwind states by at least a 0.1 ppbv change in population-averaged O3 exposure. The results suggest that the U.S. generally needs a regional strategy to effectively reduce O3 exposures. But the current regional emission control program in the U.S. is a cap-and-trade program that assumes the marginal damage of every ton of NOx is equal. In this study, the average O3 exposures caused by one ton of NOx emissions ranges from - 2.0 to 2.3 ppm-people-hours depending on the state. The actual damage caused by one ton of NOx emissions varies considerably over space. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To shed light on this issue, we compared measurements of the indicator species O3/NOy (where NOy represents the sum of NO + NO2 + nitric acid [HNO3] + peroxyacetyl nitrate [PAN] + others), NOy, and the semiempirically derived O3/NOz surrogate (where NOz surrogate is the derived surrogate NOz, and NOz represents NOx reaction products, or NOy - NOx) with results of numerical predictions reproducing the transition regimes between NOx and VOC sensitivities. Ambient air concentrations of O3, NOx, and NOy were measured from April 14 to 25, 2004 in one downwind receptor site of photochemically aged air masses within Mexico City. MCMAderived transition values for an episode day occurring during the same monitoring period were obtained through a series of photochemical simulations using the Multiscale Climate and Chemistry Model (MCCM). The comparison between the measured indicator species and the simulated spatial distribution of the indicators O3/ NOy, O3/NOz surrogate, and NOy in MCMA suggest that O3 in this megacity is likely VOC-sensitive. This is in opposition to past studies that, on the basis of the observed morning VOC/NOx ratios, have concluded that O3 in Mexico City is NOx-sensitive. Simulated MCMA-derived sensitive transition values for O3/NOy, hydrogen peroxide (H2O 2)/HNO3, and NOy were found to be in agreement with threshold criteria proposed for other regions in North America and Europe, although the transition crossover for O3/NOz and O 3/HNO3 was not consistent with values reported elsewhere. An additional empirical evaluation of weekend/weekday differences in average maximum O3 concentrations and 6:00- to 9:00-a.m. NOx and NO levels registered at the same site in April 2004 indirectly confirmed the above results. A preliminary conclusion is that additional reductions in NO x emissions in MCMA might cause an increase in presently high O 3 levels.

In-cabin pollution levels were measured on three buses from the Pueblo, CO District 70 fleet. Monitoring was conducted while buses were driven along their regular routes, with each bus tested three times before and three times after installation of control devices. Ultrafine number concentrations in the school bus cabins were 33-41% lower, on average, after the control devices were installed. Mean mass concentrations of particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) were 56% lower, organic carbon (OC) 41% lower, elemental carbon (EC) 85% lower, and formaldehyde 32% lower after control devices were installed. While carbon monoxide concentrations were low in all tests, mean concentrations were higher after control devices were installed than in pre-retrofit tests. Reductions in number, OC, and formaldehyde concentrations were statistically significant, but reductions in PM2.5 mass were not. Even with control devices installed, during some runs PM2.5 and OC concentrations in the bus cabins were elevated compared to ambient concentrations observed in the area. OC concentrations inside the bus cabins ranged from 22 to 58 μg m-3 before and 13 to 33 μg m-3 after control devices were installed. OC concentrations were correlated with particle-bound organic tracers for lubricating oil emissions (hopanes) and diesel fuel and tailpipe emissions (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and aliphatic hydrocarbons). Mean concentrations of hopanes, PAH, and aliphatic hydrocarbons were lower by 37, 50, and 43%, respectively, after the control devices were installed, suggesting that both CCFs and DOCs were effective at reducing in-cabin OC concentrations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The δ13C of most consumers, such as Gammarus and Simulium, reflected that of the dominant forms of photosynthetic production, whereas the cased larvae of two caddis flies (Agapetus and Silo) were consistently 13C depleted (mean δ13C: -41.2%0 and -40.4%0, respectively) throughout the year. The river water was supersaturated (approximately 50 times atmospheric) with methane, reflecting both supersaturation in the groundwater and local production in fine sediments. We measured appreciable rates of methane oxidation, relative to water only controls, in the biofilms on gravel, on the caddis fly cases, and on the bottom of larger rocks. In addition, there was a marked difference in the ratio of methane-oxidizing potential to chlorophyll across those substrata. This ratio was below detection in the biofilm (i.e., no methane oxidation) on the tops of rocks, greater on the bottom of rocks, and maximal for the gravels and the caddis cases. If the caddis larvae acquire most of their carbon by grazing the tops of such rocks (where they are normally found), then they must acquire their depleted δ13C values by occasionally grazing biofilm where the ratio of methane oxidation to chlorophyll was much greater, and the most likely candidate is from their own or conspecific cases. Grazing methane-oxidizing bacteria could provide the caddis larvae with up to 30% of their carbon, which could represent a true subsidy from an ancient groundwater source. © 2009, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",,"bacterium; biofilm; caddisfly; carbon isotope; chlorophyll; food web; groundwater flow; lowland environment; methane; microbial activity; net ecosystem production; nutrient availability; oxidation; photosynthesis; supersaturation; Agapetus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gammarus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67949107928

In Norway, the forest sector (forestry and forest industries) represents less than 1% of gross domestic product, but 14% of the total road transport work. Road transport represents 19% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Norway. This article is an analysis of the economic and GHG emission impacts of the following three transport policy scenarios targeting the forest sector in Norway: (1) increased fuel prices, (2) increased allowable total weight for log trucks, and (3) accelerated infrastructure development. Three different models were combined in the analyses: a national full equilibrium model, a national transport logistics model and a regionalized partial equilibrium forest sector model. The results showed that increased maximum total weight had a greater economic impact on transport costs for roundwood than for forest industry products. Elimination of bottlenecks, such as bridges with limited allowable weight, is needed if the full potential of increased total weight is to be utilized. General infrastructure measures in the main road network had greater economic impacts on forest industries than on forestry. The short-run regional effects of changes in transport costs on production and trade-flows were, however limited, mostly in the range of 1-2%. Increased total weight brought increased emissions of GHGs, owing to transfer from rail to road, whereas accelerated infrastructure investment and increased fuel prices yielded reduced emissions, although the effects were relatively small, in the range of 0.5-1%. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","CO2 emissions; Forest sector model; Logistics model; Partial and full equilibrium modelling","CO2 emissions; Economic impacts; Equilibrium models; Forest industry; Forest sector model; Forest sectors; Fuel prices; GHG emission; Gross domestic products; Infrastructure development; Infrastructure investment; Log trucks; Logistics model; Main roads; Partial and full equilibrium modelling; Partial equilibrium; Road transports; Roundwoods; Timber and forest products; Transport costs; Transport logistics; Transport policy; Automobiles; Costs; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Leakage (fluid); Logistics; Roads and streets; Timber; Truck transportation; Transportation; Automobiles; Carbon Dioxide; Costs; Emission; Forestry; Forests; Gas; Greenhouse Gases; Investment; Management; Materials Handling; Models; Roads; Transport; Trucks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449437189

However, the waste management (i.e., anaerobic digestion) can produce the biogas associated with its composition mostly consisting of methane (CH4), which is now considered as a renewable energy with emphasis on electricity generation and other energy uses. The objective of this paper was to present an overview analysis of biogas-to-bioenergy in Taiwan, which included five elements: current status of biogas sources and their energy utilizations, potential of biogas (methane) generation from livestock manure management, governmental regulations and policies for promoting biogas, benefits of GHGs (i.e., methane) emission reduction, and research and development status of utilizing livestock manure for biofuel production. In the study, using the livestock population data surveyed by the Council of Agriculture (Taiwan) and the emission factors recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the potential of methane generation from livestock manure management in Taiwan during the period of 1995-2007 has been estimated to range from 36 to 56 Gg year-1, indicating that the biogas (methane) from swine and dairy cattle is abundant. Based on the characteristics of swine manure, the maximum potential of methane generation could reach to around 400 Gg year-1. With a practical basis of the total swine population (around 4300 thousand heads) from the farm scale of over 1000 heads, a preliminary analysis showed the following benefits: methane reduction of 21.5 Gg year-1, electricity generation of 7.2 × 107 kW-h year-1, equivalent electricity charge saving of 7.2 × 106 US$ year-1, and equivalent carbon dioxide mitigation of 500 Gg year-1. © 2009.","Bioenergy; Biogas; Emission estimation; Livestock; Manure management; Promotion measure","Bioenergy; Emission estimation; Livestock; Manure management; Promotion measure; Agriculture; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Dairies; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Laws and legislation; Manures; Methanation; Methane; Population statistics; Renewable energy resources; Research and development management; Waste management; Wastewater treatment; Electric generators",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68749116194

We observe that only part of the carbon species is chemically eroded by atomic H exposure, yielding hydrocarbon desorption. Exposure to atomic O yields complete carbon erosion and CO2 and H2O desorption. A dramatic increase in metallic and non-metallic oxide is observed for especially Ni and Co surfaces, while for Au and Cu, the sub-surface Mo layer is much more oxidized. Although volatile oxides exist for some of the d-metals, there is no indication of d-metal erosion. Subsequent atomic H exposure reduces the clean oxides to a metallic state under desorption of H2O. Due to its adequacy, we propose the atomic oxygen and subsequent atomic hydrogen sequence as a candidate for contamination removal in practical applications like photolithography at 13.5 nm radiation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Remotely sensed sea surface temperature, wind and chlorophyll, which were validated by shipboard observations at the SouthEast Asian Time-series Study (SEATS) station (18°N, 116°E) in the northern South China Sea (SCS) provided the basis for this study. During the 1997-1998 winter at the SEATS station, the sea surface temperature was elevated by about 2 °C above the climatological mean, while the wind speed of the northeast monsoon was reduced from a climatological mean of 9.4 to 6.8 m/s. The concentration of surface chlorophyll-a dropped from 0.2 to 0.1 mg/m3. The monthly area-averaged integrated primary production estimated for the northern SCS area (112-119°E, 15-21°N) was reduced by about 40% of the normal winter value. Under the anomalously high sea surface temperature and weak monsoon, the mixed-layer depth would have been reduced from an average of 65 to 45 m and the nutrients in the mixed layer would have been reduced by half, according to observations at the SEATS station in more recent years. During the 1997-1998 El Niño event, the onset of warming in the northern SCS lagged behind that in the eastern equatorial Pacific by about 5 months and lingered for 11 months. This course of change resembled that of the western Pacific warm pool region. However, contrary to the northern SCS, the sea surface chlorophyll was enhanced in the warm pool region during the event, probably mainly because of the uplifted nutricline. Unlike the eastern equatorial Pacific, the dramatic recovery of biological production did not happen in the SCS in the summer of 1998.

Energy related air pollutant emissions are estimated and presented too. Energy use in Industry has shown a growing trend. Residual fuel oil was the predominant energy form, but with decreasing share, while electricity had a remarkable and steadily increasing share, reflecting changes in industrial equipment towards more automated production processes. Natural Gas started to contribute to energy mix in late '90s. Emissions followed energy's growth but with lower rates, since 'dirty fuels' use grew slower than electricity, which is a 'clean fuel' in final uses. Sectors with the greater contribution in energy use and air pollutant emissions were 'Basic Metals' and 'Chemical' from 1960 to 1975, while after 1985 'Non-metallic Minerals' and 'Energy' sectors had the greater contribution. More than 50% of the countries industrial units are located close to Athens. In 2003, Attica's share to total industry's emissions was lower than the share of industries, while neighbouring prefectures' share was higher. The share of 'dirty' industries is higher in the neighbouring to Attica prefectures, while in Attica the share of industries using mainly electricity ('clean' final energy form) is higher. The enlargement of natural gas penetration together with energy saving measures will affect positive any emission reduction policy.

Intersexual behavioural interactions may lead, combined with particular resource configurations, to sexual spatial segregation. We investigated this issue relative to host plant use in females of the purple-edged copper butterfly, Lycaena hippothoe. Males exhibited nectar resource-based territoriality, which is an uncommon mate-locating system in butterflies. They perched and patrolled in large territories harassing every passing female. In our study system, the percentage of spatial dimension shared for adult and larval resources was estimated at 50%, and males monopolised 28% of the nectar-rich zones. Under these conditions of harassment, females travelled between nectar-rich zones for feeding and zones with suitable host plants for egg laying, but often without nectar and hence with low male density. This is likely to limit their time budget and, potentially, their realised fecundity as suggested by the low number of eggs found relative to population size. Females were also highly specialised in selecting host plants under particular environmental conditions. Using test choice in experimental cages, we showed that, in the absence of males, only micro-climatic conditions may significantly influencing egg-laying decisions. Moreover, results of egg-rearing experiments under different temperature treatments suggested that eggs were laid in thermally suitable micro-environments. The highly selective egg-laying behaviour can be viewed as a preference-performance choice. Knowledge of individuals' behaviour, including sexual interactions, can be highly significant for our understanding of habitat use, which in turn can be essential for conservation. We discuss this for L. hippothoe, a species of regional conservation concern. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Conservation; Lycaena hippothoe; Mating system; Oviposition; Resource-based territoriality","butterfly; environmental conditions; fecundity; habitat use; host plant; host use; intersexual interaction; mate location; microclimate; nectar; oviposition; reproductive strategy; species conservation; territoriality; Lycaena hippothoe; Papilionoidea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952670930

To best match clones to particular site conditions, an understanding of how specific clones respond to changes in nutrition in terms of biomass partitioning, leaf physiology and biochemistry will be necessary. This study measured the response of biomass partitioning, light-saturated net photosynthesis (ASat) and photosynthetic capacity to a range in soil fertility and fertilization between two contrasting Pinus taeda L. clone ideotypes: a 'narrow crown' clone (NC) that allocates more resources to stem growth and a 'broad crown' clone (BC) that allocates more resources to leaf area (LA). Under field conditions, we found consistent clone by environment (i.e., varying nutrient regimes) interactions in biomass as well as leaf physiology. Nutrient limitations induced by logging residue incorporation resulted in a 25% loss in stem growth in BC, while NC showed no response. We postulated that the decrease in BC was due to the differences in canopy architecture leading to a reduced canopy CO2 assimilation, as well as to increased belowground maintenance costs associated with fine-root production. In contrast, N and P additions resulted in a 21% greater increase in stem volume in NC relative to BC. Fertilization increased ASat temporarily in both clones, but ASat eventually decreased below control levels by the end of the study. Although we found a clone by fertilization interaction in leaf physiology, the greatest genotype by environment interaction was found in the LA that appeared to have a greater influence than ASat on growth. This research demonstrates the potential importance of selecting appropriate clonal material and silvicultural prescription when implementing site-specific silviculture to maximize productivity in intensively managed southern pine forests.","ASat; G × E interaction; Jmax; Loblolly pine; Logging residue; Photosynthesis; VC,max","biomass allocation; canopy architecture; clone; coniferous tree; fertilizer application; forestry production; leaf; nutrient availability; photosynthesis; physiology; phytochemistry; seedling; silviculture; soil fertility; soil nutrient; soil organic matter; Pinus echinata; Pinus taeda; carbon dioxide; fertilizer; nitrogen; phosphorus; article; biomass; genetics; growth, development and aging; histology; loblolly pine; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; plant stem; soil; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Photosynthesis; Pinus taeda; Plant Leaves; Plant Stems; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73349108106

This campaign, promoting ""clean coal,"" has effectively shifted the national conversation on energy and climate change to situate coal as a viable clean energy source and the best option available to mitigate climate change. As the U.S. gets closer to passing national climate legislation and the deadline for achieving significant global reductions in carbon emissions draws near, opposition to the coal industry and its Clean Coal Campaign is organizing on a number of fronts. The environmental justice movement, through its leadership on climate justice, can serve as a centralizing force for these disparate advocacy efforts, bringing together students, scientists, policy advocates, community residents, and others engaged to fight clean coal and advance real green energy solutions. This article will look at the history of the Clean Coal Campaign and weigh the arguments for and against clean coal, focusing particularly on carbon capture and sequestration. It will then overview the advocacy efforts occurring across the U.S. to oppose coal and expose the fallacy of clean coal. Finally, it will defend the centralization of these efforts in an environmental justice-based climate justice movement that utilizes the varied resources, expertise and energy of the current advocacy efforts to stop coal and achieve a clean, green renewable energy economy. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; coal industry; environmental justice; green revolution; nature conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73949092406

This research investigates how rural electrification could be achieved in India using different energy sources and what the effects for climate change mitigation could be. We use the Regional Energy Model (REM) to develop scenarios for rural electrification for the period 2005-2030 and to assess the effects on greenhouse gas emissions, primary energy use and costs. We compare the business-as-usual scenario (BAU) with different electrification scenarios based on electricity from renewable energy, diesel and the grid. Our results indicate that diesel systems tend to have the highest CO2 emissions, followed by grid systems. Rural electrification with primarily renewable energy-based end-uses could save up to 99% of total CO2 emissions and 35% of primary energy use in 2030 compared to BAU. Our research indicates that electrification with decentralised diesel systems is likely to be the most expensive option. Rural electrification with renewable energy tends to be the most cost-effective option when end-uses are predominantly based on renewable energy, but turns out to be more costly than grid extensions when electric end-use devices are predominantly used. This research therefore elaborates whether renewable energy is a viable option for rural electrification and climate change mitigation in rural India and gives policy recommendations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Air quality forecasting requires dynamic fire emission estimates that are generated in a timely manner to support real-time operations. In the regulatory and planning realm, emission inventories are essential for quantitatively assessing the contribution of wildfire to air pollution. The development of wildland fire emission inventories depends on burned area as a critical input. This study presents a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) - direct broadcast (DB) burned area mapping algorithm designed to support air quality forecasting and emission inventory development. The algorithm combines active fire locations and single satellite scene burn scar detections to provide a rapid yet robust mapping of burned area. Using the U.S. Forest Service Fire Sciences Laboratory (FiSL) MODIS-DB receiving station in Missoula, Montana, the algorithm provided daily measurements of burned area for wildfire events in the western U.S. in 2006 and 2007. We evaluated the algorithm's fire detection rate and burned area mapping using fire perimeter data and burn scar information derived from high resolution satellite imagery. The FiSL MODIS-DB system detected 87% of all reference fires &gt; 4 km2, and 93% of all reference fires &gt; 10 km2. The burned area was highly correlated (R2 = 0.93) with a high resolution imagery reference burn scar dataset, but exhibited a large over estimation of burned area (56%). The reference burn scar dataset was used to calibrate the algorithm response and quantify the uncertainty in the burned area measurement at the fire incident level. An objective, empirical error based approach was employed to quantify the uncertainty of our burned area measurement and provide a metric that is meaningful in context of remotely sensed burned area and emission inventories. The algorithm uncertainty is ± 36% for fires 50 km2 in size, improving to ± 31% at a fire size of 100 km2. Fires in this size range account for a substantial portion of burned area in the western U.S. (77% of burned area is due to fires &gt; 50 km2, and 66% results from fires &gt; 100 km2). The dominance of these large wildfires in burned area, duration, and emissions makes these events a significant concern of air quality forecasters and regulators. With daily coverage at 1-km2 spatial resolution, and a quantified measurement uncertainty, the burned area mapping algorithm presented in this paper is well suited for the development of wildfire emission inventories. Furthermore, the algorithm's DB implementation enables time sensitive burned area mapping to support operational air quality forecasting.","Burned area; Fire; Fire detection; MODIS","Active fires; Air quality forecasting; Burn scar; Burned area; Burned areas; Burned-area mapping; Critical inputs; Data sets; Db systems; Direct broadcast; Emission inventories; Empirical errors; Fire detection; Fire emissions; Fire science; Fire size; High resolution imagery; High resolution satellite imagery; Highly-correlated; Management strategies; Measurement uncertainty; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; Montana; Over-estimation; Real-time operation; Receiving stations; Size ranges; Spatial resolution; U.S. Forest Service; Western United States; Wildland fire emissions; Air quality; Algorithms; Atmospherics; Conformal mapping; Disasters; Fire detectors; Fire protection; Forecasting; Forestry; Geodesy; Laws and legislation; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Spectrometers; Strategic planning; Surveying; Uncertainty analysis; Fires; air quality; algorithm; burning; data set; emission inventory; fire management; geological mapping; MODIS; quantitative analysis; real time; regulatory approach; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; temporal record; weather forecasting; wildfire; Air Quality; Algorithms; Detection; Disasters; Fire Protection; Fires; Forecasts; Forestry; Image Analysis; Legislation; Mapping; Planning; Remote Sensing; Satellites; Spectrometers; Surveying; Missoula; Montana; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70249149241

Despite its prevalence, there has been limited study of its ecological impacts. We investigated the effects of knotweed invasion on the abundance and diversity of forest understory plants, and the quantity and nutrient quality of leaf-litter inputs, in riparian forests in western Washington, USA. Among 39 sampling locations, knotweed stem density ranged from 0 to 8.8 m-2. Richness and abundance (cover or density) of native herbs, shrubs, and juvenile trees (≤3 m tall) were negatively correlated with knotweed density. Where knotweed was present (&gt;5.3 stems m-2), litter mass of native species was reduced by 70%. Carbon:nitrogen ratio of knotweed litter was 52:1, a value 38-58% higher than that of native woody species (red alder [Alnus rubra] and willow [Salix spp.]). Resorption of foliar N prior to leaf drop was 76% in knotweed but only 5-33% among native woody species.

I construct a game-theoretic model of two-level climate policy with incomplete information over political benefits. In equilibrium, the government selects a lax national regulation, and local policy-makers with private information on high local benefits choose more ambitious policies despite incentives to free ride. The analysis also suggests that even though local policy-makers prefer not to reveal information to the government, they must do so to pursue short-term political gains. Counterintuitively, new information can lead to more ambitious national regulation even if the government learns that the local political benefits are likely lower than expected.

Conservation tillage practices such as no-tillage (NT) have potential to increase C sequestration in agricultural soils but patterns of N2O and CH4 emissions associated with NT practices are variable. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of tillage practices on N2O and CH4 emissions in long-term continuous corn (Zea mays) plots. The study was conducted on continuous corn experimental plots established in 1962 on a Crosby silt loam (fine, mixed, mesic Aeric Ochraqualf) in Ohio. The experimental design consisted of NT, chisel till (CT) and moldboard plow till (MT) treatments arranged in a randomized block design with four replications. The N2O and CH4 fluxes were measured for 1-year at 2-week intervals during growing season and at 4-week intervals during the off season. Long-term NT practice significantly decreased soil bulk density (ρb) and increased total N concentration of the 0-15 cm layer compared to MT and CT. Generally, NT treatment contained higher soil moisture contents and lower soil temperatures in the surface soil than CT and MT during summer, spring and autumn. Average daily fluxes and annual N2O emissions were more in MT (0.67 mg m-2 d-1 and 1.82 kg N ha-1 year-1) and CT (0.74 mg m-2 d-1 and 1.96 kg N ha-1 year-1) than NT (0.29 mg m-2 d-1 and 0.94 kg N ha-1 year-1). On average, NT was a sink for CH4, oxidizing 0.32 kg CH4-C ha-1 year-1, while MT and CT were sources of CH4 emitting 2.76 and 2.27 kg CH4-C ha-1 year-1, respectively. Lower N2O emission and increased CH4 oxidation in the NT practice are attributed to decrease in surface ρb, suggesting increased gaseous exchange. The N2O flux was strongly correlated with precipitation, air and soil temperatures, but not with gravimetric moisture content. Data from this study suggested that adoption of long-term NT under continuous corn cropping system in the U.S. Corn Belt region may reduce GWP associated with N2O and CH4 emissions by approximately 50% compared to MT and CT management. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Chisel till; Conventional till; Gaseous flux; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gases; No-till; Soil temperature","Carbon sequestration; Chisel till; Conventional till; Gaseous flux; Global warming potential; No-till; Soil temperature; Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Anesthetics; Climatology; Electron transitions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Groundwater; Methane; Moisture determination; Nitrogen oxides; Silt; Soil moisture; Telluric prospecting; Temperature; Tools; Soil conservation; bulk density; carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation tillage; diurnal variation; farming system; gas exchange; greenhouse gas; human activity; maize; methane; nitrous oxide; precipitation (climatology); seasonal variation; soil emission; soil temperature; Corn Belt; North America; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349185604

The reconstructed climate curves document in detail the transition from almost tropical conditions in the Mid-Eocene to a temperate climate at the Pliocene/Pleistocene transition. The observed climatic shifts are primarily expressed as non-proportional changes of the different variables taken into account. In the present study a published palaeoclimate data set for a total of 42 macrofloras complemented by new calculations is used as base to analyse the climatic space in which a fossil flora existed. To define these spaces CA intervals calculated for 3 temperature (mean annual temperature, cold and warm month mean) and 3 precipitation variables (mean annual precipitation, mean monthly precipitation of the driest and of the wettest month) are combined. Using a global gridded climatology (10' resolution), this climate space is then utilized to identify Recent climate analogues with respect to the variables regarded. For 18 macrofloras climatic analogue regions with respect to 6 variables are identified on the globe. For 16 macrofloras, analogues exist when three temperature parameters and mean annual precipitation are regarded. No Recent equivalents are found in 8 cases. This corroborates the assumption of the temporary existence of non-analogue climates in the Cenozoic. As shown by multivariate statistics the observed anomalies with respect to present-day conditions basically refer to high winter temperatures. Deploying a GIS, the Recent climate analogues can be presented as sets of grid cells for each flora that can be mapped on a globe. Once identified, these regions can be merged with adequate thematic layers to assess additional proxy data for the palaeofloras. To exemplify the procedure Koeppen climate type, numbers of days with ground frost, as well as Matthews biome classes are reconstructed. The resulting Koeppen types, ranging from A to C, are largely consistent with data previously published. The ground frost record shows almost frost-free conditions for the Mid-Eocene greenhouse and for the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. For the Chattian, up to 7 days with ground frost result. During the Late Miocene Cooling the number of days with ground frost significantly increased. The inferred Matthews biomes reveal changing patterns of evergreen and deciduous forest cover. When Recent climate analogues are found for a fossil flora, present climate can be used to calibrate the original CA data. It is shown that calibration considerably improves the resolution of the continental climate records. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Cenozoic; Coexistence approach; North Germany; Palaeobotany; Palaeoclimate","Cenozoic; Coexistence approach; North Germany; Palaeobotany; Palaeoclimate; Climatology; Multivariant analysis; Security of data; biome; Cenozoic; climate change; coexistence; data set; deciduous forest; evergreen forest; flora; forest cover; fossil record; paleobotany; paleoclimate; Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary; proxy climate record; tropical environment; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650555990

Within the area of influence of cities it is necessary, for conservation and ecological restoration, to understand the effect on plant communities of climate change and urban heat islands, that can increase the temperature around cities as much as 8 °C when compared with peri-urban rural areas. We explored patterns of seedling survival of Ceiba aesculifolia, a tropical tree species, along an altitudinal gradient in a slope facing the city of Morelia, in Michoacán, México, because the city has followed a trend of increasing mean annual temperatures with a difference of at least 4 °C when compared with the surrounding rural areas. The highest survival was found between 2200 and 2230 m a.s.l. (100% after 1 year of planting and 75% after 2 years), 160 m higher than the altitudinal limit of the remnant adult trees in the study area, and close to the highest limit reported for the species at a regional scale (2200 m a.s.l.). There was a significant effect of altitude on survival among experimental plots (P < 0.0001) and the interaction between elevation and distance from the north side of the experimental area was significant (P = 0.017). For restoring populations of C. aesculifolia within our study region, assisted migration through the establishment of populations at the elevational limit or higher than its historical range might be necessary in areas close to cities that already are under the effects of increased temperatures, but might be necessary also in rural areas for ameliorating the expected effects of global climate change in tropical rural areas. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

There is also a shift in location of the biomass from mostly belowground in the grasslands to aboveground in the woodlands. In addition, species richness and diversity change as herbaceous species are replaced by woody species. This is not a new phenomenon, but has been going on continually as the climate of the Planet has changed. However, in the past 160 years the changes have been unparalleled. The process is encroachment not invasion because woody species that have been increasing in density are native species and have been present in these communities for thousands of years. These indigenous or native woody species have increased in density, cover and biomass because of changes in one or more abiotic or biotic factors or conditions. Woody species that have increased in density and cover are not the cause of the encroachment, but the result of changes of other factors. Globally, the orbit of the Earth is becoming more circular and less elliptical, causing moderation of the climate. Additional global climate changing factors including elevated levels of CO2 and parallel increases in temperature are background factors and probably not the principal causes directing the current wave of encroachment. There is probably not a single reason for encroachment, but a combination of factors that are difficult to disentangle. The prime cause of the current and recent encroachment appears to be high and constant levels of grass herbivory by domestic animals. This herbivory reduces fine fuel with a concomitant reduction in fire frequency or in some cases a complete elimination of fire from these communities. Conditions would now favor the woody plants over the grasses. Reduced grass competition, woody plant seed dispersal and changes in animal populations seem to modify the rate of encroachment rather than being the cause. High concentrations of atmospheric CO2 are not required to explain current woody plant encroachment. Changes in these grassland communities will continue into the future but the specifics are difficult to predict.

Such subsidies have received little attention in economic and environmental research, even though they may be at least as important from an environmental perspective as on-budget subsidies. We offer a typology of indirect subsidies. Next, we estimate the magnitude of these subsidies and their impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) and acidifying emissions for the agriculture, energy, and transport sectors in The Netherlands. The calculations are based on a model approach that translates a particular subsidy into price and quantity changes using empirical elasticities, followed by environmental effect estimates using pollutionintensity parameters. The various environmental pollution effects are aggregated into environmental indicators. The results show, among others, that GHG emissions caused by off-budget subsidies contribute to more than 30% of the policy targets specified by the Kyoto Protocol for CO2 emissions reduction by The Netherlands.

To test such processes generically, carbon dioxide equilibria and mass transfers induced by organic-inorganic interactions have been modelled for different hydrogeochemical scenarios. The approach is based on and compared with data from the Norwegian continental shelf (Smith &amp; Ehrenberg 1989) and assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium among solids and fluids. Equilibrating mineral assemblages (different feldspar types, quartz, kaolinite, calcite) are based on the primary reservoir composition. Equilibration and coupled mass transfer were triggered by the addition and reaction of different amounts of CO2, CH4 and H2 (plus acetic acid) at temperatures between 50 and 95°C (323 and 368 K). These components occur in oil fields as products of anaerobic bacterial degradation, hydrolytic disproportionation of hydrocarbons and/or thermal maturation of kerogen. We apply two different computer codes and two different thermodynamic data bases to calculate the results. Reaction of 0.32-0.6 mol CO2, 0.16-0.3 mol CH4 and 0.8-1.5 mol H2 with K-feldspar, quartz, kaolinite and calcite in 1 l of pore water results in modelled values of 0.3-2.3 mol% CO2 in a multicomponent gas phase that resembles measured data (0.2-1.5 mol%). Similar CO2 contents result from acetic acid addition (CO2, CH4, H2 + 0.016 mol CH3COOH). Equilibration with albite or anorthite reduces the release of CO2 into the multicomponent gas phase dramatically, by 1 or 4 orders of magnitude compared with the equilibration with K-feldspar. Minor differences in the modelled CO2 content (0.1-0.2 mol%) result from calculations with different computer codes if the same thermodynamic data base is applied. Relevant differences (up to 1.9 mol% CO2) result from calculations using different thermodynamic data bases. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Carbon dioxide; Carbonate; Feldspar; Hydrogeochemical modelling; Sedimentary basin","biodegradation; carbon dioxide; carbonate; feldspar; fluid composition; gas phase reaction; hydrocarbon reservoir; hydrogeochemistry; kerogen; mass transfer; maturation; numerical model; oil field; sedimentary basin; siliciclastic deposit; thermodynamics; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449630143

The analysis is done for La Pampa province in Argentina. The case study results in conclusions in how far the criteria can be verified ex ante based on available methodologies and data sources. The impacts are analyzed for two bioenergy chains (soybeans and switchgrass) for a set of defined land use scenarios. The carbon stock change for switchgrass ranges from 0.2 to 1.2 ton C/ha/year and for soybean from -1.2 to 0 ton C/ha/year, depending on the scenario. The GHG emission reduction ranges from 88% to 133% for the switchgrass bioenergy chain (replacing coal or natural gas) and from 16% to 94% for the soybean bioenergy chain (replacing fossil fuel) for various lifetime periods. The annual soil loss, compared to the reference land use system is 2-10 ton/ha for the soybean bioenergy chain and 1-2 ton/ha for the switchgrass bioenergy chain. In total, nine sustainability principles are analyzed. In the case of switchgrass, most environmental benefits can be achieved when produced on suitable land of abandoned cropland. Soybean production for bioenergy shows a good overall sustainability performance if produced on abandoned cropland. The production of switchgrass on degraded grassland shows socio-economic and environmental benefits, which is not the case for soybean production. The production of bioenergy production on non-degraded grassland is not preferred. It is concluded that the scenario approach enables understanding of the complexity of the bioenergy chain and the underlying factors influencing the sustainability principles. It is difficult to give ex ante a final conclusion whether a bioenergy chain is sustainable or not as this depends not only on the previous land use system but also on other factors as the selection of the bioenergy crop, the suitable agroecological zone and the agricultural management system applied. The results also imply that it is possible to steer for a large part the sustainability performance of a bioenergy chain during project development and implementation.

An existing model developed at Carnegie Mellon University, which had provided insight into the potential learning of cost variables in power plants with CO2 capture, is extended with learning curves for several key performance variables, including the overall energy loss in power plants, the energy required for CO2 capture, the CO2 capture ratio (removal efficiency), and the power plant availability. Next, learning rates for both performance and cost parameters were combined with global capacity projections for fossil-fired power plants to estimate future cost and performance of these power plants with and without CO2 capture. The results of global learning are explicitly reported, so that they can be used for other purposes such as in regional bottom-up models. Results of this study show that IGCC with CO2 capture has the largest learning potential, with significant improvements in efficiency and reductions in cost between 2001 and 2050 under the condition that around 3100 GW of combined cycle capacity is installed worldwide. Furthermore, in a scenario with a strict climate policy, mitigation costs in 2030 are 26, 11, 19 €/t (excluding CO2 transport and storage costs) for NGCC, IGCC, and PC power plants with CO2 capture, respectively, compared to 42, 13, and 32 €/t in a scenario with a limited climate policy. Additional results are presented for IGCC, PC, and NGCC plants with and without CO2 capture, and a sensitivity analysis is employed to show the impacts of alternative assumptions on projected learning rates of different systems. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimates of key elasticities, including the rebound effect, indicate that the positive and negative side-effects of fuel economy measures on transport activities and external costs are limited. However, an energy policy for transport does not replace a transport policy that aims to manage the main transport externalities including congestion and local pollution. Conventional marginal cost estimates and standard cost-benefit reasoning suggest that policies that address congestion and local pollution likely bring benefits at least as large as those from fuel economy measures. But the large uncertainty on the possible effects of greenhouse gas emissions constitutes a strong challenge for standard cost-benefit reasoning. Emerging results from methods to cope with this uncertainty suggest that policies to stimulate the widespread adoption of low-carbon technologies in transport are justified. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, meta-regression analyses with 1047 observations from 68 studies are used to determine factors that affect carbon sequestration costs. Results indicate that forest plantations and use of har-vested biomass for energy make forestry activities more attractive. It also turns out that forestry activities are competitive with emissions reduction in tropical regions and, perhaps, boreal regions but certainly not in Europe.

Less than half of this C stays in the atmosphere. The remainder is taken up by the oceans and terrestrial ecosystems. Where does the C come from and where and when does this uptake occur? We address these questions by providing new estimates of regional land-use emissions and natural carbon fluxes for the 1700-2000 period, simultaneously considering multiple anthropogenic (e.g. land and energy demand) and biochemical factors in a geographically explicit manner. The observed historical atmospheric CO2 concentration profile for the 1700 to 2000 period has been reproduced well. The terrestrial natural biosphere has been a major carbon sink, due to changes in climate, atmospheric CO2, nitrogen and management. Due to land-use change large amounts of carbon have been emitted into the atmosphere. The net effect was an emission of 35 Pg C into the atmosphere for the 1700 to 2000 period. If land use had remained constant at its distribution in 1700, then the terrestrial C uptake would have increased by 142 Pg C. This overall difference of including or excluding land-use changes (i.e. 177 Pg C) comes to more than half of the historical fossil-fuel related emissions of 308 Pg C. Historically, global land-use emissions were predominantly caused by the expansion of cropland and pasture, while wood harvesting (for timber and fuel wood) only played a minor role. These findings are robust even when changing some of the important drivers like the extent of historical land-use changes. Under varying assumptions, land-use emissions over the past three centuries could have increased up to 20%, but remained significantly lower than from other sources. Combining the regional land-use and natural C fluxes, North America and Europe were net C sources before 1900, but turned into sinks during the twentieth century. Nowadays, these fluxes are a magnitude smaller than energy- and industry-related emissions. Tropical regions were C neutral prior to 1950, but then accelerated deforestation turned these regions into major C sources. The energy- and industry-related emissions are currently increasing in many tropical regions, but are still less than the land-use emissions. Based on the presented relevance of the land-use and natural fluxes for the historical C cycle and the significance of fossil-fuel emissions nowadays, there is a need for an integrated approach for energy, nature and land use in evaluating possible climate change mitigation policies. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",,"Atmospheric CO; Carbon sink; Climate change mitigation; Concentration profiles; Energy demands; Fuel emissions; Fuel wood; Integrated approach; Land-use change; Natural carbons; Natural fluxes; Net effect; Terrestrial carbon cycle; Terrestrial ecosystems; Tropical regions; Twentieth century; Wood harvesting; Agriculture; Deforestation; Energy management; Fuels; Land use; Oceanography; Tropical engineering; Climate change; agricultural land; biosphere; carbon cycle; climate change; deforestation; environmental policy; fossil fuel; harvesting; human activity; industrial emission; land use change; nature-society relations; pasture; twentieth century; Agriculture; Climates; Deforestation; Energy; Fuels; Land Use; Management; Oceanography; Eurasia; Europe; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350725923

The results show that carbon taxes can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, if low greenhouse gas concentration levels are to be achieved, early participation (in some form) of large developing countries is important to increase reduction potential.

At the same time, there seems to be no systematic difference in the reduction potential reported by top-down and bottom-up approaches. The largest reduction potential as a response to carbon prices exists in the energy supply sector. Reduction potential in the building sector may carry relatively low costs. Although uncertainties are considerable, the modeling results and the bottom-up analyses all suggest that at the global level around 50% of greenhouse gas emissions may be reduced at carbon price (costs) below 100$/tCO2-eq-but with a wide range of 30-60%. At a carbon price (costs) less than 20$/tCO2-eq, still 10-35% of emissions may be abated. The variation of results is higher at low carbon-price levels than at high levels. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Within these projects, CITYDELTA and EURODELTA, the fate of air quality at the scale of European cities or that of the European continent was studied using several models. In this article we focus on the results of EURODELTA. The predictive skill of the ensemble of models is described for ozone, nitrogen dioxide and secondary inorganic compounds, and the uncertainty in air quality modelling is examined through the model ensemble spread of concentrations. For ozone daily maxima the ensemble spread origin differs from one region to another. In the neighbourhood of cities or in mountainous areas the spread of predicted values does not span the range of observed data, due to poorly resolved emissions or complex-terrain meteorology. By contrast in Atlantic and North Sea coastal areas the spread of predicted values is found to be larger than the observations. This is attributed to large differences in the boundary conditions used in the different models. For NO2 daily averages the ensemble spread is generally too small compared with observations. This is because models miss highest values occurring in stagnant meteorology in stable boundary layers near cities. For secondary particulate matter compounds the simulated concentration spread is more balanced, observations falling nearly equiprobably within the ensemble, and the spread originates both from meteorology and aerosol chemistry and thermodynamics. © 2008.","Air quality model; Ensemble modelling; Model evaluation; Uncertainty","Aerosol chemistry; Air quality model; Air quality modelling; Clean air; Coastal area; Ensemble modelling; Model evaluation; Mountainous area; Neighbourhood; Nitrogen dioxides; North Sea; Observed data; Regional air quality; Secondary particulates; Stable boundary layer; Uncertainty; Coastal zones; Emission control; Inorganic compounds; Meteorology; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Air quality; inorganic compound; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; air quality; boundary condition; diurnal variation; emission control; ensemble forecasting; neighborhood; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; pollution policy; regional climate; thermodynamics; uncertainty analysis; urban pollution; aerosol; air quality control; air quality standard; article; concentration (parameters); environmental impact; exhaust gas; meteorology; particulate matter; policy; prediction; priority journal; seashore; simulation; statistical model; thermodynamics; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69749105387

While academic literature has in recent years considered carbon tariffs in the abstract, this article contextualizes that discussion by analyzing European and American proposals to enact carbon tariffs, focusing primarily on the 2008 Lieberman-Warner Bill. This article concludes that carbon tariffs are, subject to a number of constraints, generally permissible under WTO law. However, it also argues that while carbon tariffs may generally be legally permissible, additional domestic political constraints may significantly limit the set of legal carbon tariffs which are practically feasible in any given state. This article posits that any meaningful discourse on carbon tariffs must incorporate both political and legal constraints, and it seeks to contribute to this discourse by identifying the relevant constraints and exploring certain policy options which could satisfy those constraints. © Oxford University Press 2009, All Rights Reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349515148

Especially children are particularly susceptible to increased levels of lead in their blood. It is also a fact that lead concentration is increasing in the environment due to increased anthropogenic activity. The risk of heavy metal contamination is pronounced in the environment adjacent to large industrial complexes. In a combined case study, the environmental pollution by heavy metals was related to children's health in the vicinity of an industrial area located 4 km south-east from Bucharest about 2 km east from the nearest town-Pantelimon. This site includes companies processing different, nonferrous solid wastes for recovery of heavy metals and producing different nonferrous alloys and lead batteries. In this paper, mainly the results of environmental sampling and analyses are summarized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Water, soil, and atmospheric deposition samples were collected from different locations within 3 km from the industrial area. For comparison, samples were also taken from Bucharest. Water samples were filtered (<0.45 microm), extracted by salpetric acid, and quantified by ICP-OES and ICP-MS. Soil samples were dried, sieved (<2 mm), extracted by aqua regia and analyzed by AAS. In order to quantify the atmospheric deposition, three kinds of permanently open collecting pots were used on nine different sites between August and November 2006. RESULTS: At most sampling locations, the heavy metal concentrations in soil decrease with increasing distance to the presumably major source of pollution. Highest heavy metal concentrations were found in 10-20 cm soil depths. There were also decreasing heavy metal concentrations for atmospheric deposition with increasing distance to the industrial site. In surface and groundwater samples, traces of zinc, copper and lead were detected. DISCUSSION: The heavy metal concentrations in soil were increased in the study area, mostly under legal action limits in low-concern areas (e.g., 1,000 mg Pb/kg dry soil), but often above action limits for high-concern areas (100 mg Pb/kg dry soil) such as populated areas. The soluble lead concentrations in water samples indicate a need for monitoring and assessing water quality in more detail. The results for atmospheric deposition showed increased dust precipitation and heavy metal loads in the study area compared to Bucharest. However, based on mass flow balance calculations, the actual atmospheric deposition of heavy metals must be much lower than it was in the past decades. CONCLUSIONS: It was shown that highest lead values in water, soil and atmospheric deposition are rather to be found near the investigated industrial site than at the control sites in Bucharest. Our results correspond very well with results that show that children from Pantelimon have significantly increased lead concentrations in their blood compared to children in Bucharest. The increased lead contamination around the investigated industrial area is likely to have caused the increased exposure for children living in Pantelimon. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: In high-concern areas, such as found in populated areas, further measures have to be taken to avoid health risks for people living in these areas. The measures already taken to reduce emissions from the industrial site will help to avoid further increases in heavy metal concentrations. In areas with exceeded action limits, measures have to be taken as required by law. Detailed risk assessments could help to take necessary actions to protect public health in this area. The public should be informed about the potential hazards of eating plants grown in that area. Educational programs for schools, informing children about the contamination, should lead to a better understanding of environmental problems and a more sustainable behavior in the future.",,"heavy metal; article; chemistry; environmental monitoring; industry; pollutant; pollution; Romania; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Environmental Pollution; Industry; Metals, Heavy; Romania; MLCS; MLOWN",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349900835

This is due to the ability of AKR1C enzymes to modify androgens, estrogens, progesterone and prostaglandins (PGs) in a tissue-specific manner, regulating the activity of nuclear receptors and other downstream effects. Evidence supporting a role for AKR1C enzymes in cancer derives mostly from studies with isolated primary cells from patients or immortalized cell lines. Mice are ideal organisms for in vivo studies, using knock-out or over-expression strains. However, the functional conservation of AKR1C enzymes between human and mice has yet to be described.Results: In this study, we have characterized and compared the four human (AKR1C1,-1C2, -1C3 and -1C4) and the eight murine (AKR1C6, -1C12, -1C13, -1C14, -1C18, -1C19, -1C20 and -1C21) isoforms in their phylogeny, substrate preference and tissue distribution. We have found divergent evolution between human and murine AKR1C enzymes that was reflected by differing substrate preference. Murine enzymes did not perform the 11β-ketoreduction of prostaglandin (PG) D2, an activity specific to human AKR1C3 and important in promoting leukemic cell survival. Instead, murine AKR1C6 was able to perform the 9-ketoreduction of PGE2, an activity absent amongst human isoforms. Nevertheless, reduction of the key steroids androstenedione, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, progesterone and estrone was found in murine isoforms. However, unlike humans, no AKR1C isoforms were detected in murine prostate, testes, uterus and haemopoietic progenitors.Conclusions: This study exposes significant lack of phylogenetic and functional homology between human and murine AKR1C enzymes. Therefore, we conclude that mice are not suitable to model the role of AKR1C in human cancers and leukemia. © 2009 Veliça et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"aldoketoreductase 1C; aldoketoreductase 1C1; aldoketoreductase 1C12; aldoketoreductase 1C13; aldoketoreductase 1C14; aldoketoreductase 1C18; aldoketoreductase 1C19; aldoketoreductase 1C2; aldoketoreductase 1C20; aldoketoreductase 1C21; aldoketoreductase 1C3; aldoketoreductase 1C4; aldoketoreductase 1C6; androstanolone; androstenedione; estrone; oxidoreductase; progesterone; prostaglandin D2; unclassified drug; alcohol dehydrogenase; carbonyl reductase (NADPH); prostaglandin; amino acid sequence; animal tissue; article; cancer research; cell survival; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; enzyme localization; enzyme specificity; female; genetic conservation; hematopoietic stem cell; human; human versus animal comparison; leukemia cell; male; molecular evolution; molecular phylogeny; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; prostate; sequence alignment; sequence homology; testis; tissue distribution; uterus; animal; biological model; chemistry; genetics; metabolism; phylogeny; species difference; Murinae; Mus; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Animals; Humans; Mice; Models, Biological; Phylogeny; Prostaglandins; Species Specificity; Substrate Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74549165963

Only the direct radiative effect of aerosols is considered. The results were analyzed in large areas encompassing the BR163 road (one of the main areas of deforestation in the Amazon), mainly where most of the burning takes place. The precipitation change due to the direct radiative impact of biomass burning is generally negative (i.e., there is a decrease of precipitation). However, there are a few cases with a positive impact. Two opposite forcing mechanisms were explored: (a) the thermodynamic forcing that is generally negative in the sense that the aerosol tends to stabilize the lower atmosphere and (b) the dynamic impact associated with the low level horizontal pressure gradients produced by the aerosol plumes. In order to understand the non-linear relationship between the two effects, experiments were performed with 4-fold emissions. In these cases, the dynamic effect overcomes the stabilization produced by the radiative forcing and precipitation increase is observed in comparison with the control experiment. This study suggests that, in general, the biomass burning radiative forcing decreases the precipitation. However, very large concentrations of aerosols may lead to an increase of precipitation due to the dynamical forcing associated with the horizontal pressure gradients. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, the modeling focused on two targets: the Grimsby Formation and Whirlpool Sandstone. For each layer, thousands of data points were available to model structure and thickness but only hundreds were available to support volumetric modeling because of the rarity of density-porosity logs in the public records. Geostatistical analysis based on this data resulted in accurate structure models, less accurate isopach models, and inconsistent models of pore volume. Of the two layers studied, only the Whirlpool Sandstone data provided for a useful spatial model of pore volume. Where reliable models for spatial prediction are absent, the best predictor available for unsampled locations is the mean value of the data, and potential sequestration sites should be planned as close as possible to existing wells with volumetric data. © 2009.

The results indicate that liberalisation leads to an increase in total greenhouse gas emissions by about 6% compared to the reference scenario value in 2015. The increase in CO2 emissions are caused by vegetation clearance due to a rapid expansion of agricultural area; mainly in South America and Southeast Asia. Increased methane emissions in the case of full liberalisation are caused by less intensive cattle farming in regions such as South America and Southeast Asia. This pattern is observed up to 2050. Total global production of milk, dairy and beef do not change with full liberalisation, but production shifts were observed from North America and Europe to South America and Southeast Asia. Results are less pronounced in variants where trade liberalisation is only implemented partially. Remarkably, our study shows in the trade barrier removal scenario larger numbers of dairy cows in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) then with full liberalisation scenario or a variant in which only milk quota are abolished. This illustrates that different types of liberalisation need to be analysed regionally and per commodity before general conclusions on the impact of trade liberalisation can be drawn. Our study contributes new information on greenhouse gas emissions to a vast number of trade liberalisation studies that focus on economic impacts. The combined economic-environmental impacts need to be assessed in detail before general conclusions on trade liberalisation can be given. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Governments are putting strategic plans in motion to decrease primary energy use, take carbon out of fuels and facilitate modal shifts. Taking a prominent place in these strategic plans is hydrogen as a future energy carrier. A number of manufacturers are now leasing demonstration vehicles to consumers using hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engines (H2ICEs) as well as fuel cell vehicles. Developing countries in particular are pushing for H2ICEs (powering two- and three-wheelers as well as passenger cars and buses) to decrease local pollution at an affordable cost. This article offers a comprehensive overview of H2ICEs.

When CO2 levels reached ∼340 ppm, sporadic but highly destructive mass bleaching occurred in most reefs world-wide, often associated with El Niño events. Recovery was dependent on the vulnerability of individual reef areas and on the reef's previous history and resilience. At today's level of ∼387 ppm, allowing a lag-time of 10 years for sea temperatures to respond, most reefs world-wide are committed to an irreversible decline. Mass bleaching will in future become annual, departing from the 4 to 7 years return-time of El Niño events. Bleaching will be exacerbated by the effects of degraded water-quality and increased severe weather events. In addition, the progressive onset of ocean acidification will cause reduction of coral growth and retardation of the growth of high magnesium calcite-secreting coralline algae. If CO2 levels are allowed to reach 450 ppm (due to occur by 2030-2040 at the current rates), reefs will be in rapid and terminal decline world-wide from multiple synergies arising from mass bleaching, ocean acidification, and other environmental impacts. Damage to shallow reef communities will become extensive with consequent reduction of biodiversity followed by extinctions. Reefs will cease to be large-scale nursery grounds for fish and will cease to have most of their current value to humanity. There will be knock-on effects to ecosystems associated with reefs, and to other pelagic and benthic ecosystems. Should CO2 levels reach 600 ppm reefs will be eroding geological structures with populations of surviving biota restricted to refuges. Domino effects will follow, affecting many other marine ecosystems. This is likely to have been the path of great mass extinctions of the past, adding to the case that anthropogenic CO2 emissions could trigger the Earth's sixth mass extinction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Several markers were determined after implementing two treatments known to affect redox status, namely exercise and allopurinol administration. Xanthine oxidase, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), protein carbonyls (PC), reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), catalase, and total antioxidant capacity were determined in blood, skeletal muscle, heart, and liver. Correlation between blood and tissues in each marker was performed through the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. GSSG in erythrocytes was correlated with all tissues, ranging in the five experimental groups as follows: skeletal muscle rs = 0.656-0.874, heart rs = 0.742-0.981, liver rs = 0.646-0.855. Xanthine oxidase and TBARS measured in blood satisfactorily described the redox status of the heart (0.753-0.964 and 0.705-1.000, respectively) and liver (0.755-0.902 and 0.656-1.000, respectively). Skeletal muscle and heart redox status can be adequately described by PC (0.652-1.000 and 0.656-0.964, respectively), GSH (0.693-1.000 and 0.656-1.000, respectively), and catalase (0.745-1.000 and 0.656-1.000, respectively) measured in blood.

In this paper, we address the definition of primary surface sites (i.e., adsorption units) at hydrated carbonate mineral surfaces and discuss its implications to the formulation and calibration of surface equilibria for these minerals. Given the abundance of experimental and theoretical information on the structural properties of the hydrated (10.4) cleavage calcite surface, this mineral was chosen for a detailed theoretical analysis of critical issues relevant to the definition of primary surface sites. Accordingly, a single, generic charge-neutral surface site ({triple bond, long}CaCO3·H2O0) is defined for this mineral whereupon mass-action expressions describing adsorption equilibria were formulated. The one-site scheme, analogous to previously postulated descriptions of metal oxide surfaces, allows for a simple, yet realistic, molecular representation of surface reactions and provides a generalized reference state suitable for the calculation of sorption equilibria for rhombohedral carbonate minerals via Law of Mass Action (LMA) and Gibbs Energy Minimization (GEM) approaches. The one-site scheme is extended to other rhombohedral carbonate minerals and tested against published experimental data for magnesite and dolomite in aqueous solutions. A simplified SCM based on this scheme can successfully reproduce surface charge, reasonably simulate the electrokinetic behavior of these minerals, and predict surface speciation agreeing with available spectroscopic data. According to this model, a truly amphoteric behavior is displayed by these surfaces across the pH scale but at circum-neutral pH (5.8-8.2) and relatively high ΣCO2 (≥1 mM), proton/bicarbonate co-adsorption becomes important and leads to the formation of a charge-neutral H2CO3-like surface species which may largely account for the surface charge-buffering behavior and the relatively wide range of pH values of isoelectric points (pHiep) reported in the literature for these minerals. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",,"adsorption; carbonate group; crystal structure; crystallography; hydration; modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67449132384

This practise is being driven by corporate sustainability goals, community and societal pressures to demonstrate improved water stewardship, as well as climate and regulatory pressures. However, water reuse often results in water quality compromise which can then result in decreased recovery through problems in processing circuits, product quality, and an increased likelihood of discharge of water that cannot meet environmental regulatory requirements. On most mine sites, there is usually a disjuncture between water quantity management and water quality management with the latter being managed solely as an environmental problem. It is becoming increasingly clear that water quality and quantity must be managed as an integrated system. In order to integrate water quality and quantity management to achieve multiple objectives the dynamics of water and constituents must be understood.

This paper presents an integrated assessment methodological scheme for the evaluation of air pollution control measures that are put forward in order to reduce sufficiently air pollution levels in urban areas. Forming long-term, efficient air pollution control strategies requires knowledge of the costs associated with their implementation, the emission inventories and emission reductions to be achieved, as well as the concentration variations that represent air quality levels in the area examined. In contrast to the majority of the currently employed assessment approaches, the presented scheme enables the evaluation of any proposed air pollution control option in terms of its combined impact on air quality and social welfare, by correlating economic and health impact assessment issues. The approach presented in this paper brings together air quality modelling and mathematical programming techniques and provides a decision support system for the determination of optimal bundles of air pollution control options according to the particular features and needs of the areas examined. Both cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit approaches are taken into account in order to put the problem on the basis of economic efficiency from a societal perspective. The methodology is implemented for the case of Thessaloniki, Greece, which is selected on the grounds that the area is considered as one of the most polluted-if not the most polluted-cities within Europe, especially with respect to airborne particles. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

An assessment of local and regional isotopic equilibrium in the mantle, Earth Planet Sci. Lett. 38, 44-62] showed that local disequilibria of slowly diffusing radiogenic tracers (e.g. Sr) are preserved in the mantle over 1-2 Ga time scales. Recently, it was suggested that this is not the case for fast diffusing elements such as lithium [Halama, R., McDonough, W.F., Rudnick, R.L., Bell, K., 2008. Tracking the lithium isotopic evolution of the mantle using carbonatites, Earth Planet Sci. Lett. 265, 726-742], thus questioning the ability of lithium isotopes to constrain long-term effects of recycling of material with crustal signatures. A key issue in this debate is the identification in hotspot volcanism of Li isotopic fingerprint consistent with recycling. Previous studies proposed that HIMU type volcanism, which is thought to sample mantle domains that include subducted altered oceanic crust, has 7Li/6Li distinctively higher than the fresh mid-ocean ridge basalts. This work focuses on Rurutu island, where both HIMU (20.88 &lt;206Pb/204Pb &lt; 21.42) and non-HIMU (19.11 &lt;206Pb/204Pb &lt; 20.45) lavas occur. When considering only the freshest and most primitive lavas, the lithium isotopic signatures of HIMU (+ 5.4 &lt; δ7Li &lt; + 7.9‰) and non-HIMU (+ 2.9 &lt; δ7Li &lt; + 4.8‰) lavas do not overlap, thus supporting the idea that HIMU mantle has distinctly elevated δ7Li. This result suggests that Li isotopic heterogeneities could survive diffusion over 1-2 billion years, the amount of time required to develop the highly radiogenic Pb signature of HIMU-lavas. Modeling lithium diffusion out of a lithium-rich, isotopically heavy altered oceanic crust reveals that isotopic disequilibrium persists over long time periods in comparison with the rapid decrease of chemical disequilibrium. For instance, a kilometer-thick altered oceanic crust loses most of its Li excess in a matter of a few tens of millions of years but could preserve 7Li/6Li distinctively higher than the ambient mantle over a time period in excess of 1.5 Ga. After 1.5 Ga, a kilometer-thick altered oceanic crust has heavy but uniform 7Li/6Li, while large isotopic variations persist in the nearby mantle (&lt; 20 km). Thus, decoupling between Li and slowly diffusing radiogenic isotopes can be predicted in the mantle nearby subducted crust. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, Norway's NAP directed that the petroleum sector would not receive allowances free of charge and set out special allocation rules for land-based industries. While older installations are to receive allowances free of charge, those established after 31 December 2001 are to purchase their allowances on the market. The scheme was met with criticism by the European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA) Surveillance Authority, in particular for its discriminatory treatment between older and newer installations. Norway addressed the EFTA Surveillance Authority's objections by correcting its NAP to the detriment of its environmental integrity. This article argues that Norway missed an opportunity to make polluters face the full incremental environmental costs of their activities in accordance with the polluter pays principle. The EU ETS for 2013-2020 is set to introduce an EU-wide emissions cap, auctioning and stronger harmonization of allocation rules. Despite the 'European Economic Area relevance' of the proposed amendments to Directive 2003/87/EC to improve the EU ETS, it remains to be seen whether and how Norway is going to implement these changes. No other piece of EU legislation has implied so strong a shift in decision-making power from the national to the EU level. For Norway as a non-EU Member State, this raises fundamental questions of democratic legitimacy, which must be addressed. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"cost-benefit analysis; emissions trading; environmental economics; European Union; free trade; oil industry; polluter pays principle; pollution tax; trade-environment relations; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75649145938

Plants in northern regions can display more ozone injury than plants at lower latitudes despite lower ozone levels. Larger ozone influx and shorter nights have been suggested as possible causes. However, the effects of the dim light present during northern summer nights have not been investigated. Young Trifolium subterraneum plants kept in environmentally controlled growth rooms under long day (10h bright light, 14h dim light) or short day (10h bright light, 14h darkness) conditions were exposed to 6h of 70ppb ozone during daytime for three consecutive days. Leaves were visually inspected and imaged in vivo using thermal imaging before and after the daily exposure. In long-day-treated plants, visible foliar injury within 1 week after exposure was more severe. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that the leaves of ozone-exposed long-day-treated plants were also warmer with more homogeneous temperature distributions than exposed short day and control plants, suggesting reduced transpiration. Temperature disruptions were not restricted to areas displaying visible damage and occurred even in leaves with only slight visible injury. Ozone did not affect the leaf temperature of short-day-treated plants. As all factors influencing ozone influx were the same for long- and short-day-treated plants, only the dim nocturnal light could account for the different ozone sensitivities. Thus, the twilight summer nights at high latitudes may have a negative effect on repair and defence processes activated after ozone exposure, thereby enhancing sensitivity.","Daylength; Leaf temperature; Ozone; Principal component analysis; Thermal Imaging; Thermography; Transpiration; Trifolium; Visible foliar injury","ozone; article; clover; drug effect; ecosystem; light; metabolism; photoperiodicity; physiological stress; physiology; plant leaf; radiation exposure; temperature; Ecosystem; Light; Ozone; Photoperiod; Plant Leaves; Stress, Physiological; Temperature; Trifolium; Trifolium; Trifolium subterraneum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69949130854

Geochemical modelling of the storage capacity for CO2 in saline aquifers, sandstones and/or carbonates should be based on natural analogues both in situ and in the laboratory. The main focus of this paper has been to study natural gas emissions representing extremely attractive surrogates for the study and prediction of the possible consequences of leakage from geological sequestration sites of anthropogenic CO2 (i.e., the return to surface, potentially causing localised environmental problems). These include a comparison among three different Italian case histories: (i) the Solfatara crater (Phlegraean Fields caldera, southern Italy) is an ancient Roman spa. The area is characterised by intense and diffuse hydrothermal activity, testified by hot acidic mud pools, thermal springs and a large fumarolic field. Soil gas flux measurements show that the entire area discharges between 1200 and 1500 tons of CO2 per day; (ii) the Panarea Island (Aeolian Islands, southern Italy) where a huge submarine volcanic-hydrothermal gas burst occurred in November, 2002. The submarine gas emissions chemically modified seawater causing a strong modification of the marine ecosystem. All of the collected gases are CO2-dominant (maximum value: 98.43 vol.%); (iii) the Tor Caldara area (Central Italy), located in a peripheral sector of the quiescent Alban Hills volcano, along the faults of the Ardea Basin transfer structure. The area is characterised by huge CO2 degassing both from water and soil. Although the above mentioned areas do not represent a storage scenario, these sites do provide many opportunities to study near-surface processes and to test monitoring methodologies. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We used non-destructive in situ multichannel reflection spectrometry data from a short sediment core of Laguna Aculeo (33°50′S/70°54′W, 355 m a.s.l., central Chile). Calibration-in-time (period AD 1901-2000, cross-validated with split periods) revealed robust correlations between local DJF temperatures and total sedimentary chlorin (relative absorption band depth (RABD) centred in 660-670 nm RABD660;670: r=0.79, P&lt;0.01; five-years triangular filtered) and the degree of pigment diagenesis (R660nm/670 nm: r=0.82, P&lt;0.01; five-years triangular filter). Root Mean Squared Error values are small (between 0.24 and 0.34°C) suggesting that most of the reconstructed decadal-scale climate variability is significant. Our data provide quantitative evidence for the presence of a Medieval Climate Anomaly (in this case, warm summers between AD 1150 and 1350; ΔT = +0.27 to +0.37°C with respect to (wrt) twentieth century) and a very cool period synchronous to the 'Little Ice Age' starting with a sharp drop between AD 1350 and AD 1400 (-0.3°C/10 yr, decadal trend) followed by constantly cool (ΔT = -0.70 to -0.90°C wrt twentieth century) summers until AD 1750.

It is important to develop an emission information system to provide fundamental data to support emission control strategies and air quality studies. In this research, emissions were compiled for the year 2005. Emission sources cover key anthropogenic and natural emission sources. The methodology to calculate emissions is based on the bottom-up approach using local specific data. For gaseous species, annual emission estimation is found as follows: 9465.9 Gg of carbon monoxide, 2583.1 Gg of nonmethane volatile organic compounds, 886.0 Gg of sulfur dioxide, 790.3 Gg of oxides of nitrogen, and 439.2 Gg of ammonia. For aerosol species, annual emission estimations are 1277.4 Gg of particulate matter smaller than or equal to 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter, 325.5 Gg of organic carbon, and 136.4 Gg of black carbon.

This better knowledge is very beneficial to design efficient combustion devices with reduced pollutant emission. Overall net species production rates are derived from the experimental determination of the evolution of the gas stream velocity, temperature, and species concentrations in the direction normal to the flame front. For species involved in a limited number of reactions, rate constants can be calculated at the next step. The development, in the early 1980s, of numerical codes for simulating the structure of one-dimensional laminar premixed flames the flame structure data to be directly used for validating detailed reaction mechanisms. Species analyses are still performed with techniques based on local gas sampling by probes, despite flame perturbations, but flame structure analyses have been markedly enriched by the use of non-intrusive spectroscopic techniques. The former allow the analysis of a large variety of species, and they have proven to be very well adapted to the large number of intermediate species formed in rich flames or in flames fed by heavy fuel molecules. The molecular beam mass spectrometry technique has been recently improved by the use of new photoionization sources that allow identification of isomers and extend the knowledge on intermediate species involved in formation of benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and soot in flames. Amongst various spectroscopic techniques applied to flame structure analyses, laser-induced fluorescence has been largely used to perform accurate quantitative measurements of intermediate radicals that play a key role in the prompt-NO mechanism.

Here we used a spatially distributed process-driven model over the 20 Mhaof recentlyabandonedagricultural lands of the Former Soviet Union to quantify the GHG mitigation by biofuel production from Low Input/High Diversity (LIHD) grass-legume prairies and to compare this GHG mitigation with the one of soil C sequestration as it currently occurs. LIHD has recently received a lot of attention as an emerging opportunity to produce biofuels over marginal lands leading to a good energy efficiency with minimal adverse consequences on food security and ecosystem services. We found that, depending on the time horizon over which one seeks to maximize the GHG benefit, the optimal time for implementing biofuel production shifts from ""never"" (short-term horizon) to ""as soon as possible"" (longer-term horizon). These results highlight the importance of reaching agreement a priori on the target time interval during which biofuels are expected to play a role within the global energy system, to avoid deploying biofuel technology over a time interval for which it has a detrimental impact on the GHG mitigation objective. The window of opportunity for growing LIHD also stresses the need to reduce uncertainties in soil C inputs, turnover, and soil organic matter stability under current and future climate and management practices. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Energy efficiency; Food supply; Land use; Soils; Advanced technology; Biofuel production; C sequestration; Ecosystem services; Management practices; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil organic matters; Spatially distributed process; Biofuels; biofuel; carbon; abandoned land; agricultural land; biofuel; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate effect; ecosystem service; energy efficiency; food security; grass; greenhouse gas; legume; management practice; soil carbon; soil organic matter; agricultural land; article; climate change; controlled study; grassland; land use; sensitivity analysis; simulation; soil analysis; tillage; USSR; USSR",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72249108169

We hypothesized that embryo signal, E 2, and PGE2 modulate expression of key enzymes in PG synthesis: PG-endoperoxide synthase-2 (PTGS2), microsomal PGE synthase (mPGES-1), PGF synthase (PGFS), and PG 9-ketoreductase (CBR1) as well as PGE2 receptor (PTGER2 and -4) expression and signaling within the endometrium. We determined the site of action of PGE2 in endometrium during the estrous cycle and pregnancy. Endometrial tissue explants obtained from gilts (n=6) on d 11-12 of the estrous cycle were treated with vehicle (control), PGE2 (100 nM), E2 (1-100 nM), or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nM, positive control). E2 increased PGE2 secretion through elevating expression of mPGES-1 mRNA and PTGS2 and mPGES-1 protein in endometrial explants. By contrast, E2 decreased PGFS and CBR1 protein expression. E2 also stimulated PTGER2 but not PTGER4 protein content. PGE2 enhanced mPGES-1 and PTGER2 mRNA as well as PTGS2, mPGES-1, and PTGER2 protein expression. PGE2 had no effect on PGFS, CBR1, and PTGER4 expression and PGF2α release. Treatment of endometrial tissue with PGE2 increased cAMP production. Cotreatment with PTGER2 antagonist (AH6809) but not PTGER4 antagonist (GW 627368X) inhibited significantly PGE2-mediated cAMP production. PTGER2 protein was localized in luminal and glandular epithelium and blood vessels of endometrium and was significantly up-regulated on d 11-12 of pregnancy. Our results suggest that E2 prevents luteolysis through enzymatic modification of PG synthesis and that E2, PGE2, and endometrial PTGER2 are involved in a PGE2 positive feedback loop in porcine endometrium.

The reactor was operated both alone and as part of a two-stage process in series with an anaerobic filter. Operating with a hydraulic flush to give hydraulic retention times (HRT) between 1.6 and 5.3 days, and a solids retention time (SRT) of 20 days increased hydrolysis in comparison with a control reactor where HRT and SRT were equal. Overall biodegradability was low; however, with an effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) equivalent to ∼30% of the substrate biochemical methane potential (BMP). When operated as part of a two-stage process using effluent from the anaerobic filter as the flush liquor the characteristics of the system changed substantially with an increase in performance to an overall methane production of 0.22-0.24L g-1 volatile solids (VS) added. This was achieved even when the maximum loading of 7.5gVS L-1day-1 was applied. During acclimatization the first-stage hydrolytic reactor became methanogenic despite the short HRT, and was responsible for as much as 70% of the overall methane production. The system could not revert to single-stage operation after acclimatization, showing the continuing importance of the anaerobic filter. The combined system was robust, and could recover from major disturbances and step increases in loading without reduction in continuous methane production, indicating some potential for larger scale application in BMW disposal. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Anaerobic digestion (AD); Biodegradable municipal waste (BMW); Hydraulic flush reactor; Hydrolysis; Two stage","Anaerobic filters; Biochemical methane potential; Biodegradable municipal waste (BMW); Combined system; Control reactors; Hydraulic flush reactor; Hydraulic flushes; Hydraulic retention time; Hydrolysis products; Liquid retention; Maximum loading; Methane production; Municipal waste; Single stage; Solids retention time; Two stage; Two-stage anaerobic digestions; Two-stage process; Volatile solid; Biodegradability; Biodegradation; Chemical oxygen demand; Effluents; Filters (for fluids); Hydrolysis; Methane; Oxygen; Radioactive waste disposal; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic digestion; methane; volatile agent; acclimatization; anaerobic digestion; anaerobic filter; anaerobic reactor; article; biochemistry; biodegradability; biodegradation; biomass; chemical oxygen demand; hydrolysis; municipal solid waste; nutrient; solid waste management; waste component removal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449487612

As we cannot accomplish this reduction through vehicle and fuel technology alone, the environmental and transportation communities are focusing on strategies to reduce growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT), reversing recent trends. The majority of recent VMT growth is due, not to population growth, but to the effects of urban environment, such as increased auto ownership, longer trips, and driving alone. The US Department of Energy forecasts that driving will continue to increase at almost threefold the growth in population. Even under the most stringent vehicle and fuel standards, transportation-related CO2 emissions will be 40% above the target level. In response, climate-change legislation has been passed in California and is pending in other states and in the US Congress that places strict new requirements on mandated environmental impact documentation. One limitation on compliance has been the lack of a unified set of scientific information on the underlying relationships between development form and VMT generation. This article distills and reconciles various forms of prior research on the subject, producing a unified quantitative understanding of the mechanisms that relate urban development forms with VMT and CO2. The findings will help improve the insightfulness and accuracy of the next generation of environmental documents. The article provides results of research and planning studies from throughout the US that indicate the degree to which developments with higher densities, mix of uses, accessible destinations, and interconnected streets reduce vehicle trips and VMT. Sources include regional blueprint studies, as well as project-specific studies such as Atlanta's Atlantic Station development, whose predicted trip reduction was found to be so compelling that the development was deemed a transportation control measure and air quality benefit by the Environmental Protection Agency and Federal Highway Administration. The article identifies the emerging practices in transportation impact analysis for assessing the degree to which the characteristics of development can reduce VMT and carbon impacts.

By means of temperature- and solvent-dependent steady-state spectroscopy, picosecond time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering, we provide new insights into the role of polymer aggregates in defining die thermochromic behavior of PPVs. We find DAO-PPV to exhibit a low temperature state with vibronically structured red visible absorption and emission spectra. Structurally, this low temperature state is a densely packed and disordered polymer aggregate, which contains a fraction of well-ordered, packed polymer chains. These ordered regions serve as low energy trap sites for the more disordered regions in the aggregate, thus regulating the final emission of the aggregate and imposing a vibronically resolved emission spectrum, which is usually associated with emission from one or a few chromophores. The high temperature state of DAO-PPV is a loose aggregate, with structureless absorption and emission spectra in the green visible range. Structurally, the loose aggregate is a well-solvated aggregate retaining the physical dimension of the dense aggregate but for which interchain interactions are diminished with the increase of temperature. As a result, the spectroscopic behavior of the loose aggregate is very similar if not identical to that of the single polymer chain. Increased solubility untangles polymer aggregates into single, dispersed, polymer chains, as we demonstrate here for DAO-PPV in 1,2-dichlorobenzene and at high temperature. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption; Chromophores; Emission spectroscopy; Photoluminescence spectroscopy; Toluene; Absorption and emission spectra; Chain conformations; Dichlorobenzenes; Diluted solutions; Disordered regions; Emission spectrums; High temperature; Interchain interactions; Low energies; Low-temperature state; Phenylenevinylene; Physical dimensions; Picosecond time; Polymer aggregates; Polymer chains; Single polymer chains; Spectroscopic behavior; Thermochromic behavior; Thermochromism; Visible range; Aggregates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73449125488

At the region level, per hectare yields were simulated for corn, wheat, soybean, and sorghum. We concluded that it was possible to predict crop yields through computer simulation with greater than 93% accuracy. The hail damage model test indicated EPIC could predict hail-soil-induced yield losses reasonably well (R2 &gt; 0.6). The investigation of soil type influence on dryland sorghum and wheat production indicated that Wymore silty clay loam soil and Kenoma silt loam produced the highest sorghum yields statistically; Kuma silt loam, Roxbury silt loam, Crete silty clay loam, and Woodson silt soils produced the second highest sorghum yields statistically; and Richfiled silt loam, Wells loam, and Canadian sandy loam produced the lowest sorghum yields.

Given that sample plots used for collection of forest carbon observations are often much smaller than the map units of forest carbon at regional, national, and global scales, scientists are currently experiencing two challenges. The first challenge is to produce reliable maps of forest carbon using the data from inconsistent sizes of plots and image pixels. Also, because estimates of forest carbon normally contain uncertainties, the second challenge is to accurately model propagation of uncertainties from input data to output results. In this study, a methodology for mapping and analyzing spatial uncertainty of forest carbon estimates was developed to address these challenges. The methodological framework consisted of two methods. The first one was up-scaling method that combined and scaled up existing national forest inventory plot data and satellite images from smaller sample plots and image pixels to larger map units. The second one was spatial uncertainty analysis and error budget method that entailed modeling propagated uncertainties through a geostatistical mapping system. A case study using 46 permanent national forest inventory plots from Wu-Yuan County, Jiangxi, China, was undertaken to test this methodology. The results showed that this method reproduced not only the spatial distribution of forest carbon but also the spatial pattern of variances of its estimates and was able to quantify the contributions of uncertainties from the field plot data and satellite images to the uncertainties of forest carbon estimates. Thus, this study, to some extent, overcame the gaps that currently exist in the generation and assessment of forest carbon estimation maps. Moreover, the results showed that in this case study, the variation of the band ratio defined as (TM2 + TM3 + TM5)/TM7 contributed more uncertainties to the estimates of forest carbon than the variation of the plot data. In addition, we also found out that the product of the input plot forest carbon variance and the band ratio variance, implying the interaction between these two variables, reduced the uncertainties of the forest carbon estimates. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, it can conserve more valuable fossil fuel and improve the environment by lessening Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission and the amount of waste that must be landfilled. This paper highlights the MSW generation and characteristics for the city of Chongqing, the nation's fourth largest municipality after Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. At present the daily amount of MSW generated per person is about 0.85 kg; food waste accounts for about 53.7% of total MSW. MSW in Chongqing has higher moisture content and lower net caloric value, which is an obstruction for incineration. This paper examines the emission reductions potential for MSW incineration power plant in urban Chongqing. As a case study, emission reductions analysis and economic assessment was implemented for Tongxing MSW incineration power plant. The results show that with the power displacement potential at 235 060 MWh, Chongqing is expected to generate emission reductions as much as 815 862-827 969 tCO2 and net profit US$7.72 million per annum. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These nanoscopic cages are robust and can be maintained upon guest exchange. Within the restricting space, the luminescence intensity of the encapsulated [Ln(H 2O)8]3+ species is dramatically enhanced due to the vibrational movements originating from the O-H oscillators in the coordinated water molecules being effectively reduced by the host-guest H-bonding interactions. Based on the guest-driven approach, tunable emission and bimodal emission (UV/Vis/NIR) of these [{Ln(H2O)8} 3+⊂LnIII2L4] supramolecular systems are successfully realized.

We conducted an experiment with four treatments (i.e. winter-grazed, natural alpine meadow; naturally restored alpine meadow eight years after cultivation; oat pasture and bare soil without roots) during the growing seasons of 2007 and 2008 to examine the question of CH 4 emission by plant communities in the alpine meadow. Each treatment consumed CH4 in closed, opaque chambers in the field, but two types of alpine meadow vegetation reduced CH4 consumption compared with bare soil, whereas oat pasture increased consumption. This result could imply that meadow vegetation produces CH4. However, measurements of soil temperature and water content showed significant differences between vegetated and bare soil and appeared to explain differences in CH4 production between treatments. Our study strongly suggests that the apparent CH4 production by vegetation, when compared with bare soil in some previous studies, might represent differences in soil temperature and water-filled pore space and not the true vegetation sources of CH4. © 2009 The Royal Society.","CH4 consumption by alpine ecosystem; CH4 emission by plant community; Land-use change; Soil moisture; Soil temperature","methane; alpine environment; bare soil; experimental study; grass; growing season; land use change; meadow; methane; pasture; plant community; soil moisture; soil temperature; water content; air pollution control; article; China; controlled study; environmental change; experimental study; growing season; nonhuman; oat; pasture; plant community; priority journal; seasonal variation; soil temperature; tillage; vegetation; water content; winter; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67749143837

The O3 pollution in Beijing showed a significant spatial distribution with strong regional contribution. The results suggested that the plume originating from Beijing urban areas greatly affected the O3 concentrations at the Dingling site, accounting for 55% of elevated O 3 there, while O3 pollution in the Beijing urban areas resulted from both local emissions and those from Tianjin and the south of Hebei Province. Transport of O3 was responsible for about 70% of the regional O3 contribution to Beijing urban areas, while transport of O3 precursors accounted for the remainder. The formation of O 3 was limited by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the urban areas of Beijing, while being more sensitive to NO x levels in the suburban and more remote areas. Therefore, it is necessary to consider a large number of factors, including impacts of emissions from different regions, the two modes of regional contribution as well as the sensitivity of O3 formation to precursors, in the design of emissions control strategies for O3 reduction in Beijing. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.","Beijing; Emission; Ozone; Source apportionment","Beijing; Beijing , China; Comprehensive air quality model with extensions; Emission; Emissions control; Hebei Province; Local emissions; Photochemical smog; Pollution episodes; Regional chemical transport model; Relative importance; Remote areas; Source apportionment; Source attribution; Spatial distribution; Tianjin; Urban areas; Air quality; Forestry; Three dimensional; Volatile organic compounds; Ozone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68649099999

Small (Euphorbiaceae), is an invasive plant in the southeastern United States. The leaf-rolling weevil, Heterapoderopsi.s bicallosicollis Voss, is a common herbivore attacking this plant in China. To evaluate its potential as a biological control agent of T. sebfera, biology and host specificity of this weevil were studied in China. H. bicallosicollis occurs over a wide, native, geographic range and its immatures successfully develop at 15-35°C, indicating its physiological potential to establish and persist throughout the range of climatic conditions where the target plant grows in the United States. Adults make feeding holes on leaves. Before oviposition, the female makes a sealed leaf roll called a nidus and then lays one to two eggs inside. Eggs, larvae, and pupae develop within nidi, and larvae survive only when they develop inside the nidi. This requirement makes the weevil highly host specific to T. sebifera. In laboratory no-choice tests of 54 species from eight families, adults fed on only 3 plant species, T. sebifera, Sapium chihsinianuin S. K. Lee, and Phyllanthus urinaria L. and only oviposited on T sebifera. These results were confirmed where, in multiple-choice tests, adults only oviposited on T. sebif era. Given that T. sebzf era is the only species in the genus Triadica in the United States, the results of this study suggest that H. bicallosicolli.s is a potential biological control agent of T. sebifera and should be considered to be imported into quarantine in the United States for further tests on native North American species.","Biological weed control; China; Host specificity; Invasive plant; Leaf-rolling weevil","beetle; biocontrol agent; biological control; herbivore; host specificity; invasive species; oviposition; physiology; weed control; animal; article; China; egg laying; Euphorbia; female; food preference; geography; host parasite interaction; life cycle; parasitology; physiology; temperature; weevil; Animals; China; Euphorbiaceae; Female; Food Preferences; Geography; Host-Parasite Interactions; Life Cycle Stages; Oviposition; Temperature; Weevils; North America; United States; Attelabidae; Coleoptera; Euphorbiaceae; Phyllanthus urinaria; Sapium; Triadica; Triadica sebifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69849083512

In this paper, we review the history of applications of various model-data fusion techniques in studies of terrestrial carbon fluxes in two approaches: top-down approaches that use measurements of global CO2 concentration and sometimes other atmospheric constituents to infer carbon fluxes from the land surface, and bottom-up approaches that estimate carbon fluxes using process-based models. We consider applications of model-data fusion in flux estimation, parameter estimation, model error analysis, experimental design and forecasting. Significant progress has been made by systematically studying the discrepancies between the predictions by different models and observations. As a result, some major controversies in global carbon cycle studies have been resolved, robust estimates of continental and global carbon fluxes over the last two decades have been obtained, and major deficiencies in the atmospheric models for tracer transport have been identified. In the bottom-up approaches, various optimization techniques have been used for a range of process-based models. Model-data fusion techniques have been successfully used to improve model predictions, and quantify the information content of carbon flux measurements and identify what other measurements are needed to further constrain model predictions. However, we found that very few studies in both top-down and bottom-up approaches have quantified the errors in the observations, model parameters and model structure systematically and consistently. We therefore suggest that future research will focus on developing an integrated Bayesian framework to study both model and measurement errors systematically. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon flux; Data assimilation; Kalman filter; Measurement error; Model error; Model-data fusion; Parameter estimation; Statistical estimation","atmospheric modeling; Bayesian analysis; bottom-up approach; carbon flux; data assimilation; error analysis; Kalman filter; numerical model; top-down approach",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69649094735

A novel Pannonibacter sp. strain W1 capable of degrading 4-ABS as sole carbon as well as energy, nitrogen and sulfur source was isolated and identified from the activated sludge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Strain W1 was able to completely degrade 4-ABS with initial concentrations of 200-2500 mg L-1 within 40 h. Haldane inhibition model was used to fit the special degradation rate at different initial concentrations, and the parameters μmax, Ks and Ki were determined to be 227.977 mg (g h)-1, 84.306 mg L-1 and 1270.675 mg L-1, respectively. Elements N and S of 4-ABS were released in respective forms of ammonia and sulfate while degrading 4-ABS by strain W1, accounting for 77.6% and 92.2% of theoretical values, respectively. Relatively low recoveries of dissolved N and S were probably owing to the fact that part of the released ammonia and sulfate were utilized by strain W1 for cell growth. It was found that the reduction of total organic carbon (TOC) was proportional to the degradation of 4-ABS and 84.4% TOC removal rate, corresponding to a 4-ABS degradation rate of 94.7%, was achieved at the end of the test. Additionally, HPLC and UV analyses indicated that there were no other aromatic intermediates detectable, suggesting the achievement of a complete mineralization of 4-ABS with strain W1. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, is night ventilation a suitable strategy for office buildings with lightweight construction located in cold climates? In order to answer this question, the whole energy-consumption analysis software EnergyPlus was used to simulate the indoor thermal environment and energy consumption in typical office buildings with night mechanical ventilation in three cities in northern China. The summer outdoor climate data was analyzed, and three typical design days were chosen. The most important factors influencing night ventilation performance such as ventilation rates, ventilation duration, building mass and climatic conditions were evaluated. When night ventilation operation time is closer to active cooling time, the efficiency of night ventilation is higher. With night ventilation rate of 10 ach, the mean radiant temperature of the indoor surface decreased by up to 3.9 °C. The longer the duration of operation, the more efficient the night ventilation strategy becomes. The control strategies for three locations are given in the paper. Based on the optimized strategies, the operation consumption and fees are calculated. The results show that more energy is saved in office buildings cooled by a night ventilation system in northern China than ones that do not employ this strategy. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The focus of this paper is on sulfate, nitrate, and elemental carbon. The objective of the TSSA algorithm is to provide useful results in modeling studies for identifying important emissions categories and identifying possible emissions reduction strategies to attain particulate matter (PM) air quality goals. TSSA differs from model sensitivity approaches because it tracks direct mass contributions from specific emissions sources to the total PM concentration at selected receptor sites, while results from sensitivity approaches are affected by nonlinear chemistry that can change the concentration of sulfate, nitrate, and organic carbon secondary particulates. We evaluated the algorithm by comparing CMAQ/TSSA results with results from zero-out CMAQ sensitivity simulations. As expected, TSSA results were almost identical to the CMAQ sensitivity results for chemical species that do not undergo nonlinear chemical reactions. For chemical species with nonlinear chemical reaction, the TSSA results are expected to differ from model sensitivity results, but for small emissions changes the results are similar in the two approaches. We also compared CMAQ/TSSA to CAMx/PSAT. Because there are significant differences in the CMAQ and CAMx model predicted concentrations, the source attribution results differed for TSSA and PSAT; however, the rank order of emissions sources were similar for the two approaches at most receptor sites.

The research presented illustrates the impact of using various surrogates for unobserved measurements of ambient concentrations at the zip code level. Simulation results indicate that the impact of measurement error on the association between pollutant exposure and a health outcome can be substantial. The proposed conditional expectation (CE) approach provided reliable estimates of the association and exhibited good confidence interval coverage for a variety of magnitudes of association. Use of a single-centrally located monitor, the arithmetic average, the nearest-neighbor monitor, and the inverse-distance weighted average surrogates resulted in biased estimates and poor coverage rates, especially for larger magnitudes of the association.

Particularly in the United States, the public discussion of these dimensions is strongly influenced by religious groups and leaders. Over the past few years, many religious groups have taken positions on climate change, highlighting its ethical dimensions. This paper aims to explore these ethical dimensions in the US public debate in relation to public support for climate policies. It analyzes in particular the Christian voices in the US public debate on climate change by typifying the various discourses. Three narratives emerge from this analysis: 'conservational stewardship' (conserving the 'garden of God' as it was created), 'developmental stewardship' (turning the wilderness into a garden as it should become) and 'developmental preservation' (God's creation is good and changing; progress and preservation should be combined). The different narratives address fundamental ethical questions, dealing with stewardship and social justice, and they provide proxies for public perception of climate change in the US. Policy strategies that pay careful attention to the effects of climate change and climate policy on the poor - in developing nations and the US itself - may find support among the US population.

Emulsified fuel saturated with CO2 under PCO2 = 92 kPa and Te = 288 K and the degassed emulsified fuel were used in the experiment. An emulsified fuel droplet suspended from a thermocouple was inserted into an electric furnace. Puffing behavior was observed by using a high-speed video camera. The waiting time and the superheat temperature for the occurrence of puffing were measured. The mean waiting time of the emulsified fuel saturated with CO2 decreased by about 25% compared with that of the degassed emulsified fuel. When the degassed emulsified fuel was used, there was a peak of puffing occurrence at the superheat temperature of 60 K. When the emulsified fuel saturated with CO2 was used, there was a peak of puffing occurrence at the superheat temperature of 45 K. The superheat temperature at the peak decreased by 15 K. Puffing behavior of the carbonated emulsified fuel was more violent than that of the degassed emulsified fuel. These were because the dissolved CO2 caused a reduction in the bubble nucleation energy. Moreover, a new equation which described the waiting time for puffing was proposed. This equation was based on the assumption that puffing occurred when the inner droplet temperature increased linearly. The calculated results of the waiting time were in good agreement with the experimental ones when puffing occurred near the initial linear region. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A MARKAL-based integrated energy system model of the five GMS countries was developed to examine benefits of regional energy resource development for meeting the energy demand of these countries. The study found that an unrestricted energy resource development and trade within the region would reduce the total-regional energy systems cost by 18% and would abate the total CO2 emission by 5% as compared to the base case. All the five countries except Myanmar would benefit from the expansion of regional energy resource integration in terms of lower energy systems costs and better environmental qualities. An imposition of CO2 emission reduction constraint by 5% on each of the study countries from that of the corresponding emissions under the unrestricted energy resource development in the GMS is found to improve energy security, reduce energy import and fossil fuels dependences and increase volume of power trade within the region.

Emissions benefits above and beyond the natural course of transit bus procurements were examined for new diesel buses running on ULSD fuel, diesel-electric hybrid buses, gasoline-electric hybrid buses, compressed natural gas and biodiesel. According to the analysis, reductions in emissions of CO, NMHC, NOx, PM and CO2, as well as fuel consumption, may be attained, and diesel hybrid buses yield the largest reductions in CO2 emissions and are the only technology to reduce fuel consumption relative to the present fleet. Introducing diesel-electric hybrid buses in 15% of the U.S. transit bus fleet would reduce annual end-use emissions by nearly 1,800 tons of CO, 400 tons of NMHC, 4,400 tons of NOx, 200 tons of PM, 491,400 tons of CO2, and fuel consumption by 50.66 millions of diesel gallons.","CO; CO2; Emissions inventory; Emissions modeling; Fuel economy; HC; NMHC; NOx; PM; Transit buses","Alternative fuels; Bus transportation; Energy resources; Fleet operations; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Leakage (fluid); Natural gasoline; Permanent magnets; Reduction; Steel metallurgy; Technology; CO; CO2; Emissions inventory; Emissions modeling; HC; NMHC; NOx; PM; Transit buses; Carbon monoxide; advanced technology; alternative fuel; bus transport; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; emission control; emission inventory; fuel consumption; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; public transport; traffic emission; volatile organic compound; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349805632

Although the CLPP method is a straight forward laboratory protocol which yields large amounts of functional information, the amount of data obtained can become overwhelming and often requires some type of multivariate analysis method for ordination and interpretation. Multivariate analysis can be challenging and requires a significant statistics background along with an understanding of the inferences and biases each multivariate analysis method incurs. This paper presents and evaluates a new approach to analyzing sole carbon source utilization data. A method is described which provides a one-dimensional metric derived from standard CLPP data (BIOLOG™ EcoPlate data). The one-dimensional community metric was derived using normalized Euclidean distances and shifts in the carbon source utilization patterns. The one-dimensional community metric did not provide all of the information of classical approaches such as principle component analysis (PCA) or guild grouping analysis; however, it was found to be more easily implemented and interpreted when analyzing the plate data. Validation of this approach is demonstrated using data acquired to track the divergence of bacterial communities in wetland mesocosm systems after an experimentally controlled disturbance. If the objective is to investigate community shifts over time the one-dimensional community divergence metric can be a useful tool. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using XAD-8/XAD-4 resins, the DOM in the secondary effluent, HSFW effluent, and the DOM derived from the leaves and roots (DOML&amp;R) were fractionated into five classes: hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N) and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). DOC was removed by 37.2% during the HSFW treatment. On the other hand, hydrophobic/hydrophilic distribution of the HSFW effluent DOM changed significantly, with the effluent DOC becoming more hydrophobic due to a preferential removal of HPI (with a reduction of 64.8%). Furthermore, the trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) reduction of the HSFW system was quite low (20.2%), partially being ascribed to the influence of the relatively higher specific THMFP (STHMFP) of the DOML&amp;R fractions (especially for HPO-A). The soluble microbial by-products (SMPs) and aromatic protein-like materials (polyphenols) from the leaves and roots could be the main reason for the increased STHMFP of the HSFW effluent DOM fractions. In addition, the peak of Region II (λex/λem = (220-260)/(332-380)) might serve as a proxy for monitoring the DOML&amp;R (polyphenols) in the effluent from a matured wetland. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A mass flow analysis of pharmaceuticals and diagnostics used in hospitals was performed on the site of a representative Swiss cantonal hospital. Specifically, we analyzed the consumption of iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) and cytostatics in their corresponding medical applications of radiology and oncology, respectively, and their discharge into hospital wastewater and eventually into the wastewater of the municipal wastewater treatment plant. Emission levels within one day and over several days were found to correlate with the pharmacokinetic excretion pattern and the consumed amounts in the hospital during these days. ICM total emissions vary substantially from day to day from 255 to 1259 g/d, with a maximum on the day when the highest radiology treatment occurred. Parent cytostatic compounds reach maximal emissions of 8-10 mg/d. A total of 1.1%, 1.4%, and 3.7% of the excreted amounts of the cytostatics 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, and 2′,2′-difluorodeoxyuridine (main metabolite of gemcitabine), respectively, were found in the hospital wastewater, whereas 49% of the total ICM was detected, showing a high variability among the compounds. These recoveries can essentially be explained by the high amount administered to out-patients (70% for cytostatics and 50% for ICM); therefore, only part of this dose is expected to be excreted on-site.

Allelopathy has been a controversially debated phenomenon for years, which revived in plant invasion biology as one possible reason for the success of invasive plants. Noxious plant exudates may harm other plants and provide an advantage to the allelopathic plant. However, root exudates are not always toxic, but may stimulate the microbial community and change nutrient availability in the rhizosphere. In a greenhouse experiment, we investigated the interacting effects of activated carbon, arbuscular mycorrhiza and plant competition between the invasive Senecio inaequidens and the native Artemisia vulgaris. Furthermore, we tested whether activated carbon showed any undesired effects by directly affecting mycorrhiza or soil chemistry. Contrary to the expectation, S. inaequidens was a weak competitor and we could not support the idea that allelopathy was involved in the competition. Activated carbon led to a considerable increase in the aboveground biomass production and reduced the infection with arbuscular mycorrhiza of both plant species. We expected that arbuscular mycorrhiza promotes plant growth by increasing nutrient availability, but we found the contrary when activated carbon was added. Chemical analyses of the substrate showed, that adding activated carbon resulted in a strong increase in plant available phosphate and in a decrease of the Corganic/Ntotal ratio, both of which suggest stimulated microbial activity.

These results show that activated carbon should be handled with great care in ecological experiments on allelopathy because of possible confounding effects on the soil community. © 2009 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","Activated carbon; Allelopathy; Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Artemisia vulgaris; Competition; Invasive plants; Senecio inaequidens","Arbuscular; Artemisia; Artemisia vulgaris; Senecio; Senecio inaequidens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69249202659

The results reveal that the critical event for the first dislocation nucleation during nanoindentation is due to the thermally activated formation of a small cluster with an atom's relative displacement larger than half the magnitude of the Burgers vector of partial dislocations. Hydrogen only enhances homogenous dislocation nucleation slightly; however it promotes dislocation emission, induces slip planarity, and localizes dislocation activity significantly, leading to locally enhanced vacancy formation from dislocations.

Measuring the concentrations of specific proteins provides unique information about the activity and physiological state of organisms in a sample. We developed sensitive (&lt; 5 fmol), selective bioindicator assays for the absolute quantification of select proteins used by Dehalococcoides spp. when reducing carbon atoms in the common pollutants trichloroethene (TCE) and tetrachloroethene (PCE). From complex whole-sample digests of two different dechlorinating mixed communities, we monitored the chromatographic peaks of selected tryptic peptides chosen to represent 19 specific Dehalococcoides proteins. This was accomplished using multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) assays using nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS), which provided the selectivity, sensitivity and reproducibility required to quantify Dehalococcoides proteins in complex samples. We observed reproducible peak areas (average CV = 0.14 over 4 days, n = 3) and linear responses in standard curves (n = 5, R2 &gt; 0.98) using synthetic peptide standards spiked into a background matrix of sediment peptides. We detected and quantified TCE reductive dehalogenase (TceA) at 7.6 ± 1.7 × 103 proteins cell-1 in the KB1TM bioaugmentation culture, previously thought to be lacking TceA. Fragmentation data from MS/MS shotgun proteomics experiments were helpful in developing the MRM targets. Similar shotgun proteomics data are emerging in labs around the world for many environmentally relevant microbial proteins, and these data are a valuable resource for the future development of MRM assays.

However, projected climatic changes render this assumption invalid. Here, we summarize general principles for management adaptations that have emerged from a major literature review. These general principles cover many topics including: (1) how to assess climate impacts to ecosystem processes that are key to management goals; (2) using management practices to support ecosystem resilience; (3) converting barriers that may inhibit management responses into opportunities for successful implementation; and (4) promoting flexible decision making that takes into account challenges of scale and thresholds. To date, the literature on management adaptations to climate change has mostly focused on strategies for bolstering the resilience of ecosystems to persist in their current states. Yet in the longer term, it is anticipated that climate change will push certain ecosystems and species beyond their capacity to recover. When managing to support resilience becomes infeasible, adaptation may require more than simply changing management practices-it may require changing management goals and managing transitions to new ecosystem states. After transitions have occurred, management will again support resilience-this time for a new ecosystem state. Thus, successful management of natural resources in the context of climate change will require recognition on the part of managers and decisions makers of the need to cycle between ""managing for resilience"" and ""managing for change"".","Adaptation; Climate change; Ecosystems; Resilience; Resource management; Thresholds; Triage; Uncertainty","Adaptation; Climate impacts; Climatic changes; Climatic conditions; Ecosystem process; Ecosystem resilience; Literature reviews; Management goals; Management practices; Public lands; Resource management; Successful management; Decision making; Ecosystems; Land use; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; decision making; ecosystem resilience; environmental management; land management; management practice; natural resource; adaptive environmental management; climate change; decision making; ecosystem; ecosystem resilience; environmental planning; environmental protection; financial management; forest; law; national park; review; species; United States; water management; wildlife conservation; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Decision Making; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; United States; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73449117156

A climatology of weather conditions associated with dense fog at Peoria, Illinois, for October-March 1970-94 indicated that fog forming in the presence of low clouds is common, in 57% of all events. For events associated with low pressure systems, low clouds precede dense fog in 84% of cases. Therefore, continental fogs often do not form under the clear-sky conditions that have received the most attention in the literature. Surface cooling is usually observed prior to fog on clear nights. With low cloud bases, warming or no change in temperature is frequent. Thus, fog often forms under conditions that are not well understood, increasing the difficulty of forecasting fog. The possible mechanisms for fog development under low cloud-base conditions were explored for an event when dense fog covered much of Illinois on 7 November 2006. Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) and rawinsonde observations indicated that evaporating precipitation aloft was important in moistening the lower atmosphere. Dense fog occurred about 6 h following light precipitation at the surface. The surface was nearly saturated following precipitation, but relative cooling was needed to overcome weak warm air advection and supersaturate the lower atmosphere. Surface (2 m) temperatures were near or slightly cooler than ground temperatures in most of the region, suggesting surface sensible heat fluxes were not important in this relative cooling. Sounding data indicated drying of the atmosphere above 800 hPa. Infrared satellite imagery indicated deep clouds associated with a low pressure system moved east of Illinois by early morning, leaving only low clouds. It is hypothesized that radiational cooling of the low cloud layer was instrumental in promoting the early morning dense fog. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",,"Cloud layers; Cold season; Dense fog; Ground temperature; Illinois; Infrared satellites; Low pressure systems; Lower atmosphere; Radiational cooling; Sensible heat flux; Sky condition; Surface cooling; Warm air; Weather conditions; Weather surveillance radar-1988 Doppler; Climatology; Clouds; Satellite imagery; Surveillance radar; Weather forecasting; Fog; clear sky; climatology; cloud microphysics; fog; observational method; precipitation (climatology); satellite imagery; sensible heat flux; Illinois; United States; Peoria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77649101498

The specific research questions were: Are managers' and their subordinates' perceptions of the learning climate related? and Does the manager's assessment of the work group skills correlate with the work group's perception of the learning climate? Design-methodology-approach A total of 12 managers and 130 of their subordinates were selected, and answered a questionnaire. The subordinates belonged to work groups with five to 19 care assistants working in elderly care. The majority of the participants were women (92 per cent). The mean age was 43 years old, range 20-63. Findings Results suggest that the perception of the learning climate has a correspondence between the organisational levels (managers and their subordinates) and that there is a correspondence between managers' ratings of work group skills, in particular skills for effectively managing change, and the work groups' perception of their learning climate, in particular decision autonomy and developmental and collaborative potentials.

Key questions discussed are first, what has been the character of selected interactions so far-synergistic or disruptive? Second, what kinds of interaction mechanisms have been driving the interactions; normative, cognitive, or utilitarian? Third, with regard to cross-scale effects, has significant learning taken place between institutions at different levels? Four sub-cases of interaction are analysed: first, the interaction between the Kyoto Protocol as source and the ETS as target which started after the adoption of the Protocol in late 1997. Second, a next phase of interaction started in 2004 when the EU states started to develop national allocation plans (NAPs) where bringing in credits/allowances developed under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) became one compliance strategy. Third, the opposite relationship is examined, i.e., with the ETS as the source and the Kyoto Protocol institutions as targets. The first phase started after the adoption of the 2003 ET Directive and with the developing ETS possibly leading to a more rapid and extensive CDM development than would otherwise have been the case. Fourth and finally, a separate case of interaction deals with the possible role the ETS plays and could play for an emerging global carbon market. Key findings are that these cases are mainly of a synergistic nature. Furthermore, in order to understand the driving forces, it is necessary to draw upon several interaction mechanisms, particularly cognitive and utilitarian ones. Finally, as to cross-scale learning, the post-2012 global regime may avoid pitfalls related to the allocation process experienced by the ETS. But the learning and diffusion potential should not be exaggerated. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Clean Development Mechanism; Emissions trading; ETS; EU climate policy; Interaction; Kyoto Protocol; National allocation plans","clean development mechanism; climate change; compliance; emissions trading; international law; national planning; synergism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350622430

In this region average annual rainfall has declined since 1960 and this trend is predicted to continue in the coming decades. E. globulus is a premium species for paper manufacture and grows well under moderate seasonal water stress. The traits that underpin this rapid early growth also make the species vulnerable to prolonged water stress. We established nitrogen rate and nitrogen-by-stocking experiments in five 2-year-old E. globulus plantations along a climatic gradient in south-western Australia. We measured volume growth, predawn leaf water potential and leaf area index over 7 years or until the plantations were 9 years old. These data were used to explore the relationship between growth and water stress, to understand the mechanistic basis for the relationship and to identify best-bet management strategies for E. globulus plantations in southern Australia. Nearly all of the variation in volume growth rate between sites could be explained by a combination of climate wetness index and soil depth. There was a significant growth response to nitrogen at two low rainfall and one high rainfall site. There was no growth response to nitrogen on sites where total soil nitrogen in the top 0.1 m of soil was more than 1.9 mg g-1 and a very rapid increase in relative growth response below this threshold. The observed growth response to nitrogen was associated with an increase in water stress and on at least one site increased mortality. Matching the supply of nutrients to demand will maximise the growth at any site but this may increase the risk of drought death at water-limited sites. This will be exacerbated if forecasted changes in the climate of southern Australia are realised. Thinning to 600 stems ha-1 significantly reduced the level of water stress experienced by E. globulus in Western Australia without significantly affecting end of rotation stand volume compared to unthinned stands. These results indicate that for a range of sites in south-western Australia a final stocking density of 600 stems ha-1 coupled with application of fertiliser to maximise growth will minimise risk without sacrificing any of the site potential. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Upland jack pine forests have been identified as possibly the most sensitive ecosystem in the region but despite high emissions of SO2, sulfur (S) deposition is relatively low across much of the region. The response of forest soils at 11 locations that exhibit low estimated weathering rates (&lt;10 mmol c·m-2·yr-1) was simulated for the period 1900-2100 using a dynamic hydrogeochemical model assuming no change or doubling of S deposition. The model predicted minimal impact on soil base saturation (BS), but a decline in soil solution base cation (BC) to aluminum (Al) ratio (BC:Al). The regional effects-based emissions management framework uses modeled changes in these two parameters relative to site-specific chemical thresholds to trigger actions to reduce S emissions. Modeled changes in BS are insufficient to invoke a response. Under base case conditions, modeled BC:Al reaches the chemical threshold at two and three sites within 15 and 30 years, respectively. Under conditions of double S deposition, seven sites are simulated to reach the threshold within 30 years. Nonetheless, the chemical thresholds are stringent relative to critical chemical criteria used elsewhere and the impacts of acidic deposition in the region are anticipated to be limited. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Acidic deposition; Alberta , Canada; Athabasca oil sands; Base cations; Chemical thresholds; Emissions management; Forest soils; Hydrogeochemical model; Industrial activities; Jack pine; Site-specific; Soil acidifications; Soil base saturation; Soil solutions; Two parameter; Weathering rates; Alumina; Aluminum; Oil sands; Soil moisture; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Geologic models; aluminum; cation; nitrogen; oil; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; acid deposition; acidification; atmospheric deposition; coniferous forest; forest soil; hydrogeochemistry; industrial emission; sand; sulfur dioxide; terrain; weathering; article; Canada; chemical model; ecosystem; forest soil; pine; prediction; soil acidification; weathering; Acids; Alberta; Calibration; Computer Simulation; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Geology; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Models, Theoretical; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Sulfur Dioxide; Trees; Water; Weather; Alberta; Canada; North America; Pinus banksiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68049147708

The increase of population, followed by the increase of income per capita has caused a significant increase in the growth of motor vehicles in Indonesia, especially that of motorcycles which is very high. Ahmad Yani street is one of Surabaya City's main entry access roads, of which the traffic burden is the highest. This traffic congestion surely causes high air pollution along the street. Therefore, a study on estimating social cost of air pollution caused by the densely motor vehicle traffic in Ahmad Yani street is considered necessary. The objectives of this study are not only (a) to analyse the peak-hour traffic performance, but also (b) to estimate the cost of air pollution caused by the emmision of motor vehicles in Ahmad Yani street. In this reserach, the methodology of Indonesian Highway Capacity Manual is used to analyse the traffic performance. Due to the inavailabity of Indonesian method, a US method is adopted to estimate the quantity of emission and the cost of air pollution. The cost of air pollution is measured based on the journey length and the average vehicle speed. The result of study shows that traffic congestion is very high in the morning peak hours (07.00-09.00) and is almost evenly happens along the Ahmad Yani street; at some points it even reaches the F level of service. Further result shows that the highest air pollution based on the journey length happens in segment III (GIANT Mall) on Thursday (May, 24th 2007; 07.00-09.00) reaching a cost of Rp. 246,575,690.-. The average vehicle speed is the highest in segment II (DOLOG Office) on Monday (May, 21th 2007; 07.00-09.00) reaching a cost of Rp. 254.431.756,-. In the case of segment II, if it is estimated that the ideal condition is the average speed of 40 kph (max speed allowed inside the city based on traffic law) then the cost of air pollution is Rp. 116.875.678,-, therefore the difference is Rp. 137.556.078,-. This implies that about Rp. 500 billion is needed annually for a one-way traffic. It is recommended that utilizing several measures in traffic management, such as road pricing, traffic divertion and frontage road development is necessary for the reduction of the cost of air pollution.","Social cost of air pollution; Surabaya (Indonesia); Traffic congestion air pollution","Indonesia; Social cost; Social cost of air pollution; Surabaya (Indonesia); Air quality; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Highway engineering; Highway traffic control; Motor transportation; Motors; Pollution; Roads and streets; Speed; Transportation charges; Urban planning; Vehicles; Traffic congestion; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; conference proceeding; emission control; quantitative analysis; social impact; traffic congestion; traffic emission; traffic management; East Java; Indonesia; Surabaya",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73449099275

Stockpiling is an important management practice; however, the effects of this practice on reductions and recovery of soil aggregation and aggregate OC are poorly understood. Objectives of this research were to monitor soil aggregation and aggregate OC in the surface of a short-term stockpile (&lt;3 yr) followed by a second movement of stockpiled soils to a temporary location. Samples were analysed for aggregate size distribution, aggregate fractions, OC, and organic matter turnover using 13C natural abundance. Macroaggregate proportions increased and microaggregate proportions decreased after 3 yr of storage, possibly indicating recovery of soil structure. Following the removal of the stockpile and placement in a temporary pile, macroaggregation decreased and free silt and clay fractions increased relative to initially stockpiled soils. The second disturbance resulted in greater destruction of aggregate structure than the initial disturbance during topsoil salvage. Aggregate organic matter (as indicated by OC) increased significantly between the early sampling of the stockpiled soils (&lt;1 yr in storage) and the placement of the topsoil in a temporary pile in macroaggregates and remained the same for microaggregates. Organic matter not protected within aggregates decreased with storage time as this material was available for utilization by microbes while aggregate protected organic matter (OM) remained unchanged or slightly increased for macro- and microaggregates with stockpile storage time. Aggregate δ13C values did not indicate inclusion of new OM within soil aggregates after 3 yr of topsoil stockpiling. Short-term stockpiling was beneficial for aggregation in the surface layers where plant roots and microbial communities were active; however, subsequent movement of the topsoil resulted in a greater loss of soil aggregation relative to the initial topsoil salvage without impacting soil OC. © 2009 British Society of Soil Science.","Isotope; Mixing model; Particulate organic matter","macroaggregate; organic carbon; particulate organic matter; salvaging; sampling; soil aggregate; soil management; soil organic matter; soil structure; surface layer; topsoil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69249117727

Many studies juxtapose consumer emissions (carbon footprint) and producer (territorial) emissions of greenhouse gases in order to demonstrate the effects of trade on the national emission budget. To this end, a respectable number of studies have been undertaken worldwide in order to estimate emissions embedded in international trade of numerous countries and world regions. Input-output approaches, and increasingly multi-region input-output (MRIO) models, are commonly chosen as they provide an appropriate methodological framework for complete carbon footprint estimates at the national and supra-national level. With increasing processing capabilities of computers and a wider availability of economic accounts, environmental accounts and trade data such models are now being implemented on a wide scale. After a brief overview of salient single-region input-output studies I provide an in-depth review of the most recent multi-region input-output models used for the purpose of consumption-based environmental accounting. The main methodological features and important results are described for around twenty studies covering the years 2007 to 2009. This is followed by a detailed review of studies dealing with uncertainty in MRIO analysis, an area which has not received a lot of attention so far. I conclude that further research is mainly needed in two areas, a) improvements in data availability and quality and b) improvements in the accuracy of MRIO modelling. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To gain a more complete understanding of bacterial carbon cycling in seagrass estuaries, this study focused on the importance of seagrass-derived organic matter to pelagic, seagrass epiphytic, and sediment surface bacteria. Particulate organic matter (POM), seagrass epiphytic, seagrass (Thalassia testudinum) leaf, and sediment surface samples were collected from four Florida Bay locations with historically different organic matter inputs, macrophyte densities, and primary productivities. Bulk (observed and those reported previously) and compound-specific bacterial fatty acid δ13C values were used to determine important carbon sources to the estuary and benthic and pelagic heterotrophic bacteria. The δ13C values of T. testudinum green leaves with epiphytes removed ranged from -9.9 to -6.9‰. Thalassia testudinum δ13C values were significant more enriched in 13C than POM, epiphytic, and sediment samples, which ranged from -16.4 to -13.5, -16.2 to -9.6, and -16.7 to -11.0‰, respectively. Bacterial fatty acid δ13C values (measured for br14:0, 15:0, i15:0, a15:0, br17:0, and 17:0) ranged from -25.5 to -8.2‰. Assuming a -3‰ carbon source fractionation from fatty acid to whole bacteria, pelagic, epiphytic, and sediment bacterial δ13C values were generally more depleted in 13C than T. testudinum δ13C values, more enriched in 13C than reported δ13C values for mangroves, and similar to reported δ13C values for algae. IsoSource mixing model results indicated that organic matter derived from T. testudinum was incorporated by both benthic and pelagic bacterial communities, where 13-67% of bacterial δ13C values could arise from consumption of seagrass-derived organic matter. The IsoSource model, however, failed to discriminate clearly the fraction of algal (0-86%) and mangrove (0-42%) organic matter incorporated by bacterial communities. These results indicate that pelagic, epiphytic, and sediment surface bacteria consumed organic matter from a variety of sources. Bacterial communities incorporated consistently seagrass-derived organic matter, the dominant macrophyte in Florida Bay, but seagrass δ13C values alone could not account fully for bacterial δ13C values. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Wind power is an important low-carbon technology and the most rapidly growing renewable energy technology in the U.S. Despite recent advances in wind deployment, significant state-by-state variation in wind power distribution cannot be explained solely by wind resource patterns nor by state policy. Other factors embedded within the state-level socio-political context also contribute to wind deployment patterns. We explore this sociopolitical context in four U.S. states by integrating multiple research methods.

In mine tailings, the presence of secondary carbonate minerals that trap CO2 can therefore represent substantial fixation of this greenhouse gas. The abilities of three methods of quantitative phase analysis to measure trace nesquehonite (MgCO3·3H2O) in samples of processed kimberlite have been assessed: the method of reference intensity ratios (RIR), the internal standard method, and the Rietveld method with X-ray powder diffraction data. Tests on synthetic mixtures made to resemble processed kimberlite indicate that both the RIR and Rietveld methods can be used accurately to quantify nesquehonite to a lower limit of approximately 0.5 wt.% for conditions used in the laboratory. Below this value, estimates can be made to a limit of approximately 0.1 wt.% using a calibration curve according to the internal standard method. The RIR method becomes increasingly unreliable with decreasing abundance of nesquehonite, primarily as a result of an unpredictable decline in preferred orientation of crystallites. For Rietveld refinements, structureless pattern fitting was used to account for planar disorder in lizardite by considering it as an amorphous phase. Rietveld refinement of data collected from specimens that were serrated to minimize preferred orientation of crystallites gives rise to systematic overestimates of refined abundances for lizardite and underestimates for other phases. The resulting pattern of misestimates may be mistaken for the effect of amorphous and/or nanocrystalline material in samples. This effect is mitigated by collecting data from non-serrated specimens, which typically give relative errors on refined abundances for major and minor phases in the range of 5-20%. However, relative error can increase rapidly for abundances less than 5 wt.%. Nonetheless, absolute errors are sufficiently small that estimates can be made for the amount of CO2 stored in secondary nesquehonite using the RIR method or the Rietveld method for abundances ≥0.5 wt.% and a calibration curve for abundances &lt;0.5 wt.%. The extent to which C is being mineralized in an active mine setting at the Diavik Diamond Mine, Northwest Territories, Canada, has been investigated. Rietveld refinement results and calibrated abundances for trace nesquehonite are used to estimate the amount of CO2 trapped in Diavik tailings.

An alternative approach to environmental accounting is the consumer approach, which includes environmental pressures associated with imports for domestic consumption, wherever these pressures occur. The carbon footprint, for example, is such an approach, in which CO2 or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are considered from a consumer's perspective. The consumer approach may offer new ways for policies to reduce pressures, and therefore it would be interesting to adopt this perspective in national environmental policy-making and international negotiations. To gain insight into the differences between the approaches, this paper discusses the concepts of both, showing the results of an empirical analysis and going into the application of the two different perspectives in (international) environmental policies. Due to international trade, the environmental pressures accounted for in a producer's and a consumer's perspective are usually not the same for a country. This paper presents a worldwide overview, comparing the outcomes for the two approaches with regard to GHG emissions and land use, for 12 world regions. Furthermore, for GHG emissions, a quantitative comparison was made between 87 countries and regions covering the world. Consumption-related GHG emissions and land use per capita were calculated with a full multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model. MRIO analysis is an attractive method for footprint analyses in an international context. The research shows that, for most developed countries, GHG emissions and land use are higher in the consumer approach than in the producer approach. For most developing countries, the opposite is true. Before applying national targets to the consumer approach - for instance, in climate policies - further improvements and standardisation of methodology and data will be necessary. © 2009 The International Input-Output Association.","Environmental accounting; Environmental policy; Footprint analysis; Multi-region input-output analysis; Responsibility","carbon emission; developing world; ecological footprint; emission control; environmental legislation; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; input-output analysis; land use planning; national planning; negotiation process; policy making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949405653

Promising low-temperature activity of an oxygen-activated zeolite, Cu-ZSM-5, has recently been reported in this selective oxidation and the active site in this reaction correlates with an absorption feature at 22,700 cm-1. In the present study, this absorption band is used to selectively resonance enhance Raman vibrations of this active site. 18O2 labeling experiments allow definitive assignment of the observed vibrations and exclude all previously characterized copper-oxygen species for the active site. In combination with DFT and normal coordinate analysis calculations, the oxygen activated Cu core is uniquely defined as a bent mono-(μ-oxo)dicupric site. Spectroscopically validated electronic structure calculations show polarization of the low-lying singly-occupied molecular orbital of the [Cu2O]2+ core, which is directed into the zeolite channel, upon approach of CH4. This induces significant oxyl character into the bridging O atom leading to a low transition state energy consistent with experiment and explains why the bent mono-(μ-oxo)dicupric core is highly activated for H atom abstraction from CH4. The oxygen intermediate of Cu-ZSM-5 is now the most well defined species active in the methane monooxygenase reaction.","Density functional theory; Dicopper(II)-oxo; Oxygen activation; Resonance Raman spectroscopy; Zeolite","copper oxide; hydrogen; methane; methane monooxygenase; methanol; oxygen; zeolite; copper; article; chemical reaction; controlled study; oxidation; polarization; priority journal; catalysis; chemical structure; chemistry; oxidation reduction reaction; spectroscopy; synthesis; Catalysis; Copper; Methane; Methanol; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Spectrum Analysis; Zeolites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73149102529

Some have cautioned against assigning climate a direct role in Cenozoic land mammal faunal changes. We illustrate 3 episodes of significant mammalian reorganization in the Eocene of North America that are considered direct responses to dramatic climatic events. The first episode occurred during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), beginning the Eocene (55.8 Ma), and earliest Wasatchian North American Land Mammal Age (NALMA). The PETM documents a short (<170 k.y.) global temperature increase of ≈5°C and a substantial increase in first appearances of mammals traced to climate-induced immigration. A 4-m.y. period of climatic and evolutionary stasis then ensued. The second climate episode, the late early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO, 53-50 Ma), is marked by a temperature increase to the highest prolonged Cenozoic ocean temperature and a similarly distinctive continental interior mean annual temperature (MAT) of 23°C. This MAT increase [and of mean annual precipitation (MAP) to 150 cm/y) promoted a major increase in floral diversity and habitat complexity under temporally unique, moist, paratropical conditions. Subsequent climatic deterioration in a third interval, from 50 to 47 Ma, resulted in major faunal diversity loss at both continental and local scales. In this Bridgerian Crash, relative abundance shifted from very diverse, evenly represented, communities to those dominated by the condylarth Hyopsodus. Rather than being ""optimum,"" the EECO began the greatest episode of faunal turnover of the first 15 m.y. of the Cenozoic.","Bridgerian Crash; Climate change; EECO; Faunal change; Mammal faunas","article; Cenozoic; climate change; environmental temperature; Eocene; fauna; habitat; high temperature; immigration; moisture; nonhuman; North America; Paleocene; priority journal; seasonal population dynamics; species diversity; tropic climate; Animal Migration; Animals; Biodiversity; Climate; Mammals; North America; Rain; Temperature; Time Factors; Animalia; Hyopsodus; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69449094618

In this review we evaluate the potential contribution of four biological approaches to mitigating global environment change: reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations through soil carbon sequestration and afforestation; reducing predicted increases in global surface temperatures through increasing the albedo of crop plants; and fertilizing the oceans to increase primary productivity and CO2 drawdown. We conclude that none of these biological approaches are 'magic bullets' capable of reversing environmental changes brought about by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. However, it is possible that increasing crop albedo and soil carbon sequestration might contribute towards mitigation on a regional scale. In the absence of legally binding international agreements to reduce CO2 emissions, we propose that: increased efforts are made to identify novel biological mitigatory strategies; further research is conducted to minimise the uncertainties present in all four of the biological approaches described; and pilot-level field work is conducted to examine the feasibility of the most promising strategies. Finally, it is essential to engage with the public concerning strategies for mitigating the effects of climate change because the majority of the biological approaches have effects, quite possibly of a negative nature, on ecosystem services and land usage. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, there are now voluntary and regulated carbon trading schemes operational throughout Europe that mean stored carbon, if verified, could have an economic and tradeable value. This means that new income streams could become available for upland management. The 'Sustainable Uplands' RELU project has developed a model for calculating carbon fluxes from peat soils that covers all carbon uptake and release pathways (e.g. fluvial and gaseous pathways). The model has been developed so that the impact of common management options within UK upland peats can be considered. The model was run for a decade from 1997-2006 and applied to an area of 550 km2 of upland peat soils in the Peak District. The study estimates that the region is presently a net sink of - 62 ktonnes CO2 equivalent at an average export of - 136 tonnes CO2 equivalent/km2/yr. If management interventions were targeted across the area the total sink could increase to - 160 ktonnes CO2/yr at an average export of - 219 tonnes CO2 equivalent/km2/yr. However, not all interventions resulted in a benefit; some resulted in increased losses of CO2 equivalents. Given present costs of peatland restoration and value of carbon offsets, the study suggests that 51% of those areas, where a carbon benefit was estimated by modelling for targeted action of management interventions, would show a profit from carbon offsetting within 30 years. However, this percentage is very dependent upon the price of carbon used. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The differences are mainly reflected on the types of organic matter and the reduction alteration scale. These differences are the main reason to cause apparent epigenetic alteration types and intensity of uranium mineralization. It is concluded that the reduction of coal bed methane dissipation from the Neopaleozoic is the main feature of Dongsheng deposit, which leads to the abroad development of green-color alteration and bleaching phenomenon. The reduction of bacteria is the main feature of Yili deposit, which leads to a small range of weaker fading alteration and much more framboidal spherules pyrited mineralization. The organic acid from dispersed coal particles in stratum is the main feature of Turpan-Hami basin deposit, which is the main reductant of the uranium deposit. According to the above-mentioned characteristics, we think that the types, characteristics, and the scale of reductant are the important factors in determining the types of uranium deposits and the differences between the scales. This recognition has an important theoretical and practical significance to research genetic types of uranium deposits and their exploration methods.","Bleaching sandstone; Dongsheng uranium deposit; Green-color alteration; Isotope; Pyritization; Reduction alteration; Sandstone-type uranium deposit","Bearing strata; Carbon isotopes; Coal bed methane; Coal particles; Dongsheng uranium deposit; Epigenetic alterations; Exploration methods; Genetic type; Geological significance; Green-color alteration; Ordos Basin; Organic matter; Oxygen isotopes; Pyritization; Reductants; Sulfur isotope; Turpan-Hami basin; Uranium mineralization; Bleaching; Cleaning; Coal deposits; Color; Deposits; Gas bearings; Isotopes; Methane; Mineralogy; Organic acids; Oxygen; Sandstone; Sulfur; Transuranium elements; Uranium; Uranium deposits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73449093516

Results showed that the crane nests only in wetland environments, including lake, swamp and river microhabitats. However, the bird showed different selection patterns in these microhabitats. According to the Ivelev selectivity index (S.I.), cranes preferred lakes and avoided swampy areas, while they used river areas in proportion to their availability. Factors associated with the selection of nest sites included water body size, distance to water, water depth and the level of nest concealment. Nest size was a function of the microhabitat used for nesting; nests were largest in lakes, and similarly-sized in swamp and river habitats. A certain water depth was a prerequisite for nest site selection (mean = 31.1 cm), but no differences were found among different microhabitats. Compared with nests found in Qinghai, Tibet, and Ladakh, nests in Ruoergai Wetland were smaller, but water depth near nesting sites was higher (mean = 31.1 cm vs 18.2 cm). Different plant communities, climate and disturbance are likely to be related to these differences. Conservation efforts should focus on the protection of existing lakes, minimizing disturbance impacts and maintaining small patches (i.e. 100 m2 water bodies) of swamp areas as important buffer zones. In the future, restoration of wetlands to decrease fragmentation, and reduction of habitat degradation are advocated for effective conservation of this species. © BirdLife International 2009.",,"bird; breeding site; environmental degradation; habitat fragmentation; habitat restoration; microhabitat; nest site; nesting; site selection; species conservation; water depth; wetland; China; Ruoergai Plateau; Aves; Gruidae; Grus nigricollis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74149085449

The type I group of the proteobacterial methanotrophs are generally favored at low CH4 concentration and high O2 availability, while the type II group lives better under high CH4 and limiting O2 conditions. Such physiological differences are possibly reflected in their ecological preferences. In the present study, methanotrophic compositions were compared between rice-planted soil and non-planted soil and between the rhizosphere and rice roots by using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) genes. In addition, the effects of rice variety and nitrogen fertilizer were evaluated. The results showed that the terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs), which were characteristic for type I methanotrophs, substantially increased in the rhizosphere and on the roots compared with non-planted soils. Furthermore, the relative abundances of the type I methanotroph T-RFs were greater on roots than in the rhizosphere. Of type I methanotrophs, the 79 bp T-RF, which was characteristic for an unknown group or Methylococcus/Methylocaldum, markedly increased in field samples, while the 437 bp, which possibly represented Methylomonas, dominated in microcosm samples. These results suggested that type I methanotrophs were enriched or selected for by rice roots compared to type II methanotrophs. However, the members of type I methanotrophs are dynamic and sensitive to environmental change. Rice planting appeared to increase the copy number of pmoA genes relative to the non-planted soils. However, neither the rice variety nor the N fertilizer significantly influenced the dynamics of the methanotrophic community. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

For a given land use pattern in a region, a built-in regional ecosystem model (TESim) simulates leaf physiology of plants, carbon and nitrogen dynamics, and hydrological processes including runoff generation and run-on re-absorption, as well as runoff-induced soil erosion and carbon and nitrogen loss from ecosystems. The simulation results for a certain period from 1976 to 1999 were then used to support land use decisions and to assess the impacts of land use changes on environment. In the coupling model, the land use type for a land unit was determined by optimization of a weighted suitability derived from expert knowledge about the ecosystem state and site conditions. The model was applied to the temperate crop-pasture band in northern China (CCPB) to analyze the interactions between land use and major ecosystem processes and functions and to indicate the added value of the feedbacks by comparing simulations with and without the coupling and feedbacks between land use module and ecosystem processes. The results indicated that the current land use in CCPB is neither economical nor ecologically judicious. The scenario with feedbacks increased NPP by 46.78 g C m-2 a-1, or 32.23% of the scenario without feedbacks, also decreased soil erosion by 0.65 kg m-2 a-1, or 23.13%.

In the U.S, soils have the potential to offset about 10 percent of annual CO2 emissions; however, if carbon credits are to be included in greenhouse gas control programs, soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rates associated with agricultural land uses must be computed at a watershed scale. The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) water quality model, the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) erosion model, and the CENTURY 4.0 a soil carbon model were used to simulate carbon sequestration rates for 160 crop-tillage rotations in 272 sub-basins of the Big Creek watershed (∼12,300 hectares). Under annual crops, only no-till in a corn-soybean rotation, on low to moderate slopes results in net gains in SOC. Substantial annual rates of SOC sequestration occur only under perennial crops such as Conservation Reserve Program (CRP; 0.14 t/ha without erosion; 0.08 with erosion), pasture (0.67 t/ha without erosion; 0.58 with erosion), hay (0.88 t/ha without erosion; 0.52 with erosion), and forest (2.66 t/ha without erosion; 2.49 with erosion). Erosion thus has a large effect on the spatial distribution of field-measured SOC by moving it down slope and increasing its spatial variability. Because of this, carbon credit programs should be based on field practices, thus targeting the locations where the sequestration of atmospheric carbon actually occurs and minimizing monitoring costs. Developing model-based estimates of SOC sequestration rates of field practices at many locations would thus greatly serve the needs of carbon crediting programs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

By taking advantage of the ordered starburst pores of MMSS, we can provide a simple strategy for fabricating synthetic opals consisting of homogeneous individual building blocks in which fluorescent guests are uniformly and stably impregnated. In this study, tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum(III) (Alq3) and Rhodamine B (Rh B) are selected as the fluorescent guests. The former has a wider emission band than the reflection spectrum of MMSS synthetic opals, whereas the emission band of the latter is considerably narrower than the reflection spectrum of the opals. The spontaneous emissions of these functionalized synthetic opals are clearly influenced by the stop band governed by the Bragg equation. In the case of the Alq3-MMSS conjugate, the shape of the Alq3 emission spectrum varies in accordance with the shift in the stop band. The emission of the Rh B-MMSS conjugate is noticeably narrowed, and its intensity is enhanced when the excitation intensity is increased. These results are well explained by an inhibition of spontaneous emission caused by a reduction in the density of optical states within the stop band. The results of this study indicate that MMSS synthetic opals are promising for use in novel optical applications in which the spontaneous emission can be manipulated. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Bragg equation; Building blockes; Emission bands; Emission spectrums; Excitation intensity; Functionalized; Light emitting materials; Mesoporous; Mesoporous silica spheres; Mono-dispersed; Optical applications; Optical state; Reflection spectra; Rhodamine B; Starbursts; Stop-bands; Synthetic opals; Emission spectroscopy; Fluorescence; Mesoporous materials; Rhodium; Silica; Spontaneous emission; Silicate minerals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71949099150

As a proactive adaptation measure, cities can stock their urban forests with tree species that will perform well in predicted future climates. This article presents a method for assessing the suitability of urban tree species for predicted future climates through a case study in Philadelphia. Changes of the optimal distribution ranges of major tree species planted in Philadelphia were evaluated by comparing the climate envelopes of those species with the predicted climate in the midcentury. Influences of climate change on major tree disease and pests in Philadelphia were also assessed by inspecting the potential effects of climate change on the biology of pathogens and pests. The results indicate that the future climate in Philadelphia will become less optimal for 10 tree species, while two species will thrive. Major pests and diseases in Philadelphia will generally become more problematic but occurrences of several diseases and pests may decline. It was suggested that the optimal distribution ranges of trees and their maintenance needs must be considered at the same time when selecting tree species for urban greening projects. Overall, the predicted climate change in Philadelphia will likely increase the choices of tree species for the city. © 2009 by the Society of American Foresters.","Climate envelopes; Climate projections; Core distribution range; Maintenance needs","Climate envelopes; Climate projections; Core distribution range; Future climate; Optimal distributions; Philadelphia; Potential effects; Rapid climate change; Significant impacts; Tree species; Urban forests; Urban greening; Urban trees; Agriculture; Biology; Maintenance; Optimization; Research; Climate change; assessment method; climate change; climate effect; forest management; geographical distribution; prediction; tree; urban forestry; North America; Pennsylvania; Philadelphia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350350278

However, not all of these policies have effects or positive impacts. For example, it has been quite a few years since the national government made policies to encourage coalmine methane power to be sold to the grid. Practice showed that not any kilowatt of electricity was sold from a coalmine methane power plant to the grid in Sichuan and Guizhou Provinces as of December 2008.

This paper deals with a parametric study of geometric effect on the daylighting performance of two typical types of atriums, enclosed and linear, in the subtropical climatic area. A case study of the daylighting of two existing atrium buildings is presented. The software, RADIANCE, is employed to simulate daylighting performance. The simulation results are compared with the field measurement and a 1:100 model atrium to validate the RADIANCE simulation. In the study of the geometric effects on daylighting performance in atriums, three combined geometric parameters, plane aspect ratio (PAR = W/L), section aspect ratio (SAR = H/L) and well index [WI = H(W + L)/2WL], are introduced to determine a proper design geometry. The relationships between the daylight factor (DF is defined as the ratio of the illuminance at a particular point within an enclosure to the simultaneous unobstructed outdoor illuminance under same overcast sky component) and these geometric factors are analysed for the two types of atriums. The results show that, for the enclosed atrium, the DF has an approximately linear relationship with either SAR or WI, while the DF of the linear atrium has an approximately linear correlation with the PAR. The recommended geometric factor may be WI = 1.5 for the enclosed atrium and PAR = 0.5 for the linear atrium if the comfortable DF is required.

The gas was identified as typical biogenic gas with geochemical characteristics of depleted methane carbon isotope ratios and low abundance of heavy hydrocarbon gas components. The generation of methane is mainly related to the CO2 reduction pathway. The existence of C5-C8 hydrocarbons in gas samples and enriched carbon isotope values of ethane and propane in a few gas samples indicate that natural gas in this region may contain some thermogenic gas. It can be concluded that favorable source rock and conservation conditions exist for the formation of biogenic gas and its accumulation in reservoirs.

A series of cyclopentadienyl and pentamethylcyclopentadienyl cobalt(III) η 5-pentadienyl complexes have been prepared, incorporating alkyl and aryl substituents at various positions on the pentadienyl ligand. The crystalline complexes have been completely characterized spectroscopically and, in the solid state, by X-ray crystallography. The alkyl-substituted pentadienyl complexes can be prepared by a range of methodologies, most generally by acid-promoted dehydration of in situ-derived η 2- or η 4-dienol complexes. Two variations on this classic strategy have been developed, starting from either conjugated (1,3-) or nonconjugated (1,4-) dienyl alcohols. For both cyclopentadienyl and pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ancillary ligands, the substituted η 5-pentadienyl complexes are obtained in reasonable to good isolated yields, limited by the extent of substitution on the starting allylic alcohol. The cationic cobalt(III) η 5 -pentadienyl complexes are indefinitely stable to air and moisture; isolation and purification is accomplished by chromatography on the bench. The substitutional lability of the pentadienyl ligand has been investigated using both neutral and anionic donor ligands (CO, isonitrile, acetonitrile, and halide salts). The results reveal that η 5-pentadienyl complexes react by equilibrium dissociation of the most substituted end of the pentadienyl moiety, providing the corresponding η 3-coordinated pentadienyl adducts. A comparative study of 11 X-ray crystal structures covering a range of pentadienyl substitution patterns is also reported, revealing long Co-Cl and Co-C5 bonds and, consistently, short Co-C3 bond lengths. The internal bond angles of substituent-bearing carbon atoms are smaller than those observed at unsubstituted carbons, with the compression as much as 10° at the substituted center. As expected, alkyl substituents invariably deviate out of the pentadienyl plane, toward the metal. In unbiased cases, greater deviations are noted for Cl substituents than for C2 substituents, although the deviations at C2 increase significantly for 1,2-disubstituted ligands. In some cases, the carbon-carbon bond distances display distortions toward η 2, η 3- or η 1,η 4-hapticity, although no particular correlation between structural distortion and solution reactivity is evident. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Alkyl substituent; Allylic alcohol; Ancillary ligands; Aryl substituents; Carbon atoms; Carbon-carbon bond; Comparative studies; Crystalline complexes; Cycloaddition reaction; Cyclopentadienyls; Di-enol; Donor ligands; Equilibrium dissociation; Half-sandwich; Halide salts; Hapticities; In-situ; Internal bonds; Isolated yield; Isolation and purification; Isonitriles; Nonconjugated; Pentadienyl; Pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; Structural distortions; Substitution patterns; X ray crystal structures; Acetonitrile; Acetylene; Air cleaners; Alkylation; Chromatographic analysis; Cobalt; Complexation; Crystal structure; Cycloaddition; Dyes; Ligands; Metal refining; Organic polymers; Substitution reactions; X ray crystallography; Cobalt compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71949085034

In recent years, global warming and changes in climates depending on the increase in the green house gases have been affecting the whole world. The solution seeking, initiated in the international arena with various treaties and processes, has shown itself around the world and in our country as the concept of planning and operation of the forest sources. During the recent ten years in Turkey, in forest management plans, the capacity of carbon storage and the amount of oxygen production by the forest were initiated to be calculated in the planning unit scale. The first forest management plans were prepared and put into force in 1972 in Turkey, where the planned forestry began in 1963. During the period of more than 30 years, neither the structural changes in forests nor their values regarding other functions have been examined enough. In this article, using Balci Forest Management Units in Borçka Township of Artvin, forests are studied regarding their growing stocks, timber increments, their capacities of carbon storage and oxygen production. The basic management unit scale in the study is standard and the evident standard parameters are tree species, mixture and age class. Balci Management Unit underwent attacks from bark beetles in the past. After the mechanical struggle, there have been structural changes in forest ecosystem and the potentials of forests have varied both in quality and quantity. Changes in forest ecosystems during that time, not only through natural ways but also through human activities, have been shaping the oncoming forestry practices. © 2009 Academic Journals.","Carbon storage; Forest management; Geographic information systems; Land cover change; Oxygen production","carbon; oxygen; adult; article; biomass; carbon storage; case report; forest management; forest structure; geographic distribution; human; nonhuman; planning; tree; Turkey (republic); Scolytinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350433932

Because incineration is the main method of waste management in Japan, reducing the amount of dioxins emitted from waste incinerators is an essential aspect of proper waste treatment. Intensive measures to prevent the formation of dioxins at the source have been implemented, with a focus on waste treatment methods and improving comprehensive management. The efforts have been very successful, with a 95% reduction in the amount of dioxins emitted between 1997 and 2003. The toxicity of PCBs has been monitored with keen interest since the Yusho incident. Unfortunately, treatment facilities for PCB wastes were not built until long after PCBs had been removed from use, and PCB wastes remained in storage in an untreated state. The Japanese government has promoted the construction of facilities for treating PCB wastes, and five such facilities have commenced operations. To more completely eradicate dioxins, a future challenge will be to reduce the amount of PCB-derived dioxins, which are persistent in the environment and have a long exposure pathway from the environment media to the organism and the human body. © Springer 2009.","Control technology; Dioxins; Incineration; PCBs; Waste management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76449102148

Studying the spectral changes during the dips exhibited by almost edge-on, low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) is a powerful means of probing the structure of accretion disks. The XMM-Newton, Chandra, or Suzaku discovery of absorption lines from Fe XXV and other highly-ionized species in many dippers has revealed a highly-ionized atmosphere above the disk. A highly (but less strongly) ionized plasma is also present in the vertical structure causing the dips, together with neutral material. Aims. We aim to investigate the spectral changes during the dips of XTE J1710-281, a still poorly studied LMXB known to exhibit bursts, dips, and eclipses. Methods. We analyze the archived XMM-Newton observation of XTE J1710-281 performed in 2004 that covered one orbital period of the system (3.8 h). We modeled the spectral changes between persistent and dips in the framework of the partial covering model and the ionized absorber approach. Results. The persistent spectrum can be fit by a power law with a photon index of 1.94 ± 0.02 affected by absorption from cool material with a hydrogen column density of (0.401 ± 0.007) X 1022 cm-2. The spectral changes from persistent to deep-dipping intervals are consistent with the partial covering of the power-law emission. Twenty-six percent of the continuum is covered during shallow dipping, and 78% during deep dipping. The column density decreases from 77+67-38 X 1022 cm-2 during shallow dipping to (14 ± 2) X 1022 cm-2 during the deep-dipping interval. We do not detect any absorption line from highly ionized species such as Fe XXV. However, the upper-limits we derive on their equivalent width (EW) are not constraining. Despite not detecting any narrow spectral signatures of a warm absorber, we show that the spectral changes are consistent with an increase in column density and a decrease in ionization state of a highly-ionized absorber, associated with an increase in column density of a neutral absorber, in agreement with the recent results found in other dippers. In XTE J 1710-281, the column density of the ionized absorber increases from 4.3+0.4-0.5 x 10 22 cm-2 during shallow dipping to 11.6+0.4 -0.6 x 1022 cm-2 during deep dipping, while the ionization parameter decreases from. 102.52 to 102.29 erg s-1 cm. The parameters of the ionized absorber are not constrained during persistent emission. The neutral absorber only slightly increases from (0.410 ± 0.007) x 1022 cm-2 during persistent emission to (0.420 ± 0.009) X 1022 cm-2 during shallow dipping and to (0.45 ± 0.03) x 1022 cm-2 during deep dipping. The warm absorber model better accounts for the ∼1 keV depression visible in the pn dipping spectra, and naturally explains it as a blend of lines and edges unresolved by pn. A deeper observation of XTE J1710-281 would enable this interpretation to be confirmed. © ESO 2009.","Accretion; Accretion disks; Stars: Individual; X-rays: General; XTE J1710-281","Accretion; Accretion disks; Stars: Individual; X-rays: General; XTE J1710-281; Absorption; Disks (machine components); Disks (structural components); Hydrogen; Ionization; Power spectrum; Stars; Absorption spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68649123135

Hydrogen is a key solar fuel because it can be used directly in combustion engines or fuel cells, or combined catalytically with CO2 to make carbon containing fuels. Different approaches to solar water splitting include semiconductor particles as photocatalysts and photoelectrodes, molecular donor-acceptor systems linked to catalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution, and photovoltaic cells coupled directly or indirectly to electrocatalysts. Despite several decades of research, solar hydrogen generation is efficient only in systems that use expensive photovoltaic cells to power water electrolysis. Direct photocatalytic water splitting is a challenging problem because the reaction is thermodynamically uphill. Light absorption results in the formation of energetic charge-separated states in both molecular donor-acceptor systems and semiconductor particles. Unfortunately, energetically favorable charge recombination reactions tend to be much faster than the slow multielectron processes of water oxidation and reduction. Consequently, visible light water splitting has only recently been achieved in semiconductor-based photocatalytic systems and remains an inefficient process. This Account describes our approach to two problems in solar water splitting: the organization of molecules into assemblies that promote long-lived charge separation, and catalysis of the electrolysis reactions, in particular the four-electron oxidation of water. The building blocks of our artificial photosynthetic systems are wide band gap semiconductor particles, photosensitizer and electron relay molecules, and nanoparticle catalysts. We intercalate layered metal oxide semiconductors with metal nanoparticles. These intercalation compounds, when sensitized with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ derivatives, catalyze the photoproduction of hydrogen from sacrificial electron donors (EDTA2-) or non-sacrificial donors (I-). Through exfoliation of layered metal oxide semiconductors, we construct multilayer electron donor-acceptor thin films or sensitized colloids in which individual nanosheets mediate light-driven electron transfer reactions. When sensitizer molecules are ""wired"" to IrO 2 nH2Onanoparticles, a dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode becomes the photoanode of a water-splitting photoelectrochemical cell. Although this system is an interesting proof-of-concept, the performance of these cells is still poor (∼1% quantum yield) and the dye photodegrades rapidly. We can understand the quantum efficiency and degradation in terms of competing kinetic pathways for water oxidation, back electron transfer, and decomposition of the oxidized dye molecules. Laser flash photolysis experiments allow us to measure these competing rates and, in principle, to improve the performance of the cell by changing the architecture of the electron transfer chain. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72949117426

The main mechanisms were considered to be the substrate competition and the toxic effect of denitrification intermediates on the methanogenesis. However, it is unclear whether these inhibitory effects are reflected in the structure and dynamics of methanogenic community in the soil. In the present study, the response of methanogenic archaeal community to nitrate addition was determined using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms in combination with cloning and sequencing of archaeal 16S rRNA genes. When nitrate was added at the beginning of an anoxic incubation of rice field soil, denitrification occurred rapidly and the denitrification intermediates were detected only for a short time. Total production of CH4 was reduced, but no obvious effect on the structure of methanogenic community was observed. In contrast, when nitrate was added 20 days after the anoxic incubation, the denitrification intermediates obviously accumulated. CH4 production was completely suppressed for 7 and 16 days from treatments of 5 and 10 mM nitrate respectively. The dynamics of methanogenic community also diverged greatly from the control. While the hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased and the acetoclastic methanogens decreased with the incubation in the control soil, the structure and abundance of the methanogenic community remained unchanged after the addition of nitrate. Methanogenesis resumed when the denitrification intermediates were depleted in soil. The analysis of carbon isotopic signals revealed that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis recovered faster than acetoclastic methanogenesis. Our study suggests that the accumulation of denitrification intermediates has a strong inhibitory effect on the activity but not the structure of methanogenic community. © 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Archaea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649715235

A climate bill that places a charge on carbon-based greenhouse gas emissions would drive up fossil fuel energy prices, with most of the increase being passed along to energy users. A recent study has revealed that U.S. trade-sensitive, energy-intensive manufacturers could experience substantial cost pressures from energy prices driven upward by a climate policy. The manufacturers are major consumer of energy and emitter of greenhouse gases. The HRS-MI study has showed that allocating allowances to offset higher energy prices under a climate policy would substantially mitigate the economic effects on energy-intensive industries at least through 2025. It will require strong policies that provide necessary supports and incentives for energy-intensive manufacturers to shed their reliance on carbon fuel, while retaining competitiveness.",,"Carbon fuels; Carbon-based; Climate policy; Cost pressures; Economic activities; Economic effect; Energy intensive industries; Energy prices; Energy users; Fossil fuel energy; Competition; Costs; Economics; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Leakage (fluid); Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350475517

This study evaluates wind energy resources in Taiwan with the aid of a geographic information system (GIS), which allows local potentials and restrictions such as climate conditions, land uses, and ecological environments to be considered. The findings unveiled in this study suggest a significant role for offshore wind energy resources, which may constitute between 94% and 98% of overall wind resources in Taiwan. Total power yield from wind energy could reach between 150 and 165 TWh, which would have, respectively, accounted for between 62% and 68% of Taiwan's total power generation of 243 TWh in 2007. Based on the Taiwan's current emission factor of electricity, wind energy has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by between 94 and 102 million ton per year in Taiwan, which is, respectively, equivalent to 28% and 31% of the national net equivalent CO2 emissions released in 2002. However, the challenge of managing the variability of wind power has to be addressed before the considerable contribution of wind energy to domestic energy supply and CO2 reduction can be realized. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Various applications, such as thermo-chemical cycles for hydrogen production, chemical processes comprising endothermic reactions, steam generators and metallurgical processes, can benefit from such heat pumps as ""green"" sources of high temperature heat. The environmental benefit occurs from avoiding fossil fuel heating and therefore reducing carbon dioxide and other pollutant emissions. Through heat pumps, a low-grade heat source from nuclear reactors, industrial waste, geothermal, etc. can be upgraded to high temperatures through a work-to-heat conversion. The work itself can originate from any source of renewable energy (wind, hydro, biomass, solar, etc.). In this paper, available thermo-physical parameters of the selected fluids are presented and appropriate equations of state are constructed to allow a heat pump thermodynamic analysis. Among these working fluids, only biphenyl, naphthalene, titanium tetrabromide and titanium tetraiodide have promising potential. For these fluids, a further parametric study is conducted to investigate the COP for a range of relevant operating conditions, in terms of temperature and pressure. The range of COP values is large, ranging from 1.9 to 7.3, depending on the fluid and temperature levels; the highest COP is obtained with TiI4. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Background The obesity epidemic is widely documented. Worksite initiatives have been advocated. Nurses represent an important part of the hospital workforce and serve as role models when caring for patients. Methods A sample of 194 nurses from six hospitals participated in anthropometric measurements and self-administered surveys. Results The majority of nurses were overweight and obese, and some were not actively involved in weight management behaviours. Self-reported health, diet and physical activity behaviours were low, although variable by gender, age and shift. Reports of co-worker norms supported low levels of healthy behaviours. Conclusions Findings reinforce the need to address the hospital environment and culture as well as individual behaviours for obesity control. Implications for nursing management Nurse managers have an opportunity to consider interventions that promote a climate favourable to improved health habits by facilitating and supporting healthy lifestyle choices (nutrition and physical activity) and environmental changes. Such efforts have the potential to increase productivity and morale and decrease work-related disabilities and improve quality of life. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Body mass index; Hospital environment; Hospital nurses; Job satisfaction; Nutrition; Physical activity","adult; article; body mass; diet; exercise; feeding behavior; female; health behavior; health promotion; health status; human; job satisfaction; lifestyle; male; middle aged; motor activity; nursing staff; nutritional status; obesity; occupational health; social environment; United States; Adult; Body Mass Index; Diet; Exercise; Female; Food Habits; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Health Status; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Life Style; Male; Massachusetts; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Nutritional Status; Obesity; Occupational Health; Social Environment; Adult; Body Mass Index; Diet; Exercise; Female; Food Habits; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Health Status; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Life Style; Male; Massachusetts; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Nutritional Status; Obesity; Occupational Health; Social Environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349485718

To examine the effects of elevated CO2 on the preference of Japanese beetle (JB; Popillia japonica) for leaves of different ages within the plant, soybeans were grown at the SoyFACE facility at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. When given a choice, JB consistently inflicted greater levels of damage on older leaves than on younger leaves, and there was a trend for a greater preference for young leaves grown under elevated CO2 compared to those grown under ambient CO2. More heavily damaged older leaves and those grown under elevated CO2 had reduced CystPI activity, and JB that consumed leaves with lower CystPI activity had correspondingly greater gut proteinase activity. Younger leaves with higher CystPI activity and photosynthetic rates may contribute disproportionately to plant fitness and are more protected against herbivore attack than older foliage. Cysteine proteinase inhibitors are potent defenses against JB, and the effectiveness of this defense is modulated by growth under elevated CO2 as well as leaf position. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Free-air CO2 enrichment; Global change; Optimal defense theory; Plant defenses; Plant-insect interactions; Within-plant movement","carbon dioxide; cyclopentane derivative; cysteine proteinase inhibitor; ethylene; ethylene derivative; jasmonic acid; oxylipin; age; beetle; carbon dioxide; climate change; enzyme activity; foliage; food preference; gene expression; global climate; herbivore; host preference; inhibitor; photosynthesis; plant defense; plant-herbivore interaction; soybean; analysis of variance; animal; article; atmosphere; beetle; chemistry; decision making; drug effect; gene expression regulation; metabolism; parasitology; physiology; plant leaf; soybean; United States; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Atmosphere; Beetles; Carbon Dioxide; Choice Behavior; Cyclopentanes; Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors; Ethylenes; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Illinois; Oxylipins; Plant Leaves; Soybeans; Champaign County [Illinois]; Illinois; North America; United States; Urbana; Coleoptera; Glycine max; Hexapoda; Popillia japonica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649382018

Among various mechanisms, CO2 can be trapped in saline aquifers by dissolution in the formation water. Vaporization of water occurs along with the dissolution of CO2. Vaporization can cause salt precipitation, which reduces porosity and impairs permeability of the reservoir in the vicinity of the wellbore, and can lead to reduction in injectivity. The amount of salt precipitation and the region in which it occurs may be important in CO2 storage operations if salt precipitation significantly reduces injectivity. Here we develop an analytical model, as a simple and efficient tool to predict the amount of salt precipitation over time and space. This model is particularly useful at high injection velocities, when viscous forces dominate. First, we develop a model which treats the vaporization of water and dissolution of CO2 in radial geometry. Next, the model is used to predict salt precipitation. The combined model is then extended to evaluate the effect of salt precipitation on permeability in terms of a time-dependent skin factor. Finally, the analytical model is corroborated by application to a specific problem with an available numerical solution, where a close agreement between the solutions is observed. We use the results to examine the effect of assumptions and approximations made in the development of the analytical solution. For cases studied, salt saturation was a few percent. The loss in injectivity depends on the degree of reduction of formation permeability with increased salt saturation. For permeability-reduction models considered in this work, the loss in injectivity was not severe. However, one limitation of the model is that it neglects capillary and gravity forces, and these forces might increase salt precipitation at the bottom of formation particularly when injection rate is low. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, over Beijing, China, where air quality measures were taken later, solar brightening was delayed. It is shown that until the early 1990s, UV-A irradiances over Thessaloniki show a downward trend of -0.5% yr-1, which reverses sign and becomes positive in the last decade (+0.8% yr-1). This brightening is related to a decreasing trend in local aerosol amounts. Both the negative rate of change (dimming) and the positive rate of change (brightening) are amplified in the UV-A solar irradiances, compared with the total solar irradiance, by a factor of 2.6. Satellite derived short-wave radiation over Beijing showed negative changes of -0.4% (1984-1991) and -0.1% yr-1 during 1994-2006. The negative trend in solar radiation continued even during 2000-2006.

Results showed that the bio-drying would result in the increase of the HCl and SO2 emissions and potential for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) formation, but the decrease of NOx emissions in the combustion. The potential emissions of combustion gases were correlated with organics degradation (correlation coefficient, r = 0.67 for HCl, r = 0.96 for SO2, r = 0.91 for PCDD/Fs and r = -0.60 for NOx). Interestingly, the total emissions of combustion gases based on input waste could be minimized by bio-drying. The bio-drying caused a reduction of NOx emissions but a negligible variation of total emissions of HCl and SO2 as well as the potential for total PCDD/Fs formation. Moreover, the bio-drying could significantly improve the ratio of gas emissions to low heating values. The mixed waste after bio-drying was more favorable for combustion and the combined process with insufficient aeration during the hydrolytic stage was proposed for the bio-drying operation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

First, we sought to identify the promoter of CBR3. Next, we examined whether two CBR3 promoter polymorphisms (CBR3 -725T&gt;C and CBR3 -326T&gt;A) dictate promoter activity and hepatic CBR3 mRNA levels. Methods: The promoter activities of CBR3 reporter constructs were investigated in HepG2 and MCF-7 cells. CBR3 mRNA levels were documented in 95 liver samples from white (n∈=∈62) and black (n∈=∈33) donors. Genotype-phenotype correlation analyses were used to determine the impact of the CBR3 -725T&gt;C and CBR3 -326T&gt;A polymorphisms on hepatic CBR3 mRNA levels. Results: We identified the promoter of human CBR3. Liver samples from black donors showed higher relative CBR3 mRNA levels than samples from whites (CBR3 mRNAblacks∈=∈3. 0∈±∈3.1 relative fold vs. CBR3 mRNAwhites∈= ∈1.6∈±∈1.5 relative fold, p∈=∈0.021). The variant -725C and -326A alleles did not modify the gene reporter activities of engineered CBR3 promoter constructs. In line, hepatic CBR3 mRNA levels were not associated with CBR3 -725T&gt;C and CBR3 -326T&gt;A genotype status.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the site-specific impacts of climate change on soil erosion and surface hydrology at the Changwu station of Shaanxi, China using a new spatiotemporal downscaling method. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model and climate change scenarios projected by the U.K. Hadley Centre's GCM (HadCM3) under the A2, B2, and GGa emissions scenarios were used in this study. The monthly precipitation and temperature projections were downloaded for the periods of 1900-1999 and 2010-2039 for the grid box containing the Changwu station. Univariate transfer functions were derived by matching probability distributions between station-measured and GCM-projected monthly precipitation and temperature for the 1950-1999 period. The derived functions were used to spatially downscale the GCM monthly projections of 2010-2039 in the grid box to the Changwu station. The downscaled monthly data were further disaggregated to daily weather series using a stochastic weather generator (CLIGEN). The HadCM3 projected that average annual precipitation during 2010-2039 would increase by 4 to 18% at Changwu and that frequency and intensity of large storms would also increase. Under the conventional tillage, simulated percent increases during 2010-2039, compared with the present climate, would be 49-112% for runoff and 31-167% for soil loss. However, simulated soil losses under the conservation tillage during 2010-2039 would be reduced by 39-51% compared with those under the conventional tillage in the present climate. The considerable reduction in soil loss in the conservation tillage indicates the importance of adopting conservation tillage in the region to control soil erosion under climate change.","Climate change; Impact assessment; Runoff; Soil erosion","atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate effect; downscaling; environmental impact assessment; precipitation (climatology); runoff; soil conservation; soil erosion; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature effect; tillage; Universal Soil Loss Equation; Changwu; China; Loess Plateau; Shaanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953128508

Stations located in the center of the MCMA generally exhibit higher correlation coefficients and lower model biases than those stations located in the peripheral of the MCMA. Large temporal variations in the observed and simulated O3 concentrations are noted from station to station during the MILAGRO period.

This raises the issues of the scope of trade-related measures and of when and how they could be used. This paper discusses how far trade-related measures should be incorporated in that context. Drawing on an analogy to the Montreal Protocol and comparing developing country's climate mitigation and adaptation needs with the funding available, the paper argues that such measures should initially be applied only among Annex I or II countries. To discipline the use of unilateral trade measures at the international level, the paper emphasizes a need to define comparable climate efforts. Moreover, the Lieberman-Warner bill in the US Senate-taken as a proxy for future US climate legislation-is assessed, and found to be neither effective nor likely to be WTO-consistent. The paper is concluded by arguing that, in order to encourage developing countries to do more to combat climate change, developed countries should focus on carrots. Sticks can be incorporated, but only if they are credible and realistic and serve as a useful supplement to push developing countries to take actions or adopt policies and measures earlier than would otherwise have been the case. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The model's convective parameterization is based on a closure for shallow convection, with much of the deep convection allowed to occur on resolved scales. Four realizations of the period 1981-2005 are generated. The correlation of yearly Atlantic hurricane counts with observations is greater than 0.8 when the model is averaged over the four realizations, supporting the view that the random part of this annual Atlantic hurricane frequency (the part not predictable given the SSTs) is relatively small (<2 hurricanes per year). Correlations with observations are lower in the east, west, and South Pacific (roughly 0.6, 0.5, and 0.3, respectively) and insignificant in the Indian Ocean. The model trends in Northern Hemisphere basin-wide frequency are consistent with the observed trends in the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) database. The model generates an upward trend of hurricane frequency in the Atlantic and downward trends in the east and west Pacific over this time frame. The model produces a negative trend in the Southern Hemisphere that is larger than that in the IBTrACS. The same model is used to simulate the response to the SST anomalies generated by coupled models in the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP3) archive, using the late-twenty-first century in the A1B scenario. Results are presented for SST anomalies computed by averaging over 18 CMIP3 models and from individual realizations from 3 models. A modest reduction of global and Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone frequency is obtained in each case, but the results in individual Northern Hemisphere basins differ among the models. The vertical shear in the Atlantic Main Development Region (MDR) and the difference between theMDRSST and the tropical mean SST are well correlated with the model's Atlantic storm frequency, both for interannual variability and for the intermodel spread in global warming projections. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atlantic hurricane; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Coupled models; Deep convection; Global atmospheric models; Horizontal grid spacing; Hurricane frequency; Indian ocean; Interannual variability; Lower boundary conditions; Northern Hemispheres; Random parts; Sea surface temperatures; Shallow convection; Southern Hemisphere; SST anomalies; Time frame; Tropical cyclone; Upward trend; Vertical shear; World climate research programs; Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Global warming; Hurricanes; Oceanography; Storms; Submarine geophysics; Tropics; Climate models; annual variation; atmospheric modeling; boundary condition; convective system; general circulation model; global warming; hurricane; Northern Hemisphere; parameterization; sea surface temperature; simulation; Southern Hemisphere; temperature anomaly; tropical cyclone; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75749091697

More threatening is that lots of economic developing regions still strategically depend on fast industrialization, neglecting the relationship between production's spatial distribution and regional water environmental carrying capacity. As a small region, Deyang City is the objective case. We propose a plant-level aggregation method to estimate the spatial distribution of industrial water pollution pressure in the future five years. Based on discrete event simulation, newly added industrial projects' sizes and location choices (refer to industrial location theory) are regionally aggregated. COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) emission into every river reach in the region is calculated respectively. In order to recover the water environmental function, the strategy aims at controlling emission within the carrying capacity of each river reach. And the strategy is assessed on its regional effects and spatial equity, from the perspective of government and industry. The results quantitatively show the diversified uncertain bounds of river reaches' COD adoptions which will aggravate the water pollution. And the pollution control strategy's effect indicates a large different level of spatial equity for industry and government respectively.

In this paper, the effect of these measures on soil acidification is explored. An integrated methodology is used, combining emission inventory data, emission forecasts, air quality modeling, and ecological sensitivities indicated by critical load. National emissions of SO2, oxides of nitrogen (NOX), particulate matter (PM), and ammonia (NH3) in 2005 were estimated to be 30.7, 19.6, 31.3, and 16.6 Mt, respectively. Implementation of existing policy will lead to reductions in SO2 and PM emissions, while those of NOX and NH 3 will continue to rise, even under tentatively proposed control measures. In 2005, the critical load for soil acidification caused by sulfur (S) deposition was exceeded in 28% of the country's territory, mainly in eastern and south-central China. The area in exceedance will decrease to 26% and 20% in 2010 and 2020, respectively, given implementation of current plans for emission reductions. However, the exceedance of the critical load for nitrogen (N, combining effects of eutrophication and acidification) will double from 2005 to 2020 due to increased NOX and NH3 emissions. Combining the acidification effects of S and N, the benefits of SO2 reductions during 2005-2010 will almost be negated by increased N emissions. Therefore abatement of N emissions (NOX and NH3) and deposition will be a major challenge to China, requiring policy development and technology investments. To mitigate acidification in the future, China needs a multipollutant control strategy that integrates measures to reduce S, N, and PM. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality modeling; Control measures; Critical load; Ecological sensitivity; Emission inventories; Emission reduction; Energy consumption; Flue-gas desulfurization; Integrated methodology; Multi-pollutant control; Oxides of nitrogen; Particulate Matter; PM emissions; Policy development; Power sector; Regional air pollution; Soil acidifications; Air quality; Desulfurization; Electric load forecasting; Emission control; Eutrophication; Flue gases; Investments; Soils; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Reduction; ammonia; nitrogen; sulfur dioxide; acidification; air quality; ammonia; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; critical load; data set; emission control; emission inventory; eutrophication; fuel consumption; particulate matter; policy development; sulfur dioxide; acidification; air pollution control; China; desulfurization; eutrophication; model; particulate matter; policy; review; soil acidification; soil pollution control; Acids; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Atmosphere; China; Computer Simulation; Geography; Models, Chemical; Nitrogen; Policy Making; Soil; Sulfur Dioxide; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350787226

The bioreactor started-up feeding with 4000 mg l-1 COD (lactate) and 2000 mg l-1 sulfate (SO42-). The sulfate removal efficiency reached 3.84 g l-1 d-1 when the activated sludge formed a stable bacterial community comprising of some members of genera Desulfobulbus, Desulfovibrio, Clostridium and Pseudomonas after 20 days' operation. And about 79% of reduced sulfate captured electrons from the oxidization of propionate. Sulfate absence influenced little on quantity and population structure of SRB and DB, while much on MPB and metabolic typing. And the acetate (up to 86% (w/w) of total end-products) in end-product profiles was replaced by the propionate (75% (w/w)). The addition of nitrate to sulfidogenic system suppressed the sulfidogenesis mainly by capturing the electron flow. These results suggested that sulfate absence or nitrate addition would not inhibit SRB permanently in a stable sulfidogenic community. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The program seeks to examine emissions from engines operated in a realistic duty cycle and requires the development of an engine test schedule described in this paper. Field data on engine operation were available from Engine Control Unit (ECU) broadcasts from seven heavy heavy-duty trucks (HHDDT) tested during the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) E-55/59 study. These trucks were exercised at three weights (30,000 lb [13,610 kg], 56,000 lb [25,400 kg], and 66,000 lb [29,940 kg]) through four different active modes of a chassis test schedule that were developed from the data of in-use HHDDT operation in the state of California. The trucks were equipped with heavy-duty engines made by three major U.S. engine manufacturers with a range of model years from 1998 to 2003. This paper reports on the development of four engine test modes, termed creep, transient, cruise, and high-speed cruise (HHDDT-S), which correspond to the E-55/59 HHDDT chassis test modes. The creep and transient modes represent urban travel, and the cruise and HHDDT-S modes represent freeway operation. The test mode creation used the method of joining selected truck trips together while ensuring that they offered a reasonable statistical representation of the whole database by using a least-square errors method. Least-square errors between test modes and the database are less than 5%.

A precise gridded emission inventory will help improve the accuracy of air quality simulation. Mobile source emissions are one of the major contributors to volatile organic compound (VOC) and nitrogen oxide (NO x) pollutants, the precursors of ozone formation. However, because of the complexity of road networks and variations in traffic flows at different road types and locations, spatial allocation of emissions from mobile sources into grid cells is challenging. This paper proposes a new methodological framework, named as ""the road-network-based approach,"" for spatially allocating regional mobile source emission inventories. The new approach utilizes the Geographic Information System (GIS)-based road network information and road-types-based traffic flow data to provide spatial surrogates for allocating Pearl River Delta (PRD) regional mobile source emission inventories. The results show that the new approach provides reasonable spatial distributions of mobile source emissions, and the distributions are in good agreement with PRD regional on-road emission line sources. Comparisons between using the population-based and the new road-network-based approaches are made. The air quality modeling results indicate that the new approach can obviously improve model predictions with increasing accuracy in mobile source emission allocations. Means of choosing appropriate approaches for spatially allocating regional mobile source emissions are discussed.

The inventory covers major emission sources in the region and a bottom-up approach was adopted to compile the inventory for those sources where possible. The results show that the estimates for SO2, NOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5 and VOC emissions in the PRD region for the year 2006 are 711.4 kt, 891.9 kt, 3840.6 kt, 418.4 kt, 204.6 kt, and 1180.1 kt, respectively. About 91.4% of SO2 emissions were from power plant and industrial sources, and 87.2% of NOx emissions were from power plant and mobile sources. The industrial, mobile and power plant sources are major contributors to PM10 and PM2.5 emissions, accounting for 97.7% of the total PM10 and 97.2% of PM2.5 emissions, respectively. Mobile, biogenic and VOC product-related sources are responsible for 90.5% of the total VOC emissions. The emissions are spatially allocated onto grid cells with a resolution of 3 km × 3 km, showing that anthropogenic air pollutant emissions are mainly distributed over PRD central-southern city cluster areas. The preliminary temporal profiles were established for the power plant, industrial and on-road mobile sources. There is relatively low uncertainty in SO2 emission estimates with a range of -16% to +21% from power plant sources, medium to high uncertainty for the NOx emissions, and high uncertainties in the VOC, PM2.5, PM10 and CO emissions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Specific attention is paid to the causes of a ""cold snap"" in 1940-1976 in the Northern Hemisphere and the nature of an anomalous increase in the heat content in the Earth climatic system (ocean) in 1969-1980.

Long term climate data were used to analyze and assess regional climatic variation by cluster analysis in a GIS environment. Based on thermal and moisture factors, four variables were chosen to develop climate zones. These variables include annual average rainfalls, annual average ETc, annual average Growing Day Degree (GDD) and daily average temperature generated from daily climate data of 36 years (1971-2006) on 12 local weather stations as the fundamental elements of regional climate characteristics. GIS-based spatial analysis models are used to map climate sub-regions from sets of climatic parameters derived from regional climate data sources. Two climate zoning schemes are presented by integration of spatial interpolation, spatial cluster analysis and climate indices methods.

The topmost 120 cm of the peat covers the last 4000 years according to AMS 14C dating of pollen concentration. Carbon isotope of α-cellulose, extracted from sphagnum peat, provides a quantitative reconstruction of atmospheric relative humidity, based on transfer functions of C3 plants carbon isotopic fractionation equation and the bryophyte photosynthesis CO2 absorption rate equation. δ13C, TOC and C/N variations reveal that the Dajiuhu area has experienced a long-term tendency to dry during 4000-1000 aBP, with a major transition happening around 3000 aBP. Four relative dry events are identified at 3400-3200, 3000-2600, 2200-2000 and 1600-1400 aBP, respectively, corresponding to those climate events documented in many global records. Three periodicities, 664 a, 302 a and 277 a enclosed in the atmospheric humidity of Dajiuhu are correlated to the cycles of solar activities. The weakening of East Asia summer monsoon during this period registered in the Dajiuhu peat is consistent with the synchronous weakening of Indian Monsoon. This trend may be attributed to gradual decrease of Northern Hemispheric summer solar insolation and the consequently southward migration of Intertropical Convergent Zone (ITCZ). © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.","α-cellulose δ13C; Atmospheric relative humidity; Late Holocene; Shennongjia; Sphagnum peat","Bryophyta; bryophytes; Sphagnum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449535656

The reactor network model is used to explain the main differences in ammonia chemistry for methane (CH4) containing fuels and methane-free fuels. The chemical pathways of nitrogen oxides (NOx) formation and destruction are identified using rate-of-production analysis. The results show that in the case of natural gas, ammonia reacts relatively late at fuel lean condition leading to high NOx emissions. In the pre-ignition zone, the ammonia chemistry is blocked due to the absence of free radicals which are consumed by methane-methyl radical (CH3) conversion. In the case of methane-free gas, the ammonia reacted very rapidly and complete decomposition was reached in the fuel rich region of the jet. In this case the necessary radicals for the ammonia conversion are generated from hydrogen (H2) oxidation. © 2009 The Combustion Institute.","Ammonia conversion; Flameless combustion; Fuel-NOx","Ammonia chemistry; Ammonia conversion; Chemical pathways; Flameless; Flameless combustion; Free gas; Fuel-lean conditions; Methyl radical; Nitrogen chemistry; Production analysis; Reactor network; Free radical reactions; Free radicals; Fuels; Functional groups; Gas industry; Hydrogen; Ignition; Jets; Methane; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Thermochemistry; Ammonia; ammonia; fossil fuel; free radical; methane; nitrogen oxide; ammonia formation; article; chemical model; chemical reaction kinetics; chemical structure; combustion; computational fluid dynamics; decomposition; exhaust gas; nitrous oxide emission; oxidation kinetics; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69349100818

However, whether it directly senses fear-evoking stimuli is unknown. Because the amygdala expresses acid-sensing ion channel-1a (ASIC1a), and ASIC1a is required for normal fear responses, we hypothesized that the amygdala might detect a reduced pH. We found that inhaled CO2 reduced brain pH and evoked fear behavior in mice. Eliminating or inhibiting ASIC1a markedly impaired this activity, and localized ASIC1a expression in the amygdala rescued the CO2-induced fear deficit of ASIC1a null animals. Buffering pH attenuated fear behavior, whereas directly reducing pH with amygdala microinjections reproduced the effect of CO2. These data identify the amygdala as an important chemosensor that detects hypercarbia and acidosis and initiates behavioral responses. They also give a molecular explanation for how rising CO2 concentrations elicit intense fear and provide a foundation for dissecting the bases of anxiety and panic disorders. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of the carbonization of volatile pyrolytic products of starting materials on the properties of activated carbon were investigated in the process of phosphoric acid activation. Elemental analysis and SEM observation showed that both activating in the covered case and increasing the mass of starting material used favored the carbonization of volatile pyrolytic products. An investigation of N2 adsorption isotherms revealed that the carbonization of volatile pyrolytic products significantly enhanced mesopore development in the final carbons, especially pores with a size range from 2.5 to 30 nm, with little influence on micropores, and therefore produced a large increase in the adsorption capacity to Vitamin B12 (with a molecular size of 2.09 nm).

In the period from 1999 to 2006, atmospheric emissions of sulfur dioxide and heavy metals amounted to only one-third of those between 1992 and 1998, but birch mortality in heavily polluted areas (with nickel concentrations in leaves exceeding 160 mg/kg) remained at the same level, being absent (as previously) in less polluted areas.

All the carbon will have to be disposed of for final closure of these facilities to take place. In March 2008, the Chemical Materials Agency asked the National Research Council to study, evaluate, and recommend the best methods for proper and safe disposal of the used carbon from the operational disposal facilities. This volume examines various approaches to handling carbon waste streams from the four operating chemical agent disposal facilities. The approaches that will be used at each facility will ultimately be chosen bearing in mind local regulatory practices, facility design and operations, and the characteristics of agent inventories, along with other factors such as public involvement regarding facility operations. © 2009 by the National Academy of Sciences.

State and local agencies in particular, as well as the federal government, need to consider what they will have to do differently if the 100-year flood arrives every decade or so, if the protected areas for threatened species are no longer habitable, or if a region can expect more frequent and more severe wildfires, hurricanes, droughts, water shortages, or other extreme environmental events. Both conceptually and practically, people and organizations will have to adjust what may be life-long assumptions to meet the potential consequences of climate change. How and where should bridges be built? What zoning rules may need to be changed? How can targets for reduced carbon emissions be met? These and myriad other questions will need to be answered in the coming years and decades. Informing Decisions in a Changing Climate examines the growing need for climate-related decision support--that is, organized efforts to produce, disseminate, and facilitate the use of data and information in order to improve the quality and efficacy of climate-related decisions. Drawing on evidence from past efforts to organize science for improved decision making, it develops guidance for government agencies and other institutions that will provide or use information for coping with climate change.

The new plan may extend the timeline for expanding crude production capacity and put more emphasis on developing the country's gas reserves.

Initially, 2 reactors will be built at sites in Taohuajiang City in Hunan Province by CNN, Xian'ning City in Hubei Province by China Guangdong Nuclear, and Pengze City in Jiangxi Province by China Power Investment. Another phase of construction will follow and it is expected that each site will eventually hold 4 reactors in total. Currently, its installed capacity generates around 9 Gw of nuclear power.

In the second transaction, Dow is divesting its 45% stake in crude oil refinery Total Raffinaderij Nederland to Lukoil for an estimated $725 million. The 400 jobs at the Zeeland region outfit will remain safe in the short term and expects the deal to close in the third quarter of 2009. Meanwhile, Dow is busy landing new projects and expanding its core businesses. The Ras Tanura oil refinery and petrochemicals complex, a planned joint venture between Dow Chemical and Saudi Aramco, may be back on track. The companies plan to expand Aramco's Ras Tanura refinery by 400,000 bpd to over 600,000 bpd, accompanied by a new petrochemicals complex next door. The companies have just renewed their call on contractors to tender for the project. Dow also signed a separate deal with Gazprom to reduce the Russian firm's greenhouse gas emissions. The deal will see Dow install process improvements and greener technologies at Gazprom sites around the world in return for access to carbon credits to offset its own emissions.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117431733
