Heat pumps are an efficient alternative technology for supplying heat while improving the overall efficiency and shifting to potentially carbon neutral electricity. The state-of-the-art technology is limited to supply temperatures between 100 °C and 150 °C because of lower efficiency and component limitations. This paper has therefore analyzed two promising concepts for higher supply temperatures and found technically and economically feasible solutions for process heat supply of up to 280 °C. These solutions are using large-scale equipment from oil and gas industries for applications in energy-intensive industries. The suggested systems benefitted from the economy of scale and access to low electricity prices. The concepts outperformed a biogas-based solution, and they were competitive with biomass or natural gas systems with respect to economic performance. It was concluded that an electricity-based heat supply is possible for a wide range of industrial applications and accordingly represents an important contribution to fulfilling the objectives of lower climate impact of energy supply in industry. © 2019 The Authors","Electrification; Process heat; R-718; R-744; Reversed Brayton cycle; Steam compression","Brayton cycle; Carbon; Alternative technologies; Electrification; Energy intensive industries; Manufacturing industries; Process heat; R-718; R-744; State-of-the-art technology; Heat pump systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066880216

This situation is especially important for China as the most populous and one of the heaviest PM2.5 polluted country in the world. However, health burden estimations reported for China in previous studies may be biased due to the usage of PM2.5 concentrations at a coarsely spatial resolution, as well as the ignorance of the spatial discrepancies of parameters (e.g. respiratory rate) employed in the exposure-response function. This study therefore utilized a hybrid remote sensing-geostatistical approach to refine PM2.5 concentrations at 1 km resolution across mainland China from 2013 to 2017. Meanwhile, nationwide exposure parameters were for the first time introduced to weight the integrated exposure response (IER) function to calculate and spatially reallocate the corresponding PM2.5-attributable premature deaths at 1 km resolution. Results showed that annually averaged PM2.5 concentrations in mainland China decreased by 39.5%, from 59.1 μg/m3 in 2013 to 35.8 μg/m3 in 2017. Subsequently, PM2.5 attributable premature deaths reduced 12.6%, from 1.20 million (95% CI: 0.57; 1.71) in 2013 to 1.05 million (95% CI: 0.44; 1.44) in 2017. This declining trend was found in most parts of China except some areas in Xinjiang, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces. As a result, 214,821 (95% CI: 96,675; 302,897) life were saved with an estimated monetary value of US$ 210.14 billion (2011 values). However, it has to be acknowledged that, the central and northern China within priority areas of air pollution control were still experiencing high numbers of premature deaths due to the severe PM2.5 pollution and high-density population. But more worrying than these priority areas are those Harbin-Changchun Metropolitan Region, City Belt in Central Henan and Yangtze-Huaihe City Belt in non-priority areas, which also have been seriously suffering PM2.5 attributable premature deaths over 28, 000 cases per year. In conclusion, despite the huge gain in life-saving effects in China over the past five years with the help of air pollution intervention policy, future work on cleaner air and better human health is still strongly needed, especially in non-priority areas of air pollution control. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Exposure parameters; Health burden; PM2.5; Remote sensing; Spatial-temporal","Air cleaners; Air pollution; Belts; Health; Remote sensing; Exposure parameters; Geostatistical approach; Life-saving effects; Metropolitan regions; PM2.5; PM2.5 concentration; Spatial resolution; Spatial temporals; Air pollution control; atmospheric pollution; geostatistics; health impact; particulate matter; pollution exposure; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollution control; article; clinical article; controlled study; death; human; remote sensing; Xinjiang; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; premature mortality; procedures; remote sensing; China; Henan; Huai River; Xinjiang Uygur; Yangtze Basin; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Mortality, Premature; Particulate Matter; Remote Sensing Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058820137

We asked how tree canopy cover and impervious surface cover interact to influence daytime and nighttime summer air temperature, and how effects vary with the spatial scale at which land-cover data are analyzed (10-, 30-, 60-, and 90-m radii). A bicycle-mounted measurement system was used to sample air temperature every 5 m along 10 transects (∼7 km length, sampled 3–12 times each) spanning a range of impervious and tree canopy cover (0–100%, each) in a midsized city in the Upper Midwest United States. Variability in daytime air temperature within the urban landscape averaged 3.5 °C (range, 1.1–5.7 °C). Temperature decreased nonlinearly with increasing canopy cover, with the greatest cooling when canopy cover exceeded 40%. The magnitude of daytime cooling also increased with spatial scale and was greatest at the size of a typical city block (60–90 m). Daytime air temperature increased linearly with increasing impervious cover, but the magnitude of warming was less than the cooling associated with increased canopy cover. Variation in nighttime air temperature averaged 2.1 °C (range, 1.2–3.0 °C), and temperature increased with impervious surface. Effects of canopy were limited at night; thus, reduction of impervious surfaces remains critical for reducing nighttime urban heat. Results suggest strategies for managing urban land-cover patterns to enhance resilience of cities to climate warming. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

They are among the first communities to observe climate and environmental changes first-hand, and are applying traditional knowledge and skills in order to adapt to these changes. We used participatory action research in which a series of group discussions and debates were conducted in community workshops at the village level. Using this input, we analysed the perceptions of the local people about climate variability, impacts, and adaptation practices. The majority of the local people perceived climate change patterns in the CDZ with the increase of temperature and erratic rainfall patterns perceived as the most critical changes. The majority of the people also perceived that the impacts of climate change have already been affecting agriculture and its related sectors, including land and water resources and their livelihood strategies. Most of the local people also perceived that migration of young people away from the communities has gradually increased due to the consequences of climate change impacts. Farmers have already been attempting to cope with those climate change impacts by using locally relevant adaptation measures such as mixed and multiple cropping systems, changing to drought-resistant plant varieties, and using soil conservation measures to cope with water scarcity. In addition, most of the local people perceived that getting information from traditional weather prediction was helpful to cope with drought and erratic rainfall patterns. However, the results suggest the adaptive capacity of the local people in responding to the impacts of climate change can be improved. In this regard, effective adaptation planning relies on the best available knowledge base, and the urgent need to respond to the pressures of climate change has put a premium on the generation, interpretation and use of information to improve adaptive capacity, including improved access to scaling up the traditional best practices of local people. © 2019, Faculty of Environment and Resource Studies,Mahidol University.

In this study, an interval full-infinite programming rural energy model (IFIP-REM) was developed for supporting distributed energy system (DES) optimal design under uncertainties in rural areas. By affecting the upper and lower bounds of the interval by complex and variable external conditions, IFIP-REM could simulate the influence of external systems. To validate the model, a real case study of DES optimal design in Guanzhong, a rural area of China, was tested and aimed to minimize system cost and constraints of resources, energy supply reliability, and carbon emission mitigation. The data revealed generation of reasonable optimization schemes to obtain interval solutions of IFIP-REM. Compared to centralized energy system (CES), DES reduced electricity purchasing of the municipal grid by 47.5% and extended carbon emission of both upper and lower bounds to [17.13, 44.51] % and [12.42, 36.02] %, respectively. Overall, the proposed model could help managers make decisions of DES optimal design by coordinating conflicts among economic cost, system efficiency, and carbon emission mitigation. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emission; Distributed energy system; Functional interval; Optimal design; Rural area","carbon emission; comparative study; design method; economic development; electricity supply; emission control; living standard; numerical model; optimization; rural area; spatial distribution; China; Guanzhong Plain; Shaanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064050245

A variety of scenarios are considered based on changes in climate-driven meteorological conditions and both biogenic and anthropogenic emissions. Anthropogenic emissions are based on (1) the California Air Resources Board (CARB) California Emissions Projection Analysis Model (CEPAM), (2) increases in electric sector emissions due to climate change, and (3) aggressive adoption of alternative energy technologies electrification of end-use technologies, and energy efficiency measures. Results indicate that climate-driven changes in meteorological conditions will significantly alter day-to-day variations in future ozone and PM2.5 concentrations, likely increasing the frequency and severity of pollution periods in regions that already experience poor air quality and increasing health risks from pollutant exposure. Increases in biogenic and anthropogenic emissions due to climate change are important during the summer seasons, but have little effect on pollutant concentrations during the winter. Results also indicate that controlling anthropogenic emissions will play a critical role in mitigating climate-driven increases in both ozone and PM2.5 concentrations in the most populated areas of California. In the absence of anthropogenic emissions controls, climate change will worsen ozone air quality throughout the state, increasing exceedances of ambient air quality standards. If planned reductions in anthropogenic emissions are implemented, ozone air quality throughout the less urban areas of the state may be improved in the year 2035, but regions such as the SoCAB and the east SFBA will likely continue to experience high ozone concentrations throughout the summer season. Climate change and anthropogenic emissions controls are both found to decrease wintertime PM2.5 concentrations in the SJV, eliminating nearly all exceedances of PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in the year 2035. However, reductions in anthropogenic emissions are unable to fully mitigate the impact of climate change on PM2.5 concentrations in the SoCAB and east SFBA. Thus, while future air quality in the SJV is projected to be improved in the year 2035, air quality in the SoCAB and east SFBA will remain similar or marginally worsen compared to present day levels. Conversely, we find that aggressive adoption of alternative energy technologies including renewable resources, electrification of end-use technologies, and energy efficiency measures can offset the impacts of climate change. Overall, the two main drivers for air quality in 2035 are changes in meteorological conditions due to climate change and reductions in anthropogenic emissions. © 2019",,"Air quality; Air quality standards; Climate models; Electric utilities; Energy efficiency; Health risks; Ozone; Particulate emissions; Quality control; Alternative energy technologies; Ambient air quality standards; Anthropogenic emissions; California Air Resources Board; Meteorological condition; National ambient air quality standards; Pollutant concentration; South Coast Air basins; Climate change; ozone; air quality; anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate conditions; concentration (composition); environmental impact assessment; air pollution; air quality; air quality standard; alternative energy; Article; California; climate change; energy conservation; health hazard; health impact assessment; particulate matter; priority journal; renewable energy; seasonal variation; socioeconomics; climate change; forecasting; human; theoretical model; California; United States; Air Pollution; California; Climate Change; Forecasting; Humans; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061178729

Herein, the spatially separated CoO and Au dual cocatalysts are used as the hole and electron collectors, which are loaded on the internal and external surface of TiO2 hollow sphere (THS), respectively (denoted as Aux@THS@CoO). It is found that the Au nanoparticle and Co species are homogenous deposited on the surface of THS without doping. DRS results show that the photoabsorption performances of THS are enhanced obviously in the visible light region. XPS analysis reveals that an internal electric field is constructed, which could promote the separation of photoinduced charge carriers. Subsequently, Au2.0@THS@CoO displays the highest photocurrent density compared with the counterparts. Furthermore, the results of CO2 adsorption, ESR spectra and in-situ FTIR spectra show the high adsorption capacity of CO2 on the sample and the chemisorption of CO2 on the oxygen defects of THS conversed into the active intermediate CO2−. As a result, Au2.0@THS@CoO presents a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 with H2O in CH4. The optimal activity of the catalyst is 13.3 μmol h−1 g−1, which is 60 times higher than that of THS. In addition, in-situ FTIR spectra also suggest that H2O participates in the reaction as electron donator and hole scavenger during the photocatalysis process. Finally, a possible photocatalytic process has also been proposed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 reduction; Dual cocatalysts; Photocatalysis; Spatial separation; Synergistic effect","Carbon dioxide; Carrier mobility; Catalyst activity; Cobalt compounds; Electric fields; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Energy policy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gold deposits; Gold nanoparticles; Oxide minerals; Photocatalysis; Photocatalytic activity; Separation; Titanium dioxide; Co catalysts; CO2 reduction; High adsorption capacity; Internal electric fields; Photoinduced charge carriers; Reduction of CO2 with H2O; Spatial separation; Synergistic effect; Gold",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058782796

To unravel the contribution of these processes to berry growth, a biophysical grape (Vitis vinifera L.) berry growth module was developed and integrated with a whole-plant functional-structural model, and was calibrated on two varieties, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese. The model captured well the variations in growth and sugar accumulation caused by environmental conditions, changes in leaf-to-fruit ratio, plant water status, and varietal differences, with obvious future application in predicting yield and maturity under a variety of production contexts and regional climates. Our analyses illustrated that grapevines strive to maintain proper ripening by partially compensating for a reduced source-sink ratio, and that under drought an enhanced berry sucrose uptake capacity can reverse berry shrinkage. Sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of phloem hydraulic conductance, sugar uptake, and surface transpiration on growth, while suggesting that cell wall extensibility and the turgor threshold for cell expansion had minor effects. This study demonstrates that this integrated model is a useful tool in understanding the integration and relative importance of different processes in driving fleshy fruit growth. © The Author(s) 2018.

In this study, we examine the drivers of energy consumption-related CO2 emissions in China during 1978–2014 from a multiscale perspective. Firstly, we use the multivariate empirical mode decomposition model to simultaneously decompose the CO2 emissions and 17 drivers into several groups of intrinsic mode functions and one group of residues at different timescales. Secondly, we employ the stepwise regression analysis to explore and model the key drivers of CO2 emissions at different timescales without multicollinearity. The empirical results show that China’s CO2 emissions have obvious timescales of 6.17 years, 9.25 years, 18.5 years, 37.0 years, and long-term trend. At the short-term timescales, fuel structure and economic structure have significant impacts on CO2 emissions. At the medium-term timescales, urban population and fuel structure are the major contributors to CO2 emissions. At the long-term timescale, only per capita GDP has a positive effect on CO2 emissions. Finally, we propose the policy implications at the short, medium, and long timescales. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","China; CO2 emissions; Drivers; Multivariate empirical mode decomposition; Stepwise regression analysis","Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Public policy; Regression analysis; Signal processing; Truck drivers; Vehicular tunnels; China; CO2 emission reduction; CO2 emissions; Intrinsic Mode functions; Multi scale analysis; Multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD); Policy implications; Stepwise regression analysis; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; emission control; energy use; numerical model; regression analysis; timescale; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055962763

Furthermore, regions may be involved in different coalitions for haze control with different levels of effort. In this paper, we propose a PM2.5 cooperative control model with fuzzy cost and crisp coalitions or fuzzy coalitions based on the uncertain cross-border transmission factor. We focus on the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei regions of China and obtain the following major findings. In the case of haze control in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei regions of China, local governments in the global crisp coalition can achieve their emission reduction targets with the lowest aggregated cost. However, Hebei fails to satisfy its individual rationality if there is no cost sharing. Therefore, the Hukuhara–Shapley value is used to allocate the aggregated cost among these regions so that the grand coalition is stable. However, the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei regions cannot achieve their emission reduction targets in the global fuzzy coalition without government subsidies. © 2019 by the authors.

In this paper, a two-factor learning-curve model of wind power and photovoltaics (PV) was established based on the latest empirical data from the United States, and the paths of cost reduction and corresponding social impacts were explored through scenario analysis. The results demonstrate that both of the technologies are undergoing a period of rapid development, with the learning-by-searching ratio (LSR) being greatly improved in comparison with the previous literature. Research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) have contributed to investment cost reduction in the past decade, and the cost difference between high and low RD&D spending scenarios is predicted to be 5.5%, 8.9%, and 11.27% for wind power, utility-scale PV, and residential PV, respectively, in 2030. Although higher RD&D requires more capital, it can effectively promote cost reduction, reduce the total social cost of deploying renewable energy, and reduce the abatement carbon price that is needed to promote deployment. RD&D and the institutional support behind it are of great importance in allowing renewables to penetrate the commercial market and contribute to long-term social welfare. © 2019 by the authors.","Development and demonstration (RD&D); Learning curve; Photovoltaics technology; Research; Wind power technology","abatement cost; carbon emission; cost analysis; fossil fuel; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; research and development; research work; wind power; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066830766

Here, we examined the trends in SDD variation and the driving mechanisms based on short-term (35 lakes, July‒September 2017) and long-term (3 lakes, 1982‒2016) datasets covering lakes with different trophic states on the Yunnan Plateau. In the short-term dataset, increases in organic matter content, phytoplankton biomass and trophic state reduced the SDD. In the long-term dataset, the annual SDD decreased significantly in all three lakes. Significant increases occurred in phytoplankton biomass in eutrophic Lake Dianchi, both phytoplankton biomass and organic matter content in oligo-mesotrophic Lake Erhai, and organic matter content in oligotrophic Lake Fuxianhu over time, and these increases were related to increased trophic state (or change in nutrient level) and/or possibly to climate warming. Furthermore, phytoplankton biomass and organic matter content were important direct driving factors for reduced SDD in eutrophic Lake Dianchi and oligotrophic Lake Fuxianhu, respectively, while the interaction of these two factors was the most important factor in oligo-mesotrophic Lake Erhai. These results implied that eutrophication and climate warming could regulate SDD by changing organic matter concentration and/or phytoplankton biomass, which may depend on the lacustrine trophic state. However, further studies across larger geographical scales and more lakes are needed to confirm these results. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Eutrophication; Long-term trends; Organic matter; Phytoplankton; Secchi disk depth; Water clarity","biomass; concentration (composition); eutrophication; lacustrine environment; lake water; long-term change; organic matter; phytoplankton; spatial variation; temporal variation; transparency; water quality; China; Dianchi Lake; Erhai Lake; Yunnan; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063128336

Yet by the end of 2017, China emitted 28% of the world's energy-related CO2 emissions, 76% of which were from coal use. How China can reinvent its energy economy cost-effectively while still achieving its commitments was the focus of a three-year joint research project completed in September 2016. Overall, this analysis found that if China follows a pathway in which it aggressively adopts all cost-effective energy efficiency and CO2 emission reduction technologies while also aggressively moving away from fossil fuels to renewable and other non-fossil resources, it is possible to not only meet its Paris Agreement Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) commitments, but also to reduce its 2050 CO2 emissions to a level that is 42% below the country's 2010 CO2 emissions. While numerous barriers exist that will need to be addressed through effective policies and programs in order to realize these potential energy use and emissions reductions, there are also significant local environmental (e.g., air quality), national and global environmental (e.g., mitigation of climate change), human health, and other unquantified benefits that will be realized if this pathway is pursued in China. © 2019","China; CO2 emissions reduction; Energy efficiency; Non-fossil fuels; Paris Agreement","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Coal industry; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Potential energy; Carbon dioxide emissions; China; CO2 emission reduction; CO2 emissions; Emissions reduction; Fossil resources; Non-fossil fuels; Primary energies; Fossil fuels; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy efficiency; energy use; fossil fuel; pollution policy; potential energy; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061212496

Beijing, as a pilot low carbon cities, has announced to reach carbon emissions peak by around 2020. It is expected to play a leading role and to enter into a post-fossil carbon society earlier than others. The analysis revealed that Beijing should control its future emissions by primarily controlling total energy consumption and expanding the scale of imported green electricity. The energy intensity reduction targets are predicted to be 17% and 20% during the 14th Five-Year Plan period. Decomposing targets to districts has been approved to be one of the most effective ways. However, most of relative studies adopt a state-to-provincial level of analysis and few could balance theoretical analysis and practical allocation. Considering equity, operability and feasibility, reduction pathway method, type assignment method, and average adjustment method are applied for Beijing. The methods have obvious effects on energy consumption in Shunyi, Chaoyang, Fengtai, and Haidian, which energy consumption is almost half of Beijing's total. The differences in carbon emissions for districts are less than 4% of the highest in 2025, while decomposition targets differ 0 to 3 percentage points. If Beijing is required to peak around 2020, then Tongzhou, Shunyi, and Daxing would peak later than 2025. However, if Beijing should peak earlier, then all districts except Shunyi should peak earlier than 2020 or even earlier than 2015. This assessment framework could be applied in other regions or countries to help local governments to make a more reasonable and compromising carbon mitigation plan. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission peak; Decomposition; District; Energy intensity; Post-fossil carbon society","Decomposition; Energy utilization; Adjustment method; Carbon emissions; Carbon mitigation; District; Energy intensity; Fossil carbon; Low-carbon cities; Total energy consumption; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060908232

The aim of the present study was to develop a promising remediation technology to alleviate Cr bioavailability and decrease GHG emissions in Cr-polluted paddy soil. Materials and methods: We investigated the potential role of biochar amendment in decreasing soil CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O emissions, as well in reducing Cr uptake by rice grains at application rates of 0 t ha −1 (CK), 20 t ha −1 (BC20), and 40 t ha −1 (BC40) in Cr-polluted paddy soil in southeastern China. In addition, the soil aggregate size distribution, soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration of soil aggregates, soil available Cr concentration, and rice yield were analyzed after harvesting. Results and discussion: Biochar amendment significantly reduced CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O emission fluxes. Compared to CK, total C emissions in the BC20 and BC40 treatments decreased by 9.94% and 17.13% for CO 2 -C, by 30.46% and 37.10% for CH 4 -C, and by 34.24% and 37.49% for N 2 O-N, respectively. Biochar amendment increased the proportion of both the 2000–200 μm and 200–20 μm size fractions in the soil aggregate distribution. Accordingly, the organic carbon concentration of these fractions increased, which increased the total SOC. Moreover, biochar amendment significantly decreased soil available Cr concentration and total Cr content of the rice grains by 33.6% and 14.81% in BC20 and 48.1% and 33.33% in BC40, respectively. Rice yield did not differ significantly between biochar amendment treatment and that of CK. Conclusions: Biochar application reduced GHG emissions in paddy soil, which was attributed to its comprehensive effect on the soil properties, soil microbial community, and soil aggregates, as well as on the mobility of Cr. Overall, the present study demonstrates that biochar has a great potential to enhance soil carbon sequestration while reducing Cr accumulation in rice grains from Cr-polluted rice paddies. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biochar; Cr uptake; Greenhouse gas emission; Paddy soil","bioaccumulation; bioavailability; biochar; chromium; concentration (composition); greenhouse gas; paddy field; rice; soil aggregate; soil amendment; soil emission; soil pollution; translocation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055929457

While soot emissions from the diesel-CNG combustion can be tested in a real-world single-cylinder engine, the soot formation characteristics cannot be tested in the same way. Therefore, to understand the mechanisms behind soot formation in diesel-CNG combustion, soot evolution must be investigated using a simulation model. In this study, the soot evolution is investigated under different CNG substitution ratios with single and split fuel injection. An AVL 5402 single-cylinder diesel engine was modified to run diesel/CNG dual-fuel to investigate the combustion and soot emissions. A new soot model using KIVA-3V R2 code and integrated with a reduced heptane/methane PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) mechanism was used to simulate soot behavior. For the combustion, the results show that the ignition delay gets extended, the combustion duration gets shorter and the peak pressure can be improved when CNG substitution ratio is increased both with single and split injection. Additionally, a slight increase of pressure is observed when the split injection is used. This is because the split injection is an effective strategy to change the distribution and vaporization of fuel, which results in an incremental increase in combustion efficiency and increase pressure. As the CNG substitution ratio is increased, soot emissions get drastically reduced. The reason is the equivalence ratio distribution of air-fuel becomes more homogenous and the local fuel-rich region shrinks with increasing of CNG substitution ratios. Pyrene is an important intermediate specie to generate soot particles. The results show that pyrene distribution decreases, leading to a reduced generation of soot precursors. As a result, the soot mass of CNG70 is less than the other two cases. The basic reason is the prolonged ignition delay allowed for more time for fuel−air mixing, which reduces soot mass formation. © 2019","Dual-fuel combustion; KIVA-3V R2 code; Single and split injection; Soot model","Compressed natural gas; Diesel engines; Dual fuel engines; Engine cylinders; Fuel injection; Gas emissions; Heptane; Ignition; Pyrene; Soot; AND splits; Combustion efficiencies; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Dual fuel combustion; Kiva-3v; Particulate matter emissions; Single-cylinder diesel engine; Soot model; Dust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062541986

However, a comprehensive understanding of the interactions among these soil-forming factors on soil N fractions (SNFs) is still unclear. We measured SNFs at 89 sites across a 3300-m gradient elevation in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, which spans a large range of climates, parent materials and plant communities. The results showed that different SNFs were correlated with different predictors. Inorganic N was related to elevation and plant species diversity; labile organic N was mainly controlled by parent material; and moderate and recalcitrant organic N were governed by mean annual temperature, parent material and plant species diversity. We concluded that the combined effects of the soil-forming factors controlled SNFs; plant species diversity and parent material were the first and second crucial factors for predicting SNFs. Aspect, elevation and mean annual temperature not only directly affected some fractions, but also indirectly influenced them via plant species diversity. Our results stress the importance of incorporating abiotic and biotic factors when predicting soil N–environment feedback across a large scale. © 2018","Climate; Parent material; Plant community; Soil nitrogen fractions; Topography","climate effect; inorganic nitrogen; parent material; plant community; soil nitrogen; soil temperature; species diversity; topography; vegetation; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058803460

In this method, the global samples evaluated by costly simulation are used to build a type of surrogate model named the regressing Kriging model, which are then employed to predict bi-objectives of untested samples or filter noises from the evaluated samples. An adaptive selector is incorporated to determine which samples in the local trust-region are evaluated by costly simulation and which ones by the built regressing Kriging model. This helps to balance computational costs and accuracies of three quadratic regression models, especially when the variable dimension is high. The non-interactive role of a decision maker is taken to generate more non-dominated solutions around the desired bi-objective point. In the field experiments, an urban road network with 15 signalized and five non-signalized intersections in Changsha, China, is modeled as the simulation scenario by VISSIM. Then, the traffic simulation model is firstly calibrated from two aspects by the BOSSO method, which can well reproduce the reality. After that, the network-wide bi-objective signal timing optimization problem is also solved by the BOSSO method. Numerical results show that compared with the real-field traffic states, the total delay and vehicular emissions are reduced by at most 16.90% and 32.22% respectively under the budged number of simulations. Balance analyses also show the existence of a competing relationship between bi-objectives. Finally, the BOSSO method is validated to outperform three other counterparts (NSGA-II, BOTR and BOEGO) from various aspects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Signal timing optimization; Simulation-based optimization; Total delay; Vehicular emissions","Decision making; Interpolation; Regression analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Street traffic control; Timing circuits; Traffic signals; Non-signalized intersection; Nondominated solutions; Signal timing optimization; Simulation-based optimizations; Stochastic simulations; Total delay; Traffic simulation model; Vehicular emission; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061589829

With the wide application of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, the problem caused by SO3 has become severe, especially when high sulfur coal is burned. Emission regulations of SO3 for coal-fired power plants, which promote the development of SO3 measurement and control technologies, have been set in some countries and regions. In this paper, recent advances in the formation, transformation, measurement, and control mechanism and technologies of SO3 in coal-fired power plants were summarized. The formation mechanisms of SO3 in boiler and SCR systems and its form transition and corresponding effects on the performance of power plants were analyzed. Different SO3 test standards and methods were compared, and online SO3 monitor based on isopropanol absorption method were developed. Various SO3 control technologies, including simultaneous and specific removal technology, were summarized. Low-low temperature and wet electrostatic precipitators could remove up to 90% SO3/H2SO4 aerosol, and the removal efficiency of SO3 in wet flue gas desulfurization can be enhanced to 80% by absorber optimization and inlet flue gas temperature decrease. For power plants that burn high-sulfur coal, the injection of alkaline sorbent before the SCR or air preheater system can remove more than 90% of SO3 to decrease the formation of NH4HSO4 and the pressure drop in the air preheater. High SO3 removal technology and strategies for different scenarios were proposed to meet different SO3 emission requirements in the future. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Alkaline sorbent; ESP; Flue gas; SO3; Sulfuric acid aerosol; WESP; WFGD","Aerosols; Air preheaters; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Electrostatic precipitators; Flue gases; Flues; Mining; Particulate emissions; Selective catalytic reduction; Temperature; Coal-fired power plant; Flue gas temperatures; Measurement and control technology; Selective catalytic reduction systems; WESP; Wet electrostatic precipitators; Wet flue gas desulfurization; WFGD; Fossil fuel power plants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058540699

Stoichiometric operation with EGR and the three-way catalyst has become a potential approach for commercial LNG engines to meet the Euro VI emissions legislation. In the current study, numerical investigations on the knocking tendency of several combustion chambers with different geometries and corresponding performances were conducted using CONVERGE CFD code with G-equation flame propagation model coupled with a reduced natural gas chemical kinetic mechanism. The results showed that the CFD modeling approach could predict the knock phenomenon in LNG engines reasonably well under different thermodynamic and flow field conditions. The predicted threshold between ""no knock"" and ""knock"" conditions was found to be in good agreement with experimental results, which means it provides a valid way to estimate the capability of knock suppression and knock-limited thermal efficiency for the design and optimization of LNG combustion system. Based on the validated CFD model, the effects of combustion chamber structures on turbulent flow and combustion process were discussed. The results showed that lower mean flow velocity in the spark plug region and higher turbulent kinetic energy in the center of the combustion chamber and near the spark plug can be obtained with a shallow re-entrant chamber geometry at the time of ignition and during the early combustion stage, which could effectively promote the initial flame propagation. However, the knock propensity is also higher compared to other combustion chamber geometries, mainly due to the preheating of the flame front in the squish crevices and the suppression of flame propagation to the bottom of the combustion chamber, which limits the thermal efficiency improvement. In addition, it's found that the thermal efficiency of the current LNG engine with aluminum piston is restricted by both the knock and durable peak in-cylinder pressure (mechanical strength). Therefore, it's essential to develop effective combustion and knock control strategies under higher peak in-cylinder pressure conditions (with higher CR steel piston) to further improve the thermal efficiency of stoichiometric LNG engine. © 2019 SAE International.

To predict future carbon stability, it is imperative to understand their responses to environmental changes, which is subject to large uncertainty. As current global warming is causing range shifts toward higher latitudes, we conducted three reciprocal soil transplantation experiments over large transects in 2005 to simulate abrupt climate changes. Six years after soil transplantation, fungal biomass of transplanted soils showed a general pattern of changes from donor sites to destination, which were more obvious in bare fallow soils than in maize cropped soils. Strikingly, fungal community compositions were clustered by sites, demonstrating that fungi of transplanted soils acclimatized to the destination environment. Several fungal taxa displayed sharp changes in relative abundance, including Podospora, Chaetomium, Mortierella and Phialemonium. In contrast, bacterial communities remained largely unchanged. Consistent with the important role of fungi in affecting soil carbon cycling, 8.1%–10.0% of fungal genes encoding carbon-decomposing enzymes were significantly (p < 0.01) increased as compared with those from bacteria (5.7%–8.4%). To explain these observations, we found that fungal occupancy across samples was mainly determined by annual average air temperature and rainfall, whereas bacterial occupancy was more closely related to soil conditions, which remained stable 6 years after soil transplantation. Together, these results demonstrate dissimilar response patterns and resource partitioning between fungi and bacteria, which may have considerable consequences for ecosystem-scale carbon cycling. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon-decomposing genes; climate change; high-throughput sequencing; soil microbial community; soil transplantation","bacterium; carbon cycle; China; classification; climate change; fungus; microbiology; mycobiome; Bacteria; Carbon Cycle; China; Climate Change; Fungi; Mycobiome; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064926609

However, control schemes, energy performance analysis, characterization and optimization of such a system under the Tibet climatic/altitude conditions still remain a challenge. This research aims to investigate a PCM-integrated solar heating system applicable to Tibet which is unique in terms of the altitude, solar radiation, atmospheric pressure and water boiling temperature etc. The whole process involves (1) identification of the unique features of Tibet climate and altitude and relevant requirements to the solar system; (2) design of a PCM-integrated solar heating system based on a selected building in Lhasa and planning the potential control strategies appropriate to such a system; (3) analysis of the system's energy performance under different operational schemes; and (4) recommendation of the most appropriate system operational scheme and design strategy. A dynamic simulation model was established and applied to study the energy performance of such a system, in which the solar energy usage rate is defined as the performance evaluation index. It is found that the operational scheme ‘A’ has the best energy saving effect, followed by operational schemes B and C. The system presents a more favorite energy performance between 9:00 h–18:00 h, compared to other time slots in a typical winter day. Change in operational schemes creates a significant impact on the energy saving effect of the system. The results help wide and fast deployment of the PCM-integrated solar heating system and enable the determination of the best performing operational scheme and associated performance data appropriate to Tibet or similar regions in the world, thus making a significant contribution to the saving of fossil fuel energy consumption and reduction of the carbon emission on the regional and global scales. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Design procedure; Energy saving effect; Flat-plate solar thermal collector; Operational strategy; PCM storage tank","Altitude control; Atmospheric pressure; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Heating equipment; Solar energy; Structural design; Design procedure; Energy-saving effect; Operational strategies; Solar thermal collector; Storage tank; Solar heating; carbon emission; control system; design method; energy efficiency; heating; instrumentation; numerical model; operations technology; performance assessment; simulation; solar power; China; Lhasa; Xizang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060925210

We have studied a new type of SDI (SDI with tanks) suitable for cultivation and production of perennial fruit trees and photovoltaic aeration device in greenhouse. The results showed that aeration irrigation promoted the growth of new leaves, fine roots, and new branches of grape, regulated O2/CO2 content in rhizosphere soil, and accelerated air exchange in rhizosphere soil. This study showed that aeration irrigation did not change the structure of bacteria and fungi but significantly increased the abundance of aerobic bacteria, such as Nitrospira and Cytophagia. Moreover, it promoted the increase of Pseudomonas and Aspergillus related to phosphate solubilization, that of Bacillus related to potassium solubilization, and that of Fusarium related to organic matter (OM) decomposition. This study shows that aeration irrigation through SDI with tanks can promote grape growth, which may be related to the ability of aeration irrigation to change the gas composition of rhizosphere soil, optimize the structure of rhizosphere soil microorganism. © 2019, American Society for Horticultural Science.

The stability of C-57 carbon is confirmed through phonon-mode analysis, total energy and elastic constants calculations, as well as first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. We conceived that the metallicity of C-57 carbon is attributed to the large states across Fermi-level contributed by p y orbital due to the bond distortion, which is much different from that of graphite. This new carbon sheet can also serve as a precursor for stable one-dimensional nanotubes with metallic character.

While a number of studies have attributed the PM 2.5 -related health impacts to emission sources, they have seldom examined the complicated nonlinear relationships between them. Here we investigate the nonlinear relationships between PM 2.5 -related premature mortality in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, one of the most polluted regions in the world, and emissions of different pollutants from multiple sectors and regions, through a combination of chemical transport model (CTM), extended response surface model (ERSM), and concentration-response functions (CRFs). The mortalities due to both long-term and short-term exposures to PM 2.5 are most sensitive to the emission reductions of primary PM 2.5 , followed by NH 3 , nonmethane volatile organic compounds and intermediate volatility organic compounds (NMVOC+IVOC). The sensitivities of long-term mortality to emissions of primary organic aerosol (POA), NMVOC+IVOC and SO 2 do not change much with reduction ratio, whereas the sensitivities to primary inorganic PM 2.5 (defined as all chemical components of primary PM 2.5 other than POA), NH 3 and NO x increase significantly with the increase of reduction ratio. The emissions of primary PM 2.5 , especially those from the residential and commercial sectors, contribute a larger fraction of mortality in winter (57–70%) than in other seasons (28-42%). When emissions of multiple pollutants or those from both local and regional emissions are controlled simultaneously, the overall sensitivity of long-term mortality is much larger than the arithmetic sum of the sensitivities to emissions of individual pollutants or from individual regions. This implies that a multi-pollutant, multi-sector and regional joint control strategy should be implemented to maximize the marginal health benefits. For NO x emissions, we suggest a nationwide control strategy which significantly enhances the effectiveness for reducing mortality by avoiding possible side effects when only the emissions within the BTH region are reduced. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","China; CMAQ/2D-VBS; extended response surface model (ERSM); PM 2.5; premature mortality","Ammonia; Decision making; Emission control; Health; Nitrogen oxides; Surface properties; Volatile organic compounds; China; CMAQ/2D-VBS; PM2.5; Premature mortality; Response surface modeling; Air pollution; ammonia; intermediate volatility organic compound; methane; nitric oxide; nonmethane volatile organic compound; organic compound; sulfur dioxide; unclassified drug; volatile agent; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; emission control; health impact; mortality; nonlinearity; particulate matter; pollutant source; volatile organic compound; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution control; Article; chemical composition; chemical model; chemical phenomena; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental impact; health hazard; nonlinear system; premature mortality; priority journal; residential home; response surface method; suspended particulate matter; air pollutant; epidemiology; human; particle size; particulate matter; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; Air Pollutants; China; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Mortality, Premature; Nonlinear Dynamics; Particle Size; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060243210

The oxygen applied during annealing played a key role in the formation of the special pyramidal-like structures by introducing thin oxygen-rich transition layers on the top surfaces of the VO 2 crystals. An etching related growth and transformation mechanism for the synthesis of nanopyramidal films was proposed. Structural characterizations confirmed the formation of a composite VO 2 structure of monoclinic M1 (P21/c) and Mott insulating M2 (C2/m) phases for the films at room temperature. Moreover, by varying the oxygen concentration, the nanocrystal morphology of the VO 2 films could be tuned, ranging over pyramidal, dot, and/or twin structures. These nanopyramidal VO 2 films showed potential benefits for application such as temperature??regulated field emission devices. For one typical sample deposited on a 3-inch silicon substrate, its emission current (measured at 6 V/µm) increased by about 1000 times after the oxygen-etching treatment, and the field enhancement β factor reached as high as 3810 and 1620 for the M and R states, respectively. The simple method reported in the present study may provide a protocol for building a variety of large interesting surfaces for VO 2 -based device applications. © 2019 by the authors.

This campaign included meteorological monitoring, pollutant monitoring, aerosol sampling and fuel sampling. During the campaign, 16 ship plumes were captured by the on-shore measurement site, and 4 plumes indicated the usage of high-SF (SF refers to the sulfur content of marine fuels). The average reduction of the mean ΔNOx/ΔSO2 ratio from high-sulfur plumes (3.26) before 1 January to low-sulfur plumes (12.97) after 1 January shows a direct SO2 emission reduction of 75 %, consistent with the sulfur content reduction (79 %). The average concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 μm), NOx, SO2, O3 and CO during campaign were 147.85 μg m-3, 146.93, 21.91, 29.68 ppb and 2.21 ppm, respectively, among which NOx reached a maximum hourly concentration of 692.6 ppb, and SO2 reached a maximum hourly concentration of 165.5 ppb. The mean concentrations of carbonaceous and dominant ionic species in particles were 6.52 (EC - elemental carbon), 23.10 (OC - organic carbon), 22.04 (SO2-4), 25.95 (NO-3) and 13.55 (NH+4) μg m-3. Although the carbonaceous species in particles were not significantly affected by fuel switching, the gas and particle pollutants in the ambient air exhibited clear and effective improvements due to the implementation of low-sulfur fuel. Comparison with the prevailing atmospheric conditions and a wind map of SO2 variation concluded a prompt SO2 reduction of 70 % in ambient air after fuel switching. Given the high humidity at the study site, this SO2 reduction will abate the concentration of secondary aerosols and improve the acidity of particulate matter. Based on the enrichment factors of elements in PM2.5, vanadium was identified as a marker of residual fuel ship emissions, decreasing significantly by 97.1 % from 309.9 ng m-3 before fuel switching to 9.1 ng m-3 after regulation, which indicated a crucial improvement due to the implementation of low-sulfur fuels. Ship emissions were proven to be significantly influential both directly and indirectly on the port environment and the coastal areas around Bohai Bay, where the population density reaches over 650 people per square kilometer. The results from this study report the positive impact of fuel switching on the air quality in the study region and indicate a new method for identifying the ship fuel type used by vessels in the area. © 2019 Author(s).",,"aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; fuel; observational method; pollution monitoring; port; regulatory framework; Bohai Bay; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064198839

The results showed that TYL, CIP, and SM2 reduced the production of methane during AD by 7.5%, 21.9%, and 16.0%, respectively. After AD for five days, CIP strongly inhibited the mcrA gene, where its abundance was 49% less than that in the control. TYL and SM2 decreased the abundances of Spirochaeta and Fibrobacteres during AD. High-throughput sequencing identified 10 methanogen genera, where Methanocorpusculum, Methanobrevibacter, and Methanosarcina accounted for 99.1% of the total archaeal reads. TYL and SM2 increased the efficiency of the acetoclastic methanogen pathway (Methanosarcina) by 29.04% and 52.79%, respectively. Redundancy analysis showed that Spirochaeta, Fibrobacteres, and Methanosarcina had positive correlations with CH4 and mcrA.

Since 2015, policies for substituting residential coal use with electricity have been implemented at unprecedented levels in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region, one of the most severely air polluted areas in China. This study evaluated the health benefits of the residential “coal-to-electricity” policy in the BTH region. We developed an integrated assessment model to investigate the impact of the policy on both the ambient and indoor air quality improvement. The private health benefits from indoor air quality improvements do not justify the costs. However, adding the spillover public health benefits from ambient air quality improvements, the policy brings net social benefits to the BTH region. Compared to a no-policy scenario, Beijing obtains the most health benefits and enjoys the most synergies from regional cooperation among the three provinces/municipalities. Hebei bears the highest cost since it has more households fueled by coal. Our results showing net social benefits provide support for a massive and accelerated implementation of this policy in the BTH region. The provincial distributional results can provide a reference for subsidies from Beijing and Tianjin to Hebei for achieving region-wide implementation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ambient air pollution; Coal-to-electricity policy; Health benefits; IMED model; Indoor air pollution; Residential heating","Air quality; Coal; Health; Heating; Housing; Indoor air pollution; Air pollution sources; Ambient air pollution; Ambient air quality; Electricity policy; Health benefits; Integrated assessment models; Regional cooperation; Residential heating; Economic and social effects; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; economic impact; energy policy; health impact; heating; indoor air; public health; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058241735

However, the real carbon mitigation effects of this policy are unclear. Moreover, the potential cost savings from internal or external trading among provinces are also uncertain. Based on panel data of 30 provincial industries from 2006 to 2015, this paper first employs a difference-in-differences model to explore the effects of the pilot ETS on industrial carbon emissions and carbon intensity. A Stochastic Frontier Analysis is then conducted to measure industrial energy efficiency and identify any carbon mitigation effects. We next use a parameterized directional output distance function to estimate the industrial carbon marginal abatement costs and analyze the potential cost savings/gains from internal trading among provinces within the same geographical regions and from external trading across regions. Results show that: (a) the pilot ETS has significant negative effects on industrial carbon emissions (10.1%) and carbon intensity (0.78%). (b) Energy efficiency plays an important role in the carbon mitigation effects. (c) the distribution of marginal abatement cost (MAC) shows significant geographical characteristics.

Absorption technologies are presently the most available and effective approach for post-combustion CO2 capture. However, state-of-the-art amine-based absorption technologies incur intensive energy use, as high as 3 times the thermodynamic minimum, thus resulting in prohibitively high costs. Solvents are key to the performance of absorption technologies. Recently, a new class of solvents, phase change solvents, have attracted growing interest due to their potential to substantially reduce energy use for CO2 capture. Phase change solvents are homogeneous (single-phase) solvents under normal conditions, but undergo a phase transition into a heterogenic (two-phase) system, triggered by changes in polarity, hydrophilicity, ionic strength, or hydrogen bond strength to form a CO2-lean liquid phase and a CO2-enriched liquid or solid phase. This review paper first examines different mechanisms that trigger phase separations in solvents. A comprehensive list of phase change solvents reported in the recent literature, including those subject to chemically or thermally triggered phase changes, non-aqueous or aqueous systems, and those forming either a CO2-enriched solid or a liquid phase are provided and their physiochemical properties for CO2 capture are discussed. Enabled by phase change solvents, different variants of CO2 absorption processes have been developed and tested in laboratory or pilot scales over the past ten years. The status of such emerging processes is summarized and their advantages and challenges for post-combustion CO2 capture are reviewed and commented. Solvent properties such as CO2 loading capacity, lean- and rich-phase partition, desorption pressure, absorption kinetics, viscosity, stability, and volatility are critical for both CO2 capture performance and scalability. Gaps between state-of-the-art and ideal solvents are analyzed, and insights into the research needs such as solvent structure–property–performance relations, computational solvent design, ideal vapor-liquid equilibrium behavior, and integration of capture processes with post-combustion emission sources are provided. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Absorption; CO2-triggered solvent; Desorption; Energy penalty; Phase change solvent; Thermomorphic solvent","Absorption; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Combustion; Desorption; Hydrogen bonds; Ionic strength; Liquids; Solvents; CO2 loading capacity; Different mechanisms; Effective approaches; Energy penalties; Low-carbon energy technology; Performance and scalabilities; Phase Change; Physio-chemical properties; Phase transitions; absorption; carbon dioxide; combustion; desorption; phase transition; physicochemical property; reaction kinetics; solvent; thermodynamics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061215720

As precursors of PCDD/Fs, dibenzofuran (DF) and dibenzo‑p‑dioxin (DD) have received considerable public and scientific attention. To reduce the emission of PCDD/Fs, it is critical to explore the formation mechanisms of DF and DD. The present study delineated the DF and DD formation mechanisms from anthracene partial oxidation with the aid of high-accuracy quantum chemistry calculations. The rate constants of crucial elementary steps were obtained utilizing canonical variational transition-state (CVT) theory with the small curvature tunneling (SCT) correction. The results indicate that anthracene could be important precursor of DF and DD, because of the potential barriers for all the major elementary reactions are lower than 33.54 kcal mol −1 . This work also reveals that water molecule plays an important catalytic effect during the formation of both DF and DD by lowering the barriers of about 27.24 kcal mol −1 . For the water-assisted formation pathway, DF is the dominate product of anthracene partial oxidation with the highest barrier of 30.45 kcal mol −1 .

Based on face-to-face interview data from 427 randomly selected pastoral households of the Hulun Buir grassland in northern China, this study investigated perceptions and impacts of historical climate change and the associations of these perceptions with observed climate change. Meanwhile, we identified pastoralists’ responses to climate change, as well as barriers to the adaptation process. We used binary logistic regression models to determine the factors that influence climate change adaptation strategies. The results show that pastoralists’ perception of the inter-annual variability in climate variables is relatively consistent with the observed meteorological data. Pastoralists’ adaptive strategies for climate variability comprise primarily livestock and pasture management interventions, such as “purchasing fodder”, “reducing livestock”, “part-time grazing”, and “renting pasture”. In addition, pastoralists identified several barriers that are allied with adaptation practices, such as limited grassland tenure, an absence of credit, and limited access to agricultural markets. Furthermore, the sex, age, and education level of the head of household and the household livelihood capital and location were found to be the key factors determining the choice of adaptation strategies.

Thirty generic urban block cases in six typologies that represent a diverse range of urban forms were examined through simulation-based studies under the same planning conditions and simulation assumptions so as to rule out the impact of non-design related factors. Several key planning and geometric parameters which capture the formal characteristics of the urban blocks were examined as independent variables, and the dependent variables include the performance indicators on solar energy harvesting potential and building net energy use intensity that capture the dual benefits of photovoltaic (PV) systems in reducing building cooling loads and offsetting local plug loads with electricity generated on site. The results indicate that, under the same planning conditions and design premises, differences in urban block typology could lead to up to 200% increase in solar energy harvesting potential and electricity generated from rooftop PV, twelve times higher rate of reduction in building cooling loads, tow times higher rate of reduction in net purchased electricity, and 25% lower building net energy use intensity. The courtyard and hybrid urban block typologies consistently outperform the other typologies, especially the commonly implemented tower and slab blocks, and they benefit the most from PV deployment in the tropics. The comparison between an existing residential precinct and a hypothetical alternative hybrid urban block further demonstrated the significant impact of urban design on efficiency of PV electricity generation and building energy use efficiency. In addition to the significant economic benefit in reduction in utility cost and environmental implication in terms of equivalent reduction in CO2 emissions on urban scale, this study highlights the crucial role that urban design plays in terms of maximising on-site renewable energy production such as solar energy. The significant planning and geometric parameters in relation to the performance indicators provide insight as reference for establishing solar energy friendly urban planning and architectural design guidelines. The methodology and technical workflow as developed can support reliable and efficient feasibility studies, especially in the early stage of urban planning and architectural design.

The aim of this study was to evaluate PCDD/F emission and reduction of a basic SWI in the absence of air pollution controls (APCs). The results indicated that the stack gas and fly ash presented average PCDD/F levels and emission factors of 3.6 ng international toxic equivalent (I-TEQ)/Nm3 and 189.31µg I-TEQ/t and 6.89 ng I-TEQ/g and 137.85µg I-TEQ/t, respectively, much higher than those from large municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWI). PCDD/Fs congener fingerprints indicated that de novo synthesis played a dominant role in the low-temperature post-combustion zone and increased the presence of high-chlorine substituted congeners. On the basis of the emission factor 327.24 µg I-TEQ/t-waste, approximately 3000 g I-TEQ dioxins might be generated in total through basic SWIs and open burning. After refitting an SWI by adding activated carbon injection with a bag filter (ACI+BG), the PCDD/F emissions decreased to mean values of 0.042 ng I-TEQ/Nm3, far below the standard of 0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm3, and the removal efficiency reached 99.13% in terms of I-TEQ. Therefore, it is entirely feasible to considerably reduce PCDD/F emissions by refitting basic SWI, which is positive for the future development of rural solid waste (RSW (RSW) disposal by SWI. © 2019 by the authors.

The growth of the manufacturing sector has been slowing in recent years due to increasingly strict environmental regulations that force factories to cut production. In this study, we discussed whether financial constraints were essential in firms’ decision to control pollution, and matched the Annual Surveys of Industrial Firms dataset with the Ministry of Environmental Protection survey data on firms’ expenditures in industrial waste gas emission control. The relationship between calculated investment-cash flow sensitivity (ICFS) and the environmental investment ratio (the ratio of firms’ expenditures on pollution control to total assets) was analyzed. We found that, overall, financial constraints had a significantly negative effect on firms’ efforts to reduce waste gas emission. State-owned enterprises (SOE) relieved financial pressure mainly by seeking external financing sources to reduce emission. On the other hand, private-owned (POE) and foreign-owned enterprises (FOE), if efficiently financed internally, can reduce waste gas emission by increasing investment in waste gas treatment. This study provided a quantitative analysis on firms’ financial constraints in environmental protection investment, contributing to the development of effective government policies on related issues in China. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Corporate environmental behavior; Financial constraint; Industrial waste gas; Pollution","Emission control; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Investments; Manufacture; Pollution; Surveys; Waste treatment; China; Environmental behavior; Environmental investments; Financial constraints; Industrial waste gas; Manufacturing sector; State owned enterprise; Waste gas treatment; Environmental regulations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060957351

Instead of producing low-value ammonium salts, we present in this study a proof of concept approach using activated carbon particle-based flow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) that enables recovery of much higher value ammonia solution. During electrosorption, ammonium and other cations undergoing treatment migrate across the ion exchange membrane and accumulate in the flowable activated carbon cathode with an increase in local pH due to the Faradaic reactions resulting in the deprotonation of ammonium to uncharged NH 3(aq) . Following the reversal of the polarity, the constantly charged ions (typically Na + , K + and Ca 2+ ) that are present are largely released back into the waste stream while NH 3(aq) can be selectively trapped in the cathode with an ammonia-rich solution, a valuable resource, subsequently produced. Results show that the selectivity of the FCDI process for ammonium ions toward other cations reached 3.7 to 11.4 with the formation of ammonia solution dominating the fate of the nitrogen containing species present under optimal operating conditions. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Ammonia recovery; Ammonia-rich solution; Continuous operation; Flow-electrode capacitive deionization","Activated carbon; Cathodes; Energy utilization; Ion exchange; Ion exchange membranes; Positive ions; Recovery; Salts; Trapped ions; Activated carbon particles; Ammonia solution; Capacitive deionization; Continuous operation; Electrochemical stripping; Faradaic reactions; High energy consumption; Optimal operating conditions; Ammonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063155783

To evaluate the impact of this development strategy on carbon intensity, we used a propensity score matching (PSM) technique and applied a difference-in-differences (DID) approach. The results highlighted three key points. First, while the impact of western development strategy on carbon intensity varies across different provinces, the strategy generally has no help to the reduction of carbon intensity in west region that has been increasing at an annual rate of 12.2 tons per million yuan. Second, the impact of western development strategy on carbon intensity has a hysteresis effect, which means the strategy deteriorates the carbon intensity of west region before improving it. Third, four intermediate factors: industrialization level, the capital intensity, the degree of urbanization, and strengthen of environmental regulation, strategically improved the carbon intensity of west region.

To celebrate its 10 years anniversary, in this Perspective we focus on the state-of-the-art molecular water-oxidation catalysts (MWOCs), the Ru-bda series (bda = 2,2′-bipyridine-6,6′-dicarboxylate), to offer strategies for the design and synthesis of more advanced MWOCs. The O - O bond formation mechanisms, derivatives, applications, and reasons behind the outstanding catalytic activities of Ru-bda catalysts are summarized and discussed. The excellent performance of the Ru-bda catalyst is owing to its unique structural features: the distortion induced 7-coordination and the carboxylate ligands with coordination flexibility, proton-transfer function as well as small steric hindrance. Inspired by the Ru-bda catalysts, we emphasize that the introduction of negatively charged groups, such as the carboxylate group, into ligands is an effective strategy to lower the onset potential of MWOCs. Moreover, distortion of the regular configuration of a transition metal complex by ligand design to generate a wide open site as the catalytic site for binding the substrate as an extra-coordination is proposed as a new concept for the design of efficient molecular catalysts. These inspirations can be expected to play a great role in not only water-oxidation catalysis but also other small molecule activation and conversion reactions involving artificial photosynthesis, such as CO2 reduction and N2 fixation reactions. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Artificial photosynthesis; Carboxylation; Ligands; Metal complexes; Oxidation; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Carboxylate groups; Carboxylate ligands; Conversion reactions; Intrinsic activities; Molecular catalysts; Regular configuration; Small molecule activation; Water oxidation catalysts; Catalyst activity; carboxylic acid; dimer; ligand; oxygen; ruthenium 2,2' bipyridine 6,6' dicarboxylate complex; ruthenium complex; unclassified drug; Article; binding site; catalyst; chemical analysis; chemical bond; chemical structure; covalent bond; electrospinning; enzyme active site; intrinsic activity; molecular interaction; molecular water oxidation catalyst; photosynthesis; proton transport; reaction analysis; synthesis; water analysis; water cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064226482

Traditional methods for estimating source impacts that employ receptor models are limited by the availability of observational data. To better estimate temporally and spatially resolved mobile source impacts on PM2.5, we developed an approach based on a method that uses elemental carbon (EC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxide (NOx) measurements as an indicator of mobile source impacts. We extended the original integrated mobile source indicator (IMSI) method in three aspects. First, we generated spatially resolved indicators using 24-hr average concentrations of EC, CO, and NOx estimated at 4 km resolution by applying a method developed to fuse chemical transport model (Community Multiscale Air Quality Model [CMAQ]) simulations and observations. Second, we used spatially resolved emissions instead of county-level emissions in the IMSI formulation. Third, we spatially calibrated the unitless indicators to annually-averaged mobile source impacts estimated by the receptor model Chemical Mass Balance (CMB). Daily total mobile source impacts on PM2.5, as well as separate gasoline and diesel vehicle impacts, were estimated at 12 km resolution from 2002 to 2008 and 4 km resolution from 2008 to 2010 for Georgia. The total mobile and separate vehicle source impacts compared well with daily CMB results, with high temporal correlation (e.g., R ranges from 0.59 to 0.88 for total mobile sources with 4 km resolution at nine locations). The total mobile source impacts had higher correlation and lower error than the separate gasoline and diesel sources when compared with observation-based CMB estimates. Overall, the enhanced approach provides spatially resolved mobile source impacts that are similar to observation-based estimates and can be used to improve assessment of health effects. Implications: An approach is developed based on an integrated mobile source indicator method to estimate spatiotemporal PM2.5 mobile source impacts. The approach employs three air pollutant concentration fields that are readily simulated at 4 and 12 km resolutions, and is calibrated using PM2.5 source apportionment modeling results to generate daily mobile source impacts in the state of Georgia. The estimated source impacts can be used in investigations of traffic pollution and health. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.",,"air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; particulate matter; procedures; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Georgia; Motor Vehicles; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063550400

The vibrational distribution of the excited state is described by an ensemble of nuclear geometries with vertical transition properties computed for each point in the ensemble through the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method. Compared to TDDFT calculation at stationary geometry, this method provides a better estimate of oscillator strength and distribution of transition dipole moments (TDMs). Four different types of CT states are explored. For the twisted intramolecular CT state, the oscillator strength is promoted strongly and direction distribution of TDMs is concentrated, while it increases less with dispersed TDMs for the through-space CT state. The present work provides a feasible calculation method for TADF emitters and will compensate the flaws of the traditional stationary point TDDFT method which hamper their application in understanding and predicting the photophysical properties of emitters with strong CT characteristics. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Charge transfer; Dipole moment; Excited states; Fluorescence; Direction distribution; Oscillator strengths; Photophysical properties; Thermally activated delayed fluorescences; Time dependent density functional theory; Transition dipole moments; Vertical transitions; Vibrational distribution; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064382983

In this context, the need for high boost level at low engine speed requires the exploration of dual stage boosting systems. At the same time, the increased electrification level of the vehicles enables the usage of electrified boosting systems aiming to exploit the opportunities of high levels of electric power and energy available on-board. The aim of this work is therefore to evaluate, through numerical simulation, the impact of a 48 V electric supercharger (eSC) on vehicle performance and fuel consumption over different transients. The virtual test rig employed for the analysis integrates a 1D CFD fast running engine model representative of a 1.5 L state-of-the-art gasoline engine featuring an eSC in series with the main turbocharger, a dual voltage electric network (12 V + 48 V), a six-speed manual transmission and a vehicle representative of a B-SUV segment car. The evaluation tests chosen for the case study were, on the one hand, vehicle elasticity manoeuvres for the performance assessment and, on the other hand, type approval and RDE driving cycles, for the fuel economy assessment. An evaluation of possible engine and vehicle hardware modifications was also carried out. In particular, the effects of a variation of the final drive ratio, of the increase of the turbine size and of the usage of a high efficiency engine concept (featuring an increased compression ratio from 10 to 12 and a late intake valve closing, exploiting the advantages of a Miller cycle) were investigated. The introduction of a 48 V electric supercharger on a gasoline passenger car was shown in the selected test cases to lead to up to 16% reduction of the elasticity time and up to 9% improvement in fuel consumption when the high efficiency engine concept was considered. © 2019 SAE International.

There is growing evidence on how international experiences (through volunteering, exchanges and placements) benefit the NHS through an innovative workforce that develops international best practice and promotes lifelong learning. Most of this evidence has been captured though surveys to returned international volunteers. However, there is limited evidence about how to quantify the value that returned international healthcare volunteers bring back to their country of residence. Methods: This paper identifies the various benefits to the NHS from returned international healthcare volunteers. The outcomes from returned international volunteers, which have been identified as relevant form a NHS perspective, are linked to three key areas in a multisector analytical framework used by the World Bank to evaluate labour market programmes: (1) Investment climate and Infrastructure, (2) Labor market regulations and institutions, and (3) Education and skills development. The monetary value of these outcomes is quantified through productivity indices which capture the economic value that the achievement of these outcomes have on the quality of the NHS labor force. This model is applied to a dataset of international volunteers provided by the Global Engagement health partnerships. Results: The results suggest that international volunteering generates average productivity gains of up to 37% for doctors and up to 62% for nurses. Average productivity gains estimated from health partnerships data vary depending on duration of volunteering periods and occupational category mix. Conclusions: Our analysis offers a value for money rationale for international volunteering programmes purely from a domestic and NHS perspective. The valuation method considers only one of the aims of international volunteering programmes: the development of the existing and future NHS workforce. Broader benefits for health system strengthening at a global level are acknowledged but not accounted for. Overall, we conclude that if the acquisition of volunteering outcomes is realised, the NHS can accrue a productivity increase of between 24 and 41% per volunteer, with a value ranging from £13,215 to £25,934 per volunteer. © 2019 The Author(s).","Global engagement; Health partnerships; International volunteers; Productivity","analytical framework; best management practice; data set; health services; health worker; international organization; labor market; learning; productivity; achievement; adult; article; climate; education; female; human; human experiment; investment; job market; major clinical study; male; money; national health service; nurse; outcome assessment; productivity; skill; volunteer; workforce; international cooperation; learning; organization and management; physician; productivity; psychology; questionnaire; volunteer; Efficiency; Humans; International Cooperation; Learning; Nurses; Physicians; State Medicine; Surveys and Questionnaires; Volunteers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064842671

For each basin, six discrete liquid-unloading scenarios are considered, consisting of combinations of well types (conventional and unconventional) and liquid-unloading systems (nonplunger, manual plunger lift, and automatic plunger lift). Analysis reveals that methane emissions from liquids unloading are highly variable, with mean TNMEs ranging from 0.0093% to 0.38% across basins. Automatic plunger-lift systems are found to have significantly higher per-well methane emissions rates relative to manual plunger-lift or non-plunger systems and on average constitute 28% of annual methane emissions from liquids unloading over all basins despite representing only ∼0.43% of total natural gas well count. While previous work has advocated that operational malfunctions and abnormal process conditions explain the existence of super-emitters in the natural gas supply chain, this work finds that super-emitters can arise naturally due to variability in underlying component processes. Additionally, average cumulative methane emissions from liquids unloading, attributed to the natural gas supply chain, across all basins are ∼4.8 times higher than those inferred from the 2016 Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). Our new model highlights the importance of technological disaggregation, uncertainty quantification, and regionalization in estimating episodic methane emissions from liquids unloading. These insights can help reconcile discrepancies between ""top-down"" (regional or atmospheric studies) and ""bottom-up"" (component or facility-level) studies.

The research on the ecological environment effects of land use activities in ecologically sensitive suburban areas is important in guiding the healthy and sustainable development of cities. Taking the west suburbs of Hangzhou in China as a case study, we quantified land use changes from Landsat satellite imagery and calculated the value of ecosystem services using the well-established equivalent factor table for land use/cover change (LUCC) and ecosystem services value (ESV). The impacts of LUCC on the ecological environment were analyzed using the transfer matrix of land use and coefficient of elasticity. Results revealed the following. (1) The total ESV in the western suburban area of Hangzhou decreased from $109.95 million in 2000 to $87.09 million in 2016. Moreover, the ESV of gas regulation, climate regulation, soil formation and protection, as well as biodiversity conservation presented a large decrease of more than 25%, especially between 2010 and 2016. (2) The spatial distribution of ESV was high in the west and low in the east. The regions with a significant reduction in ESV were mainly distributed in the eastern town of Wuchang and in Jincheng Town located in the midwest valley. (3) Industrial agglomeration activities in the ecologically sensitive suburban area emerged as the primary factor influencing ESV for various land uses. The elasticity indicator for assessing the responses to ESV changes relative to LUCC showed that 1% of the land conversion in this area resulted in average changes in ESV of 4.1% after the establishment of the industrial agglomeration area. (4) The increase in construction land was associated with a significant decrease in forest area because of the policy of cultivated land requisition–compensation balance and development strategies for low-slope hilly lands. Consequently, the ESV in the ecologically sensitive suburban areas rapidly declined. © 2019 by the authors.

Based on our previous field study, a pot experiment with isotopic13C labelling was designed in this study. The objective was to investigate the main C sources for CH4 emissions and the key environmental factor with the application of organic fertilizer in paddies. Results indicated that 28.6%, 64.5%, 0.4%, and 6.5% of13C was respectively distributed in CO2, the plants, soil, and CH4 at the rice tillering stage. In total, organically fertilized paddy soil emitted 3.51 kg·CH4 ha−1 vs. 2.00 kg·CH4 ha−1 for the no fertilizer treatment. Maximum CH4 fluxes from organically fertilized (0.46 mg·m−2·h−1) and non-fertilized (0.16 mg·m−2·h−1) soils occurred on day 30 (tillering stage). The total percentage of CH4 emissions derived from rice photosynthesis C was 49%, organic fertilizer C &lt; 0.34%, and native soil C &gt; 51%. Therefore, the increased CH4 emissions from paddy soil after organic fertilization were mainly derived from native soil and photosynthesis. The 16S rRNA sequencing showed Methanosarcina (64%) was the dominant methanogen in paddy soil. Organic fertilization increased the relative abundance of Methanosarcina, especially in rhizosphere.

This paper aims to control the pollution emissions of the Chinese electric power industry and enhance its electric-generation capacity though pollution-emission allocation patterns and inefficiency elimination. The data envelopment analysis centralized allocation model (DEA-CA) under metafrontier framework is adopted to distribute pollution emissions and electric-generation capacity considering technological heterogeneity at regional and national levels. The empirical result shows that the emission reduction responsibility is directly proportional to regional power generation performance. The metafrontier framework allocates emission permits to combine the national and regional, which makes the adjustment of each province more reasonable. At last, the relationship between the aggregate optimal electricity capacity and the pollution emission control coefficient is shown to follow an inverted U-shape curve, which implies that a modest emission control policy might be more appropriate for the electric power industry to achieve the joint optimizing goal of electricity generation enhancement and pollution emission control. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Metafrontier; Pollutant emissions","atmospheric pollution; data envelopment analysis; electrical power; electricity generation; emission control; energy efficiency; heterogeneity; pollution control; technological change; China; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; China; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; pollution; prevention and control; statistics and numerical data; technology; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Power Plants; Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061975162

Five predefined fractions were apportioned based on ambient measurements: elemental and organic carbon, from combustion of biomass (ECbb and OCbb) and from fossil-fuel (ECff and OCff) sources, and remaining non-fossil organic carbon (OCrnf), dominated by natural sources.</p>OCrnf made a larger contribution to TCp than anthropogenic sources (ECbb, OCbb, ECff, and OCff) at four out of nine sites in fall, reflecting the vegetative season, whereas anthropogenic sources dominated at all but one site in winter/spring. Biomass burning (OCbb&thinsp;+&thinsp;ECbb) was the major anthropogenic source at the central European sites in fall, whereas fossil-fuel (OCff&thinsp;+&thinsp;ECff) sources dominated at the southernmost and the two northernmost sites. Residential wood burning emissions explained 30&thinsp;%-50&thinsp;% of TCp at most sites in the first week of sampling in fall, showing that this source can be the dominant one, even outside the heating season. In winter/spring, biomass burning was the major anthropogenic source at all but two sites, reflecting increased residential wood burning emissions in the heating season. Fossil-fuel sources dominated EC at all sites in fall, whereas there was a shift towards biomass burning for the southernmost sites in winter/spring.</p>Model calculations based on base-case emissions (mainly officially reported national emissions) strongly underpredicted observational derived levels of OCbb and ECbb outside Scandinavia. Emissions based on a consistent bottom-up inventory for residential wood burning (and including intermediate volatility compounds, IVOCs) improved model results compared to the base-case emissions, but modeled levels were still substantially underestimated compared to observational derived OCbb and ECbb levels at the southernmost sites.</p>Our study shows that natural sources are a major contributor to carbonaceous aerosol in Europe, even in fall and in winter/spring, and that residential wood burning emissions are equally as large as or larger than that of fossil-fuel sources, depending on season and region. The poorly constrained residential wood burning emissions for large parts of Europe show the obvious need to improve emission inventories, with harmonization of emission factors between countries likely being the most important step to improve model calculations for biomass burning emissions, and European PM2.5 concentrations in general. © Author(s) 2019.",,"aerosol; anthropogenic source; biomass burning; concentration (composition); fossil fuel; particulate matter; rural area; seasonal variation; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063944970

We investigated the impact of threshold relationships on our ability to project ecological change outside the observational record (e.g., the 21st century), using the challenge of predicting late-Holocene fire regimes in boreal forest and tundra ecosystems. Location : Boreal forest and tundra ecosystems of Alaska. Time period : 850–2100 CE. Major taxa studied : Not applicable. Methods: We informed a set of published statistical models, designed to predict the 30-year probability of fire occurrence based on climatological normals, with downscaled global climate model data for 850–1850 CE. To evaluate model performance outside the observational record and the implications of threshold relationships, we compared modelled estimates with mean fire return intervals estimated from 29 published lake-sediment palaeofire reconstructions. To place our results in the context of future change, we evaluate changes in the location of threshold to burning under 21st-century climate projections. Results: Model–palaeodata comparisons highlight spatially varying accuracy across boreal forest and tundra regions, with variability strongly related to the summer temperature threshold to burning: sites closer to this threshold exhibited larger prediction errors than sites further away from this threshold. Modifying the modern (i.e., 1950–2009) fire–climate relationship also resulted in significant changes in modelled estimates. Under 21st-century climate projections, increasing proportions of Alaskan tundra and boreal forest will approach and surpass the temperature threshold to burning, with > 50% exceeding this threshold by > 2 °C by 2070–2099. Main conclusions : Our results highlight a high sensitivity of statistical projections to changing threshold relationships and data uncertainty, implying that projections of future ecosystem change in threshold-governed ecosystems will be accompanied by notable uncertainty. This work also suggests that ecological responses to climate change will exhibit high spatio-temporal variability as different regions approach and surpass climatic thresholds over the 21st century. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; fire ecology; nonlinear relationships; palaeoecology; statistical modelling; thresholds; transferability","boreal forest; climate change; ecosystem dynamics; fire behavior; Holocene; numerical model; paleoecology; statistical analysis; threshold; tundra; Alaska; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060983684

The instrument, a parallel-plate particle separator (PPPS), is designed to classify aerosol particles according to their charging states and measure their quantities. The trajectories of submicron particles in the PPPS are numerically analyzed using the Lagrangian particle tracking method, taking into account the Brownian force and the electrostatic force. First, it is confirmed that the deterioration in the classification accuracy observed in the experiment is due to Brownian diffusion. The optimal condition that improves the accuracy is investigated through a parametric study by varying the balance of flow rates at the inlets, the geometry of the inlet and exit sections, and the applied voltage. It is found that decreasing the flow rate of the central inlet for aerosol or narrowing the central inlet improves the accuracy. The dependence of the accuracy on the flow rate is found to be in accordance with the experimental results. For charged particles, an optimum voltage that maximizes the classification accuracy is found. On the basis of the simulation results, we propose a method to determine the charge distribution of aerosol from the number of particles counted at each exit of the PPPS. In the test assuming aerosol in the air, the charge distribution determined from the number count at the exits is found to perfectly agree with the charge distribution specified at the inlet.

We found that the research and management communities need guidance on how to interpret and apply existing information. Climate information needs in the PPR are driven by the need to understand how projected changes in precipitation will impact prairie wetland ecology. Primary needs include guidance towards selecting, interpreting, and using various climate information products to understand impacts and explanations of the differences between new products and previously available information. Another need includes information on how the societal responses to climate change will further impact ecological systems. Existing management priorities, limited institutional resources, and limited ecological data are remaining barriers that can be ameliorated by leveraging existing policy processes or trusted sources of information to provide guidance, thereby reducing time and costs associated with using climate information in wildlife policy planning. Throughout, we emphasize the importance of the social and ecological aspects of the decision-making context to shape climate information needs, barriers, and entry points.

According to the “reference scenario” based on observed market trends the electricity demand of white goods is expected to decrease by 8% between 2015 and 2035. The analysis shows that this is the combined result of having more energy efficient appliances in the stock, a higher appliance ownership level, and an increased number of dwellings. The “maximum efficiency” scenario based on new technologies shows an electricity saving potential of white goods of 25%. These findings confirm that energy efficiency standards and labelling can be effective instruments for achieving energy and CO2 emissions reduction targets. The assessment for cost effectiveness indicates the current limited scope for economically viable energy efficiency improvements of white goods, while novel technological solutions are likely to expand the economic energy efficiency potential. Since white goods and their components are mass-produced and traded internationally, similar findings can be expected for other countries with comparable legislation (e.g. EU member states) but country-specific analyses are nevertheless recommended. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Appliances; Energy efficiency; Labelling; New technologies; Policy","Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Electric appliances; Electric power utilization; Emission control; Energy policy; Labeling; Public policy; Development and applications; Electricity demands; Electricity saving potentials; Electricity-consumption; Energy efficiency improvements; Energy efficiency standards; Energy-efficient appliances; Technological solution; Energy efficiency; demand-side management; ecolabeling; electricity generation; electricity supply; electronic equipment; energy efficiency; energy policy; legislation; scenario analysis; technological development; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060897822

Prepared products were well-characterized for their optical and structural properties. Surface morphology of the prepared samples were studied with the influential parameters such as surfactant concentration, sonication time, temperature, pH and compared the effect with normal mechanical stirring. Morphology was highly dependent on the experimental parameters. The predicted growth mechanism to obtain superstructures of the samples prepared by sonochemical method was discussed. Photoluminescence (PL) studies exhibit characteristic emission peaks of Pr 3+ ions in the range 500–750 nm. The highest PL intensity was obtained for 5 mol% of Pr 3+ doped samples. Further, co-doping with Li + , Na + and K + ions into Pr 3+ activated SrTiO 3 phosphor led to an enhancement in luminescence intensity by reducing the parity restriction of electric dipole transitions. As a consequence of suitable local distortion of the crystal field surrounding to the Pr 3+ activator ions. The maximum PL intensity was observed for Li + (1 wt%) co-doped SrTiO 3 :Pr 3+ (5 mol%) samples. Furthermore, Li + ion was the best charge compensator, because of it reduced the defects emission and also increased the emission intensity of Pr 3+ significantly. Prepared phosphors exhibit short lifetime, good quantum efficiency; excellent color purity which is near to the NTSC standards. Prepared fluorescent powders were used as a dusting powder for the rapid visualization of latent fingerprints under UV light of 254 nm.

This study develops an event-based probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) model for livestock snow disasters in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) region and derives risk assessment results based on historical climate conditions (1980-2015) and present-day prevention capacity. In the model, a hazard module was developed to identify and simulate individual snow disaster events based on boosted regression trees. By combining a fitted quantitative vulnerability function and exposure derived from vegetation type and grassland carrying capacity, we estimated risk metrics based on livestock mortality and mortality rate. In our results, high-risk regions include the Nyainqêntanglha Range, Tanggula Range, Bayankhar Mountains and the region between the Kailas Range and the neighbouring Himalayas. In these regions, annual livestock mortality rates were estimated as < 2% and mortality was estimated as < 2 sheep unit km-1 at a return period of 20 years. Prefectures identified with extremely high risk include Guoluo in Qinghai Province and Naqu, and Shigatse in the Tibet Autonomous Region. In these prefectures, a snow disaster event with a return period of 20 years or higher can easily claim total losses of more than 500 000 sheep units. Our event-based PRA results provide a quantitative reference for preparedness and insurance solutions in reducing mortality risk. The methodology developed here can be further adapted to future climate change risk analyses and provide important information for planning climate change adaption in the QTP region. ©2019 Author(s).",,"adaptation; climate change; disaster management; livestock farming; mortality; probability; risk assessment; snow; vulnerability; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063908435

This is because the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications are becoming more popular in the field of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) so as to further enhance traffic efficiency, safety, emissions reduction and infotainment applications. Over the last few years, a number of routing protocols in VANETs have been developed. In particular, position-based routing protocols have attracted the most interest in VANETs as they are suitable for a frequently changeable network topology and highly dynamic nature of vehicular nodes. This paper develops a new Mobility Prediction Based Routing Protocol (MPBRP) for neighborhood detection, packet transmission and path recovery in VANETs by using driver's intention collected from the positioning systems. Several major contributions are made in the paper: (1) Combining both predictive forwarding strategy and recovery strategy to detect neighbors and transfer packets. (2) Utilizing the predicted position and angles in a pre-defined time with considering driver's intention to select the neighboring nodes and discover the transmission path. (3) Validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed protocol by creating a unified simulation platform (Veins) and implementing it in real world scenarios. (4) Enhancing the overall performance as the proposed routing protocol achieved competitive improvement over existing protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and average hops about 26.22%, 21.89% and 20.79% by average in grid-based scenario, and about 26.04%,23.14% and 18.51% by average in urban scenario respectively. © 2019 IEEE.","Driver's intention; Geographic (position-based) routing protocols; Mobility prediction; V2V communication; Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs)","Clustering algorithms; Computer system recovery; Emission control; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Internet protocols; Network routing; Routing protocols; Simulation platform; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicles; Driver's intention; Intelligent transportation systems; Mobility predictions; Packet delivery ratio; Position-based routing protocol; V2V communications; Vehicle to infrastructure (V2I); Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Vehicular ad hoc networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068577417

Most of the existing EAD applications have been developed and tested in traffic-free scenarios or in a fully connected environment, where the presence and behavior of all surrounding vehicles are detectable. In this paper, we describe a prediction-based EAD strategy that can be applied toward more realistic scenarios, where the surrounding vehicles can be either a connected or non-connected. Unlike highway scenarios, predicting speed trajectories along signalized corridors is much more challenging due to disturbances from signals, traffic queues, and pedestrians. Based on vehicle activity data available via inter-vehicle communication or onboard sensing (e.g., by radar), we evaluate three state-of-the-art nonlinear regression models to perform short-term speed forecasting of the preceding vehicle. It turns out radial basis function neural network outperformed both Gaussian process and multi-layer perceptron network in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Using signal phase and timing information and the predicted state of the preceding vehicle, our prediction-based EAD algorithm achieved better fuel economy and emissions reduction in urban traffic and queues at intersections. Results from the numerical simulation using the next generation simulation data set show that the proposed prediction-based EAD system achieve 4.0% energy savings and 4.0% - 41.7% pollutant emission reduction compared with a conventional car following strategy. Prediction-based EAD saves 1.9% energy and reduces criteria pollutant emissions by 1.9% - 33.4% compared with an existing EAD algorithm without prediction in urban traffic. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","criteria pollutant emissions reduction; eco-approach and departure; energy consumption; preceding traffic constraints; Vehicle speed forecasting","Computational efficiency; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Fuel economy; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Network layers; Radial basis function networks; Regression analysis; Traffic signals; eco-approach and departure; Inter vehicle communications; Multi layer perceptron networks; Pollutant emissions reduction; preceding traffic constraints; Radial basis function neural networks; Short-term speed forecasting; Vehicle speed; Vehicle to vehicle communications",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053343427

Thus, for sustainable land management, ecosystem services should be evaluated and monitored. In this study, based on Landsat TM/ETM data, we quantitatively evaluated the losses of ecosystem service values (ESV) in three sections of the agro-pastoral ecotone from 1980–2015. The results were as follows: (1) the main characteristic of the land conversions was that a large area of grassland was converted into cultivated land in the agro-pastoral ecotone; (2) on the spatial scale, the ESV losses of the agro-pastoral ecotone can be called an “inclined surface” in the direction of the northeast to southwest, and the northeastern section of the agro-pastoral ecotone lost more ESV than the middle and northwest sections (p < 0.05), on the temporal scale, the order of losses was 1990–2000 > 1980–1990 > 2000–2015; (3) the agro-pastoral ecotone lost more ESV, which was mainly due to four kinds of land conversion, which were grassland that was transformed into cultivated land, grassland transformed into unused land, grassland transformed into built-up areas, and cultivated land transformed into built-up areas; (4) although these land conversions were curbed after the implementation of protection policies at the end of the 1990s, due to reduced precipitation and increasing temperatures, the agro-pastoral ecotone will face a more severe situation in the future; and, (5) during the period of 1990–2015, the overall dynamic processes of increasing population gradually expanded to the sparsely populated pastoral area. Therefore, we believe that human interventions are the main cause of ecological deterioration in the agro-pastoral ecotone. This study provides references for fully understanding the regional differences in the ecological and environmental effects of land use change and it helps to objectively evaluate ecological civilization construction in the agro-pastoral ecotone of Northern China. © 2019 by the authors.

We present 0.″2-0.″4 resolution images of the rest-frame 188 and 419 μm dust continuum and the CO(6-5), H2O(211-202), and Jup = 2 H2O+ line emission. We also report the detection of H2O(211-202) in this source. The dust continuum and molecular gas emission are resolved into a nearly complete ∼1.″5 diameter Einstein ring plus a weaker image in the center, which is caused by a special dual deflector lensing configuration. The observed line profiles of the CO(6-5), H2O(211-202), and Jup = 2 H2O+ lines are strikingly similar. In the source plane, we reconstruct the dust continuum images and the spectral cubes of the CO, H2O, and H2O+ line emission at sub-kiloparsec scales. The reconstructed dust emission in the source plane is dominated by a compact disk with an effective radius of 0.7 ± 0.1 kpc plus an overlapping extended disk with a radius twice as large. While the average magnification for the dust continuum is μ ∼ 10-11, the magnification of the line emission varies from 5 to 22 across different velocity components. The line emission of CO(6-5), H2O(211-202), and H2O+ have similar spatial and kinematic distributions. The molecular gas and dust content reveal that G09v1.97 is a gas-rich major merger in its pre-coalescence phase, with a total molecular gas mass of ∼1011 M. Both of the merging companions are intrinsically ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with infrared luminosities LIR reaching 4 × 1012 L, and the total LIR of G09v1.97 is (1.4 ± 0.7)×1013 L. The approaching southern galaxy (dominating from V = -400 to -150 km s-1 relative to the systemic velocity) shows no obvious kinematic structure with a semi-major half-light radius of as = 0.4 kpc, while the receding galaxy (0 to 350 km s-1) resembles an as = 1.2 kpc rotating disk. The two galaxies are separated by a projected distance of 1.3 kpc, bridged by weak line emission (-150 to 0 km s-1) that is co-spatially located with the cold dust emission peak, suggesting a large amount of cold interstellar medium (ISM) in the interacting region. As one of the most luminous star-forming dusty high-redshift galaxies, G09v1.97 is an exceptional source for understanding the ISM in gas-rich starbursting major merging systems at high redshift. © ESO 2019.","Galaxies: high-redshift; Galaxies: ISM; Gravitational lensing: strong; ISM: molecules; Radio lines: ISM; Submillimeter: galaxies","Cosmology; Dust; Gases; Kinematics; Merging; Molecules; Red Shift; Rotating disks; Stars; Galaxies: ISM; Galaxies:high-redshift; Gravitational lensing: strong; ISM: molecules; Radio lines: ISM; Submillimeter: galaxies; Galaxies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065255290

The three systems were located in different regions: Hexi Oasis (dry arid, intensive crop/livestock production), Loess Plateau (semi-arid/semi-humid, dominated by extensive crop production) and Qinling Bashan Mountains (moist-subtropical, extensive crop/livestock production). The data used were collated from 525 farms (35 farms/county and 5 counties/region) thorough official statistical records and farm survey. The ANOVA analysis of average data from 2012 to 2016 indicated that Loess Plateau had a higher CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 -eq) emission factor per kg DM product of maize and flaxseed than other 2 regions (P&lt; 0.05), while a lower rate per kg beef carcass weight. Qinling Bashan Mountains had a lower emission factor for producing 1 ¥ of crop products than other 2 regions (P&lt; 0.05). The evaluation of change in GHG emissions from 1991 to 2016 indicated that CO 2 -eq per kg carcass of pork, beef, and lamb in the 3 production systems generally declined during this period, but emissions per kg DM of potato, rapeseed, and maize increased. However, CO 2 -eq per ¥ of crop and livestock products tended to decrease from 1991 to 2016, driven mainly by market price and productivity. The present results provide the benchmark information for local policy makers and agricultural industries to make informed decisions for mitigation of GHG emissions from agricultural production in Gansu of China. © 2019, University of Agriculture.

Although laboratory studies reported that biochar applications can reduce N2O emissions, the number of field-based studies is still limited. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effects of four different types of biochars and their interactions with a variety of environmental parameters on N2O emissions from an Andosol field over a 2-year period (2015–2016). The field experiment consisted of five treatments: chemical (mineral) fertilizer without biochar (CF), chemical fertilizer with rice husk biochar (RH), chemical fertilizer with chipped bamboo biochar (BA), chemical fertilizer with chipped hardwood biochar (HW), and chemical fertilizer with chipped wood briquette biochar made from a mixture of softwood and hardwood sawdust (SH). Biochar was applied at a rate of 25 t ha−1. The NH4+–N and NO3−–N adsorption capacity of biochars before application was also measured. NH4+–N adsorption capacity differed among the biochars, while biochars showed very little NO3−–N absorption capacity. The cumulative N2O emission of biochar treatment to that of the CF treatment during the N2O peak period (17 days) after biochar and fertilizer application increased with the increase of NH4+–N adsorption capacity of the biochar. However, biochar application did not affect the cumulative N2O emission over 2 years in the field condition. The lack of significant differences may have been due to Andosol CEC (31.3 cmol(+) kg−1), which was higher than that of the biochars (4.52–19.65 cmol(+) kg−1), and also high pH-buffering capacity of Andosol. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Andosol; Biochar; Field experiment; Inorganic N adsorption; Nitrous oxide","Andosol; biochar; experimental study; fertilizer application; inorganic nitrogen; nitrous oxide; soil amendment; soil emission; upland region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063013340

Next, we explain the characteristics, causes, impacts, and countermeasures of this phenomenon, using the severe heat island in Tokyo as an example, with the aim of developing guidelines for tackling this issue in developing countries. In addition, we use several evaluation case studies to discuss heat island mitigation measures incorporating life-cycle assessments.

Phenological modeling is one of prediction approches that play this role when it concerns flowering stages, particularly in the context of global warming mostly uncertain and continuously in change and the difficult adaptation of fruit trees to the future climatic trends. This study was aimed to develop and select a sequential model with best fit in three contrasting Mediterranean locations, including Moroccan sites characterized by mild climate in order to compare them with European sites (temperate climate), where phenological models were previously developed. Full flowering is the phenological stage investigated in this study. Statistical analysis of mean temperature during the period from October to April showed a significant difference between Moroccan and European sites. Consequently, full flowering dates observed in all locations demonstrated different behaviors in response to temperature variation during winter and spring period. Modeling process showed a sequential model with good fit to account for the full flowering stage observations with RMSE of 4.4 days of the validated data. Output of the fitted model revealed a delayed date of breaking dormancy and consequently a long endodormancy period in Morocco, intermediate in France and short in Italy, showing a gradient from the south (Morocco), where apple trees showed difficulty of adaptation due to lack of chilling, to the north areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Apple tree; Mediterranean; Modeling; Phenology","adaptation; deciduous tree; ecological modeling; flowering; global warming; model validation; phenology; temperature gradient; Europe; France; Italy; Mediterranean Region; Morocco; Malus x domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060527828

However, the optimal syngas compositions and fuel supply strategies in RCCI combustion are significantly affected by engine configurations, which have not been investigated yet. In this study, by integrating the KIVA-3V code and the non-dominated sort genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), the optimizations for a 0.477 L single-cylinder engine with shallow/wide piston bowl (Engine A) and a 1.325 L single-cylinder engine with conventional omega-type piston (Engine B) under the syngas/diesel RCCI combustion were performed. The optimized operating parameters include the fuel-supply strategies, syngas compositions, and intake conditions. The results indicate that the fuel-supply strategy is flexible in Engine A due to the shallow/wide piston bowl and the relatively small cylinder bore. The single injection strategy with high premix ratio is able to achieve the high combustion efficiency in Engine A, and the injection timing is restricted around -35 °CA ATDC to realize the desired combustion phase. In addition, the injection pressure is restricted around 100 MPa to avoid the fuel impingement and wetting wall phenomenon. For Engine B with the larger displacement and omega-type piston, the double injection with early pilot injection timing is necessary to improve the combustion efficiency of the near-wall syngas. The pilot injection ratio is controlled in a narrow range to avoid the local high-temperature combustion region and provide sufficient high reactivity fuel in the piston bowl. In order to reduce NOx emissions and improve combustion efficiency, higher initial pressure and temperature are applied in Engine A with the shallow piston bowl. For improving the fuel efficiency, high H2 ratio in the combustible gas with low diluent ratio are recommended for both engines. © 2019 SAE International.

Yet there is little knowledge about the adaptive capacity of urban forms to climate stress, or of an appropriate assessment method. Through a case study on the urban heat island (UHI) in Xiamen City, China, we propose a novel approach that integrates several aspects to assess the adaptive capacity of urban form to climate stress. These aspects include the calculation of urban form, the determination of climate stress and land use modeling. Our results demonstrate that this approach is applicable for assessing the adaptive capacity of urban form in the historical, current and future multitime scales. Both urban planning aspects (e.g. population density, land use mix, road density and percentage of green open space) and landscape features (e.g. shape complexity, contiguity and compactness) are found to be key urban form drivers affecting UHI. The adaptive capacity of the urban form to UHI in Xiamen City has been declining dramatically, and is expected to continue to decline in the future as long as adaptation continues to not be integrated in urban land use planning. Our analysis suggests that urban managers need to review the past development model of land use and rethink the current approach to urban planning: most urgent is the need to take full account of adaptation in future land use planning and implementation, so as to enhance climate resilience. © 2019 The Author(s).

This paper proposes a recycling-equilibrium strategy from a regional policy perspective that integrates circular economic theory and modeling techniques to resolve phosphogypsum-related pollution problems. Specifically, three typical conflicts are analyzed to describe the problem complexity, and a multi-objective bi-level programming model is formulated under uncertainty for the assignment of practical disposal limits to achieve a compromise agreement between the multiple decision makers. A solution approach that employs fuzzy theory, an acceptable reduction target, and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions is developed to identify the optimum phosphogypsum stack allowance allocation mechanism for regional authorities and an optimal purchase-transportation plan for the phosphate fertilizer plants. The results from the practical case validated the feasibility and efficiency of the formulated method and proved that a recycling-equilibrium strategy based stack allowance allocation mechanism could successfully achieve phosphogypsum pollution mitigation. The practical application findings were: (1) different phosphate fertilizer plants have different sensitivities towards changing stack reduction targets; (2) local authority revenue and phosphogypsum stack quantities are mainly impacted by environmental protection targets; (3) allocating larger stack allowances to phosphate fertilizer plants with smaller emissions coefficients can realize better phosphogypsum reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Conflicts; Phosphate fertilizer plants; Phosphogypsum pollution control; Recycling-equilibrium strategy","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Economics; Gypsum; Phosphate fertilizers; Recycling; Uncertainty analysis; Bilevel programming models; Circular economy; Conflicts; Environmental contamination; Equilibrium strategy; Karush Kuhn tucker condition; Phosphogypsum; Socio-economic development; Pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059870143

The ractopamine (Rac) target molecules are specifically captured on the electrode surface by aptamer recognition. The ECL signal is quenched by energy transfer from the luminophore to benzoquinone compounds, which are oxidative products of Rac from the electrochemical scanning process. The proposed ECL aptasensor exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity and excellent selectivity for Rac detection. The linear response ranged over Rac concentrations from 1.5 × 10-12 M to 1.5 × 10-8 M with a detection limit of 4.1 × 10-14 M (S/N = 3). The detection recovery of Rac in real meat samples confirmed the satisfactory performance of the method. This study describes a versatile ECL aptasensor based on the combined functions of luminous nanospheres and Au NPs, indicating its potential application for the ultrasensitive analysis of targets in diverse systems. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064169668

However, present knowledge is still not enough to understand this paramount aspect of global warming. By using climate model simulations, we first highlight that regional warming amplifications directly following anthropogenic emission would torment many undeveloped countries. Then, we find that cloud has the largest contribution to polar amplification, rather than the frequently blamed sea ice decline. The summertime sea ice decline plays the second role in generating strong wintertime polar amplification via lagged energy release. Our findings also propose that heat uptake by the deeper ocean greatly favors the terrestrial amplification. Additionally, the cloud also shows its importance in helping dryland amplification. Our findings suggest that these robust regional warming amplifications are very likely inevitable under anthropogenic emission, therefore strictest global mitigation is required to prevent unacceptable warming over the high risk regions. ©2019.

Meanwhile, electrochemical evaluations state clearly that the mass activity of Pt/C@NiRu layered double hydroxide and Pt/C@NiRuCe layered double hydroxide separately is 2032 mA·mg−1Pt and 2475 mA·mg−1Pt in alkaline solution. And unexpectedly, the obtained Pt/C@NiRu layered double hydroxide with mass activity of 686 mA·mg−1Pt and Pt/C@NiRuCe layered double hydroxide with mass activity of 725 mA·mg−1Pt possess better electrocatalytic performance and CO resistance than home-made Pt/C (273 mA·mg−1Pt) in acid medium.

However, the impact mechanism of socio-economic factors on primary particulate matter (PM) emissions remains unclear. Based on the provincial primary PM emission data in the YRD from 1995 to 2014, this paper used Slope, Theil index, and Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIAPAT) models to quantitatively identify the regional differences of primary PM emissions and explore the key influencing factors. The results showed that primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particulate (PM10), and total suspended particulate (TSP) emissions all featured an upward trend of fluctuation over the study period. The regional differences in primary TSP emissions in the YRD region was gradually shrinking and the regional differences of primary PM2.5 and PM10 emissions presented a rising trend of fluctuation. The estimated coeffcient of population size, energy structure, and fixed assets investment (FAI) were all significantly positive at the level of 1%. The negative effect of economic growth on energy PM emissions was significant under the level of 1%. The increase of foreign direct investment (FDI) had different effects on primary PM2.5, PM10, and TSP emissions. In addition, the influence of energy intensity on primary PM emission from energy consumption are mainly negative but not significant even under the level of 10%. These conclusions have guiding significance for the formulation of PM emission reduction policy without affecting YRD's economic development. © 2019 by the authors.","Influencing factors; Primary PMemissions; Regional inequality; STIRPAT model; Theil index","economic development; economic growth; emission; energy intensity; foreign direct investment; haze; particulate matter; quantitative analysis; socioeconomic status; China; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066879838

However, there are often significant institutional challenges for the design and implementation of integrated policies in practice. There are also few scholarly examples of integrated landscape approaches to REDD+, particularly at subnational levels, and little is known about how or why they have emerged. To address this gap, this article explores the evolution of an integrated landscape approach to REDD+ in Vietnam through the lens of policy design and policy learning. Our research was structured around three objectives: 1) Investigate challenges for the design and implementation of intra- and inter-sectoral policies at national and subnational levels of REDD+ governance 2) Explore how these challenges have led to policy change and improved policy integration 3) Evaluate if policy changes represent “shallow” or “deep” forms of policy learning. We found that limited policy capacity, problematic policy design processes, and bureaucratic politics have been significant barriers for vertical and horizontal policy integration. However, initial challenges have also led to instrumental and social policy learning, evident in changes to policy tools, goals, targets, and agents. We found that a regional landscape approach that leverages existing state institutions has emerged because it allows REDD+ actors to exploit scarce resources for design and implementation. We conclude that existing state policies and political commitment are essential for realizing an integrated landscape approach to REDD+, but that the process of REDD+ implementation may also contribute to “deeper” policy learning among state actors, and substantive reforms in state institutions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,"Deforestation; Land use; Design and implementations; Forest degradation; Policy integration; Reducing emissions; Regional landscapes; Scarce resources; Sectoral policies; Through the lens; Design; Capacity; Deforestation; Design; Integration; Interest; Land Use; Processes; Vietnam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056180829

However, CO2 emissions in the industrial sector stagnated due to China's economic slowdown since 2012. This paper aims to estimate the CO2 emissions in China's industrial sector during 2010–2016 to deliver sectoral and regional details and uncover the reasons for the emissions stagnancy. We find that the emission stagnancy is a result of decreasing energy intensity and economic slowdown. Industrial restructuring within the entire industrial sector and emission intensity (emissions per unit of energy consumption) had limited effect on the emissions reduction. From the sectoral perspective, iron &amp; steel and nonmetal sectors accounted for most reduced emissions in China's industrial sectors during 2014–2016. From the regional perspective, the emissions decrease mainly occurred in western and northeastern provinces, rather than more developed coastal provinces. Mitigation policies are raised, including the industrial structure shift from energy-intensive sectors to other sectors and addressing the emissions mitigation in rapid industrializing provinces, such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia, so that an earlier and lower emission peak of China's industrial sectors can be achieved. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; CO2 emissions; Governance; Industrial sector; Stagnancy","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy utilization; China; CO2 emissions; Governance; Industrial sector; Stagnancy; Industrial economics; carbon emission; economic conditions; emission control; governance approach; industrial emission; industrial structure; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061335262

Especially access to the bandgap is needed to figure out which path the charge carriers take, key to further understand and optimize the latest generations of thin film LED technology. Here, state-of-the-art organic LEDs are treated like solar cells by measuring the open-circuit voltage under UV illumination. A variation of the illumination intensity and temperature gives access to the effective bandgap, the ideality factor and the recombination strength. A differential evaluation approach is implemented, yielding the full temperature and intensity dependence of these parameters. A radiative and a non-radiative recombination process are identified and used to reconstruct the current density dependence of the external quantum efficiency. All recombination events are related to an effective bandgap that suggests free charge recombination between the guest and the host material of the emission layer. This approach will thus help to identify and eliminate non-radiative recombination losses in LEDs based on other type of molecules emitters and materials, such as perovskites or quantum dots, as well. Knowing the effective bandgap will also be essential to realize LEDs with the lowest possible driving voltages. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This study provides interannual and seasonal variations in light absorption properties, chemical composition, and sources of water-soluble BrC (WS-BrC) based on PM10 samples collected in Godavari, Nepal, from April 2012 to May 2014. The mass absorption efficiency of WS-BrC at 365 nm (MAE365) shows a clear seasonal variability, with the highest MAE365 of 1.05 ± 0.21 m2 g-1 in premonsoon season and the lowest in monsoon season (0.59 ± 0.16 m2 g-1). The higher MAE365 values in nonmonsoon seasons are associated with fresh biomass burning emissions. This is further substantiated by a strong correlation (r = 0.79, P &lt; 0.01) between Abs365 (light absorption coefficient at 365 nm) and levoglucosan. We found, using fluorescence techniques, that humic-like and protein-like substances are the main chromophores in WS-BrC and responsible for 80.2 ± 4.1% and 19.8 ± 4.1% of the total fluorescence intensity, respectively. BrC contributes to 8.78 ± 3.74% of total light absorption over the 300-700 nm wavelength range. Considering the dominant contribution of biomass burning to BrC over Godavari, this study suggests that reduction in biomass burning emission may be a practical method for climate change mitigation in South Asia.

A commonly used data-driven regionalization framework for studying air quality, identifying areas with similar air pollution behavior and locating emission sources involves an incorporation of the principal component analysis (PCA) with cluster analysis (CA) methods. However, the traditional PCA does not consider spatial heterogeneity, which is a notable issue in geographic studies. This article focuses on extracting the local principal components of air quality indicators based on a geographically weighted principal component analysis (GWPCA) method, which is superior to the PCA with considering spatial heterogeneity. Then, a spatial cluster analysis (SCA) is used to identify the areas with similar air pollution behavior based on the results of the GWPCA. The results are all visualized and show that the GWPCA has a higher explanatory ability than the traditional PCA. Our modified framework based on the GWPCA and SCA for assessing air quality can effectively guide environmentalists and geographers in evaluating and improving air quality from a spatial perspective. Furthermore, the visualization results can be used by city planners and the government for monitoring and managing air pollution. Finally, policy suggestions are recommended for mitigating air pollution via regional collaboration. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; China; GWPCA; Spatial clustering; Spatiotemporal analysis","Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Cluster analysis; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Regional planning; Sulfur dioxide; China; GWPCA; Regional collaboration; Spatial clustering; Spatiotemporal analysis; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Visualization results; Weighted principal component analysis; Principal component analysis; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; cluster analysis; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; pollutant source; spatiotemporal analysis; sulfur dioxide; urbanization; air pollution; air quality; article; China; cluster analysis; government; human; human experiment; monitoring; principal component analysis; regionalization; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061577758

A total of 612 farmers (328 females and 284 males) were interviewed using purposive sampling technique. Our results indicate that adaptation strategies are gendered with men mostly resorting to on-farm agronomic practices such as the use of artificial fertilizers and also moving into new cash crops. Female farmers also use similar on-farm agronomic practices particularly artificial fertilizers to boost crop production but most importantly resorted to petty trading in agricultural and consumable goods, an off-farm strategy. This shows women’s resilience which has also subsequently improved their decision-making role at the household level, which is an indicator of empowerment. We recommend that institutions that support climate change adaptation initiatives at the local level must take gender differences into consideration and support particularly women to strengthen their resilience and consolidate their empowerment. © 2017, © 2017 The African Specialty Group of the American Association of Geographers.","adaptation; climate change; Gender; Ghana; men; women",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021176188

Climate warming has the potential to alter alpine plant phenology and physiology, species interactions, community structure, species distributions, and ecosystem processes through effects on temperature, snow, and moisture regimes. Here, we review the state of understanding of alpine species, community, and ecosystem responses to climate change, with an emphasis on what has been learned from controlled experiments. We conclude that many alpine plant communities are already responding to climate warming, with changes contingent on hydroclimate setting and local edaphic factors that modulate species use of greater nitrogen and phosphorous availability, migration to newly suitable sites, and success relative to neighboring species and migrants from lower elevations. Understanding the complex set of interactions required for predicting future change calls for more integrated experiments that explicitly address multiple interacting abiotic and biotic factors. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We asked whether continued warming will affect the distribution of six common canopy-forming species: mid-intertidal fucoids (Ascophyllum nodosum, Fucus vesiculosus), low-intertidal Irish moss (Chondrus crispus), subtidal laminarian kelps (Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata) and the invasive Codium fragile. Location: Northwest Atlantic. Methods: We used occurrence records and the correlative presence-only species distribution model Maxent to determine present-day distribution. This distribution was compared to each species’ warm-water physiological thresholds indicating areas of stable or reduced growth and mortality. Present-day models were then projected to mid-century (2040–2050) and end-century (2090–2100) using two contrasting carbon emission scenarios (RCP2.6 and 8.5) and two global climate models from CMIP5 based on changes in ocean temperatures. Results: Projected range shifts were minimal under low emissions (RCP2.6), but substantial species-specific range shifts were projected under high emissions (RCP8.5), with all species except C. fragile predicted to experience a northward shift in their southern (warm) edge of ≤406 km by the year 2100. Northward expansions outweighed southern extirpations for fucoids and C. crispus leading to overall range expansions, while range contractions were projected for kelps and C. fragile. Model projections generally agreed with physiological thresholds but were more conservative suggesting that range shifts for kelps may be underpredicted. Main conclusions: Our results highlight the benefits to be gained from strong climate change mitigation (RCP2.6), which would limit changes in rocky shore community distribution and composition. The business-as-usual RCP8.5 scenario projected major range shifts, seaweed community reorganization and transitions in dominant species south of Newfoundland by 2100 (~47°N). As canopy-forming seaweeds provide essential habitat, carbon storage, nutrient cycling and commercial value, understanding their response to continued climate warming is critical to inform coastal management and conservation planning. © 2019 The Authors.

Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) are one of the most well-documented species declining from climate change–specifically a reduction in snowcover–yet clear management strategies have yet to emerge. To test whether camouflage mismatch is reducing hare survival we translocated 96 hares to a site recently extirpated of snowshoe hares, and monitored coat color change, mismatch with snow, habitat use, and weekly survival in winter-spring of 2017. Hare survival was low during periods of camouflage mismatch, and mismatched hares were 3.2 × less likely to survive, but this pattern varied by habitat. We found that aspen-alder stands >5 hectares negated the mortality costs of mismatch. We provide experimental evidence that mismatch is driving the range contraction of snowshoe hares, and identify specific habitats to buffer the consequences of climate change on this declining winter specialist. © 2018 The Authors.

The need for a workshop arose from the lack of any market-wide manufacturer requirement for documented sensor performance evaluations, the lack of any independent third party or government-based sensor performance certification program, and uncertainty among all users as to the general usability of air sensor data. A multi-sector subject matter expert panel was assembled to facilitate an open discussion on these issues with multiple stakeholders. This summary provides an overview of the workshop purpose, key findings from the deliberations, and considerations for future actions specific to sensors. Important findings concerning PM2.5 and O3 sensors included the lack of consistent performance indicators and statistical metrics as well as highly variable data quality requirements depending on the intended use. While the workshop did not attempt to yield consensus on any topic, a key message was that a number of possible future actions would be beneficial to all stakeholders regarding sensor technologies. These included documentation of best practices, sharing quality assurance results along with sensor data, and the development of a common performance target lexicon, performance targets, and test protocols. © 2019","Low-cost air quality sensors; Ozone; Performance targets; PM2.5","Air quality; Environmental Protection Agency; Quality assurance; Certification programs; Consistent performance; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Low costs; Performance targets; PM2.5; Subject matter experts; United States environmental protection agency; Ozone; ozone; data quality; ozone; particulate matter; performance assessment; sensor; accuracy; air analysis; Article; certification; correlation analysis; limit of detection; mathematical computing; particulate matter; performance measurement system; priority journal; workshop; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064460289

Efforts are being made to return large ungulates (bison) back into prairie landscapes, but successful introductions can be constrained by suitable habitat as determined by resource availability (plant biomass, forage quality of the plant biomass, and soil carbon and nitrogen), particularly given some of these tracts are former arable land that has been restored to tallgrass prairie. The objective of this study was to quantify whether plant biomass (available forage) differs between prairie types, if forage quality varies across native prairie remnants and restored prairies, and if these differences are related to carbon and nitrogen storage in soil. We sampled native prairie remnants, low seeded-diversity older restored prairies, and high seeded-diversity younger restored prairies at Nachusa Grasslands, Illinois during July 2014. Total plant biomass differed between the three prairie types, with the high seeded-diversity younger-restored prairies having almost twice that of the low seeded-diversity older-restored prairies and more than twice that of the remnant prairies. In regard to forage quality, the percentage of crude protein in dry matter was greater in the remnant prairies compared to both of the restored prairie types. The high seeded-diversity younger restored prairies had the highest lignin concentration in the forage. The fat content of forage was highest in the high seeded-diversity younger restored prairies. Total soil carbon and nitrogen did not differ between the three prairie types at either the 0-10 cm or 10-20 cm depth. The preliminary findings of this study suggest bison grazing within the introduction unit at Nachusa Grasslands will be more intensive within restored prairies as compared to remnants. © 2019 BioOne.All rights reserved.",,"arable land; dry matter; habitat mosaic; landscape; phytomass; prairie; resource availability; restoration ecology; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; ungulate; Illinois; Nachusa Grasslands; United States; Bison; Ungulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065538702

In addition, extreme climatic events such as droughts are becoming more common. Land-use change and extreme climatic events are thought to have synergistic impacts on aquatic biodiversity, but few studies have directly tested this. A severe El Niño drought in Southeast Asia in early 2016 caused 16 low-order hill streams across a land-use gradient encompassing primary forest, logged forest and oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysia, to dry up into series of disconnected pools. The resulting disturbance (specifically, increased water temperature and decreased dissolved oxygen concentration) tolerated by the fish during the drought exceeded any worst-case scenario for climate change-induced warming. We quantified the biomass, density and movement of the dominant freshwater fish species, Nematabramis everetti (Cyprinidae), in these streams across this land-use gradient before, during, and after the 2016 El Niño drought period. Density of N. everetti was significantly lower in logged forest streams than primary forest or oil palm streams, and the biomass of individuals captured was lower during drought than prior to the drought; however, there was no change in the biomass density of individuals during drought. The distance moved by N. everetti was significantly lower during and after the drought compared to before the drought. We detected a significant antagonistic interaction on biomass of captured fish, with the magnitude of the drought impact reduced land-use intensified. Populations of N. everetti were surprisingly resilient to drought and seem most affected instead by land-use. Despite this resilience, it is important to monitor how this widespread and abundant species, which provides an important ecosystem service to local human communities, is affected by future land-use and climate change, as logging, deforestation and conversion to plantation monocultures continue across Southeast Asia. © 2019 2018 The Author(s).

The gel has a high strength and a very low water-like viscosity, that extends its applicability to small pore diameters and low permeability media. The gel was prepared and applied on-site with oilfield equipment. Mixing was upscaled from laboratory- to field-scale, including one unsuccessful attempt. Environmental concerns and additional health and safety requirements were modest as the formulation was composed only of the non-toxic commercial silica-based product Betol K28 T, acetic acid and fresh water. A well was selected and prepared in the Bečej natural CO2 field in Serbia, the well and reservoir were prepared and the gel was placed into a 600 m deep CO2- and CH4-bearing sandstone layer. The reservoir was selectively sealed to the gas cap through a fast, CO2-selective gelation, while the hydraulic pathways of the liquid-filled part of the reservoir remained open. In the regions where no CO2 was present the gelation reaction was slower and the kinetic was temperature-accelerated. A numerical model was used to simulate the impact of the pre-injection operational procedures and to quantify the impact on the temperature-dependent gelation time.

In this paper, we examine processes of climate change governance in a given city in China, Rizhao, and evaluate how MLG arrangements operate. We do so by examining primary data collected through in-depth interviews with local stakeholders. Our results show that the focus on multi-level – and in particular transnational – interactions obscures the ways in which urban low carbon transitions happen in three ways. First, in spite of Rizhao being a well-known case in environmental politics, there is an absence of international actors and non-governmental organizations operating on the ground. Second, the emphasis on opportunities of local authorities to build political agendas through participation in global networks conceals how structures of power, political-economic coalitions, and technological practices are firmly fixed in a local context. Third, the case study illustrates the enduring authority of formal top-down channels of control in this political system. Based on these results, we caution against the uncritical application of MLG theory to environmental politics in settings where deliberative democracy is lacking and the full benefits of multi-level interactions are unlikely to be achieved. © 2019","China; Cities; Climate change; Multi-level governance; Politics","climate change; democracy; environmental politics; governance approach; innovation; nongovernmental organization; political system; urban climate; China; Rizhao; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060023132

The underlying cause of climate change is the increase of carbon emissions. To reduce carbon emissions, the analysis of the factors affecting this type of emission is of practical significance. Design/methodology/approach: This paper identified five factors affecting carbon emissions using the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition model (e.g. per capita carbon emissions, industrial structure, energy intensity, energy structure and per capita GDP). Besides, based on the projection pursuit method, this paper obtained the optimal projection directions of five influencing factors in 30 provinces (except for Tibet). Based on the data from 2000 to 2014, the authors predicted the optimal projection directions in the next six years under the Markov transfer matrix. Findings: The results indicated that per capita GDP was the critical factor for reducing carbon emissions. The industrial structure and population intensified carbon emissions. The energy structure had seldom impacted on carbon emissions. The energy intensity obviously inhibited carbon emissions. The best optimal projection direction of each index in the next six years remained stable. Finally, this paper proposed the policy implications. Originality/value: This paper provides an insight into the current state and the future changes in carbon emissions. © 2018, Lei Wen and Linlin Huang.","Carbon emissions; Influencing factors; LMDI; Markov transfer matrix; Projection pursuit model","carbon emission; decomposition analysis; energy intensity; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; industrial structure; Markov chain; China; Xizang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057050086

Few studies have examined the role of environmental factors in controlling species interaction networks across time. We examined variation in plant–grasshopper network structural properties in response to three major grassland drivers: periodic fire, ungulate grazing and climate. We sequenced a plant barcoding gene from extracted grasshopper gut contents to characterize diets of 26 grasshopper species. Resulting grasshopper species’ diets were combined with long-term plant and grasshopper surveys to assemble plant–grasshopper networks across 13–19 years for six watersheds subjected to varying fire and grazing treatments. Network modularity, generality and predicted grasshopper community robustness to plant species loss all increased in grazed watersheds. Temperature decreased predicted grasshopper community robustness to plant species loss. Grasshopper communities were found to be vulnerable to climatic warming due to host plant loss. However, intermediate disturbance from ungulate grazers may maintain grasshopper diversity and buffer community robustness to species loss. Our results suggest that climate and disturbance shape the structure of ecological interaction networks and thus have many indirect effects on species persistence though direct effects on interaction partners.

Findings: In this study, a batch of carbonized plant remains was obtained through the flotation method at the cultural layer of this ruin. Furthermore, three complete carbonized buckwheat kernels were found and identified with modern buckwheat kernels for the first time. Conclusions: The 14 C dating result was from 3,610 to 3,458 years before present. These carbonized buckwheat kernels from the late Neolithic period are the oldest that have been found in China.

The effects of Miller cycle on the state parameters, combustion characteristics, NO emissions, and the spatial distribution of working fluid were analyzed. A one-dimensional (1D) simulation model was established by using the BOOST software. The FIRE software was used to simulate the combustion process and emission characteristics of the diesel engine at medium and low loads. The results show that in the E3 cycle (four kinds of loads, 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, according to Marine application propeller law), with the proper EIVC, the in-cylinder pressure, temperature and NO emission will be reduced. At the load of 50%, NO emissions were reduced by 17.8%, At 25% load NO emissions were reduced by 14.9%. During the fuel injection, the decrease of in-cylinder temperature causes a longer ignition delay period. When the EIVC is too early, the heat release rate increases sharply, at the same time, the NO generation also increases. Furthermore, it will lead to misfire at low load. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Combustion; Marine diesel engine; Miller cycle; NOx emission; Simulation","Combustion; Computer software; Diesel engines; Marine engines; Nitrogen oxides; Plant shutdowns; Ship propellers; Combustion characteristics; Emission characteristics; Heat Release Rate (HRR); In-cylinder pressures; Marine Diesel Engines; Miller cycle; NOx emissions; Simulation; Intake valves; combustion; diesel engine; efficiency measurement; emission; equipment; nitric oxide; nitrogen oxides; simulation; software; spatial distribution; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062147879

Though the focus is on policies at the state-level, local government and electric utility policies are documented when they collectively cover a majority of the state׳s population or electricity customers. Data were collected first from the Alternative Fuel Database Center (AFDC), then supplemented with information taken from more than 300 government (state, city, and county) and utility websites. Nine separate EV-related policy instruments were identified, organized as capital financial incentives, operating financial incentives, preferred access incentives, and disincentives. Though most policy instruments act to support EV adoption, an increasing number of U.S. states are adopting an annual fee for EVs to support road maintenance costs. For vehicle purchase incentives, home charger subsidies, vehicle license tax or registration fees, and the annual EV fee, data was gathered on the money value of these policy instruments. For emissions inspection exemptions and high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane access, an annual money value for each policy instrument is estimated. The other policy instruments, time-of-use (TOU) rates for electricity, designated parking and free parking, are reported as binary variables. For further discussion of EV policy instruments as well as interpretation of their values, see Wee et al. [1].

We explored the effect of selected management practices and their interactions on emissions mitigation and summarized findings from life cycle assessments of milk from dairy systems typical of the Midwest of the United States. Sources: Peer-reviewed literature was the main source of data and information to construct this review. Synthesis: Dry matter intake and feed conversion efficiency drive enteric CH4 production (g/d) and intensity (g/kg of milk), respectively. Dietary fiber and lipids influence enteric CH4 and dietary protein influences manure N2O. In the manure management chain, long-term storage of unprocessed liquid manure is a major source of GHG emissions, but the adoption of manure solid–liquid separation and anaerobic digestion substantially reduce the carbon balance of a farm. Amount, timing, and application mode of nitrogen fertilizer are keys to reducing N2O emission from fields. Reduced or no till, winter crop, and perennial crops increase soil OM content and reduce field CO2 losses. Variation in on-farm GHG emissions, which averaged 1.1 kg of CO2-eq per kilogram of milk, was associated more with specific management practices than with farm size or dairy system. Conclusions and Applications: Adopting best nutritional, cropping, and manure management practices may reduce substantially on-farm GHG emissions in all dairy systems. Modeling and assessment methods must be improved to better account for interactions among system components and co-products of milk production. © 2019 American Registry of Professional Animal Scientists","dairy farm; enteric methane; greenhouse gases; life cycle assessment; nitrous oxide",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067419023

In this study, we examined EM fungal communities associated with 23 species from four genera (Alnus, Betula, Carpinus and Corylus) of Betulaceae in Chinese secondary forest ecosystems, using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the ITS2 region. Effects of host plant phylogeny, soil, climate and geographic distance on EM fungal community were explored. In total, we distinguished 1738 EM fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% sequence similarity level. The EM fungal communities of Alnus had significantly lower OTU richness than those associated with the other three plant genera. The EM fungal OTU richness was significantly affected by geographic distance, host plant phylogeny, soil and climate. The EM fungal community composition was significantly influenced by host plant phylogeny (12.1% of variation explained in EM fungal community), geographic distance (7.7%), soil (4.6%) and climate (1.1%). This finding highlights that environmental filtering linked to host plant phylogeny and dispersal limitation strongly influence EM fungal communities associated with Betulaceae plants in Chinese secondary forest ecosystems. © 2019 FEMS 2019.","Betulaceae; dispersal limitation; ectomycorrhizal fungal community; environmental filtering; Illumina MiSeq; ITS2","community structure; dicotyledon; dispersal; ectomycorrhiza; forest ecosystem; geographical variation; host plant; phylogeny; secondary forest; species richness; China; Alnus; Betula; Betulaceae; Carpinus; Corylus; Otus; Betulaceae; chemistry; classification; climate; forest; genetics; host range; microbiology; mycobiome; mycorrhiza; phylogeny; physiology; plant dispersal; soil; Betulaceae; Climate; Forests; Host Specificity; Mycobiome; Mycorrhizae; Phylogeny; Plant Dispersal; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064142666

Many studies have focused on the linear, rather than nonlinear, relationship between environmental regulation and CO2 emissions. The exploration of nonlinear relations is conducive to the in-depth study of policy effects and regional differences of environmental regulations in China. To ensure effective CO2 emission reductions, regional differences in CO2 emissions in China should also be considered. In this study 30 provinces of China were divided into three different regions according to their level of economic development from 2004 to 2015. Taking the energy intensity and foreign direct investment (FDI) as threshold variables, a threshold model was used to examine the relationship between environmental regulation and CO2 emissions. It was found that environmental regulation has a threshold effect on CO2 emissions, with significant differences among the eastern, central, and western regions. Environmental regulations in the eastern region were ineffective for curbing CO2 emissions, while the energy intensity was in the middle and low threshold range. However, FDI had a promotional effect on CO2 emissions. In the central region, environmental regulations reduced CO2 emissions under the influence of energy intensity and FDI. In the western region, environmental regulations could not mitigate CO2 emissions when the energy intensity and FDI were used as the threshold variables. It was concluded that a diverse range of measures for CO2 reduction should be adopted according to the local economic situation.

Under the analytical framework of Copeland and Taylor (1994), it introduces this new measure to investigate the effects of China's carbon emissions during 2004-2016, using the spatial econometric model and the differential generalized method of moments. We find that China's carbon emissions show significant spatial correlation characteristics and interregional diffusion, which indicates that regional coordinated cooperative governance is key to carbon emission mitigation in China, and that China's two-way FDI coordinated development has presented a significant braking effect on carbon emissions during the research period. Furthermore, we decompose the effects of the two-way FDI on carbon emissions into three parts. This decomposition shows that the scale effect is positive, while both the composition and the technique effects are negative. The technique effect essentially dominates the emission reduction induced by the coordinated development of the two-way FDI. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Inward foreign direct investment; Outward foreign direct investment; Two-way FDI","carbon emission; emission control; foreign direct investment; governance approach; scale effect; two-dimensional modeling; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066923577

Due to the lack of technical support and financial incentives, a range of technical and economic barriers still exist for small-medium enterprises (SMEs). This paper first introduces a point energy technology, which is developed for SMEs to improve the insight of the energy usage in the manufacturing processes and installed in a local bakery. Statistical analysis of electricity consumption data over a seven-day period is conducted, including the identification of operational modes for individual processing units using an enhanced clustering method and the voltage unbalance conditions associated with these identified modes. Two technical strategies, namely electrical load allotment and voltage unbalance minimisation, are then proposed, which could attain more than 800 kwh energy saving during this period and the current unbalance could be reduced to less than 10%. In addition, the genetic algorithm is deployed to solve the job shop scheduling problem based upon the commercial electrical tariffs, and this reduces the electricity bill by £80 per day in the case study. Implementation of the recommendations based on the above analysis therefore may potentially yield significant financial and environmental benefits. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Clustering; Energy efficiency; Energy monitoring; Job shop scheduling","Bakeries; Climate change; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Job shop scheduling; Manufacture; Scheduling; Carbon emission reductions; Clustering; Electricity-consumption; Energy intensive industries; Energy monitoring; Energy saving potential; Intelligent Manufacturing; Job shop scheduling problems; Energy efficiency; carbon emission; cluster analysis; energy conservation; energy efficiency; genetic algorithm; manufacturing; power plant; small and medium-sized enterprise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060945007

The existing studies have usually introduced a single indicator to describe urbanization and have ignored the complexity and multi-dimensionality of urbanization. This study establishes an evaluation system of urbanization quality to estimate the urbanization development level. The geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is employed to examine the impact of the urbanization quality on CO2 emissions and reveals the spatial differences of 30 provinces in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The results show that there are significant temporal and spatial differences in the effects of the urbanization quality on CO2 emissions between provinces. Improvements in the urbanization quality have contributed to cutting CO2 emissions in most provinces. The impact of the urbanization quality on CO2 emissions in the central region and western region is greater than that in the eastern region. The energy intensity has the largest positive impact on CO2 emissions, which indicates that technical progress can effectively reduce CO2 emissions. The industrial structure has a positive impact on CO2 emissions in 2000 and 2015, whereas it has a negative impact on the CO2 emissions of some provinces in 2005 and 2010. This paper provides valuable findings and conclusions of the relationship between urbanization quality and CO2 emissions.

In order to advance the goal of developing a low-carbon economy in China, this study explored influencing factors, change trends, and reduction potential in relation to CO 2 emissions in Guangdong Province using a provincial dataset covering the period 1995 to 2014. We used extended STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology) model and the technique of ridge regression in order to identify key influencing factors behind Guangdong's CO 2 emissions. We also forecasted emission trends and estimated reduction potential in the period 2015–2030. Our empirical results indicate that economic development, population growth, urbanization, fixed asset investment, and industrialization level all positively affected CO 2 emissions during the period studied, while the impacts of energy consumption structure and technology progress were found to be negative. Scenario simulations reveal that the aggregate CO 2 emissions of Guangdong Province will increase continuously up to 2030 under all of the twenty scenarios developed and tested in this study; despite this, we argue that the potential for emission reduction remains large. An optimal scenario was identified after cross-sectional comparison. Our analysis casts new light on the importance of exploring socioeconomic determinants and reduction potential in relation to emissions, in order to plan for rapidly developing regions like Guangdong. The empirical findings have significant implications for the Chinese government in implementing policy measures in order to promote low-carbon development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO 2 emissions; Guangdong province; Ridge regression; Scenario analysis; STIRPAT model","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Investments; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; CO2 emissions; Guangdong Province; Ridge regression; Scenario analysis; Stirpat models; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061597118

Second, for developing countries, urbanization, transport-related emissions and industrialization all have a significant positive effect on national PM2.5 concentrations increase, although their impacts are unexpectedly smaller than those in the other groups of countries.

In order to evaluate vehicle-induced turbulence and its contribution to pollutant dispersion, this study proposes a computational fluid dynamics based simulation methodology that uses a dynamic mesh updating method. The unsteady RNG k-ε turbulence model was employed to investigate the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) induced by vehicle movement and pollutant profile in the target street canyon. The simulation accuracy is successfully validated against a published wind tunnel experiment. The results demonstrate that: (1) The TKE is mainly located behind the vehicle, and the magnitude of the TKE around the moving vehicle body far exceeds that of stationary vehicles; (2) Travelling speed has a significant influence on the TKE. When the moving speed is 15 m/s, its TKE near the tail is about 1.8 times and 6.3 times than that at 10 m/s and at 5 m/s, respectively; (3) Vehicle movement greatly contributes to pollutant dispersion. Compared to no vehicle movement (V = 0 m/s), vehicle-induced turbulence with V above 5 m/s can reduce the carbon monoxide concentration by about 4% at breathing height. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic mesh updating method; Numerical simulation; Pollutant dispersion; Street canyon; Turbulent kinetic energy; Vehicular emission","Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Kinetics; Mesh generation; Numerical methods; Quality management; Turbulence models; Vehicles; Wind tunnels; Pollutant dispersions; Street canyon; Turbulent kinetic energy; Updating methods; Vehicular emission; Kinetic energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061314078

However, the annual and peak fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) concentrations during severe events in winter did not always reduce as expected. This is partially due to the inter-annual variation of meteorology, which affects the emission, transport, transformation, and deposition processes of air pollutants. In this study, the responses of PM 2.5 and ozone (O 3 ) concentrations to changes in emission and meteorology from 2013 to 2015 were investigated based on ambient measurements and the Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model simulations with anthropogenic emissions. It is found that emission reductions in 2014 and 2015 effectively reduced PM 2.5 concentrations by 23.9 and 43.5 μg/m 3 , respectively, but was partially counteracted by unfavorable meteorology. The negative effects from unfavorable meteorology were significant in extreme pollution events. For example, in December 2015, unfavorable meteorology caused a great increase (90 μg/m 3 ) of PM 2.5 in Beijing. Reduction of primary PM and gaseous precursors led to 13.4 and 16.5 ppb increase of O 3 -8 h daily concentrations in the summertime in 2014 and 2015 in comparison of 2013, which was likely caused by the increase of solar actinic flux due to PM reduction. In addition, reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions in areas with negative NOx-O 3 sensitivity could lead to an increase of O 3 formation when the reduction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was not sufficient. This unintended enhanced O 3 formation could also lead to higher O 3 in downwind areas. This study emphasizes the role of meteorology in pollution control, validates the effectiveness of PM 2.5 control measures in China, and highlights the importance of appropriate joint reduction of NOx and VOCs to simultaneously decrease O 3 and PM 2.5 for higher air quality. © 2019","Counteraction; Meteorology variation; Ozone; PM 2.5","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Particulate emissions; Quality control; Volatile organic compounds; Air pollution in chinas; Anthropogenic emissions; Community multi-scale air qualities; Counteraction; Extreme pollution events; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Interannual variation; PM2.5; Meteorology; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; concentration (composition); emission control; meteorology; nitrogen oxides; ozone; particulate matter; pollution control; volatile organic compound; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; meteorology; particulate matter; pollution transport; priority journal; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060437012

Do environmental regulations help improve the air quality in urban centers, and what mechanism explains their effects in China? In order to explore the causal relationship between environmental regulations and air quality, the effectiveness of the New Ambient Air Quality Standards—primarily the monitoring of PM2.5—was evaluated using the Difference-in-Differences (DID) method to weaken the endogeneity problems. Our results suggest that the New Standards reduce the concentration of PM2.5 and emissions of SO 2 in pilot cities in neither the short-term nor the long-term. Our heterogeneous analyses show that the monitoring efforts, pollution control efforts, and ownership structures can affect outcomes of New Standards significantly, and that they have different influences on various categories of pollutants.

Pellet fuel demand was a linear function of daily average ambient temperature. It was used to predict total seasonal fuel and heat demand from the beginning of October to the end of April. A cost of heat (COH) analysis was performed considering all costs associated with the system including capital cost, operation, maintenance, other costs, and final system disposal (or salvation) cost. Sensitivity analysis showed that initial capital cost, wood pellet fuel price, and boiler heating system seasonal efficiency were the top three key factors determining the final COH with seasonal efficiency becomes more significant when pellet price increases. A life cycle annualized cost method was used to determine and compare the costs of heat using natural gas, No. 2 fuel oil, and propane. The study found that at the current seasonal efficiency of 75.8% (based on gross heating value), pellet fuel price of 240 $/ton, and maximum government incentives of $10,000, wood pellet boiler heating is able to replace intermediate efficiency (83%) propane heating systems in NYS at current fuel price of 2.48 $/gal. With a 3.6% fuel price increase to 2.57 $/gal, wood pellet heating is comparable with high efficiency (95%) propane heating systems. In addition, a heating oil price above 3.22 $/gal would make it economically possible to switch from oil heating to wood pellet heating in NYS. It was found that major emissions reductions can be achieved by switching from inefficient wood heating technology to wood pellet heating in terms of reductions in CO2, particulate matter (PM), and CO emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions reductions are also achieved when switching from fossil fuels to wood pellets, but PM and CO emissions increased significantly. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cost of heat; Economic analysis; Environmental benefits; NYS; Wood pellet boiler heating system","Boilers; Costs; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Heating; Life cycle; Pelletizing; Propane; Sensitivity analysis; Temperature; Wood; Wood fuels; Economic and environmental benefits; Emissions reduction; Environmental benefits; Government incentive; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Gross heating value; Heating system; Seasonal efficiency; Cost benefit analysis; cost analysis; economic analysis; energy storage; environmental assessment; field method; instrumentation; life cycle analysis; sensitivity analysis; spatial distribution; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056183741

To investigate how soil microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activities respond to elevated ozone, we collected soils from a temperate grassland after four years of ozone exposure under fully open-air field conditions. We measured soil microbial biomass, the metabolism of low molecular weight C substrates and hydrolytic extracellular enzyme activities in both bulk soil and isolated aggregates to assess changes in microbial activity and community function. After four years of elevated ozone treatment, soil total organic C was reduced by an average of 20% compared with ambient condition. Elevated ozone resulted in a small but insignificant reduction (4–10%) in microbial biomass in both bulk soil and isolated aggregates. Activities of extracellular enzymes were generally not affected by elevated ozone, except β-glucosidase, whose activity in bulk soil was significantly lower under elevated ozone than ambient condition. Activities of β-glucosidase, leucine aminopeptidase and acid phosphatase were higher in microaggregates (<0.25 mm) as compared to macroaggregates (>0.25 mm). Elevated ozone had no effects on mineralization rates of low molecular weight C substrates in both bulk soil and isolated aggregates. We therefore conclude that the size and activity rather than function of the soil microbial community in this semi-natural grassland are altered by elevated ozone. © 2019","(semi-)Natural vegetation; Climate change; FACE; Hydrolytic enzymes; Soil aggregates","Aggregates; Amino acids; Biomass; Climate change; Microorganisms; Molecular weight; Phosphatases; Soils; Extracellular enzyme activity; FACE; Hydrolytic enzyme; Natural vegetation; Semi-natural grasslands; Soil aggregate; Soil microbial biomass; Soil microbial community; Ozone; acid phosphatase; beta glucosidase; carbon; cell enzyme; cytosol aminopeptidase; macroaggregate; unclassified drug; beta glucosidase; ozone; biomass; climate change; enzyme activity; grassland; metabolism; mineralization; ozone; soil aggregate; soil biota; soil carbon; Article; cell aggregation; cell function; cell size; environmental exposure; environmental impact; environmental temperature; enzyme activity; microbial activity; microbial biomass; microbial community; mineralization; molecular weight; ozone layer; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); soil microflora; temperate grassland; bacterium; biomass; chemistry; drug effect; enzymology; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; plant; season; soil; Wales; Bacteria; beta-Glucosidase; Biomass; Carbon; Microbiota; Ozone; Plants; Seasons; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059751072

In this study, three SNF1-related protein kinase 1 genes, ZmSnRK1.1, ZmSnRK1.2 and ZmSnRK1.3, which are highly conserved in plants, were isolated from maize (Zea mays L.). Expression profiling experiments indicated that the three genes were constitutively expressed in all tested tissues with the highest expression level in young ears. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that ZmSnRK1.1, ZmSnRK1.2 and ZmSnRK1.3 are localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing ZmSnRK1.1, ZmSnRK1.2 or ZmSnRK1.3 exhibited hypersensitivity to exogenous sugar treatment and accumulated less glucose but more sucrose in the rosette leaves and mature seeds compared to the wild type. Time to flowering was shortened in the ZmSnRK1.1 over-expressing lines but prolonged in the ZmSnRK1.2 and ZmSnRK1.3 lines. Leaf senescence was delayed in all transgenic lines, especially in the ZmSnRK1.3 lines, which led to enhanced biomass and seed yield at maturity. Key genes that are involved in carbon metabolism, senescence and flowering time were differentially regulated in the transgenic lines as revealed by the RNA-seq analysis. This study demonstrated that maize ZmSnRK1 members play important roles in energy sensing and carbon metabolism, they regulate the architecture shaping and developmental transition when heterogeneously expressed in Arabidopsis and may provide potentially valuable characteristics for high yield breeding of crops in the future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon metabolism; Delayed senescence; SnRK1; Yield; Zea mays","glucose; sucrose; sugar; carbon; plant protein; protein serine threonine kinase; SNF1-related protein kinases; sucrose; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; biomass production; carbon metabolism; cell nucleus; cellular distribution; controlled study; cytoplasm; flowering; gene expression level; gene expression regulation; gene location; gene overexpression; hypersensitivity; leaf senescence; maize; nonhuman; plant breeding; plant gene; plant metabolism; plant yield; priority journal; RNA sequence; rosette formation; seed yield; sequence analysis; ZmSnRK1 gene; Arabidopsis; biomass; cell aging; cytology; enzymology; gene expression profiling; genetics; growth, development and aging; maize; metabolism; molecular cloning; multigene family; physiology; plant leaf; procedures; transgenic plant; Arabidopsis; Biomass; Carbon; Cell Nucleus; Cellular Senescence; Cloning, Molecular; Cytoplasm; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Multigene Family; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Sucrose; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059510460

The sulfate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (S-AOM) process catalyzed by anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) is a vital link connecting the global carbon and sulfur cycles, and it is considered to be the overriding methane sink in marine ecosystem. However, there have been few studies regarding the role of S-AOM process and the distribution of ANME archaea in intertidal ecosystem. The intertidal zone is a buffer zone between sea and land and plays an important role in global geochemical cycle. In the present study, the abundance, potential methane oxidation rate, and community structure of ANME archaea in the intertidal zone were studied by quantitative PCR, stable isotope tracing method and high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that the potential S-AOM activity ranged from 0 to 0.77 nmol 13CO2 g-1 (dry sediment) day-1. The copy number of 16S rRNA gene of ANME archaea reached 106 ~ 107 copies g-1 (dry sediment). The average contribution of S-AOM to total anaerobic methane oxidation was up to 34.5%, while denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation accounted for the rest, which implied that S-AOM process was an essential methane sink that cannot be overlooked in intertidal ecosystem.

However, the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction into fuels such as methane (CH4) is substantially restricted by high CO2 activation barrier and inefficient proton supply. Here, Mo-doped WO3·0.33H2O nanorods have been synthesized and Mo doping in WO3·0.33H2O dramatically increased the CH4 production yield by 5.2 times from 1.02 to 5.3 μmol gcat−1 h−1 under water vapor without the assistant of any sacrificial agent or noble metal. The Mo doping proves capable of facilitating CO2 activation by improving the ability to store and localize photogenerated electrons and boosting the transfer of photoexcited electrons to adsorbed CO2. In addition, proton and electron insertion converts WO3·0.33H2O into tungsten bronze (HxWO3·0.33H2O) under light irradiation, guaranteeing required electrons and protons for CO2 reduction. The enhanced water oxidation of Mo-doped WO3·0.33H2O promotes proton supply and insertion process, improving the hydrogenation process of the carbon intermediate to generate CH4. The combined action of the enhanced CO2 activation and water oxidation with efficient proton and electron insertion improves the performance of CO2 photoreduction to CH4.

This aggravated an already tense situation of water shortage. Considering the low irrigation water utilization effectives of the urban green space system, the typical urban greening shrub (Ligustrum vicaryi) was selected as the research object of this study. In a pot experiment, three mulch materials were selected: gravel (CH1), pine needles + gravel (CH2), and bark + gravel (CH3). These materials were set to a uniform thickness of 3 cm, and soil water was maintained between 75% and 85% of the field capacity. Using the analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy mathematics model, the physiological and ecological response characteristics of Ligustrum vicaryi were investigated under different combinations of mulch material. The results for various processing, regarding plant growth, showed CH3 > CH2 > CH1 > CK (Control Check). The leaf area, total leaf area, and leaf area index of CH3 were, respectively, 21.4%, 21.9%, and 62.5% larger than those of the control check (CK). Regarding physiological characteristics, photosynthetic rate, evaporation rate, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency of CH3 were better than for the other treatments. Regarding ecological services, carbon fixation, oxygen release, cooling, and quantity of humidification of CH3 were optimal. Considered comprehensively for the landscape function, physical characteristics, and ecological services of Ligustrum vicaryi, the preliminary thought is that bark and gravel dual-element mulch, with a layer thickness of 3 cm, was the optimal soil cover treatment for the typical city greening shrub Ligustrum vicaryi. Using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the fuzzy mathematical model for the evaluation of the effects of different soil cover treatments on the landscape function, ecological service function, and physiological characteristics of Ligustrum vicaryi was reliable and feasible.

Under such circumstances, water reuse has the potential to address these challenges but only under a favourable policy environment. In this paper, policy documents were considered as the ethnographic object to understand how people talk about water reuse in Kenya through policies, plans, regulations and guidelines. Using a general inductive approach to content analysis, the findings suggest that Kenya’s policy on water reuse has progressed, especially in the recognition of the potential of reused water for addressing water scarcity, pollution, cleaner industrial production, food production, and climate change adaptation and mitigation. While many of the water reuse issues have been discussed under water and irrigation, environment and industrialization, other key sectors such as food and agriculture, housing, urban development and health remain silent on water reuse. Therefore, there is a need to take water reuse conversations beyond the water, environment, and industrialisation sectors if we are to address the water supply and wastewater management issues. Likewise, the study reminds us of the importance of foregrounding public perception and harmonized institutional arrangements in the success of water reuse in the country. © IWA Publishing 2019.","Ethnography of policy; Kenya; Water policy; Water recycling; Water reuse",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066047883

Box 5003, Ås, 1432, Norway","Background: Commercial biogas upgrading facilities are expensive and consume energy. Biological biogas upgrading may serve as a low-cost approach because it can be easily integrated with existing facilities at biogas plants. The microbial communities found in anaerobic digesters typically contain hydrogenotrophic methanogens, which can use hydrogen (H2) as a reducing agent for conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into methane (CH4). Thus, biological biogas upgrading through the exogenous addition of H2 into biogas digesters for the conversion of CO2 into CH4 can increase CH4 yield and lower CO2 emission. Results: The addition of 4 mol of H2 per mol of CO2 was optimal for batch biogas reactors and increased the CH4 content of the biogas from 67 to 94%. The CO2 content of the biogas was reduced from 33 to 3% and the average residual H2 content was 3%. At molar H2:CO2 ratios &gt; 4:1, all CO2 was converted into CH4, but the pH increased above 8 due to depletion of CO2, which negatively influenced the process stability. Additionally, high residual H2 content in these reactors was unfavourable, causing volatile fatty acid accumulation and reduced CH4 yields. The reactor microbial communities shifted in composition over time, which corresponded to changes in the reactor variables. Numerous taxa responded to the H2 inputs, and in particular the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanobacterium increased in abundance with addition of H2. In addition, the apparent rapid response of hydrogenotrophic methanogens to intermittent H2 feeding indicates the suitability of biological methanation for variable H2 inputs, aligning well with fluctuations in renewable electricity production that may be used to produce H2. Conclusions: Our research demonstrates that the H2:CO2 ratio has a significant effect on reactor performance during in situ biological methanation. Consequently, the H2:CO2 molar ratio should be kept at 4:1 to avoid process instability. A shift toward hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was indicated by an increase in the abundance of the obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanobacterium. © 2019 The Author(s).","Biomethane; Glucose; Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis; In-situ; Mesophilic","Batch reactors; Biogas; Glucose; Hydrogenation; Methanation; Methane; Methanogens; Molar ratio; Volatile fatty acids; Biomethane; Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis; Hydrogenotrophic methanogens; Mesophilic; Microbial communities; Microbial community composition; Process instabilities; Renewable electricity production; Carbon dioxide; biogas; carbon dioxide; community composition; glucose; methane; methanogenesis; microbial community; Methanobacterium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065329291

Using data from Austin, Texas, USA, a nonlinear autoregressive ANN model is used to predict the waste generation rate of the recycling and garbage streams for the year 2023 in four sub-areas of the city. This ANN model resulted in mean absolute percentage errors ranging from 10.92% to 16.51%. Modified compositions of the recycling and garbage streams are then used as inputs, along with the year 2023 generation rates, to create 6 modified and 3 non-modified scenarios that reflect possible future changes in waste composition. These waste stream scenarios are then used as input parameters to determine optimal waste collection routes with minimal travel distance in each of the four sub-areas using the GIS vehicle routing problem network analysis tool. Results of these 36 scenarios yield changes in travel distance of up to 19.9%, when compared to the non-modified composition. Further, dual compartment trucks were compared to single compartment trucks and found to save between 10.3 and 16.0% in travel distance and slightly reduce emissions but had a 15.7–19.8% increase in collection time.

Sociologists and behavioural scientists recognize the importance of selecting environmental policies that have broad political support, while economists tend to compare different instruments first on the basis of their efficiency, and then by assessing their distributional impacts and thus their political acceptability. This paper examines case-study and empirical evidence that the job losses ascribed (correctly or incorrectly) to climate policies have substantial impacts on the willingness of affected workers to support these policies. In aggregate, the costs of these losses are significantly smaller than the benefits, both in terms of health and, probably, of labour market outcomes, but the losses are concentrated in specific areas, sectors and social groups that have been hit hard by the great recession and international competition. Localized contextual effects, such as peer group pressure, and politico-economic factors, such as weakened unions and tightened government budgets, amplify the strength and the persistence of the ‘job-killing’ argument. Compensating for the effects of climate policies on ‘left-behind’ workers appears to be the key priority to increase the political acceptability of such policies, but the design of compensatory policies poses serious challenges. Key policy insights Public perception of, and support for, climate policies is substantially reduced in the presence of large negative shocks, especially job losses. Climate policies can be perceived as negative for employment, especially in areas where polluting industries represent a large share of employment and in occupations and sectors already damaged by globalization and automation. Policymakers should distinguish between small and large distributional effects of climate policies, and find the appropriate combination of revenue recycling schemes, industrial and retraining policies as well as compensation packages to increase the support for such policies. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","amplification mechanisms; Climate policies; collective action problems; distributional impacts; employment impacts; political acceptability","collective action; employment; environmental policy; environmental politics; government; occupation; perception; policy making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054868397

Since the dechlorination occurs at the iron surface, marked differences in rate constants are commonly found for nanoscale and microscale ZVI. It has already been shown for trichloroethene (TCE) adsorbed to activated carbon (AC) that the dechlorination reaction is shifted to the carbon surface simply by contacting the AC with highly reactive nanoscale ZVI particles. Transfer of reactive species to the adsorbed pollutant was discussed. The present study shows that even low price and very low reactive microscale ZVI can also be utilized for an effective dechlorination process. Compared to the reaction rate at the iron surface itself, an enormous acceleration of the dechlorination rate for chlorinated ethenes was observed, reaching activity levels such as known for nanoscale ZVI. When fibrous AC is brought into direct contact with microscale ZVI the iron-surface-normalised dechlorination rate constants increased by up to four orders of magnitude. This implies that the dechlorination reaction is fully transferred to the AC surface. At the same time, the anaerobic corrosion of the same material was not substantially affected. Thus, the utilization of iron's reduction equivalents towards dechlorination (dechlorination efficiency) can be considerably enhanced. A screening with various AC types showed that the extent of rate acceleration depends strongly on the surface chemistry of the AC. By means of temperature-programmed desorption, it could be shown that concentration and type of oxygen surface groups determine the redox-mediation properties. Quinone/hydroquinone groups were identified as being the main drivers for electron-transfer processes, but to some extent other redox-active groups such as chromene and pyrone can also act as redox mediators. AC overall plays the role of a catalyst rather than a reactant. The present study derives recommendations for practical application of the findings in water-treatment approaches. © 2019","Activated carbon; Dechlorination in the adsorbed state; Redox mediator; Zerovalent iron","Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Corrosion; Iron; Nanotechnology; Rate constants; Redox reactions; Surface chemistry; Surface properties; Temperature programmed desorption; Adsorbed state; Chlorinated ethenes; Dechlorination reaction; Electron transfer process; Orders of magnitude; Oxygen surface groups; Redox mediators; Zero-valent iron; Dechlorination; activated carbon; chlorinated hydrocarbon; chromene derivative; functional group; hydroquinone; iron; quinone derivative; tetrachloroethane; trichloroethylene; activated carbon; corrosion; dechlorination; iron; nanoparticle; redox conditions; trichloroethylene; water treatment; Article; catalysis; chemical reaction; controlled study; dechlorination; desorption; nanoanalysis; oxidation; oxidation reduction state; priority journal; temperature; water treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059951889

Some researchers have argued that rooftop PVs should be viewed as an investment, where performance is evaluated using relevant investment analysis methods. This article argues that the proper economic value and climate mitigation potential of rooftop PVs can be assessed only if the market mechanisms and characteristics of the underlying building stock are understood better. This paper utilises a customer-driven investment model to examine the feasible market potential of rooftop PVs in an urban environment. The economic returns of PV installations are calculated for 89,000 buildings separately and by comparing them to the underlying spatial property returns, the profitability and adoption years of rooftop PVs for in different locations are estimated. Implications for CO2 emissions and the impact of the net metering (NM) policy on the rate of adoption are calculated.

In October 2018, the Court of Appeal of The Hague rejected all of the State's objections, including that on the alleged infringement of the balance of powers principle. The court confirmed that, when so asked by individuals or nongovernmental organizations, courts are obliged to assess government actions (including policies) against human rights obligations. By setting the required outcome of policies (at least 25 percent emissions reduction by the end of 2020), the court left it up to the Dutch Government and Parliament to discuss which policy interventions to adopt to achieve this outcome. The Court of Appeal also confirmed, and sometimes even put greater emphasis on, a number of important elements of the Urgenda ruling, such as the role of the precautionary principle, the issue of causality (including the ‘drop in the ocean’ argument put forward by the State) and the potential role of climate engineering. © 2019 The Author.

Water lead levels can be mitigated by point-of-use (POU) devices such as reverse osmosis, distillation, or activated carbon with lead reduction media. Objectives: This study assessed a partial cost-benefit of residential installation of POU devices to reduce lead concentrations in drinking water and examined the economic impact at the community level based on exposures reported in Flint, Michigan. Methods: We calculated the individual consumer breakeven point for each lead abatement option by subtracting the lifetime cost of device installation and maintenance from the lifetime cost of lead exposure through its impact on intelligence (IQ) and lifetime earnings. This approach was then extrapolated to the community level based on reported lead exposures in Flint, Michigan. Results: Based on operating POU device costs, lead absorption from water, and economic losses associated with reduced IQ, initial water lead levels associated with consumer breakeven points for reverse osmosis (7.31 µg/L), activated carbon (3.73 µg/L), and distillation (12.0 µg/L) were calculated. For example, an individual consuming water with 25 µg/L of lead, similar to the 90th percentile of concentrations measured in Flint, Michigan, would have an expected blood lead level of 1.25 µg/dL, a corresponding loss of 0.641 IQ points, and a lifetime economic earnings loss of $14,284. Over 70 years of continued use, activated carbon with lead reduction media is the least expensive device to maintain and operate as compared to reverse osmosis and distillation. Conclusions: Infrastructure failures related to drinking water are unpredictable and exposure to contaminates can have significant economic ramifications. POU devices represent a cost-effective option to reduce the impact of lead exposure, particularly when water lead concentrations exceed regulated levels. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Blood lead levels; Cost-benefit; Drinking water; Flint; Lead; Point-of-use; Water lead levels","activated carbon; drinking water; lead; drinking water; lead; activated carbon; blood; cost-benefit analysis; distillation; drinking water; economic impact; installation; lead; pollution exposure; public health; reduction; reverse osmosis; Article; community; consumer; cost benefit analysis; distillation; economic aspect; fluid intake; human; income; Michigan; osmosis; priority journal; residential area; economics; lead poisoning; water management; water pollutant; water supply; Flint; Michigan; United States; Drinking Water; Humans; Lead; Lead Poisoning; Michigan; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060447827

Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars go through a process of strong mass loss that involves pulsations of the atmosphere, which extends to a region in which the conditions are adequate for dust grains to form. Radiation pressure acts on these grains which, coupled to the gas, drive a massive outflow. The details of this process are not clear, including which molecules are involved in the condensation of dust grains. Aims. We seek to study the role of the SiO molecule in the process of dust formation and mass loss in M-type AGB stars. Methods. Using the IRAM NOEMA interferometer we observed the 28SiO and 29SiO J = 3-2, v = 0 emission from the inner circumstellar envelope of the evolved stars IK Tau and IRC+10011. We computed azimuthally averaged emission profiles to compare the observations to models using a molecular excitation and ray-tracing code for SiO thermal emission. Results. We observe circular symmetry in the emission distribution. We also find that the source diameter varies only marginally with radial velocity, which is not the expected behaviour for envelopes expanding at an almost constant velocity. The adopted density, velocity, and abundance laws, together with the mass-loss rate, which best fit the observations, give us information concerning the chemical behaviour of the SiO molecule and its role in the dust formation process. Conclusions. The results indicate that there is a strong coupling between the depletion of gas-phase SiO and gas acceleration in the inner envelope. This could be explained by the condensation of SiO into dust grains. © ESO 2019.","Circumstellar matter; Radio lines: stars; Stars: AGB and post-AGB; Stars: late-type; Stars: mass-loss","Chemical bonds; Condensation; Dust; Molecules; Stars; Circumstellar matters; Radio lines: stars; Stars: mass loss; Stars:AGB and post AGB; Stars:late type; Silicon compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065013343

Consequently, Peru is currently creating its national structure to combat climate change through mitigation and adaptation actions. Nationally-determined contributions (NDCs) are the planned interventions that nations report for intended reductions in GHG emissions. In fact, Peru has now committed to reduce its annual GHG emissions by 30% in 2030 with respect to a business-as-usual estimation for that same year. The 76 NDCs have been divided into six main sectors: energy, transport, industrial processes, agriculture, forestry and waste. In this context, the main goal of this study is to provide a critical review of the validity and effectiveness of current mitigation NDCs proposed by the Peruvian government to comply with the Paris Agreement. Moreover, the analysis is accompanied by a discussion on how the use of life-cycle methods, namely Life Cycle Assessment, can be of utility in terms of policy support to evaluate the mitigation potential of these NDCs, as well as in the identification of additional contributions in sectors where the mitigation potential has been obviated. The expansion of system boundaries beyond the national context to account for the globalized nature of current market flows or the modelling of indirect impacts of a particular policy appear as relevant advantages of including life-cycle methods in public climate policy. The analysis, which is intended to be of utility to policy-makers in Peru and in other developing and emerging economies across the world, suggests that life-cycle methods arise as adequate tools to monitor the environmental appropriateness of adopting or adapting low-carbon technology to the local context. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; GHG mitigation; Life Cycle Assessment; Nationally determined contributions; Paris Agreement","Climate change; Environmental technology; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Copenhagen accords; Developing nations; Emerging economies; GHG mitigation; Industrial processs; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Low-carbon technologies; Nationally determined contributions; Life cycle; annual variation; climate change; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; mitigation; agriculture; carbon footprint; climate action; energy; environmental planning; environmental protection; fishery; forestry; government; human; industry; land use; land use and land use change; life cycle; life cycle assessment; livestock; low carbon technology; nationally determined contribution; Peru; policy; priority journal; program appropriateness; public climate policy; Review; technology; traffic and transport; validity; waste water management; Peru",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059203933

The experiments were performed in steady state conditions on a single cylinder research compression ignition engine with a bore of 85 mm and piston stroke of 90 mm, coupled with an electric dynamometer. The diesel engine with optimized compression ratio was equipped with a diesel fuel direct injection common rail system. A homogeneous mixture of air and hydrogen was formed using a port fuel injection. The influence of hydrogen share on total fuel energy was systematically investigated between limits given by the pure diesel operation and up to a maximum hydrogen share, reaching 98% by energy. The tested hydrogen share was constrained by practical limits at various loads between 4 and 16 bar of IMEP with simulation of the real turbocharger performance and at three engine speeds. It was observed that increase in the hydrogen share reduces emissions of CO2 and CO proportionally with decrease in carbon content in the fuel. Simultaneously, PM emissions in raw exhaust gas dropped continuously with increase in hydrogen share. NOx emissions for the highest H2 share dropped only slightly from the level of the diesel engine. The engine efficiency was slightly reduced, when operated with a highest share of hydrogen compared to the pure diesel operation. Based on experimental results a steady state performance and emissions maps of a turbocharged four cylinder hydrogen - diesel dual fueled engine were compiled. A particular implementation of a dual fuel H2 - diesel engine in a passenger van in a WLTP driving cycle was simulated. Two fueling strategies were compared. The simulations showed a potential of almost 70 percent reduction of the driving cycle CO2 emissions for the strategy using the highest hydrogen share, compared to the pure diesel operation.

We used the SOCOL-AER global aerosol-chemistry-climate model to investigate 21 different SSG scenarios, each with 1.83 Mt S yr-1 injected either in the form of accumulation-mode H2SO4 droplets (AM H2SO4), gas-phase SO2 or as combinations of both. For most scenarios, the sulfur was continuously emitted at an altitude of 50 hPa (≈20 km) in the tropics and subtropics. We assumed emissions to be zonally and latitudinally symmetric around the Equator. The spread of emissions ranged from 3.75° S-3.75° N to 30° S-30° N. In the SO2 emission scenarios, continuous production of tiny nucleation-mode particles results in increased coagulation, which together with gaseous H2SO4 condensation, produces coarse-mode particles. These large particles are less effective for backscattering solar radiation and have a shorter stratospheric residence time than AM H2SO4 particles. On average, the stratospheric aerosol burden and corresponding all-sky shortwave radiative forcing for the AM H2SO4 scenarios are about 37 % larger than for the SO2 scenarios. The simulated stratospheric aerosol burdens show a weak dependence on the latitudinal spread of emissions. Emitting at 30° N-30° S instead of 10° N-10° S only decreases stratospheric burdens by about 10 %. This is because a decrease in coagulation and the resulting smaller particle size is roughly balanced by faster removal through stratosphere-to-troposphere transport via tropopause folds. Increasing the injection altitude is also ineffective, although it generates a larger stratospheric burden, because enhanced condensation and/or coagulation leads to larger particles, which are less effective scatterers. In the case of gaseous SO2 emissions, limiting the sulfur injections spatially and temporally in the form of point and pulsed emissions reduces the total global annual nucleation, leading to less coagulation and thus smaller particles with increased stratospheric residence times. Pulse or point emissions of AM H2SO4 have the opposite effect: they decrease the stratospheric aerosol burden by increasing coagulation and only slightly decrease clear-sky radiative forcing. This study shows that direct emission of AM H2SO4 results in higher radiative forcing for the same sulfur equivalent mass injection strength than SO2 emissions, and that the sensitivity to different injection strategies varies for different forms of injected sulfur. © 2019 Author(s).",,"aerosol; aerosol composition; atmospheric chemistry; climate modeling; coagulation; nucleation; radiative forcing; shortwave radiation; stratosphere; stratosphere-troposphere interaction; subtropical region; sulfate; sulfuric acid; tropical region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064227012

The WG is one of the important mountain ranges that run parallel to the west coast of India. The mountain chain lies almost perpendicular to the low level jet stream (LLJ) and hence, receives about three times the average rainfall in India. The onset of southwest monsoon also occurs at this region, and thus WG plays a key role in regulating Indian climate through regional climate modulations. Therefore, detecting changes in the rainfall in WG is necessary to identify changes in regional climate. Here, we examine the features of rainfall received and reasons for the observed rainfall patterns in the northern and southern WG. In general, the rainfall peaks are observed in low elevated areas with high inter-annual variability. We find an increase (decrease) southwest monsoon rainfall of about 1.6 mm day −1 decade −1 in certain pockets of the northern (southern) WG. However, an average trend of + 0.3 (− 0.39) mm day −1 decade −1 is estimated in the northern (southern) WG for the 1931–2015 period. Our analyses reveal that this contrasting trend in rainfall (i.e. positive in the north and negative in the south WG) is due to the northward movement of LLJ; from 10°N to 15°N. This shift in LLJ is triggered by an abnormal increase in the surface temperature of the northern Arabian Sea and tropospheric temperature of the north India in the recent decades. The warming helped the LLJ core to move northwards and that weakened (strengthened) the westerly winds over the southern (northern) WG to significantly change the pattern of southwest monsoon rainfall. Henceforth, this study cautions the changes in the rainfall pattern over WG, which can have significant long-term implications for regional climate change. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Linear trend; Low level jet stream; Monsoon rainfall; SST; Western Ghats","annual variation; climate change; jet stream; monsoon; mountain region; rainfall; regional climate; sea surface temperature; trend analysis; India; Western Ghats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051634917

This is an important type of forest degradation in the region that could lead to changes in the structure and composition of the forest, quality and quantity of inputs to the peat, soil properties, and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. We studied peat and litterfall characteristics along a forest degradation gradient that included an intact site, a moderately degraded site, and a heavily degraded site. To understand underlying factors driving GHG emissions, we examined the response of in vitro soil microbial GHG emissions to soil moisture variation, and we tested the potential of pneumatophores to conduct GHGs in situ. The soil phosphorus and carbon content and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio as well as the litterfall nitrogen content and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio were significantly affected by forest degradation. Soils from the degraded sites consistently produced more carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) than soils from the intact site during in vitro incubations. The response of CO 2 production to changes in water-filled pore space (WFPS) followed a cubic polynomial relationship with maxima at 60–70% at the three sites. Methane (CH 4 ) was produced in limited amounts and exclusively under water-saturated conditions. There was no significant response of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions to WFPS variation. Lastly, the density of pneumatophore decreased drastically as the result of forest degradation and was positively correlated to in situ CH 4 emissions. We conclude that recurrent M. flexuosa harvesting could result in a significant increase of in situ CO 2 fluxes and a simultaneous decrease in CH 4 emissions via pneumatophores. These changes might alter long-term carbon and GHG balances of the peat, and the role of these ecosystems for climate change mitigation, which stresses the need for their protection. © 2018, The Author(s).","CH 4; CO 2; GHG; Mauritia flexuosa; N 2 O; Peat swamp forest; Pneumatophores; Tropical peatland; Water-filled pore space","carbon dioxide; carbon flux; emission; environmental degradation; environmental gradient; evergreen tree; forest soil; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; peat; peatland; pore space; root system; soil moisture; soil nitrogen; soil property; swamp forest; tropical environment; Amazonia; Peru; Mauritia flexuosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044237323

To explore the speed and repeatability of adaptation, we examined the divergence of life-history traits to climate, using latitude as a proxy, in the native North American and introduced European and Australian ranges of the annual plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia. We explored niche changes following introductions using climate niche dynamic models. In a common garden, we examined trait divergence by growing seeds collected across three ranges with highly distinct demographic histories. Heterozygosity–fitness associations were used to explore the effect of invasion history on potential success. We accounted for nonadaptive population differentiation using 11 598 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We revealed a centroid shift to warmer, wetter climates in the introduced ranges. We identified repeated latitudinal divergence in life-history traits, with European and Australian populations positioned at either end of the native clines. Our data indicate rapid and repeated adaptation to local climates despite the recent introductions and a bottleneck limiting genetic variation in Australia. Centroid shifts in the introduced ranges suggest adaptation to more productive environments, potentially contributing to trait divergence between the ranges. © 2018 The Authors.

However, careful evaluation of the real impacts of the programs is still inadequate. The paper provides an insight into the relationship between the expected outcomes and the actual results of an energy efficiency program. It does so on a case example of one of the most significant energy efficiency and renewable energy sources programs in Central Europe, the Green Savings Programme. In total, 206 measures were inspected in 124 projects of the program. The analysis of the inspections showed that there is a significant difference between the expected, verified CO 2 emission reduction and ex post, real attained reduction (25% on average). The reasons are partly methodical, but most can be attributed to the behavioral factors of occupants in the respective buildings. The results therefore clearly show the need to tackle the relationship between the calculated (expected) energy savings (and related CO 2 emission reduction) and the real savings which are highly influenced by building users. Ex post evaluations should be done, among other things, to provide a more accurate picture regarding the member states’ energy efficiency improvement obligations. Furthermore, such evaluation also provides an essential input for further optimisation of the future energy efficiency support programs.

CIB. A truncated AccS protein that contains only the soluble C-terminal autokinase module (AccS=) accounts for the succinate-dependent CCR control. In vitro assays with purified AccS= revealed its autophosphorylation, phosphotransfer from AccS=~P to the Asp60 residue of AccR, and the phosphatase activity toward its phosphorylated response regulator, indicating that the equilibrium between the kinase and phosphatase activities of AccS= may control the phosphorylation state of the AccR transcriptional regulator. Oxidized quinones, e.g., ubiquinone 0 and mena-dione, switched the AccS= autokinase activity off, and three conserved Cys residues, which are not essential for catalysis, are involved in such inhibition. Thiol oxidation by quinones caused a change in the oligomeric state of the AccS= dimer resulting in the formation of an inactive monomer. This thiol-based redox switch is tuned by the cellular energy state, which can change depending on the carbon source that the cells are using. This work expands the functional diversity of redox-sensitive sensor kinases, showing that they can control new bacterial processes such as CCR of the anaerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds. The AccSR two-component system is conserved in the genomes of some betaproteobacteria, where it might play a more general role in controlling the global metabolic state according to carbon availability. IMPORTANCE Two-component signal transduction systems comprise a sensor histidine kinase and its cognate response regulator, and some have evolved to sense and convert redox signals into regulatory outputs that allow bacteria to adapt to the altered redox environment. The work presented here expands knowledge of the functional diversity of redox-sensing kinases to control carbon catabolite repression (CCR), a phenomenon that allows the selective assimilation of a preferred compound among a mixture of several carbon sources. The newly characterized AccS sensor kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of the AccR master regulator involved in CCR of the anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds in the betaproteobacterium Azoarcus sp. CIB. AccS seems to have a thiol-based redox switch that is modulated by the redox state of the quinone pool. The AccSR system is conserved in several betaproteobacteria, where it might play a more general role controlling their global metabolic state. © 2019 Valderrama et al.","Catabolite repression; Quinones; Redox switch; Sensor kinase","aspartic acid; bacterial protein; bacterial protein AccS; carbon; cysteine; menadione; phosphatase; phosphotransferase; protein histidine kinase; thiol derivative; ubiquinone; unclassified drug; protein histidine kinase; quinone derivative; anaerobic metabolism; Article; autophosphorylation; Azoarcus; bacterial genome; carbon source; catabolism; catabolite repression; catalysis; cell energy; controlled study; enzyme activity; in vitro study; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; protein analysis; protein modification; protein phosphorylation; anaerobic growth; Azoarcus; enzymology; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; phosphorylation; protein multimerization; protein processing; Anaerobiosis; Azoarcus; Catabolite Repression; Histidine Kinase; Oxidation-Reduction; Phosphorylation; Protein Multimerization; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Quinones",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064721189

The objectives of this study were to assess the livelihood strategies and assets as well as the vulnerability of peri-urban fisherfolks in Lakes Chivero and Manyame, Zimbabwe. Furthermore, the study investigated the perceptions of fisherfolks towards climate change and its effects on their livelihoods. We employed a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods based on the livelihood indicator approach to assess climate risks and the associated vulnerabilities of peri-urban fisherfolks for the period November 2015–January 2017. Results indicate that the livelihood of the majority of fisherfolks (92.3% in Lake Manyame and 97.1% in Lake Chivero) is predominantly based on fishing and farming. More than 60% of the fisherfolks have attained formal education with some even attaining university education. Most (87%) peri-urban fisherfolks in the Lake Chivero and Manyame are aware of climate change and attest to its negative effects on their fishing-dependent livelihoods. Synergistic and multiplier relations between climatic and non-climatic factors such as water quality and quantity deterioration, obsolete fishing equipment and low working capital are key drivers of vulnerability. Economic diversification is the main adaptive strategy adopted by fisherfolks to reduce vulnerability. Non-significant differences in livelihood strategies, fisherfolk responses and perceptions towards climate change are attributed to the contiguity of the two lakes. Application and implementation of similar climate mitigation and adaptive strategies is a potential solution to reduce current and future vulnerability of fisherfolks in contiguous peri-urban lakes. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Peri-urban fisheries; Urbanisation; Vulnerability; Water security; Zimbabwe","climate change; climate effect; fishery; lake; livelihood; nature-society relations; perception; periurban area; urbanization; vulnerability; Lake Chivero; Manyame Lake; Zimbabwe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041217192

Biogas is also at a disadvantage because it has to compete with very low natural gas prices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of integrating absorption refrigeration technology for combined cooling, heat, and power (CCHP) on the farm to help bridge this economic hurdle. A combined environmental life cycle and techno-economic assessment was used to compare 2 cooling pathways with and without co-digestion. We considered using CCHP to (1) displace electricity-driven refrigeration processes (e.g., milk chilling/refrigeration, biogas inlet cooling) or (2) mitigate heat stress in dairy cattle via conductive cow cooling. All cooling scenarios reduced environmental emissions compared with combined heat and power only, with an appreciable reduction in land use impacts when employing conductive cow cooling. However, none of the cooling scenarios achieved economically viability. When using cooling power to displace electricity-driven refrigeration processes, economic viability was constrained by low electricity prices and a lack of incentives in the United States. When used for conductive cow cooling, economic viability was constrained by (1) low waste heat-to-cooling conversion efficiency; (2) limited conductive cow cooling effectiveness (i.e., heat-stress mitigation); and (3) low heat stress frequency and limited severity. However, we predict that with minor improvements in conductive cow cooling effectiveness and in hotter climates, CCHP for conductive cow cooling would be economically viable even in current US energy markets. © 2019 American Dairy Science Association","anaerobic digestion; conductive cooling; dairy cow; heat stress; net metering","biofuel; agricultural land; anaerobic growth; animal; bovine; dairying; digestion; economics; female; heating; milk; physiology; procedures; refrigeration; renewable energy; Anaerobiosis; Animals; Biofuels; Cattle; Dairying; Digestion; Farms; Female; Heating; Milk; Refrigeration; Renewable Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060766486

The final survey will cover 100 × 1 arcmin2 MUSE fields. Each MUSE-Wide pointing has a depth of one hour and hence targets more extreme and more luminous objects over ten times the area of the MUSE-Deep fields. The legacy value of MUSE-Wide lies in providing ""spectroscopy of everything"" without photometric pre-selection. We describe the data reduction, post-processing and PSF characterization of the first 44 CANDELS/GOODS-S MUSE-Wide pointings released with this publication. Using a 3D matched filtering approach we detect 1602 emission line sources, including 479 Lyman-α (Lyα) emitting galaxies with redshifts 2.9-6.3. We cross-matched the emission line sources to existing photometric catalogs, finding almost complete agreement in redshifts (photometric and spectroscopic) and stellar masses for our low redshift ( &lt; 1.5) emitters. At high redshift, we only find ∼55% matches to photometric catalogs. We encounter a higher outlier rate and a systematic offset of Δ 0.2 when comparing our MUSE redshifts with photometric redshifts from the literature. Cross-matching the emission line sources with X-ray catalogs from the Chandra Deep Field South, we find 127 matches, mostly in agreement with the literature redshifts, including ten objects with no prior spectroscopic identification. Stacking X-ray images centered on our Lyα emitters yields no signal; the Lyα population is not dominated by even low luminosity AGN. Other cross-matches of our emission-line catalog to radio and submillimeter data, yielded far lower numbers of matches, most of which already were covered by the X-ray catalog. A total of 9205 photometrically selected objects from the CANDELS survey lie in the MUSE-Wide footprint, of which we provide optimally extracted 1D spectra. We are able to determine the spectroscopic redshift of 98% of 772 photometrically selected galaxies brighter than 24th F775W magnitude.

In order to fully utilize physics based model's potential in calibration development with minimal data, improved techniques been shown to overcome those limitations in this paper. Phenomenological combustion and emission models along with air path dynamics are developed in GT-Suite using steady state points over engine operation area. Models are validated using data with limited data corresponding to variation in actuators and Calibration parameters to understand any limitations of using models over wide range of variations. Accuracy targets for Engine performance and NOx emissions are set based on references from technical publications, understanding of software capability and approach used, variation from different engines, environment conditions and test cells and so on. Design of experiments is carried out using validated model on Desktop for variation in calibration parameters, environment conditions based on Engine speed and Load. DOE data generated using 1D models was analyzed using AVL CAMEO and final calibration maps are generated. Developed Calibrations are validated in Engine Test cell under similar setup conditions of simulation. With the help of this activity, MBC/Desktop Calibration can be performed in virtual world over wide range of calibration inputs and used as good starting point for physical DOE, software development and so on. New Model Based Calibration Techniques aids in developing robust calibration optimizing physical testing and reduction in development cost and time. © 2019 SAE International.

We modeled the relationships between emissions and biophysical conditions, logging practices, and forest policies and then used these models to estimate potential emission reductions from full implementation of RIL-C practices. We applied the method in 8 forest management enterprises (FMEs; i.e., concessions) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 9 in Gabon, and 6 in the Republic of Congo (RoC). Committed logging emissions expressed per cubic meter of timber harvested (to control for differences in logging intensities) ranged from 0.63 Mg C m −3 in a FME in RoC to 4.8 Mg C m −3 in a FME in Gabon, with an overall average of 2.1 Mg C m −3 . Logging emissions were dominated by damage caused by road and log landing construction (i.e., hauling; 50%) and felling (43%; includes carbon in extracted logs). Total emissions represented only about 9% of unlogged forest biomass carbon stocks. Average emissions were highest in Gabon (2.65 Mg C m −3 ) followed by DRC (1.84 Mg C m −3 ) and RoC (1.54 Mg C m −3 ). Emissions from concessions certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC, N = 6) and those that were not certified (N = 17) did not differ. Nearly half (51%) of logging emissions could be avoided without reducing timber yields if all best examples of RIL-C logging practices observed were applied in the same FME. At the country level, if all FMEs were to utilize these practices, emissions reductions would be 34% in RoC, 45% in DRC, and 62% in Gabon. When combined with country-level logging statistics, emissions from selective logging as currently practiced in the six countries of the Congo Basin are equivalent to 40% of the region's total emissions from deforestation. © 2019","Climate change mitigation; REDD+; Tropical forestry; Tropical silviculture","Carbon; Climate change; Deforestation; Emission control; Timber; Biophysical conditions; Carbon emissions reductions; Climate change mitigation; Democratic Republic of Congo; Forest stewardship councils; REDD; Reduced-impact logging; Tropical silvicultures; Logging (forestry); climate change; deforestation; emission control; forest management; implementation process; legal system; logging (timber); mitigation; selective logging; silviculture; tropical forest; Carbon; Congo; Deforestation; Gabon; Hauling; Impact; Selective Cutting; Congo Basin; Democratic Republic Congo; Gabon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061037498

What mostly hinders their wide implementation is that their efficiency heavily depends on the local microclimatic specificities, since they cannot self-adjust to the environmental changes. This study aims at investigating benefits and impacts of smart logics applied to outdoor cooling, by field testing a web of nebulizers coupled to a bespoke fuzzy controller piloting the pump. The cooling action was tweaked as convenient to maintain comfortable conditions and to avoid energy wastage whenever unneeded. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first application of fuzzy logic to water spraying systems (or to any other controllable urban climate mitigation technology) targeting comfort and energy optimization. The prototype was field monitored in comparison with the conventional on-off control, in two Italian urban contexts (Cfa and Csa climatic zones) over 15 days in the hottest months of the year. The cooling and humidification action was thoroughly characterized by mapping both the horizontal and vertical profiles and by applying advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques to spot the main environmental drivers. The maximum cooling (measured between the sprayed area and an undisturbed reference) touched 7.5 °C and 6.14 °C in the two locations, respectively. The energy saving achieved under fuzzy control versus the temporized control, was spectacularly high in the wetter and windier location with an average of −51.2% and a maximum of −67.5%. The comfort benefit was also substantial: the temperature never deviated from neutrality by more than ±2 °C, whereas with the on–off, this threshold was surpassed between the 14% and the 20% of the time by even more than 5 °C. The results suggest that smartly controlled nebulization is an energy-efficient and comfort-effective strategy to counteract urban overheating. Furthermore, solar-powered solutions are well suited as proved by the preliminary design estimation we included. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Evaporative cooling; Fuzzy logic; Smart control; Urban climate; Urban heat island mitigation technologies; Water spraying","Artificial intelligence; Computer circuits; Energy efficiency; Evaporative cooling systems; Fuzzy control; Solar energy; Temperature control; Evaporative cooling; Smart control; Urban climates; Urban heat island; Water spraying; Fuzzy logic; artificial intelligence; boundary layer; cooling; energy efficiency; environmental quality; fuzzy mathematics; heating; microclimate; urban area; urban climate; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061285209

Since air pollution has important effects on human health and other living things, the issue of air quality is of great importance all over the world. Accordingly, many studies based on classification, clustering and association rule mining applications for air pollution have been proposed in the field of data mining and machine learning to extract hidden knowledge from environmental parameters. One approach is to model a region in a way that cities having similar characteristics are determined and placed into the same clusters. Instead of using traditional clustering algorithms, a novel algorithm, named Majority Voting based Multi-Task Clustering (MV-MTC), is proposed and utilized to consider multiple air pollutants jointly.

Although most Southern Hemisphere populations are slowly recovering, the influence of future climate change on their recovery remains unknown. We investigate the impacts of two anthropogenic pressures—historical commercial whaling and future climate change—on populations of baleen whales (blue, fin, humpback, Antarctic minke, southern right) and their prey (krill and copepods) in the Southern Ocean. We use a climate–biological coupled “Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments” (MICE) that links krill and whale population dynamics with climate change drivers, including changes in ocean temperature, primary productivity and sea ice. Models predict negative future impacts of climate change on krill and all whale species, although the magnitude of impacts on whales differs among populations. Despite initial recovery from historical whaling, models predict concerning declines under climate change, even local extinctions by 2100, for Pacific populations of blue, fin and southern right whales, and Atlantic/Indian fin and humpback whales. Predicted declines were a consequence of reduced prey (copepods/krill) from warming and increasing interspecific competition between whale species. We model whale population recovery under an alternative scenario whereby whales adapt their migratory patterns to accommodate changing sea ice in the Antarctic and a shifting prey base. Plasticity in range size and migration was predicted to improve recovery for ice-associated blue and minke whales. Our study highlights the need for ongoing protection to help depleted whale populations recover, as well as local management to ensure the krill prey base remains viable, but this may have limited success without immediate action to reduce emissions. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Antarctic; ecosystem model; fisheries; global warming; migration; Multispecies model; predator–prey interactions; whaling","anthropogenic effect; climate change; ecosystem modeling; future prospect; global warming; migration; population dynamics; predator-prey interaction; whale; whaling; Southern Ocean; Balaenoptera acutorostrata; Cetacea; Copepoda; Eubalaena australis; Euphausiacea; Megaptera; Mysticeti",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062326238

Firstly, CFD predictions for the three conditions were performed following a systematic validation of the numerical method against experimental measurement from methane/air MILD combustion in a laboratory-scale closed furnace. Subsequently, kinetic calculations with a well-stirred reactor model was used to quantitatively identify the operating ranges of MILD combustion in the three atmospheres for methane. Moreover, the kinetic calculation provided additional insight into the fuel oxidation pathway. The results reveal that replacing N2 with either CO2 or H2O would help to establish MILD combustion mode from the viewpoint of lower temperature increase, due to both physical and chemical property discrepancies among the diluents. Specifically, the chemical effect and physical effect are responsible to the lower temperature rise for CO2-diluted case and H2O-diluted case, respectively. Inside the MILD combustion furnace, the negative heat release region disappears in regardless of atmospheres, indicating the eliminated fuel pyrolysis process under MILD combustion mode. Detailed analysis of the flame structure suggests that the combustion regimes inside the furnace in the three atmospheres are all in well-stirred combustion regime, and CO2-diluted case has the most extended reaction zone. Kinetic calculation indicates that CO2 or H2O dilution would result in a wider MILD combustion operating range compared to N2 dilution, while it is more pronounced for CO2. These observations all imply that MILD combustion will be more easily established with CO2 dilution than N2 or H2O dilution. However, higher CO formation is obtained in O2/CO2, forcing more attention to be paid on CO emission under CO2-diluted MILD combustion. Furthermore, the hydrocarbon recombination route is negligible under MILD combustion in spite of the atmospheres, implying lower sooting tendency as compared with conventional combustion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CFD modelling; Flame structure; Kinetic modelling; MILD combustion; Oxy-fuel combustion","Carbon dioxide; Computational fluid dynamics; Dilution; Flame research; Fuel storage; Fuels; Furnaces; Kinetic theory; Kinetics; Methane; Numerical methods; CFD modelling; Flame structure; Kinetic modelling; MILD combustion; Oxyfuel combustion; Combustion; atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; combustion; computational fluid dynamics; methane; oxidation; oxygen; reaction kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062110621

As such, the non-destructive or minimally destructive nature of operator–artwork interactions has been considered as essential in this field. The complete diagnosis of the status of the art object signifying a full knowledge of invisible defects and their morphology allows its timely and correct maintenance and ensures its durability. It is herein presented the basic technical information on the development of a portable system termed Digital Holographic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (DHSPI) for the structural diagnosis of works of art. DHSPI has been tested on a variety of conservation problems over the years. It is a completely portable and fully PC driven automated system for the detection and non-destructive diagnosis of the structural alterations of an artwork, whether they are defects lying on the subsurface or between the layers below it, the fringe number information allows the depth estimation and the complete documentation. The system exploits the benefits of a highly coherent laser beam as essential presupposition for remote on-field access—that is the main emphasis given here—to immovable/movable art objects. It takes advantage of a CCD camera as photosensitive medium to record the interference of the retro reflected object laser beam from the object under consideration with a twin reference laser beam. The device allows micro projections of the defects on the surface of the object to be detected with a resolution that corresponds to half the wavelength of the laser beam. Local disparities, in relation to the total response of the object, are directly correlated to the detected microdisplacement of object surface as structural defects. Special tailor-made software allows full control of the system, processing of the data, and extraction of anomalies. Direct visual qualitative observation of the displacement processes is followed as captured in the monitor. A second custom-made software—not presented in detail here—enables further processing of the results to improve their imaging, quantification, and dimensioning. The final result is a quantitative map of alterations, the coordinates, and the classification of their risks which can be also extracted if further information is necessary. The qualitative or quantitative documentation map can be used as a guide to the conservator for maintenance and restoration work. Further on, the system also allows observation of the object's response to climate changes in order to predict the formation of alterations or the evolution of existing ones providing the only known direct tool for scheduling preservation strategies. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","cultural heritage; holographic interferometry; non-destructive testing; portable technologies; remote access; speckle pattern interferometry; structural diagnosis","Automation; CCD cameras; Classification (of information); Climate change; Data handling; Holographic interferometry; Laser beams; Nondestructive examination; Object detection; Speckle; Cultural heritages; Non destructive testing; Portable technologies; Remote access; Speckle pattern interferometry; Structural diagnosis; Electronic document exchange",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052430476

Because of a low equilibrium conversion of CO2 to MeOH at high temperature, development of efficient catalytic CO2 hydrogenation processes that operate under low reaction temperature is of extreme importance. Herein, we report that TiO2-supported Re (Re(1)/TiO2; Re = 1 wt %) promotes the selective hydrogenation of CO2 to MeOH (total TON based on Re = 44, MeOH selectivity = 82%) under mild conditions (pCO2 = 1 MPa; pH2 = 5 MPa; T = 150 °C). Both in terms of TON and methanol selectivity, the performance of Re(1)/TiO2 is superior to that of TiO2 catalysts loaded with other metals and to Re catalysts on other support materials. In addition, our investigations include the reaction mechanism and structure-activity relationship for the catalytic system used in this study, suggesting that relatively reduced Re species (oxidation state: 0-4) of subnanometer size serve as the catalytically active site for the formation of MeOH.

Design/methodology/approach: The impact-assessment framework was indicator-based and designed for creating sustainable tourism (ST) in a case study. A set of indicators in various dimensions was developed and applied, referring to the UNWTO guideline. A mixed method of primary and secondary data collected from different sources included document review, site observation, key informant interview, questionnaire survey and focus-group discussions. Assessment of actual/observed impacts was proceeded based on the data collected from tourists and stakeholders, especially on tourist behaviors and resource consumptions. Findings: The implementation of LCT program in a world heritage city provided impacts in different dimensions and characters. The observed activities were majorly tourism activities in accommodations and recreational places. The indicator initiation is the first development toward sustainability in a case of tourism study in a city destination. Indicators were developed with participation from key stakeholders and covered sustainability and carbon-emission dimensions. Impact-assessment results show a positive theme in less carbon emission, enhanced local income distribution and community capacity. However, the negative impacts include increased amounts of resource consumption and waste generation in visiting sites. The impact matrix works as the map for decision-makers to maximize benefits and manage the cons of the LCT program toward ST principles. Research limitations/implications: Research methodology, procedure and results on impact assessment with holistic perspectives imply academic contribution and practical benefits for decision-makers regarding ST development. The number of samples and enterprises was limited because of the program implementation period. Originality/value: The research illustrates the impact-assessment process for an implemented city-based LCT program toward ST, where stakeholder participation was also functioning. A list of indicators was specially designed and can be practically applied for other LCT programs in city destinations. Applying a sustainability impact-assessment framework to the program can provide a clear presentation on how to develop ST. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Low carbon; Stakeholders; Sustainability indicators; Urban tourism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062040645

Differential human vulnerability to environmental hazards results from a range of social, economic, historical, and political factors, all of which operate at multiple scales. While adaptation to climate change has been the dominant focus of policy and research agendas, it is essential to ask as well why some communities and peoples are disproportionately exposed to and affected by climate threats. The cases and synthesis presented here are organized around four key themes (resource access, governance, culture, and knowledge), which we approach from four social science fields (cultural anthropology, archaeology, human geography, and sociology). Social scientific approaches to human vulnerability draw vital attention to the root causes of climate change threats and the reasons that people are forced to adapt to them. Because vulnerability is a multidimensional process rather than an unchanging state, a dynamic social approach to vulnerability is most likely to improve mitigation and adaptation planning efforts.

Although resident microbial communities perform crucial biogeochemical cycles for salt marsh functioning, their response to restoration practices is still understudied. One promising restoration strategy is the placement of sand or sediment onto the marsh platform to increase marsh resiliency. A previous study examined the above- and below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in Spartina alterniflora-vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended sediments at varying inundation regimes. Here, we analyzed samples from the same experiment to test the effect of sand-amendments on the microbial communities after 5 months. Along with the previously observed changes in biogeochemistry, sand amendments drastically modified the bacterial communities, decreasing richness and diversity. The dominant sulfur-cycling bacterial community found in natural sediments was replaced by one dominated by iron oxidizers and aerobic heterotrophs, the abundance of which correlated with higher CO2-flux. In particular, the relative abundance of iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria increased in the sand-amended sediments, possibly contributing to acidification by the formation of iron oxyhydroxides. Our data suggest that the bacterial community structure can equilibrate if the inundation regime is maintained within the optimal range for S. alterniflora. While long-term effects of changes in bacterial community on the growth of S. alterniflora are not clear, our results suggest that analyzing the microbial community composition could be a useful tool to monitor climate adaptation and restoration efforts.

While predictability of meteorology has been investigated over the past few decades, the uncertainties in air quality simulations are less well known. This study explores the uncertainties in predicting ground-level ozone (O3) in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States during June 2016 through a series of simulations using WRF-Chem, focusing on the sensitivity to the meteorological initial and boundary conditions (IC/BCs), emissions inventory (EI), and planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme. The average uncertainty of ground-level maximum 8-hr average O3 mixing ratio (MD8-O3) was most sensitive to uncertainties in the IC/BCs, while uncertainty in the EI was of secondary importance, and was least sensitive was to the use of different PBL schemes. Updating the NO emissions in the EI had the greatest influence on the accuracy, with an estimated decrease of 0.59 ppbv/year in the root-mean-square error and an average decrease of 0.63 ppbv/year in the values of modeled MD8-O3. Our study suggests using perturbations in IC/BCs may lead to a more dispersive ensemble of O3 prediction than using different PBL schemes and/or different EI. However, considering the combined uncertainties from all three sources examined are still smaller than the averaged root-mean-square errors of predicted O3 against observations, there are apparent other sources of uncertainties not studied that need to be considered in future ensemble predictions of O3. ©2019.

Recent climate change adaptation policy strives to promote bottom-up, citizen-driven initiatives to improve local resilience. How and under what conditions citizens may engage in collective action remains unclear, however. We employ a mixed-methods approach in Eastern Tyrol, Austria, combining stakeholder workshops with a survey of 216 citizens at risk. Results show that bottom-up citizen initiatives can provide multiple benefits, such as increasing risk awareness and local adaptive capacities. While citizens are open-minded to assuming a broad range of activities and responsibilities, local stakeholders in natural hazard management prefer to limit civic engagement to support roles, mostly during recovery from a natural hazard event. Citizen initiatives tend to emerge in communities with weak institutional capital. This may lead to conflicts with existing institutions over allocation of competences and power. Contrastingly, social and human forms of capital support the formation of initiatives; however, low willingness of citizens to assume leadership positions may be a bottleneck for sustained initiatives.

Analysis of observations and experiments performed with the fifth generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5) show that much above average April precipitation over the ORB, a large fraction of which fell as rain on an existing snowpack, increased streamflow to near record-high levels. Subsequently, two heavy rainfall events affected the ORB in the first week of May, ultimately resulting in flooding. This heavy precipitation during April and May was linked to large-scale atmospheric features. Results from sensitivity experiments with CRCM5 suggest that the mass and distribution of the snowpack have a major influence on spring streamflow in the ORB. Furthermore, the importance of using an appropriate frozen soil parameterization when modelling spring streamflows in cold regions was confirmed. Event attribution using CRCM5 showed that events such as the heavy April 2017 precipitation accumulation over the ORB are between two and three times as likely to occur in the present-day climate as in the pre-industrial climate. This increase in the risk of heavy precipitation is linked to increased atmospheric moisture due to warmer temperatures in the present-day climate, a direct consequence of anthropogenic emissions, rather than changes in rain-generating mechanisms or circulation patterns. Warmer temperatures in the present-day climate also reduce early-spring snowpack in the ORB, offsetting the increase in rainfall and resulting in no discernible change to the likelihood of extreme surface runoff. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"climate modeling; flood; rainfall; snowpack; streamflow; temperature effect; Canada; Montreal; Ottawa River; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051737507

The SBT framework is focused on benchmarking triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability through exhaustive use of lean, six-sigma, and life cycle assessment (LCA). During the validation, sustainability performance of a value-added wood products' production line was assessed and improved through deployment of the SBT framework. Strengths and weaknesses of the system were identified within the scope of the bronze frontier maturity level of the framework and tackled through a six-step analytical and quantitative reasoning methodology. The secondary objective of the study was to document how value-added wood products industries can take advantage of natural properties of wood to become frontiers of sustainability innovation. In the end, true sustainability performance of the target facility was improved by 2.37 base points, while economic and environmental performance was increased from being a system weakness to achieving an acceptable index score benchmark of 8.41 and system strength level of 9.31, respectively. The social sustainability score increased by 2.02 base points as a function of a better gender bias ratio. The financial performance of the system improved from a 33% loss to 46.23% profit in the post-improvement state. Reductions in CO2 emissions (55.16%), energy consumption (50.31%), solid waste generation (72.03%), non-value-added-time (89.30%), and cost performance (64.77%) were other significant achievements of the study. In the end, the SBT framework was successfully validated at the facility level, and the target facility evolved into a leaner, cleaner, and more responsible version of itself. This study empirically documents how synergies between lean, sustainability, six-sigma and life cycle assessment concepts outweigh their divergences and demonstrates the viability of the SBT framework. © 2019 by the authors.","Lean management; Life cycle assessment; Six-sigma; Sustainability benchmarking; Sustainable development","benchmarking; cost analysis; efficiency measurement; life cycle analysis; manufacturing; quantitative analysis; regulatory framework; sustainability; wood quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066942565

Barack Obama claimed that policies implemented during his presidency set in motion irreversible trends toward a clean-energy economy, with the years 2008–2015 given as evidence of decoupling between CO 2 emissions and economic growth. This is despite California being the only state in the USA that has implemented a specific policy to curb emissions, a cap-and-trade scheme in place since 2013. To assess Obama's claims and the effectiveness of policies to reduce CO 2 emissions, we analyze national and state-level data from the USA over the period 1990–2015. We find: (a) annual changes in emissions strongly correlated with the growth conditions of the economy; (b) no evidence for decoupling; and (c) a trajectory of CO 2 emissions in California which does not at all support the claim that the cap-and-trade system implemented there has reduced CO 2 emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","California; Cap-and-trade; Carbon emissions trading; Decoupling; Economic growth; USA","carbon dioxide; Article; California; climate change; correlation analysis; economic development; environmental management; environmental policy; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; gross national product; priority journal; program effectiveness; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061675143

The tool requires detailed vehicle technical specifications and a series of component efficiency maps, which are difficult to retrieve for those that are outside of the manufacturing industry. In the context of quantifying HDT CO2 emissions, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission received VECTO simulation data of the 2016 vehicle fleet from the vehicle manufacturers. In previous work, this simulation data has been normalised to compensate for differences and issues in the quality of the input data used to run the simulations. This work, which is a continuation of the previous exercise, focuses on the deeper meaning of the data received to understand the factors contributing to energy and fuel consumption. Fuel efficiency distributions and energy breakdown figures were derived from the data and are presented in this work. Correlation formulas were produced to calculate the energy loss contributions of individual components and resistances (air drag, rolling resistance, axle losses, gearbox losses, etc.) over the Regional Delivery and Long Haul cycles, given a limited number of input parameters such as vehicle characteristics and average component efficiencies. Default values and meaningful ranges of variation of these parameters obtained from the data of the fleet are also reported in this work. The importance of air drag and rolling resistance losses are highlighted since these losses account for about 70% of the energy consumed downstream the engine. Finally, based on the correlation formulas to calculate the individual energy losses, a method is presented that calculates the final energy consumption and CO2 emissions for all the regulated HDTs classes and that does not rely on the use of VECTO. © 2019 SAE International.

The obtained Pt36Co/C catalyst exhibits a much larger electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and an improved ORR electrocatalytic activity compared to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, an electrode prepared with Pt36Co/C was further evaluated under H2-air single cell test conditions, and exhibited a maximum specific power density of 10.27 W mgPt−1, which is 1.61 times higher than that of a conventional Pt/C electrode and also competitive with most state-of-the-art Pt-based architectures. In addition, the changes in ECSA, power density, and reacting resistance during the accelerated degradation process further demonstrate the enhanced durability of the Pt36Co/C electrode. The superior performance observed in this work can be attributed to the synergy between the ultrasmall size and homogeneous distribution of catalyst nanoparticles, bimetallic ligand and electronic effects, and the dissolution of unstable Co with the rearrangement of surface structure brought about by acid etching.

X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements indicated that the Bi2S3 content had a significant influence on the growth of (040) and (121) facets as well as on the morphology of the Bi2S3/BiVO4 samples. When the Bi2S3 content reached 1 mmol, the Bi2S3/BiVO4 samples exhibited a peony-like morphology. The results of transient photocurrent tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements confirmed that a more effective charge separation and a faster interfacial charge transfer occurred in Bi2S3/BiVO4 than BiVO4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Bi2S3/BiVO4 samples could be attributed to the improved absorption capability in the visible light region and the enhanced electron-hole pair separation efficiency due to the formation of the Bi2S3/BiVO4 heterostructure.

Experiments in the present study included the performance of Cu-Beta catalyst and Cu-CHA catalyst before and after hydrothermal aging, and the effects of Cu content, feed gas space velocity (GHSV), NH3/NOx ratio, and sulfur poisoning on the performance of Cu-CHA catalyst. In the low temperature range (T≤250 °C), the T50 and T90 of Cu-Beta catalyst are 139 °C and 165 °C, respectively, while those of Cu-CHA catalyst are 150 °C and 183 °C, respectively. In the high temperature range (T&gt;400 °C), the NOx conversion of Cu-CHA catalyst is generally higher than that of Cu-Beta catalyst. The temperature window of Cu-Beta catalyst is 154 to 514 °C, while that of Cu-CHA catalyst is 168 to 522 °C. Cu-CHA catalyst exhibits better catalytic activity at medium and high temperatures. It can be concluded that the lower the Cu content of CHA catalyst, the lower the T50, but the better the thermal stability. In the low temperature range, when the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) is 30000/h, the NOx conversion is also the highest. The effect of NH3/NOx ratio on catalytic activity of Cu-CHA catalyst is significant at high temperature. When the ratio is 0.8, the NOx conversion decreases linearly with the increase of temperature. After the fifth sulfur poisoning operation, the NOx conversion decreases from 87% to 63.7%. When the temperature is 300 °C, the catalytic activity of Cu-CHA restores to fresh state after the operation of the fifth desulfurization operation. © 2019 SAE International.

It develops a technical and economic analysis to estimate in what extension (georeferenced analysis) and at what costs (process analysis) can this biomass-based diesel contribute to the Brazilian diesel supply, and to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Findings indicate the annual techno-economic potential of 80.3 PJ (considering the use of eucalyptus and pine residues), mostly concentrated in the South, Midwest and Southeast regions of the country. Overall, 21 production hotspots were identified, allowing the deployment of 27 facilities across the country. A clear advantage of this fuel production route is the fact that the carbon capture and storage can be intrinsic to the process, leading to negative CO2 emissions of the fuel production chain. Total mitigation potential is nearly 25 MtCO2 yearly. Furthermore, while still not cost-competitive without ambitious climate and energy policies in place, the forestry residue-based diesel can contribute to the reduction of the country's dependency on imports, resulting in positive impacts on the Brazilian trade balance. © 2019","BECCS; Biomass; Brazil; Fischer-Tropsch diesel; GIS","Biomass; Carbon capture; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Economic analysis; Forestry; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Timber; BECCS; Biofuel production; Brazil; Cost competitive; Fischer-Tropsch diesel; Forestry residues; Process analysis; Techno-economics; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; biofuel; carbon sequestration; economic analysis; GIS; industrial production; mitigation; plant residue; pollution control; technical efficiency; trade-environment relations; Brazil; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062349659

This requires a strong policy framework to incentivise new investments in a region currently lacking investors, but also presents an opportunity to shape the electricity sector over the long term according to the broader energy transition strategy of the EU and the Energy Community. The aim of this paper is to assess what type of long-term pathways exist for electricity sector development in the region if they follow the energy transition process of the EU. In this model-based scenario assessment, long term electricity sector futures are explored using a set of interlinked electricity models evaluating the level of renewable energy investment required in the region to reach a deep decarbonization target, assuming emission reduction above 94% by 2050 compared to 1990 in line with the long term market integration and climate policy goals of the EU. It also explores what are the most important system wide impacts of the high deployment of renewable energy concerning generation adequacy and security of supply. Key policy insights Energy policies in the South East Europe (SEE) region, both at the national and regional level, should focus on enabling renewable energy integration, as this will be a key component of the future energy mix. EU and Energy Community policies should be incorporated into national energy planning to ensure that SEE countries embark on the energy transition process at an early stage. Stranded costs should be carefully considered in decision-making on new fossil-fuel generation and gas network investment in order to avoid lock-in to carbon intensive technologies. If consistent decarbonization policy prevails, with a significant and persistent CO2 price signal, the role of natural gas remains transitory in the region. The SEE region offers relatively cheap decarbonization options: the power sector can reduce GHG emissions above 94% by 2050 in the modelled scenarios. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Despite the prevalence of this contamination, and the vital ecological function of prokaryotes, just three studies have investigated prokaryote community responses to copper concentration in freshwater sediments. To address this, the current study investigated these communities in outdoor mesocosms spiked with varying copper concentrations. We profiled the prokaryotic communities at the taxonomic level, using next-generation high-throughput sequencing techniques, as well as their function, using baiting with leaf analogues, and Biolog Ecoplates for community-level physiological profiling. Sediments containing just 46 mg kg−1 of copper, had distinctly different microbial communities compared with controls, as determined by both DNA and RNA 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) profiling. In addition to this, sediment communities displayed a greatly reduced utilisation of carbon substrates under elevated copper, while the communities recruited onto leaf analogues were also disparate from those of control ponds. Given the vital role of prokaryotes in ecosystem processes, including carbon cycling, these changes are potentially of great ecological relevance, and are seen to occur well below the ‘low risk’ sediment quality guideline values (SQGV) used by regulatory bodies internationally. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Carbon; Copper; Ecosystems; Microorganisms; Nucleic acids; RNA; Water; Anthropogenic activity; Community level physiological profiling; Copper concentration; Copper contamination; Elevated concentrations; High-throughput sequencing; Microbial communities; Sediment quality guidelines; Sediments; cellulose; copper; DNA; RNA 16S; copper; fresh water; bioindicator; community structure; concentration (composition); copper; freshwater sediment; microbial community; pollution effect; pollution exposure; prokaryote; Acidobacteria; Article; Bacteroidetes; carbon cycling; carbon utilization; controlled study; cyanobacterium; freshwater environment; high throughput sequencing; mesocosm; microbial community; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; pond; Proteobacteria; sediment; Australia; bacterium; chemistry; drug effect; environmental monitoring; microbiology; microflora; sediment; water pollutant; Carbon; Copper; Ecosystems; Microorganisms; Nucleic Acids; Water; Prokaryota; Australia; Bacteria; Copper; Environmental Monitoring; Fresh Water; Geologic Sediments; Microbiota; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061174234

One of the major challenges for molecular catalysts remains the necessity of high overpotentials, which can be overcome by identifying novel routes that improve the energetic reaction trajectory of critical intermediates during catalysis. In this combined experimental and computational study, we show that imidazolium functionalization of molecular fac-Mn(CO)3 bipyridine complexes results in CO2 reduction at mild electrochemical potentials in the presence of H2O. Importantly, our studies suggest that imidazolium groups in the secondary coordination sphere promote the formation of a local hydration shell that facilitates the protonation of CO2 reduction intermediates. As such, we propose a synergistic relationship between the functionalized catalyst and H2O, which stands in contrast to other systems in which the presence of H2O frequently has detrimental effects on catalysis. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalysis; Catalysts; Chemical industry; Manganese compounds; Pollution control; Reaction intermediates; Reduction; Carbon dioxide reduction; Computational studies; Coordination sphere; Electrocatalytic reduction; Electrochemical potential; Energetic reactions; Molecular catalysts; Synergistic effect; Carbon dioxide; bipyridine; carbon dioxide; imidazole; manganese; water; Article; catalysis; density functional theory; electrochemistry; electrolysis; hydration; hydrogen bond; oxidation reduction potential; protonation; reduction (chemistry)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064748287

Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying the regulation of CO 2 uptake and intracellular conversion in cyanobacteria is largely unknown. We report the characterization of a previously unrecognized thylakoid-located CA Slr0051 (EcaB) from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which possesses CA activity to regulate CO 2 uptake. Inactivation of ecaB stimulated CO 2 hydration in the thylakoids, suppressed by the classical CA inhibitor acetazolamide. Absence of ecaB increased the reduced state of the photosynthetic electron transport system, lowered the rate of photosynthetic O 2 evolution at high light (HL) and pH, and decreased the cellular affinity for extracellular inorganic carbon. Furthermore, EcaB was upregulated in cells grown at limiting CO 2 concentration or HL in tandem with CupA. EcaB is mainly located in the thylakoid membranes where it interacts with CupA and CupB involved in CO 2 uptake by converting it to bicarbonate. We propose that modulation of the EcaB level and activity in response to CO 2 changes, illumination or pH reversibly regulates its conversion to HCO 3 by the two CO 2 -uptake systems (CupA, CupB), dissipating the excess HCO 3 − and alleviating photoinhibition, and thereby optimizes photosynthesis, especially under HL and alkaline conditions. © 2018 The Authors.

Using survey data from 313 Chinese households living near large-scale broiler farms of an international food company, this paper employs a contingent valuation method and discrete choice experiment to quantify the willingness to accept an air pollution compensation scheme. The findings are as following: (1) 42% of respondents have a nonmonetary preference for compensation; thus, the conventional contingent valuation method is unsuitable for application to them. (2) The results of a sample selection model show that in addition to income, trust and subjective factors dominate decision-making based on willingness to accept; however, the effect of actual distance is weak. (3) The combination of nonmonetary options is feasible and beneficial for both the company and local residents in the long term. This paper distinguishes between the WTA with regard to monetary and nonmonetary ecological compensation measure (ECM). And it develops a methodological approach that allows the development of WTA-based monetary and non-monetary to establish compensation guidelines for international food companies. Our study focuses on a case study of a major foreign company, providing an example to other similar multi-national businesses for sustainable development strategy in developing countries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Choice experiment; Contingent valuation method; Pollution; Willingness to accept","Decision making; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Pollution; Sustainable development; Agricultural industrializations; China; Choice experiments; Contingent valuation methods; Discrete choice experiments; Environmental compensation; Sample selection models; Willingness to accept; Planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060937484

As we know, the variations of eBC and particle number concentration (PNC) are influenced by several factors such as source, transformation, transport and deposition. The dominant controlling factor for different pollutant parameters might be varied, leading to the different spatio-temporal variations among the measured parameters. Currently, a study of spatio-temporal variations of PNSD and eBC considering the influences of both site categories and spatial scale is still missing.

Two of these severe pollution events are thoroughly examined. The first, occurring on 17 May 2016, tracks transboundary pollution transport exiting eastern China and the Yellow Sea, traversing the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA), and then reaching TRF in the afternoon hours with severely polluted conditions. This case study indicates that although outflow from China and the Yellow Sea were elevated with respect to chemically unperturbed conditions, the regulatory exceedance at TRF was directly linked in time, space, and altitude to urban Seoul emissions. The second case studied, which occurred on 9 June 2016, reveals that increased levels of biogenic emissions, in combination with amplified urban emissions, were associated with severe levels of pollution and a regulatory exceedance at TRF. In summary, domestic emissions may be causing more pollution than by transboundary pathways, which have been historically believed to be the major source of air pollution in South Korea. The case studies are assessed with multiple aircraft, model (photochemical and meteorological) simulations, in situ chemical sampling, and extensive ground-based profiling at TRF. These observations clearly identify TRF and the surrounding rural communities as receptor sites for severe pollution events associated with Seoul outflow, which will result in long-term negative effects to both human health and agriculture in the affected areas. © 2019 Author(s).",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; biogenic emission; ozone; pollutant transport; transboundary pollution; urban pollution; China; Pacific Ocean; Seoul [Seoul (ADS)]; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea; Yellow Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064281610

The actual speed is often higher than the legal speed limit indicating that many road users don't consider the speed limits seriously. Speed limits value should be posted to reflect the maximum speed considered to be safe and reasonable by the majority of drivers. One of the methods to determine the speed limit is 85th percentile. The aim of this research was to determine the impact of speed limit increases on mobility and the environment in urban areas. The results show that a large number of road users' drive above speed limits. There are 4.75% of pick-up and light truck users, 10% of passenger car users and 12.25% of motorcycle users exceed the speed limit. Reduced speed has a positive impact on accident severity and number of accidents. The results show that the effects of a 5km per hour reduction in travel speed are greater at lowers speeds and reductions over 50km per hour bring dramatic decreases in crash risk. Reduction in vehicle speed will be followed by the reduction in fuel consumption and vehicle operating cost of vehicle. Vehicle operating costs such as tire wear, lubricating oil, and spare parts that tend to increase with increasing the speed. Effect of the lowering speed limit was reduction in nitrogen oxides emission and carbon monoxide emission. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064854924

To address this gap, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program collected respiratory emergency department (ED) data from 17 states. Objectives: To estimate age-specific acute effects of ozone and fine particulate matter (particulate matter ≤2.5 mm in aerodynamic diameter [PM 2.5 ]) on respiratory ED visits. Methods: We conducted time-series analyses in 894 counties by linking daily respiratory ED visits with estimated ozone and PM 2.5 concentrations during the week before the date of the visit. Overall effect estimates were obtained with a Bayesian hierarchical model to combine county estimates for each pollutant by age group (children, 0-18; adults, 19-64; adults≥65, and all ages) and by outcome group (acute respiratory infection, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and all respiratory ED visits). Measurements and Main Results: Rate ratios (95% credible interval) per 10-μg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 and all respiratory ED visits were 1.024 (1.018-1.029) among children, 1.008 (1.004-1.012) among adults younger than 65 years, and 1.002 (0.996-1.007) among adults 65 and older. Per 20-ppb increase in ozone, rate ratios were 1.017 (1.011-1.023) among children, 1.051 (1.046-1.056) among adults younger than 65, and 1.033 (1.026-1.040) among adults 65 and older. Associations variedinmagnitude by age group for eachoutcome group. Conclusions: These results address a gap in the evidence used to ensure adequate public health protection under national air pollution policies.

This requires virtually all of the vapors generated and displaced while refueling to be stored onboard the vehicle. The refueling phenomenon of spitback and early-clickoff are also important considerations in designing refueling systems. Spitback is fuel bursting past the nozzle and into the environment and early-clickoff is the pump shutoff mechanism being triggered before the tank is full. Development of a new refueling system design is required for each vehicle as packaging requirements change. Each new design (or redesign) must be prototyped and tested to ensure government regulations and customer satisfaction criteria are satisfied. Often designs need multiple iterations, costing money and time in prototype-based validation procedures. To conserve resources, it is desired to create a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool to assist in design validation. A model that simulates the entire refueling system will be discussed here. This includes boundary conditions of the pump nozzle, the vapor return line, and an orifice that mimics the pressure drop across an activated carbon canister. Experiments are performed both to characterize boundary conditions for the CFD and to validate results from the model. Fuel tank pressure data gathered from both simulation and experiments shows good correlation. Steady state pressures of each method trend the same and have similar magnitude at multiple fuel flow rates. These results show the capability of the refueling system model as a development tool. © 2019 SAE International.

We compared a food crop and a horticultural farming system, regarding applied adaptation measures and factors influencing adaptation. The data were based on a field survey of 267 smallholder farmers in Laikipia County of Kenya. A binary logistic regression was conducted against individual adaptation measures to identify determinants of adaptation. Adaptation measures employed by food crop farmers were mainly risk-reducing, such as mixed- and inter-cropping, planting early-maturing crop varieties and early planting. In contrast, horticultural farmers tended to focus more on intensifying crop production and applied crop rotation, irrigation and application of agro-chemicals, artificial fertilizer and manure. Factors positively influencing adaptation included access to extension services and risk perception among horticultural farmers, and access to workforce and farmers groups among food crop farmers. Furthermore, food crop farmers with access to less risk-prone income sources than agriculture seemed to have less motivation to adapt.

By drawing on a multi-level perspective from the socio-technical transition literature, the study provides empirical evidence for how realignments in the environmental regulatory regime alter incumbent actors' positions and produce varying environmental innovation responses to reduce air-borne pollution from shipping. The study illustrates that the stringency of a regional command-and-control regulation in combination with evolving pressures in the external landscape environment and shipping companies' task environments are essential components shaping the adoption of environmental innovations.

These networks have the potential to reduce carbon emissions and are a key future technology in the strategy to combat climate change. However, large initial investments limit the diffusion of such networks. A large fraction of those investments, apart from trenching, goes to piping. Piping costs are highly dependent on pipe diameter, material and pressure rating. In this work, we focus on reducing costs by reducing the pressure in the system; thus allowing a reduced pressure rating. To reduce the maximum pressure in a hydraulic system, we present a novel technique based on alternating the connection of the expansion vessel. We explain our concept in a lab experiment and subsequently apply our method to the large-scale network at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. At ETH Zurich, we predict a pressure reduction of 8% from 6 to 5.5 bar.

During the decomposition of OM, microorganisms can use the assimilated C for biomass production or respire it as CO 2 , and the fraction of growth to total assimilation defines the microbial carbon-use efficiency (CUE). As such, CUE has direct consequences for how microbial decomposers affect the balance of C between atmosphere and soil. We estimated fungal and bacterial growth in C units in microcosm systems with submerged plant litter. We established conversion factors between bacterial and fungal growth to biomass and applied this to a dataset representing 9 different sites in temperate forest soils, temperate agricultural soils, and subarctic forest soils, to estimate growth rates of fungi and bacteria in units of C, to estimate the dominance of the two decomposer groups, and to compare these values to respiration to estimate the microbial CUE. We observed that fungal-to-bacterial growth ratios (F:B) ranged from 0.02 to 0.44, and that the fungal dominance was higher in soils with lower C:N ratio and higher C-quality. We found a negative exponential relationship between the dominance of fungi and the microbial CUE. CUE ranged from 0.03 to 0.30, and values clustered most strongly according to site rather than level of soil N. CUE was higher in soil with high C:N ratio and high C-quality. However, within each land-use type, a high mineral N-content did result in lower F:B and higher resulting CUE. In conclusion, a higher soil C-quality coincided with lower F:B and higher CUE across the surveyed sites, while a higher N availability did not. A higher N availability resulted in higher CUE and lower F:B within each site suggesting that site-specific differences such as the effect of plant community via e.g. plant litter and rhizosphere input, overrode the influence of N-availability. © 2019","Bacteria; Carbon use efficiency; Environmental stoichiometry; Fungi; Microbial growth; Soil carbon sequestration","Bacteria; Carbon; Ecology; Efficiency; Forestry; Fungi; Land use; Stoichiometry; Agricultural soils; Biomass productions; Carbon use efficiencies; Conversion factor; Microbial decomposers; Microbial growth; Negative exponential; Soil carbon sequestration; Soils; bacterium; biomass; carbon sequestration; fungus; growth; growth rate; organic carbon; organic matter; plant community; soil carbon; stoichiometry; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060907478

Measured vehicles were tested by following in-service buses on regular routes. Six Euro II and Euro III buses were retrofitted with diesel particulate filters (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) or a combined SCR+DPF (SCRT) device. Substantial and statistically significant technology impacts were observed for several pollutants. Optimized SCR and SCRT retrofit technology reduced real-world NOx emissions by approximately 70%, on average. Retrofit DPF slightly reduced NOx emissions but increased direct NO2 emissions by more than a factor of 8, on average. SCRT led to about 70% lower NO2 levels than DPF alone, but for some vehicles higher NO2 levels were observed as compared with the ""no retrofit"" situation, warranting further investigation. None of the SCR systems were found to lead to a substantial increase in NH3 emissions after operation optimization. High NH3 and N2O emissions were occasionally observed while experience with the system calibration was being accumulated. Observed average N2O emission levels for ""DPF+SCR"" technology were relatively high at 182 mg/kg fuel, corresponding to 1.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions. The study shows that SCR retrofit programs can be effective for NOx reduction of transit buses but that proper calibration and regular emission monitoring are required.

Extreme droughts, which are more often prolonged, can increase the risk of forest fires, not only in southern Europe but also, in Central Europe. Nonetheless, catastrophic fire events are not well recognized in the Central European Lowlands (CEL), where large forest complexes are located. Knowledge of past fire activity in this part of Europe is scarce, although several fires have occurred in this area during the previous millennia. Large coniferous forest monocultures located in the CEL are highly susceptible to fires and other disturbances. Here, we present a case study from the Tuchola Pinewoods (TP; northern Poland), where large pine monocultures are present. The main aim of this study is to document the potential effects past land management has on modern day disturbance regimes using state-of-the-art paleoecological data, historical documents and cartographic materials. We then present a protocol that will help forest managers utilize long-term paleoecological records. Based on paleoecological investigations, historical documents, and cartographic materials, our results show that, in the past 300 years, the TP witnessed not only disastrous fires and but also windfalls by tornados and insect outbreaks. A change in management from Polish to Prussian/German in the 18th century led to the transformation of mixed forests into Scots pine monocultures with the purpose to allow better economic use of the forest. Those administrative decisions led to an ecosystem highly susceptible to disturbances. This article provides a critical review of past forest management as well as future research directions related to the impacts of fire risk on land management and ecosystem services: (a) habitat composition and structure (biodiversity); (b) natural water management; and (c) mitigation of climate changes. Designated forest conditions, management, and future fire risk are a controversial and highly debated topic of forest management by Forestry Units. More research will allow the gathering of reliable information pertinent to management practices with regard to the current fire risks. It is necessary to develop a dialog between scientists and managers to reduce the risk of fires in projected climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Disturbances; Fire assessment; Fires; Forest management; Monocultures; Paleoecology","assessment method; catastrophic event; coniferous forest; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; eighteenth century; environmental disturbance; forest fire; forest management; historical perspective; land management; lowland environment; management practice; monoculture; paleoecology; article; biodiversity; case report; climate change; clinical article; environmental management; fire; forest management; habitat; human; insect; manager; monoculture; nonhuman; paleoecology; Poland; scientist; Scots pine; water management; ecosystem; Europe; forest; tree; Poland [Central Europe]; Hexapoda; Pinus sylvestris; Ecosystem; Europe; Fires; Forests; Poland; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061543994

This expansion of cities has caused a rapid increase in vehicular traffic, which in turn has caused deterioration of air quality. To overcome the problem of unprecedented air pollution, the governments worldwide have framed policies for faster adoption of electric vehicles. One of the major challenges faced is the development of low-cost drive for these vehicles and keeping the imports to a minimum. As a result of this, the trend is to move away from the permanent magnet-based motor technology and to use induction motor-based drivetrain. For the induction motors to be successful in electric vehicle drivetrain application, it is important to have a robust speed control algorithm. This work aims at adapting a direct torque control technique for induction motor's speed control. The work addresses the impact of reference flux linkage on the operation of an induction motor for direct torque control over a wide range of operation. A Finite Element Analysis based induction motor model is used to obtain values of reference flux linkage. The method uses offline calculations to determine the reference flux linkage, and a lookup table is generated using these flux linkage values. This lookup table is eventually implemented with the direct torque control algorithm. The proposed methodology for selecting reference flux linkage is compared with variable flux technique for various vehicle driving cycles. The comparison shows that the proposed approach gives satisfactory performance (in terms of speed response, torque and flux linkage) over a wide operating speed range. Furthermore, energy consumption analysis for considered driving cycles is also discussed.

Many technologies have been already developed, or are currently under study, to meet legislated targets. In-line with above objective, the enhancement of turbulence intensity inside the combustion chamber has a significant importance which contributes to accelerating the burning rate, to increase the thermal efficiency and to reduce the cyclic variability [9]. Turbulence generation is mainly achieved during the intake stroke which is strictly affected by the intake port geometry, orientation and to certain extends by combustion chamber masking. Conservation of turbulence intensity till 700~720 crank angle (CA) is achieved by optimized shape of combustion chamber geometry and piston bowl shape. High exhaust port flow also contributes to overall engine efficiency by reduction of residual gas fraction (RGF); this enables high compression ratio (CR) operation by reducing in compression end temperature (CET). In this work, different geometries of the intake port have been designed and analyzed by means of three dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, to foresee the in-cylinder tumble motion development during intake stroke. Final design is manufactured and tested on flow bench. 45% tumble improvement has been attained over base design without loss of mass flow rate (MFR). Similarly exhaust port has also been re-designed by performing numbers of iterations to enhance exhaust port flow and velocity by steady state CFD iterations. Similar to intake port, actual flow measurement is also performed on exhaust port and 36% increase in MFR performance is gained. © 2019 SAE International.

Well-intentioned AM actions could alter disease dynamics for target species and recipient sites, resulting in unanticipated detrimental economic and ecological impacts. Although disease risks are occasionally mentioned in AM debates, current regulations or best practices that reduce or mitigate these complex risks are generally lacking in North America. We use the “Disease Triangle”, a foundational framework in pathology, to illustrate pathways through which AM may impact disease emergence, to identify knowledge gaps, and to suggest best practices to reduce disease risks. We highlight empirical examples in which altering pathogen distributions, host communities, and environment have historically resulted in costly and ecologically damaging diseases in plants. Although guidelines to reduce disease risks in AM are generally lacking, policies governing endangered species, invasive species, and disease management can provide starting points for a more comprehensive policy. We use examples from the United States to identify key strengths and weaknesses that can inform regulations to reduce disease risks associated with AM. We argue that consideration of disease motivates policy development that incorporates improved risk assessments, agency coordination, and accountability mechanisms. © 2018 The Authors.

Grazing, a common land use in different Natura 2000 habitat types, may contribute to the maintenance of protected plant communities and reduce fuel loads and wildfire hazard. Our study aims to assess the effects of grazing on plant composition and conservation status of calcareous shrub-grassland Natura 2000 habitat types, as well as its effects on fire hazard reduction and aboveground carbon storage. We surveyed plant communities grazed by goats in fenced (ungrazed) and open (grazed) plots in a mosaic of calcareous shrub-grassland habitat types and assessed plant species composition and habitat conservation status. We also assessed aboveground plant biomass in grazed and ungrazed plots and modelled potential fire behaviour in those plots for each habitat. With the exception of cryptogams, grazing did not affect plant cover, but positively affected species richness (mean ± SD: 26.80 ± 11.65 vs. 29.37 ± 8.59, P = 0.01; fenced vs. unfenced) and Shannon diversity (2.11 ± 0.81 vs. 2.33 ± 0.55, P < 0.01) in the habitat mosaic. Furthermore, grazing did not affect the conservation status of two out of three of the studied habitat types. Additionally, grazing decreased the fire hazard in grass and dwarf shrub communities without reducing aboveground carbon stocks significantly. Our results show that moderate grazing is a management practice that effectively contribute to the conservation of Natura 2000 shrub-grassland habitat types through reduction of wildfire hazard and maintenance of habitat conservation status. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon storage; Fire hazard; Functional traits; Indicator species; Vegetation structure","biodiversity; bioindicator; calcareous grassland; carbon sequestration; common land; conservation status; ecological impact; ecosystem service; European Union; fire; functional group; goat; grass; grassland; grazing; habitat conservation; habitat mosaic; habitat type; management practice; plant; plant community; protected area; shrub; species richness; vegetation structure; Capra hircus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061972093

Thus, understanding how droughts affect fire patterns in this region is essential for anticipating and planning actions for remediation of possible impacts. Focused on the Brazilian Amazon biome, we investigated fire responses to the 2010 and 2015/2016 Amazonian droughts using remote sensing data. Our results revealed that the 2015/2016 drought surpassed the 2010 drought in intensity and extent. During the 2010 drought, we found a maximum area of 846,800 km2 (24% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) with significant (p ≤ 0.05) rainfall decrease in the first trimester, while during the 2015/2016 the maximum area reached 1,702,800 km2 (47% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) in the last trimester of 2015. On the other hand, the 2010 drought had a maximum area of 840,400 km2 (23% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) with significant (p ≤ 0.05) land surface temperature increase in the first trimester, while during the 2015/2016 drought the maximum area was 2,188,800 km2 (61% of the Brazilian Amazon biome) in the last trimester of 2015. Unlike the 2010 drought, during the 2015/2016 drought, significant positive anomalies of active fire and CO2 emissions occurred mainly during the wet season, between October 2015 and March 2016. During the 2010 drought, positive active fire anomalies resulted from the simultaneous increase of burned forest, non-forest vegetation and productive lands. During the 2015/2016 drought, however, this increase was dominated by burned forests. The two analyzed droughts emitted together 0.47 Pg CO2, with 0.23 Pg CO2 in 2010, 0.15 Tg CO2 in 2015 and 0.09 Tg CO2 in 2016, which represented, respectively, 209%, 136%, 82% of annual Brazil’s national target for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation by 2017 (approximately 0.11 Pg CO2 year-1 from 2006 to 2017). Finally, we anticipate that the increase of fires during the droughts showed here may intensify and can become more frequent in Amazonia due to changes in climatic variability if no regulations on fire use are implemented. © 2019 Silva Junior, Anderson, Silva, Almeida, Dalagnol, Pletsch, Penha, Paloschi and Aragão.","CHIRPS; GFEDv4; MODIS; Old-growth forest; Rainfall; Remote sensing; Temperature","Carbon dioxide; Deforestation; Fires; Land surface temperature; Rain; Remote sensing; Temperature; CHIRPS; Climatic variability; First trimesters; Forest vegetation; GFEDv4; MODIS; Old-growth forest; Remote sensing data; Drought; biome; climate change; deforestation; drought; extreme event; forest fire; hazard management; remediation; Amazonia; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067409846

With the increasing maturity of photovoltaic (PV) technology, household-type distributed solar PV power generation projects are increasingly popular in China. Nevertheless, compared with conventional power generation, the initial cost of a solar PV project remains relatively high. Therefore, to mobilize the incentives of the general public, there is an urgent need for studies on how to share the costs and benefits of a solar PV power generation project between the government and users. By adopting the Shapley Game methodology, this paper has conducted a theoretical analysis of the cost-sharing among the central government, local government, and users and has built an investment cost-sharing model (Ci′=P(i)−Vs(i)−Vri,i=1,2,3), which is able to coordinate the benefit of all three stakeholders. This is followed by a case study. The results show that, under China's central government subsidy of 0.42 yuan per kWh, the best strategy for the local government to encourage the public to install solar PV facilities is to provide a one-off compensation equal to 30% of the initial investment. Finally, this paper proposes relevant policy recommendations to promote the development of solar PV power generation for emissions reduction in China. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Investment cost-sharing; PV power generation; Shapley game analysis; Solar energy","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Emission control; Investments; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Conventional power; Emissions reduction; Game analysis; Global carbon emission; Investment costs; Photovoltaic technology; Policy recommendations; PV power generation; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059943663

Mitigation and adaptation actions can interact with each other resulting in synergies or tradeoffs. An integrated approach that considers these interactions is important to harness the synergies to create win-win situations and to avoid trade-offs for no-regret decisions. In this context, this study presents a qualitative analysis of the existing national level climate policies of Nepal to identify the extent and mechanism of their mitigation-adaptation interactions based on expert survey. Four key sectors having inter-relationships between mitigation and adaptation were identified as Agriculture, Forestry and Land use (AFOLU), urban planning, energy and water. We used Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) to rank and prioritize the opportunities and barriers for harnessing synergies and avoiding trade-offs of mitigation-adaptation interlinkage with these sectors in view. Our results show that such interactions in the Nepalese policy context are present mostly in the form of synergies in the order of AFOLU > Urban Planning > Energy > Water. We identified that developing an institution dedicated to climate change at the national level is the most important opportunity while inadequate institutional co-ordination is the most important barrier for harnessing these synergies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Barriers; Climate change; Mitigation-adaptation; Nepal; Synergy and trade-offs","adaptive management; analytical hierarchy process; assessment method; climate change; environmental policy; integrated approach; trade-off; urban planning; agriculture; Article; biomass energy; city planning; climate adaptation; climate change; climate mitigation; energy consumption; environmental management; environmental policy; forestry; human; Nepal; qualitative analysis; water supply; forestry; policy; Nepal; Agriculture; Climate Change; Forestry; Nepal; Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061254124

To reduce the CH4 emissions, first, pig slurry (PS) was stored for 40 d at 30 °C after adjusting the pH at 5.0–7.0 using H2SO4 solution. In the control (non-acidified PS), 3.7 kg CO2 eq./ton PS of CH4 emissions was detected, which was reduced to 1.8, 0.9, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 kg CO2 eq./ton PS at pH 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, and 5.0, respectively. Methanosarcina was found to be the dominant genus (67% of the total archaeal sequence) in the control, whose dominance was reduced as storage pH decreased. The results of ribonucleic acid analysis and specific methanogenic activity test further confirmed the inhibition of indigenous methanogens by acidification. Later, the biochemical CH4 potential of stored PS was tested. Compared to the control (10.6 L CH4/L PS), the acidified PS showed higher CH4 yields of 12.7–14.6 L CH4/L PS, presumably by keeping degradable organic matters in PS under acidic condition.

This study aims to investigate how people's impression of government varies with air pollution in Chinese cities.

Such an effect is more significant on heavily polluted or severely polluted days. In further estimations, we find that people will not pay more attention to the polluters themselves on polluted days. These results are consistent with previous studies that air pollution causes people to be more depressed, selfish and sensitive to fairness.

Herein, two-dimensional graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets with nitrogen vacancies (g-C 3 N x ) located at both three-coordinate N atoms and uncondensed terminal NH x species were prepared by one-step tartaric acid-assistant thermal polymerization of dicyandiamide. Transient absorption spectra revealed that the defects in g-C 3 N 4 act as trapped states of charges to result in prolonged lifetimes of photoexcited charge carriers. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed that the faster decay of charges is due to the decreased interlayer stacking distance in g-C 3 N x in favor of hopping transition and mobility of charge carriers to the surface of the material. Owing to the synergic virtues of strong visible-light absorption, large surface area, and efficient charge separation, the g-C 3 N x nanosheets with negligible loss after 15 h of photocatalysis exhibited a CO evolution rate of 56.9 μmol g −1 h −1 under visible-light irradiation, which is roughly eight times higher than that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 .

Since productivity of boreal forests is much limited by low summer temperatures, it is expected that trees subjected to warming are progressively decreasing their regional growth coherence in the last decades. In this study, we used a comprehensive network of indexed ring-width records to assess 20th-century spatiotemporal patterns of climatic sensitivity of forest growth around the Urals mountain range above 60 °N (ca. 750,000 km 2 ). This area offers an excellent opportunity to test for warming effects as most north Eurasian conifers (including Larix, Picea and Pinus species) are found along a north-to-south temperature gradient across contrasting soil hydrothermal regimes (permafrost and permafrost-free). We observed positive associations between indexed ring-width and summer temperature over the past century, decreasing southwards. However, weaker (permafrost) or non-significant (permafrost-free) relationships were consistently found at the local and regional scales after 1960. A cointegration analysis indicated that tree-growth release from cold limitation significantly reduced the degree and spatial extent of synchronous growth at short- (annual) and long-term (decadal) scales, most likely by exposing forests to endogenous (local) factors (e.g., competition, soil properties, nutrient availability) and species-specific reactions. Whereas the loss of temperature sensitivity progressively reduced non-permafrost synchrony by 50% over the whole 20 th century, permafrost forests decreased their synchrony only after the 1960s, by 20%. Radial growth was enhanced in permafrost sites, as suggested by increasing basal area increment. Our results unequivocally link a substantial decrease in temporal coherence of forest productivity in boreal ecosystems to a growth release from cold limitation that is concurrent with regional warming trends. This emerging pattern points to increasing dependence on local drivers of the carbon balance and the role as carbon sinks of forests in the northern Ural region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate warming; Cointegration; Conifer species; Network coherence; Permafrost; Tree rings","basal area; boreal forest; carbon balance; carbon sink; cointegration analysis; coniferous tree; forest ecosystem; global climate; growth; mountain region; permafrost; sensitivity analysis; summer; temperature effect; temperature gradient; terrestrial ecosystem; tree; tree ring; Eurasia; Urals; Coniferophyta; Larix; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060882841

We compared the plant-associated microbiota of the dioecious perennial plant Acanthosicyos horridus (Nara) in the Namib Desert in relation to soil parameters, climate, and plant gender. Abiotic soil attributes (soil moisture, total organic matter, salinity) and plant gender were among the main factors correlating with soil microbial-community biomass, basal respiration, and substrate-induced respiration rates. These varied between an extremely arid Far East (FE) site and a less arid site in the sandy, saline delta ecosystem. A. horridus gender was correlated with soil microbiome composition and activity, and varied between the relatively humid and more xeric environments. This study highlighted the apparent role of plant dimorphism in determining soil biotic composition and diversity in a desert ecosystem; however, the cause of the relationship between plant gender and microbial community remains uncertain. Possible explanations include gender-related variation in the plant itself, a link to certain abiotic soil conditions that incidentally influence plant gender, or a combination of both.

In order to ensure that blue skies will greet participants in international mega-events in China, such as the 2008 summer Olympic Games, the 2014 APEC summit, and the G20 summit in 2016, host cities and surrounding regional governments have often implemented stunningly comprehensive plans for controlling air pollution which have usually included the halting of industrial production, the restriction of traffic, the suspension of construction work, and the relocation of residents. These plans are formulated and implemented for a defined period of time only, and they seem to represent an ad hoc top-down campaign-style of governance rather typical of Chinese politics. In contrast to traditional political campaigns in China, however, governance campaigns nowadays involve a much more significant level of scientific knowledge and steering. For the current “blue sky” campaigns, for instance, environmental engineers are asked to design and oversee measures for smog and air quality control in close collaboration with local authorities, while political scientists are consulted to mitigate the potential risk of any public backlash against the harsh regime of pollution control. We argue that the integration of policy and science that occurs for the purpose of alleviating air pollution during these events deserves specific attention with regard to what can be learned about the incorporation of scientific knowledge into policy making in China and its tangible effects. Based on a study of the G20 summit that was held in Hangzhou in September 2016, this article explores how, under this special form of pollution control enforcement, the government regionally mobilized public (and especially scientific) resources to fabricate blue skies. Finally, the sustainable effects of science-policy integration for implementing impromptu air pollution control are also examined. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution control; Campaign-style governance; China; G20 Blue; Policy implementation; Science-policy integration","adult; air pollution control; article; attention; China; city; construction work; female; government; human; human experiment; industrial production; male; management; resident; scientist; smog; summer; suspension",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060314345

The effects of various parameters including steel yield stress, number of carbon-FRP layer, slenderness ratio of the composite column, and spacing of carbon-FRP strip on the axial load bearing capacities of the tested specimens were studied. Moreover, the axial compression behaviour of the circular CFST columns with carbon-FRP composites was evaluated in terms of axial compression force (N)–longitudinal shortening displacement (δ) curves, axial stiffness, strain response, strength enhancement indexes, and ductility indexes. Subsequently, a nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis modelling concerning the surface contact action of carbon-FRP-strengthened circular CFST columns was established and validated experimentally. The experimental and analytical results indicate that strengthening the circular CFST stub columns using carbon-FRP wraps could improve their axial load bearing capacities and prevent outward local bulges for the thin-walled steel tubes.

In the present article, for the first time, the effects of both inorganic nanoparticles as an additive to PCM (phase change materials) and magnetic field on the PCM solidification rate inside a porous energy storage system have been modeled. For this purpose, the mixture of CuO nanoparticles and water was used as NEPCM (nanoparticle-enhanced PCM), and an external magnetic field was applied to the system. The unsteady process of solidification inside the storage system was simulated by employing finite element method (FEM). The impacts of various parameters including Lorentz forces strength, CuO/water concentration, and Rayleigh number on the charging time have been evaluated. Solid fraction, temperature, and streamline contours have been plotted to study the solidification process locally. The results indicated that with augmenting the Hartmann number from 0 to 10, the solidification time was reduced up to 23.5% in average. On the other hand, the addition of nanoparticles to PCM with volume fractions up to 4% leads to, on average, a 14% decrease in the solidification time. The obtained results suggest to employ the magnetic field as an effective solution to accelerate the solidification in energy storage systems while to reinforce the influence of magnetic field; nanoparticles can be added to the PCM. Finally, the solidification time was correlated with three main design parameters, i.e. nanoparticle volume fraction, Hartmann and Rayleigh numbers with a mathematical expression. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Magnetic field; NEPCM; Porous media; Solidification; Thermal energy storage","Carbon dioxide; Charging time; Copper oxides; Global warming; Heat storage; Magnetic field effects; Magnetic fields; Magnetic storage; Nanometals; Nanoparticles; Phase change materials; Porous materials; Solidification; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Volume fraction; Waste heat; Carbon dioxide emissions; External magnetic field; Influence of magnetic field; Inorganic nanoparticle; Latent heat thermal energy storage systems; Mathematical expressions; Nanoparticle volume fractions; NEPCM; Nanomagnetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060930057

Unwise and non-scientific disposal of wastes not only poses a grave threat to environmental quality but also results in loss of economic value of wastes. Since organic wastes are an abundant pool of organic matter and valuable plant nutrients, agricultural recycling of these wastes appears to be a promising alternative enabling value addition and their resourceful utilization. Land application of organic wastes stabilized through techniques such as composting, vermicomposting and anaerobic digestion yielding excellent organic fertilizer like compost augments soil fertility and crop yield. Additionally, the practice incorporates indirect environmental benefits such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, land conservation due to reduced landfilling of wastes and substitute to chemical fertilizers. Economically also, agricultural utilization of organic wastes reduces the cost of landfilling, transportation of wastes, imports and production cost of chemical fertilizers and opens avenues for rural employment.

HDVs accounted for 18% and 11% of the 2014 GHG emissions from the transportation sector in Canada and BC, respectively. Different scenarios are analyzed using the GHGenius model and recent emissions measurements from LNG HDVs. The low emissions scenario of 1 g CH 4 /kg LNG indicates that LNG HDVs could reduce GHG emissions by 22% and 30% in Canada and BC, respectively. Also, the analysis shows that Canada's and BC's well-to-wheels (WTW) methane emissions should be maintained below 13 and 18 g CH 4 /kg LNG to produce less GHG emissions from LNG HDVs than their diesel counterparts. If WTW methane emissions are maintained at the current estimated rate of 26 g CH 4 /kg LNG , replacing diesel with LNG in HDVs would change GHG emissions from +1.7% to +24% for Canada, and from −8% to +16% for BC by 2050. Finally, our study indicates that even methane emissions of 1 g CH 4 /kg LNG would not be enough to decrease GHG emissions of HDVs by 80% below 2005 levels by 2050 as is the target set by the Government of Canada and BC. However, LNG HDVs do reduce nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions. Policy makers could support LNG HDVs for immediate reductions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, but should support methane emissions measurements and control campaigns, and other alternative fuels to meet the 80% GHG emission reduction target by 2050. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Greenhouse gas emissions; Heavy-duty vehicles; Liquefied natural gas; Methane emissions","Alternative fuels; Emission control; Gas emissions; Gas fuel purification; Liquefied natural gas; Methane; Natural gas vehicles; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Public policy; British Columbia; Emissions measurements; Heavy duty vehicles; Methane emissions; Particulate Matter; Particulate matter emissions; Policy implications; Transportation sector; Greenhouse gases; carbon emission; emission control; energy policy; greenhouse gas; liquefied natural gas; methane; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; British Columbia; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061320563

While previous research has shown that sustainable forest management practices can increase soil C storage by enhancing plant productivity, the role of soil microbes remains elusive. We analyzed changes in plant litter, soil C, and microbial parameters across a reforestation chronosequence—with average stand ages of ∼20, 80, 120, 200 and ≥ 300 years—to evaluate how microbial communities mediate soil C transformation and sequestration. We observed generally consistent increases in microbial biomass (lipid biomarkers), microbial necromass (amino sugar biomarkers), and soil organic C with forest age, highlighting microbial regulation of soil C accumulation. Specifically, increases in microbial biomass preceded gains in soil C, suggesting microbial lipids are an early and sensitive indicator of ecosystem restoration. We also observed a rapid increase in microbial necromass relative to bulk soil C in forests restored for 80–200 years, likely due to accelerated microbial turnover rates. These patterns suggest high plant productivity (low litter C: N ratios) during the early and middle stages of reforestation facilitates efficient microbial growth and necromass accrual in SOC stocks. As forests age, the contribution of microbial necromass to the SOC pool declines toward background levels. Our results suggest reforestation offers a positive feedback solution that mitigates climate change by efficiently sequestering soil C belowground. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Microbial biomass; Microbial necromass; Reforestation; Soil carbon storage","Biomarkers; Biomass; Climate change; Ecosystems; Lipids; Microorganisms; Organic carbon; Productivity; Reforestation; Restoration; Ecosystem restoration; Microbial biomass; Microbial communities; Microbial parameters; Necromass; Sensitive indicator; Soil carbon storage; Sustainable forest management; Soils; accumulation rate; background level; belowground biomass; biomarker; bulk density; carbon sequestration; chronosequence; leaf litter; lipid; reforestation; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; stand structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060917127

Using observed air quality data, we also evaluate how pollution levels affect respondents’ support for different types of emissions reductions. We find that reductions targeting both climate change and human health benefits have stronger support than those which address only one of the two. Furthermore, respondents in cities with the highest annual concentrations of particulate matter are willing to pay 30% more to clean up the air when compared to individuals living in less polluted cities.

Thus, the present study is aimed at using a simulation-optimization model to perform conjunctive management of surface-ground water use to achieve two main objectives: (1) minimizing shortages in meeting irrigation water demands and (2) maximizing the total agricultural net benefit for the main crops of an agricultural sector. To meet these main goals, first, the genetic programming (GP) method is used to simulate surface water-groundwater interactions. Then, the simulation model is linked to a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) as the optimization model, yielding a simulation-optimization model. In order to investigate the impact of different climatic conditions on the optimized surface and ground water allocation and propose an optimal crop pattern for each climatic period, three planning periods (wet, normal and dry) were addressed in modeling the conjunctive water use management problem. Finally, the economic results of this study suggested a maximum increase in the net benefit by 38.19%, 59.37% and 45%, as compared to those obtained in the actual operation in wet, normal and dry years, respectively, for one study sub-area.

To study the effect of biochar origin on greenhouse gas emission in two contrasting soil types, we used a robotized continuous flow incubation system and δ 13 C stable isotope approach to compare four biochar types (feed stock: olive mill, corn cob, pistachio shell, cotton stalk) in an alkaline clay soil and two selected biochar types (feed stock: olive mill and corn cob) in an acidic sandy soil. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes was performed at the end of the incubation to investigate the effect of different biochars on bacterial community structure in the two different soils. In the alkaline clay soil, all biochar types in conjunction with N fertiliser decreased CO 2 emissions up to 12% compared to the N added control treatment causing negative priming, whereas no significant effect of biochar addition on N 2 O emissions was observed. In contrast, application of olive mill biochar to the acidic sandy soil significantly increased soil pH, CO 2 , and N 2 O fluxes, whereas no significant effect of corn cob biochar addition was observed. There was a significant linear relationship between the biochar induced increase in soil pH and the biochar induced increase in soil born N 2 O emission. Additionally, we detected a clear variation in bacterial community structure in the acidic sandy soil (phyla Acidobacteria, Nitrospirare, and Arthrobacter) with the olive mill biochar addition. Overall, the amendment of different biochars failed to mitigate N 2 O emissions in both soil types when mineral fertiliser was added. Furthermore, amendment of olive mill biochar stimulated both N 2 O and CO 2 emissions in the low pH sandy soil and altered the bacterial community structure, which was possibly related to its liming effect. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biochar; Liming effect; pH; Priming effect; Soil type","Alkalinity; Bacteria; Carbon dioxide; Clay; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; pH; RNA; Sand; Acidic sandy soils; Bacterial community structure; Bio chars; High-throughput sequencing; Liming effects; Linear relationships; Priming effects; Soil types; pH effects; biochar; carbon; carbon 13; charcoal; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; RNA 16S; unclassified drug; biochar; charcoal; fertilizer; nitrogen; biochar; clay soil; community structure; greenhouse gas; limiting factor; microbial community; pH; sandy soil; soil amendment; soil type; stable isotope; Acidobacteria; alkalinity; Arthrobacter; Article; carbon footprint; community structure; controlled study; high throughput sequencing; maize; microbial community; Nitrospira; nonhuman; olive; pistachio; priority journal; RNA gene; sandy soil; soil acidity; soil fertilization; air pollutant; analysis; bacterium; chemistry; classification; environmental monitoring; Germany; greenhouse gas; microflora; soil; turkey (bird); Acidobacteria; Arthrobacter; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gossypium hirsutum; Pistacia vera; Zea mays; Air Pollutants; Bacteria; Charcoal; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Germany; Greenhouse Gases; Microbiota; Nitrogen; Soil; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059611739

In this paper, test results for the Gen3X Gasoline Direct Injection Compression Ignition (GDCI) engine are presented. The engine is a 2.2L, four-cylinder, double overhead cam engine with compression ratio ∼17. It features a ""wetless"" combustion system with a high-pressure direct injection fuel system. At low load, exhaust rebreathing and increased intake air temperature were used to promote autoignition and elevate exhaust temperatures to maintain high catalyst conversion efficiency. For medium-to-high loads, a new GDCI-diffusion combustion strategy was combined with advanced single-stage turbocharging to produce excellent low-end torque and power. Time-to-torque (TT) simulations indicated 90% load response in less than 1.5 seconds without a supercharger. For cold starts, the engine is equipped with a fast 2.5kW electric air heater positioned upstream of the intake valves. No spark plugs are used. Dynamometer tests indicated excellent fuel efficiency over the operating map. Minimum BSFC of 194 g/kWh (BTE 43%) was measured at 1750rpm- 12bar IMEP with BSFC less than 210 (40% BTE) over a very wide operating region. The GDCI engine operates on US pump gasoline (RON91) and is ideal for down speeding and uploading for improved vehicle fuel economy. New simulations showed that potentially 48% BTE could be achieved through use of thermal barrier coatings and other improvements to the engine (Gen4X engine). Vehicle simulations were performed at Argonne using the Gen3X engine map for a midsize sedan, SUVs, and a pickup truck. Results indicated a 36 to 51% improvement in combined FTP fuel economy over a competitive 2015 1.6L turbocharged GDi engine equipped with intake variable valve lift.

The effects of human and natural change drivers on key landscape characteristics of Arctic wetlands may be critical for ecosystem resilience, with some functional aspects still poorly understood. This paper reviews the scientific literature on change drivers for Arctic wetland landscapes, seeking to identify the main studied interactions among different drivers and landscape characteristics and their changes, as well as emerging research gaps in this context. In a total of 2232 studies of various aspects of Arctic wetland landscapes found in the literature, natural drivers and climate change have been the most studied change drivers so far, particularly regarding their impacts on carbon cycling, plant communities and biodiversity. In contrast, management plans, land use changes, and nutrient-pollutant loading, have not been investigated as much as human drivers of Arctic wetland change. This lack of study highlights essential gaps in wetland related research, and between such research and management of Arctic wetlands. © 2019 by the authors.","Arctic wetland landscapes; Change drivers; Climate change; Research gaps; Wetland management","Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Land use; Plants (botany); Wetlands; Ecosystem resilience; Functional aspects; Landscape characteristic; Nutrient pollutants; Research gaps; Scientific literature; Wetland landscapes; Wetland management; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; ecosystem service; environmental impact assessment; landscape ecology; literature review; livelihood; nature-society relations; research work; sustainable development; wetland; wetland management; Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065044498

We present evidence from a small-scale case study of a flood-prone informal settlement in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to provide a contextually grounded contribution to a growing body of literature on gender, climate change and cities. We argue that the way climate change impacts are perceived, experienced and adapted to on an everyday level is characterized by gendered differences (among others).

Beside the increasing electrification of the powertrain, it will be essential to utilize the full potential of the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). There is clearly a competition of new and different ICE-Technologies [1] including VCR. VCR systems are expected to be introduced to a considerable number of next generation turbocharged Spark Ignited (SI) engines in certain vehicle classes. The implementation of Miller or Atkinson cycles is an essential criterion for increased geometric Compression Ratio (CR). The DUAL MODE Variable Compression System (VCS)TM enables a 2-stage variation of the connecting rod length and thus of the compression ratio (CR). The concept allows a modular integration into existing engine families without significant modifications of the engine architecture and thus represents a cost-attractive solution. The basic functionality and potential were described in a technical paper which was presented at the SAE WCX 2017 [2], the development of the hydraulic function and oil investigations were presented at the SAE WCX 2018 [3]. This paper describes the engine integration of the Dual Mode VCS-system including the hydraulic control system into a state-of-the-art 2.0L-Turbo Gasoline Direct Injected (TGDI)-Engine for the vehicle boundaries of a midsize Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV). Switching strategies, as well as the importance of short switching duration under Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) as well as Real Driving Emissions (RDE) requirements are discussed. The applied fail-safe operation and Dual Mode VCS position control and detection will be described. Finally, the Fuel Consumption (FC) impact of the Dual Mode VCS system is discussed. For the 2.0L-TGDI engine in the actual vehicle class, dependent on the load profile and the specific power and torque requirements a CO2 reduction between 5% and up to 9% in the WLTP is achievable. © 2019 SAE International.

For instance, carbon isotopes are fractionated during anabolic (e.g., photosynthate production) and catabolic (e.g., methanogenesis) reactions. These biological processes exert a major control on ambient micro-scale chemical conditions as well as the large-scale exogenic carbon reservoir. Combined with the ubiquity of bio-mediated carbonate mineral nucleation and obligate enzymatic skeletonization, these biochemical reactions and their control on the exogenic carbon pool are known to leave distinct imprints on carbonate minerals which accumulate as sediments throughout Earth’s history. Here, we study the evolution of the marine carbonate-carbon isotope record based on database compilations from the Precambrian and the Phanerozoic. By looking at the frequency distribution of the amplitude of stratigraphic variation at various temporal resolutions, we assess trends in the carbonate-carbon isotope variability. Part of this variation can only be explained by authigenic and diagenetic carbonate mineral additions, which carry metabolic carbon isotope signatures created in the vicinity of cells and secluded (sub-)seafloor micro-environments. It can be envisioned that compartmentalization (membrane enclosed regions), the accumulation of extracellular polymeric substances (biofilms), and restricted fluid exchange in the early diagenetic environment can create sharp isotope gradients that lead to a high-order of micro-scale carbon isotope variability being imprinted in carbonate rock. The frequency of the high-amplitude variation diminishes with the development of more complex life (metazoan-dominated biosphere); presumably through the dispersing action of bioturbation (eradicating these micro-environments), increased grazing pressure and the advent of obligate biomineralization. On the other hand, stark chemical gradients in a world dominated by unicellular life (prokaryotes and to a lesser extent eukaryotes) are thought to leave a distinctly more variable C isotope signature in carbonate rock. An enhanced understanding of the biogenicity of carbonate carbon isotope signatures at multiple spatial and temporal scales provides a baseline that is usable in the search for signs of (past) extraterrestrial life. © 2019 Schobben and van de Schootbrugge.","Biofilms; Biomineralization; Biosignatures; Bioturbation; Carbon cycle; Diagenesis; Evolutionary innovation; Microbial carbonate","Biofilms; Biology; Biomineralization; Biospherics; Carbonate minerals; Carbonation; Sedimentary rocks; Stratigraphy; Biosignatures; Bioturbation; Carbon cycles; Diagenesis; Evolutionary innovation; Microbial carbonates; Isotopes; biomineralization; biosphere; carbon isotope; carbonate rock; diagenesis; isotopic fractionation; marine sediment; stable isotope",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067410119

All three markets have challenging fuel consumption, CO2 and emission regulations in place and under discussion, which are forcing the automotive industry to make their power train technology more efficient. But not only governmental regulations are driving the change, increasing urbanization intensifies local environmental pollution from vehicles and strains the acceptance of today's car centric mobility. Electrification is the highly touted magic solution, but is it fast and comprehensive enough to solve above mentioned problems? Is society - car owners, automotive industry and governments - willing to pay the high cost for electrified car technology and infrastructure within a short timeframe of 10 to 15 years? Or will so called bridge technologies like 48V BRS (Boost Recuperation Systems) be needed, which are less efficient on a single car, but effective on a broad scale and therefore in total more beneficial and affordable overall. In Europe 48V BRS are already strongly developing and beyond 2020 this technology is expected to evolve step by step into a market leading solution. The following paper discusses the automotive environment and trends in NAFTA, Europe and China. It explains the architecture, function, operation modes and use cases of 48V BRS in combination with the ICE-based (Internal Combustion Engine) powertrain. Furthermore, the requirements on the components for optimal CO2 cost/benefit and the software functionalities of a 48V BRS are derived and described. Future board-net requirements, driven by vehicle comfort consumers, safety systems and by autonomous driving, are discussed. Finally, an outlook of future opportunities for 48V systems is provided.

A DSF-equipped engine features the ability to selectively deactivate cylinders on a cylinder event-by-event basis in order to match the requested torque demand at optimum fuel efficiency while maintaining acceptable noise, vibration and harshness (NVH). Dynamic Skip Fire (DSF) has already shown significant fuel economy improvements for throttled spark-ignition engines. This paper explores the potential benefits of DSF technology in improving fuel economy while maintaining ultra-low tailpipe emissions for light-duty (LD) Diesel powertrains. An analytical model was created using the FEV Complete Powertrain Simulation Platform to conduct a dedicated simulation study of DSF benefits over the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) and a representative Real Driving Emissions (RDE) cycle. The study was conducted on two characteristic vehicle platforms; a mid-size sport utility vehicle (SUV) and a compact, C-segment passenger car. The two Diesel-powered vehicles considered in this analysis each employ a state-of-the-art 2.0-liter, 4-cylinder Diesel engine equipped with high- and low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and a variable geometry turbocharger (VGT). The analysis results obtained so far demonstrate that DSF technology, when applied to a light-duty diesel engine with optimized transmission shift scheduling, can achieve up to 5% fuel economy benefit, while realizing tailpipe nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions reduction up to 40%. The improved fuel economy is a result of combination of factors, including pumping loss reduction, combustion system efficiency improvement and deceleration cylinder cut-off utilization. The reduction of tailpipe NOx is achieved mainly by improved conversion efficiency in the NOx aftertreatment system due to increased exhaust temperatures with DSF technology. © 2019 SAE International.

Previous studies have analyzed NDCs largely in terms of their implied contribution to limit global warming, their implications on the energy sector or on mitigation costs. Nevertheless, a gap in the literature exists regarding the understanding of implications of the NDCs on countries’ Energy-Water-Land nexus resource systems. The present paper explores this angle within the regional context of Latin America by employing the Global Change Assessment Model, a state-of-the-art integrated assessment model capable of representing key system-wide interactions among nexus sectors and mitigation policies. By focusing on Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, we stress potential implications on national-level water demands depending on countries’ strategies to enforce energy-related emissions reductions and their interplays with the land sector. Despite the differential implications of the Paris pledges on each country, increased water demands for crop and biomass irrigation and for electricity generation stand out as potential trade-offs that may emerge under the NDC policy. Hence, this study underscores the need of considering a nexus resource planning framework (known as “Nexus Approach”) in the forthcoming NDCs updating cycles as a mean to contribute toward sustainable development. © 2019 Santos Da Silva et al.

However, linkages between the markets for soy oil and palm oil, which is associated with very high land use change emissions, could negatively affect the climate performance of soy-based biofuels. This study estimates the own and cross-price elasticities for the supply of soy and palm oils in the US using country-level data from 1992 to 2016 under rational expectations, through a seemingly unrelated regressions system of equations. We find a positive cross-price elasticity of palm oil import with respect to soy oil price and a positive reaction of supply of soy oil to increase in prices of palm oil. These results suggest that US biofuel policies may underestimate substitution between soy and palm oils and thus overestimate the climate benefits from soy-based biofuel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuel; CODE: O13; Oils market; P28; Price elasticity; Q21; Q42; SURE","Biodiesel; Biofuels; Climate change; Commerce; Drying oils; Elasticity; Forestry; Land use; Climate mitigations; CODE: O13; Cross-price elasticity; Price elasticity; Rational expectations; Seemingly unrelated regression; SURE; System of equations; Palm oil; alternative energy; biofuel; energy market; energy policy; oil trade; price dynamics; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058002379

The advanced spark ignition (SI) engines can operate under lean conditions to improve efficiency and reduce emissions. Under such lean conditions, the ignition and complete combustion of the charge mixture is a challenge because of the reduced charge reactivity. Enhancement of the in-cylinder charge motion and turbulence to increase the flame velocity, and consequently reduce the combustion duration is one possible way to improve lean combustion. The role of air motion in better air-fuel mixing and increasing the flame velocity, by enhancing turbulence has been researched extensively. However, during the ignition process, the charge motion can influence the initial spark discharge, resulting flame kernel formation, and flame propagation. Therefore, a combined empirical and simulation study is undertaken to investigate the flow field around the spark gap. The flow field generated by a steady flow of air across the spark gap of a conventional J-type spark plug under ambient conditions is studied using optical particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The flow characteristics are compared to the high-speed direct imaging, and voltage and current measurement results of the spark channel in an effort to correlate the spark behavior to the local flow velocity. The flow field near the spark gap in an SI engine under motoring conditions is simulated, and the results are compared to the empirical current and voltage measurements taken during engine operation. The results show that the turbulence is generated in the wake of the spark plug as expected and flow velocity in the spark gap is higher than the free stream velocity. Optical and electrical measurements show the spark stretching and restrikes increase, and discharge duration decreases with increase in flow velocity. Similar behavior is observed during engine operation as well. © 2019 SAE International.

During real world driving, transient engine operation and variation in fuel injection, airflow, and wall temperature are key factors to be controlled. Due to the limited opportunity for optimization of engine control, generation of a well-mixed fuel spray is necessary to create a suitable combustion environment to minimize emissions. Optimum spray performance achieves minimum surface wetting as well as promoting evaporation and diffusion if wetting occurs. Improvement in spray homogeneity is an important step to achieve this. Higher fuel pressure is initially considered to achieve improvements, as it is expected to improve mixture formation by reduction of wall wetting due to high atomization and lower penetration, as well as improvement in spray homogeneity. However, excessive pressure should be avoided due to the associated increase in friction losses. This paper shows that improved injector nozzle technology is effective to reduce wall surface adhesion due to high spray dispersion and homogeneity, which will avoid losses due to excessive fuel pressure increase. © 2019 SAE International.

In this work, we present a novel model which combines bubble-induced mass transport with the spatial distribution of the species involved in the reactions along the diffusion layer on nanostructured electrodes. The validity of this model has been proved through a study on electrodes with two different morphologies. It has been revealed, from the modeling, that the poor performance of particle-based electrodes at high kinetics can be attributed to the large departure diameter of the gas bubbles and consequently to a severe mass transport limitation. On the other hand, the dendritic morphology can guarantee an effective mass diffusion, even for high CO2 consumption rates, thus leading to a high performance over a wide potential range. The relationship between local pH and the formation of C2 products can also be interpreted well, on the basis of reliable experimental data and the valid model.

It is doing this with the help of a theoretical discussion highlighting the links between National Innovation System, state business relations (SBR) and good governance institutions. This is then followed by an empirical study based on this discussion and using various OLS multivariate panel regressions. Evidence is found that the presence of business associations that are widely participated help in promoting innovation. They do this also in countries suffering from low institutional settings, and correct for the shortcomings caused by low regulatory quality. PPD play also an important role in counteracting institutional deficiencies that could otherwise harm innovation; and this is specifically the case for low government effectiveness. High official representation in PPD is a key for such needed outcome. PPD, however, need an open climate where the government is accountable to various societal groups and where different interest groups are free to aggregate their power. On the other hand, favoritism in allocation of resources and Cronyism might counteract institutional deficiencies, especially with regard to low government effectiveness and low regulatory quality. Yet, the overall effect of cronyism on innovation is still negative. Tackling the reduction of cronyism as an objective presents PPD as an alternative that could counteract low government effectiveness and high participation in business associations as another alternative which manages to counteract low regulatory quality, provided that cronyism is minimized in both cases. The novelty of this study rests on the contribution it aims at providing in an area where research is insufficient. There is lack of research on how innovation is affected generally by SBR, and more specifically by either formal or informal forms of SBR and cronyism.

The objective of this study was to analyze the spatio-temporal trends of monthly evaporation at 52 weather stations in the state of Aguascalientes (Mexico) which have hydrometeorological records of long periods. The autocorrelation was eliminated with an auto-regressive model, and the trend was determined using the Spearman (S) and Kendall (K) tests. The statistical significance of the trend was determined with the Spearman correlation coefficient (rs) and the Z statistic (the test statistic of the normal distribution) both indicated that that there were statistically significant trends in 107 time series, of these 88 series had negative trends and 19 series had positive trends. Negative trends were present in all months of the year, while positive trends occurred from February to May and from October to December only. The reduction of evaporation from − 4.10 to − 20.50 mm/month/year from June to September showed a hopeful future scenario for rainfed agriculture. Irrigated agriculture during dry months could have a reduction of irrigation requirements as a consequence of the reduction in reference and crop evapotranspiration. The evaporation increase during dry months could increase irrigation requirements and pumping, mainly in March, April, and November when there are trends with increases of about 26.90, 24.60, and 23.90 mm/month/year, respectively. The spatial variability of evaporation trend means that other effects of climate change could vary in different parts of the state.

In comparison to the catalyst containing only platinum, bismuth hinders platinum oxidation, stabilizing it in the metallic state both before and after prereduction in hydrogen.

Here, reclaimed PET (rPET) bottles are converted to fiberglass-reinforced plastics (FRPs), which sell for more than twice that of rPET. When monomers derivable from biomass are incorporated, rPET-FRPs with superior properties are achieved. Supply chain energy calculations reveal that this strategy for plastics upcycling could save significant total manufacture energy, mainly from savings in associated energy from petroleum feedstocks, and could also reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, this approach provides an economic incentive for plastics recycling and renewable feedstock use through the creation of long-lifetime, performance-advantaged materials. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the largest produced polyester globally with an annual production exceeding 26 million tons for use in carpet, clothing, and single-use beverage bottles, among others. Today, only PET bottles are reclaimed for recycling, albeit at a low reclamation rate, with most of the waste PET accumulating in landfills or the environment. In this study, PET is upcycled to higher-value, long-lifetime materials, namely two types of fiber-reinforced plastics (FRPs), via combination with renewably sourceable monomers. By harnessing the embodied energy in reclaimed PET (rPET) and implementing renewably sourceable monomers with distinct chemical functionality relative to petroleum building blocks, the resultant rPET-FRPs exhibit considerably improved material properties and are predicted to save 57% in the total supply chain energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% over standard petroleum-based FRPs. Overall, this study enables a route to PET upcycling via bio-based monomers that could incentivize both improved plastics reclamation and acceleration of the bioeconomy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.This study develops an approach to incentivize both higher extents of waste plastics reclamation and use of bio-based chemicals. In particular, reclaimed plastics (polyethylene terephthalate) and chemicals derivable from renewable resources are combined to create high-performance, long-lifetime composite materials with properties that exceed those of standard petroleum-based materials and that exhibit higher selling prices than reclaimed plastic. Analysis predicts that this approach results in reductions in energy input and greenhouse gas emissions relative to standard composites manufacturing today. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","1,4-butanediol; biomass; composites; muconic acid; PET; plastic waste; recycling; reinforced plastics; upcycling","Biomass; Bottles; Composite materials; Elastomers; Feedstocks; Fiber reinforced materials; Fiber reinforced plastics; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Monomers; Plastic bottles; Plastic products; Polyethylene terephthalates; Recycling; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Supply chains; 1 ,4-Butanediol; Fiber reinforced plastics (FRPs); Fiberglass reinforced plastics; Muconic acid; Petroleum-based materials; Plastic wastes; Polyethylene terephthalates (PET); upcycling; Plastic recycling; biomass; composite; emission control; geoaccumulation; landfill; plastic; plastic waste; polymer; reclaimed land; recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063763126

However, largely unexamined, are the ways that narrative understandings conveyed in adaptation plans consider and attempt to address inequality in climate risk to urban populations and FEW-systems. In this paper, we examine whether and how adaptation plans from C40 member cities address inequality in risk, by planning actions to reduce hazard exposure or tackling the drivers of social vulnerability. C40 is a network of 94 of the world's cities fostering policies to address climate change. We apply a mixed methods approach, including a discourse analysis and meta-analysis of adaptation plans. The discourse analysis helps to unpack framings of urban equity issues as they relate to policy actions, and the meta-analysis seeks to quantitatively investigate patterns of framing and policy across adaptation plans. Our findings suggest that FEW-nexus thinking is not yet embedded in narrative understandings of risk and planned adaptation actions, within the adaptation plans we studied. In the city adaptation plans we analyzed, we found multiple frames coexisting behind the broader adaptation visions (e.g., risk and resilience). Rather than converging, issues, and principles such as those of equality, coexist with economic issues in an imbalance of incongruent political movements and priorities. Techno-infrastructural and economic investments and concerns tend to take precedence over concerns and interests for inequality in climate risks. We discuss some of the institutional factors explaining this. Knowledge integration, for instance, is constrained by the existence of a plurality of sectors, levels of government, power, values, and ways of understanding and managing climate risk. We also suggest that the relatively low importance of equality considerations in the adaptation plans will likely limit the capacity of cities to support broader goals such as those of the New Urban Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. © Copyright © 2019 Romero-Lankao and Gnatz.","discourse analysis; FEW nexus; inequality; meta-analysis; urban adaptation; urban climate governance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073640539

This study analyses the mortality avoided and the economic benefit which would be derived from a reduction of the pollution of PM2.5 and PM10 to the levels recommended by the WHO in Algeciras Bay in the period 2005-2015. The analysis carried out shows that the industrial zones, such as Los Barrios and San Roque, are those which have greater levels of pollution and in which the relative risk is greater.

Two European trucks and one North American truck were tested using the constant-speed and coastdown methods. When corrected to zero yaw angle, a difference of up to 12% was observed in the measured drag coefficients from the US coastdown procedure and the EU constant-speed test. The differences in the measured drag coefficient can be attributed, among others, to the assumptions in the speed-dependence of the tire rolling resistance and axle spin losses, the data post-processing required by each methodology, unaccounted frictional losses in the transmission, the behavior of the automated manual transmission during the coastdown run, and the yaw angle correction. © 2019 SAE International.

Carbon dioxide (CO 2) has major contribution of 76% in total GHG emissions. Agroforestry that integrates trees in the agricultural landscape is regarded as a strategy for both adaptation and mitigation of climate change. Agroforestry plays an important role in reducing the level of GHG emissions vis-à-vis atmospheric CO 2 through carbon sequestration. Carbon sequestration is the process involved in carbon capture and the long period storage of atmospheric CO 2. In the present study, firstly area under agroforestry was estimated in Central Plateau and Hill region (agro-climatic zone-8) using satellite remote sensing data. Secondly, dynamic CO 2FIX model v3.1 was used to assess the baseline total carbon and carbon sequestration potential (CSP) of agroforestry systems for a simulation period of 30 yr. Finally, equivalent CO 2 absorption was assessed with the help of estimated agroforestry area and net CSP in the zone. Estimated area in Central Plateau and Hill region is about 1.96 million ha, which is 5.18% of total geographical area of this zone. Total carbon sequestered at zone level was estimated to be 17.81 Tg (tera gram) C and equivalent CO 2 absorption is at 65.36 Tg. The CSP of agroforestry systems would be about 158.55 Tg C for a simulated period of 30 yr or CSP would be 5.28 Tg C yr - 1 at country level. On the other hand, equivalent CO 2 absorption was 586.50 Tg for a period of 30 yr or would be 19.55 Tg yr - 1 at country level. Hence, the present study concludes that agroforestry has significant contribution in reduction of atmospheric CO 2 which would have much more if the area under agroforestry and/or number of trees ha - 1 on farmlands are increased. © 2019, Indian Academy of Sciences.",,"absorption; agroforestry; assessment method; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; greenhouse gas; remote sensing; satellite data; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062540997

The European Union's (EU) Member States (MSs) embarked on a decarbonization and renewables deployment program aware of this risk. However, uncertainty remains around which technologies are best suited to the nexus of resources affected. In this study, we illustrate the benefits of using the Relative Aggregate Footprint (RAF) concept to evaluate energy technology alternatives. The RAF is an indicator based on a System of Systems approach that assesses technologies along multiple performance criteria, takes account of performance uncertainty, adjusts criteria importance according to local resource availabilities, and makes the evaluation robust to differing notions of optimality to determine the desirability of technologies. We evaluated 11 electricity generation technologies by cost, carbon, water and land footprint. Assuming equal weightings of the four criteria, we found nuclear, geothermal, and onshore wind to generally have the lowest RAF. We then calculated the MS-specific RAF's by weighing each criterion based on the local availability of the respective resource: 1) gross domestic product per capita, 2) carbon emissions per capita, 3) freshwater withdrawals as a share of renewable freshwater, and 4) land availability per capita. By analyzing variances between MSs’ RAFs we highlighted how differences in resource availability generate trade-offs for EU electricity decarbonization policies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Energy sustainability; European Union; Footprint; Nexus; Relative aggregate footprint; System of systems","Aggregates; Carbon; Decarbonization; Economic and social effects; International trade; Sustainable development; System of systems; Water; Energy sustainability; European union; Footprint; Nexus; Relative aggregate footprint; Electric power generation; fossil fuel; natural gas; water; anthropogenic effect; carbon footprint; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; environmental economics; European Union; resource availability; sustainability; technology adoption; trade-off; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; carbonization; controlled study; cost; electricity; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental policy; European Union; freshwater environment; gross national product; hydropower; land use; Monte Carlo method; nuclear energy; relative aggregate footprint; renewable energy; solar energy; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059838264

The relationship between the CWCs and these fluids, however, is not well understood. This study aims to unravel the relationship between CWC development and hydrocarbon-rich seepage in Pompeia Province (Gulf of Cdiz, Atlantic Ocean). This region is comprised of mud volcanoes (MVs), coral ridges and fields of coral mounds, which are all affected by the tectonically driven seepage of hydrocarbon-rich fluids. These types of seepage, for example, focused, scattered, diffused or eruptive, is tightly controlled by a complex system of faults and diapirs. Early diagenetic carbonates from the currently active Al Gacel MV exhibit 13C signatures down to 28:77 Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB), which indicate biologically derived methane as the main carbon source. The same samples contain 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers diagnostic for archaea such as crocetane (13C down to 01:2VPDB) and pentamethylicosane (PMI) (13C down to 02:9 VPDB), which is evidence of microbially mediated anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). This is further supported by next generation DNA sequencing data, demonstrating the presence of AOM-related microorganisms (ANMEs, archaea, sulfate-reducing bacteria) in the carbonate. Embedded corals in some of the carbonates and CWC fragments exhibit less negative 13C values (8:08 to 1.39 VPDB), pointing against the use of methane as the carbon source. Likewise, the absence of DNA from methane- and sulfideoxidizing microbes in sampled coral does not support the idea of these organisms having a chemosynthetic lifestyle. In light of these findings, it appears that the CWCs benefit rather indirectly from hydrocarbon-rich seepage by using methane-derived authigenic carbonates as a substratum for colonization. At the same time, chemosynthetic organisms at active sites prevent coral dissolution and necrosis by feeding on the seeping fluids (i.e., methane, sulfate, hydrogen sulfide), allowing cold-water corals to colonize carbonates currently affected by hydrocarbon-rich seepage. © Author(s) 2019.

Treatments consisted of R0: 50% Pennisetum purpureum and 50 % concentrate; R1: 20% P. purpureum, 50 % concentrate, and 30% grass-legumes silage; R2: 20% P. purpureum, 35 % concentrate, and 45% grass-legumes silage; and R3; 20% P. purpureum, 20 % concentrate, and 60% grass-legumes silage. The rumen fluid obtained from fistulated cattle was used for T-RFLP, 16S rDNA clone library, and qPCR analyses. The results indicated that bacterial diversity was dominated by Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and methanogen by Methanobacteriales, based on partial 16S rDNA sequences. The microbial communities were dominated by Prevotella brevis, P. ruminicola, Succiniclasticum ruminis, and Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, M. smithi, M. thueri, and M. millerae. The increasing silage diet in a rumen suppressed methanogenesis by reducing population distribution of Methanobacteriales, directly or indirectly, by reducing the diversity of bacterial populations. Generally, the increase silage in the diet changed the bacterial and methanogen community. Grass-legume silage diets of less than 45% are potential for ruminant diet to reduce methane production by a decrease of 4% in the relative distribution of methanogens in the rumen. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Automotive companies have been working to address this issue by reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of their vehicles. EPA has encouraged this by providing incentives in the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Rule of 2009. Improving the efficiency of MACs (mobile air conditioning systems) is part of this effort. Life-cycle climate performance (LCCP) is a comprehensive metric for estimating the greenhouse gases emissions produced by the construction, operation, and end-of-life recycling of a vehicle MAC (Mobile Air Conditioning) system. Many companies and organizations have conducted LCCP for their vehicles using various software tools. The IMAC-GHG-LCCP (Improved Mobile Air Conditioning related to Green-House-Gas LCCP) model is a new comprehensive software tool that follows a similar approach as the current automotive LCCP modeling standard, GREEN-MAC-LCCP ([Global Refrigerants Energy & Environmental Mobile Air Condition LCCP), but with a focus on simplicity and ease-of-use. The tool has added support for water plumbing, multiple evaporators and chillers, electric compressors and user-defined refrigerants. Vehicle usage data for each city including vehicle lifetime, driving distance, and driving duration are open for user edit. Inputs to the software include refrigerant leakage data, MACs capacity and power consumption data, vehicle component mass data, fan data, updated weather data, and drive cycle data to calculate the indirect and direct CO2-equivalent emissions for a given vehicle in each selected city. Curve fits of the cooling capacity and power consumption are used to estimate the performance of the MAC at a range of different engine/vehicle speeds and ambient conditions. The emissions of the vehicle at each time step of the selected drive cycle are calculated. A results report provides the calculated direct and indirect emissions for each city. A model example estimating the effects of improving the efficiency of the MAC system on the direct and indirect emissions of a vehicle is presented. © 2019 SAE International.

A simple framework for understanding the contribution of these diverse initiatives to building community resilience could provide a useful tool for researchers, funders, policymakers and others to understand their current, and likely future, impact and how they might be better supported. It would also provide a useful basis for such initiatives to critically reflect on and assess their own activities and priorities. The ‘resilience compass’ (Wilding 2011) provides one such possible framework and has the particular merit of having been developed with active participation of community activists. In this paper, this approach has been tested by organising data on the activities of 63 hugely varied community-based climate action initiatives in six European countries. This has created a visual guide to enable a simple comparison of their likely potential to catalyse change and consideration of how the efforts of each might be better balanced to enhance their impact. Further, to support the appropriation of the framework by communities themselves, we report the development of a novel online tool for community initiatives to use for resilience self-assessment and a downloadable resource to support them to run participatory, community resilience workshops. We conclude that this approach has significant potential to advance the scientific understanding of community resilience, and so help create the conditions in which the transformational ‘bouncing forward’ to a low-carbon future can emerge. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Community; Resilience; Transformation; Transition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051718296

After decades of reduced primary emissions, it is now possible that the POPs contained in these reservoirs are being remobilized because of climate warming. However, a comprehensive investigation into the remobilization of POPs from background soil on the largest and highest plateau on Earth, the Tibetan Plateau (TP), is lacking. In this study, a sampling campaign was carried out on the TP at three background sites with different land cover types (forest, meadow and desert). Field measurements of the air-soil exchange of POPs showed that previous prediction using empirical models overestimated the values of the soil-air partitioning coefficient (K SA ), especially for chemicals with K OA &gt; 9. The direction of exchange for γ-HCH, HCB, and PCB-28 overlapped with the air-soil equilibrium range, but with a tendency for volatilization. Their emission fluxes were 720, 2935, and 538 pg m -2 day -1 , respectively, and were similar in extent to those observed for background Arctic soil in Norway. Nam Co and Ngari are also permafrost regions, and most chemicals at these two sites exhibited volatilization. This is the first result showing that permafrost can also emit POPs. Seasonally, we found that chemicals tended to be re-emitted from soils to the atmosphere in winter and deposited from the air to the soil in summer. This finding is opposite to most previous results, possibly because of the higher air-soil concentration gradient caused by the prevailing transport of POPs in summer. Climate warming exerts a strong influence on air-soil exchange, with an increase of 1 °C in ambient temperature likely leading to an increase of Tibetan atmospheric inventories of POPs by 60-400%.

In this article, we present our initial experience with this technique. Materials and Methods: We used a three-port technique through the oral vestibule, one 10 mm port for the laparoscope and two additional 5 mm ports for the endoscopic instruments required. The carbon dioxide insufflation pressure was set at 12 mm of Hg. Anterior cervical subplatysmal space was created from the oral vestibule down to the sternal notch, and the thyroidectomy was done using conventional laparoscopic instruments and a harmonic scalpel. Results: From May 2016 to December 2017, we have performed ten such procedures in the Department of General Surgery in our hospital, which is a tertiary referral center. Six patients had solitary thyroid nodules, for which a hemi-thyroidectomy was done. Four patients had multi-nodular goiter and total thyroidectomy or near-total thyroidectomy was done. The preoperative fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was suggestive of Bethesda class 2 lesions in all the patients with multinodular goiter and in five of the six patients with solitary nodular goiter. Only one patient with solitary nodular goiter had a Bethesda class 3 lesion on FNAC. The final histopathological report of the specimen was benign, either colloid goiter, or degenerative nodule in all cases of multinodular goiter and in four cases of solitary thyroid nodule. In one Bethesda class 2 solitary nodule, the histopathological report was suggestive of follicular carcinoma; in the Bethesda class 3 solitary nodule, the histopathological report was suggestive of follicular variant of papillary carcinoma. No complication such as temporary or permanent vocal cord paralysis, hypoparathyroidism, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, tracheal injury, esophageal injury, mental nerve palsy, or surgical site infection was found postoperatively. However, two patients developed small hematomas in the midline. Conclusion: Transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy is a safe, feasible, and minimally invasive technique with excellent cosmetic results. © 2018 Journal of Postgraduate Medicine.","Endoscopic thyroidectomy using vestibular approach; scar-free thyroidectomy; transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy","adult; Article; carbon dioxide tension; clinical article; endoscopic surgery; female; fine needle aspiration biopsy; follicular carcinoma; follow up; hematoma; histopathology; human; male; nerve paralysis; nodular goiter; operation duration; papillary carcinoma; postoperative period; thyroid nodule; thyroidectomy; endoscopy; natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery; procedures; thyroid disease; thyroid gland; thyroidectomy; treatment outcome; Adult; Endoscopy; Female; Humans; Male; Natural Orifice Endoscopic Surgery; Thyroid Diseases; Thyroid Gland; Thyroidectomy; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065186480

This meta-analysis investigated correlations of R. raciborskii with water temperature and N:P (nitrogen to phosphorus)-ratios across four lakes with different climates and trophic states by means of long-term time series and the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA. The results have shown that in the lakes with temperate and Mediterranean climate, R. raciborskii is strongly correlated with water temperature since germination and growth rely on rising water temperatures in spring. In contrast, there was a weaker correlation with water temperature in subtropical and tropical lakes where pelagic populations of R. raciborskii are overwintering, and are present all year round. However, the highest abundances of R. raciborskii coincided with highest water temperature for the Mediterranean, subtropical and tropical lakes, whilst in the temperate Langer See the highest abundances of R. raciborskii occurred at 24.1 °C, even though temperatures of up to 27 °C were recorded in 2013 and 2014. The correlation of R. raciborskii with N:P-ratios proved to be strongest for the meso- to eutrophic Lake Kinneret (r2 = 0.8) and lowest for the eutrophic Lake Paranoa (r2 = 0.16). However, the assumption has been confirmed that R. raciborskii is growing fastest when waters are N-limited regardless of trophic states. In terms of phenology, the temperate and Mediterranean lakes displayed “fastest growth” in spring and early summer. In contrast, the growing season in subtropical and tropical lakes lasted from spring to autumn most likely because of overwintering populations, and growing importance of direct and indirect biotic regulating factors such as competition, grazing, remineralisation of nutrients along warming climate. In order to carry out a meta-analysis of time series across four different lakes, HEA served as powerful tool resulting in inferential models with predictive capacity for population dynamics of R. raciborskii just driven by water temperature or N:P-ratios, whilst coefficients of determination r2 served as criteria for hypotheses testing. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate; Eutrophication; Four lakes; Hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA; Meta-analysis; N:P-ratios; Phenology; Raphidiopsis raciborskii; Water temperature","climate; Cylindrospermopsis; lake; meta analysis; phytoplankton; temperature; Climate; Cylindrospermopsis; Lakes; Phytoplankton; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064453915

Findings from the study suggest that the communities involved have achieved positive outcomes from the approach. Capacity building and advocacy training have made the involved communities more proactive, which has increased the collaboration between the communities and local governance. Climate change adaptation has now become one of the key priorities on the political agenda of the local district assemblies.

A precise estimate of aboveground biomass of the juvenile stages of trees is therefore very important. We developed a generalized allometric biomass model for the prediction of aboveground biomass of the juvenile individuals of Rhododendron arboreum (Sm.). We used data from 66 destructively sampled juveniles of R. arboreum in Gorkha district-one of the mountainous districts in Nepal, for the purpose. Using eight nonlinear functions of various forms (power, exponential, fractional forms), we evaluated several individual-level characteristics, such as size (diameter, height), crown measures (crown ratio, crown width, crown spread ratio, crown index, crown fullness ratio), height-to-diameter ratio (plant bole slenderness), number of branches, wood density, and stand-level characteristics, such as altitude and slope of sites for their potential contributions to the biomass variations of the juvenile individuals. A simple power function with cross-product of the squared-diameter and height as a main predictor and crown spread ratio as a covariate predictor showed the best fit to data (R2 adj =0. 90); RMSE=59.35 g) without adj substantial trends in the residuals. Our model is site-specific and its application should therefore be limited to those stands which were the basis of this study. Further works on recalibration, validation, and verification of our model using a larger dataset collected from a wider range of species distribution will be more interesting. © 2019, Federal University of Lavras.

The collective and contextual nature of anomalies (e.g., heat waves) coupled with the real-valued, seasonal, multimodal, highly correlated, and gridded nature of climate variable observations poses a multitude of challenges. Existing anomaly detection methods have limitations in the specific setting of real-valued areal spatiotemporal data. In this paper, we develop a method for extreme event detection in meteorological datasets that follows from well known distribution-based anomaly detection approaches. The method models spatial and temporal correlations explicitly through a piecewise parametric assumption and generalizes the Mahalanobis distance across distributions of different dimensionalities. The result is an effective method to mine contiguous spatiotemporal anomalous regions from meteorological fields which improves upon the current standard approach in climatology. The proposed method has been evaluated on a real global surface temperature dataset and validated using historical records of extreme events. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","anomaly detection; clustering; spatiotemporal data mining","Climatology; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection methods; clustering; Global surface temperature; Meteorological datasets; Meteorological fields; Spatial and temporal correlation; Spatio-temporal data mining; Data mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059058243

The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, run at 12-km horizontal grid spacing, is compared to both CESM simulations. VR-CESM and WRF are more comparable to satellite and surface-based observations than UN-CESM in simulating summertime (June to August) temperature across the TP and TP foothills, respectively. WRF and VR-CESM also more accurately simulate precipitation than UN-CESM across the region due to more accurate terrain treatment. The number of days in which effective (>2.5 mm/day) and heavy (>25 mm/day) precipitation events are generally better captured in VR-CESM compared to UN-CESM and WRF. Finally, snow cover fraction in VR-CESM is better simulated for all months compared to UN-CESM, with the largest improvements simulated from June to August, while WRF performs even better than VR-CESM in simulating snow cover fraction. The improvements in simulated temperature, precipitation, and snow cover are due to WRF and VR-CESM's ability to resolve more complex topographic features rather than time step differences between the UN-CESM and VR-CESM experiments. While it is fairly intuitive that improved topography accuracy should bring forth more accurate simulated meteorology, this evaluation suggests that VR-CESM is competitive or may even be preferred over regional climate models (such as WRF) when examining internal and external climate variability, as it bypasses several drawbacks associated with regional climate models. ©2019.

Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is an effective way to achieve very low tailpipe NOx-emission levels. For an efficient after treatment system, a homogeneous distribution of gaseous ammonia across the catalytic surface is essential. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the impingement of the injected urea water solution (UWS), its evaporation and transformation to gaseous ammonia is of vital importance. Due to the complex physics of the impingement process, the simulation of SCR systems with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) relies upon empirical models known as impingement maps. In the current study a droplet chain generator was used to investigate single droplet impingement of UWS. The impingement events were filmed with a high speed camera and then analysed with respect to impingement velocity and droplet diameter as well as droplet Weber-number. Together with the recorded surface temperature of the impingement target, an impingement map was drawn. In contrast to previous investigations, these experiments were mainly carried out in the range of the critical temperature that separates impingement regimes that result in wall wetting and regimes with thermal rebound or break-up. The results revealed a temperature range that is relevant for SCR applications where instead of pure film formation and evaporation an immediate boiling of the film followed by thermal breakup was observed. Consequently, in comparison to the often used Bai-Gosman- or Bai-Onera-impingement-diagram, a significant amount of secondary droplets is created instead of all mass being transferred to liquid film. Although this film boiling has been described for water in literature before, to the best of our knowledge, it has never been implemented into CFD and applied to a complete SCR system. With the implementation of the observed behaviour by specifying a certain fraction of droplets to rebound from the surface in the specific regions of the impingement map, a significant improvement of the simulation results could be demonstrated. © 2019 SAE International.

To do this, we have formulated and implemented an optimization model based on a mixed-integer linear program, which determines the optimal expansion plan considering the installation of both large-scale power plants and renewable-based distributed generation. An important characteristic of the proposed model is that it includes a detailed formulation of the power system. Moreover, differently than existing literature, special attention is given to the analysis of the spatial-temporal distributive effects of pollutant taxes, considering both global and local pollutant emissions. The method is applied to the main Chilean power system. Our results indicate that global and local pollutant taxes significantly impact both planning and operational decisions in the power system. In particular, pollutant taxes may have significant spatial distributive effects, as shown in the analysis of 13 regions of Chile, leading to damages in some specific regions while relatively benefiting others. Our results also show that the availability of renewable energy capacity may improve the effectiveness of pollutant taxes. Particularly, adding 1.5 GW of hydro capacity to the Chilean system allows avoiding around 32 GWh of fossil fuel generation per year, saving more than 1.5 billion US$ in the 10-year horizon considered.

However, during the use of the electric bus, according to the reflection of the passengers and the drivers, the vibration noise was abnormal under the two-gear and the three-gear acceleration conditions. Compared with the traditional diesel bus, the gearbox noise of electric bus is more prominent due to time varying loads effect and the absence of diesel engine masking effect under the acceleration condition, which deteriorates the NVH characteristics of the whole vehicle. Therefore, the gearbox of electric bus is researched as an object in this paper. The test results showed that the radiated noise of the gearbox under the three-gear acceleration condition was significantly higher than the two-gear acceleration condition, and the meshing noise of the shifting gear of the three-gear was found to be the main source of the gearbox radiated noise under the three-gear acceleration condition by order analysis, so the shifting gear of the three-gear was optimized as an object. In this paper, the boundary element radiated noise model has been established in the acoustic radiation software, and the radiated noise model has been verified by the bench test under the three-gear acceleration condition.

Green areas in urban spaces with different green coverage rates in Baoji City were selected to quantitatively compare the effects and differences of month, time, temperature, humidity, wind velocity, vegetation structure, and area of site on PM2.5 and PM10 concentration. The results showed that increasing the urban green coverage rate will help to improve the green area’s reduction of airborne particulate matter concentration and the selected factors affecting the green area’s reduction ability were discrepant in urban spaces with different green coverage rates. With the decrease of the green coverage rate, the purification effect of green area itself on air particles was weakened, and other factors, such as meteorological conditions and human activities, became the dominant influencing factors. Vegetation structure only had significant effects on the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 in green areas of urban space with a green coverage rate greater than 75%. The concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 were lowest in the partly closed green area of one-layered coniferous trees and the closed green area of one-layered mixed trees.

In part, this is due to interactions between emissions from surrounding large cities (e.g., Chicago) and meteorology, which is heavily influenced by the presence of the Great Lakes. These complex meteorology-emissions interactions pose a challenge to fully capture O3 dynamics, particularly near shores of the lakes, where high O3 levels are often experienced. In a simulation with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, using inputs as typically constructed, the model tends to be biased high. A literature review indicated that NOx emissions from mobile sources, possibly overestimated in the 2011 National Emission Inventory (NEI), or the version of the Carbon Bond chemical mechanism used in CMAQ could be responsible for high biases of O3. As such, a series of sensitivity tests was conducted to identify potential causes for this bias, including emissions biases (e.g., biogenic VOCs, anthropogenic NOx), chemical mechanism choice, and O3 dry deposition to fresh water, for high O3 periods in July 2011. The base model/emissions configuration used the following: Carbon Bond mechanism CB05, biogenic emissions using Biogenic Emission Inventory System (BEIS), and anthropogenic emissions from the 2011 National Emissions Inventory (NEI). Meteorological inputs were developed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (version 3.8.1). Simulated daily maximum 8-h average O3 without and with a cutoff of 60 ppb (referred to as MDA8 O3 and elevated MDA8 O3 hereafter, respectively) were evaluated against measurements. The evaluation showed a high bias in MDA8 O3 across the domain, particularly at coastal sites (by ∼6 ppb), while elevated MDA8 O3 (i.e., greater than 60 ppb) was biased low, with exceptions centered along the shore of Lake Michigan. Using the CB6 chemical mechanism or 50% reduction of NOx emissions from on-road mobile sources led to substantial domain-wide decreases in O3 from the base case, and the model performance improved, particularly along the Lake Michigan shoreline and for the western domain. However, elevated MDA8 O3 was more biased against measurements, compared to the model performance in the base case, except at a few sites along the shoreline. Using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) instead of BEIS to estimate biogenic emissions, or increasing dry deposition of O3 to fresh water by a factor of ten (which is unrealistic), had minor impacts on simulated O3 over land. But, combining MEGAN with CB6 resulted in improved elevated MDA8 O3 simulation along the western coast of Lake Michigan. Finally, using CB6 combined with a 30% reduction of on-road mobile NOx emissions and MEGAN led to the best performance. Two companion papers investigate how meteorological modeling can be improved. Together, the recommended modeling system could serve as a starting point for future O3 modeling in the region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CB6; CMAQ; MEGAN; NOx emissions; Ozone; The great lakes region","Air quality; Carbon; Deposition; Meteorology; Mobile power plants; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Reduction; Roads and streets; Water; Weather forecasting; CMAQ; Community multi-scale air qualities; Great Lakes regions; MEGAN; National emission inventories; National emissions inventories; NOx emissions; Weather research and forecasting models; Lakes; carbon; fresh water; ozone; air quality; anthropogenic source; biogenic emission; dry deposition; emission control; emission inventory; nitrous oxide; ozone; performance assessment; sensitivity analysis; shoreline; weather forecasting; aerosol; air quality; Article; atmospheric deposition; chemical bond; dry deposition; forecasting; meteorology; priority journal; simulation; United States; weather; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Michigan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060602085

The drought induced by strong El Niño event occurred in the tropics during 2015 and 2016. However, it is still unclear to what extent the drought could affect photosynthetic activities of crop and forest in Southeast Asia. Here, we used the satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which is a proxy of actual photosynthesis, along with traditional vegetation indices (Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) and total water storage to investigate the impacts of El Niño-induced droughts on vegetation productivity of the forest and crop in the Southeast Asia. We found that SIF was more sensitive to the water stress than traditional vegetation indices (EVI) to monitor drought for both evergreen broadleaf forest and croplands in Southeast Asia. The higher solar radiation partly offset the negative effects of droughts on the vegetation productivity, leading to a larger decrease of SIF yield (SIFyield) than SIF. Therefore, SIFyield had a larger reduction and was more sensitive to precipitation deficit than SIF during the drought. The comparisons of retrieved column-average dry-air mole fraction of atmospheric carbon dioxide with SIF demonstrated the reduction of CO2 uptake by vegetation in Southeast Asia during the drought. This study highlights that SIF is more beneficial than EVI to be an indicator to characterize and monitor the dynamics of drought in tropical vegetated regions. © 2019 by the authors.","Drought; El Niño events; Extreme climatic events; Photosynthesis; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Chlorophyll; Crops; Fluorescence; Forestry; Photosynthesis; Productivity; Radiation effects; Tropics; Vegetation; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Climatic events; Enhanced vegetation index; Global carbon cycle; Photosynthetic activity; Precipitation deficits; Vegetation productivity; Drought",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065044201

Recent work demonstrates that rapid autoxidation of organic peroxy radicals (RO 2 ) formed during VOC oxidation results in highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOM) that efficiently form SOA. As NO x emissions decrease, the chemical regime of the atmosphere changes to one in which RO 2 autoxidation becomes increasingly important, potentially increasing PM 2.5 , while oxidant availability driving RO 2 formation rates simultaneously declines, possibly slowing regional PM 2.5 formation. Using a suite of in situ aircraft observations and laboratory studies of HOM, together with a detailed molecular mechanism, we show that although autoxidation in an archetypal biogenic VOC system becomes more competitive as NO x decreases, absolute HOM production rates decrease due to oxidant reductions, leading to an overall positive coupling between anthropogenic NO x and localized biogenic SOA from autoxidation. This effect is observed in the Atlanta, Georgia, urban plume where HOM is enhanced in the presence of elevated NO, and predictions for Guangzhou, China, where increasing HOM-RO 2 production coincides with increases in NO from 1990 to 2010. These results suggest added benefits to PM 2.5 abatement strategies come with NO x emission reductions and have implications for aerosol–climate interactions due to changes in global SOA resulting from NO x interactions since the preindustrial era. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

These organisms provide reduced carbon substrates for species that cannot oxidize methane themselves, thereby serving a key role in these niches while also sequestering this potent greenhouse gas before it enters the atmosphere. Deciphering the molecular details of how methane-oxidizing bacteria interact in the environment enables us to understand an important aspect that shapes the structures and functions of these communities. Here we show that many members of the Methylomonas genus possess a LuxR-type acyl-homoserine lactone (acyl-HSL) receptor/transcription factor that is highly homologous to MbaR from the quorum-sensing (QS) system of Methylobacter tundripaludum, another methane oxidizer that has been isolated from the same environment. We reconstitute this detection system in Escherichia coli and use mutant and transcriptomic analysis to show that the receptor/transcription factor from Methylomonas sp. strain LW13 is active and alters LW13 gene expression in response to the acyl-HSL produced by M. tundripaludum.

The growing availability of arable land in the Mediterranean regions, as a consequence of the decline of cereal cropping systems and grain legume, provides ample opportunities for performing successful feedstock production on unmanaged areas. This paper seeks to capture and analyze ongoing and emerging questions concerning bioenergy production on marginal lands in the Mediterranean area in a framework of sustainability indicators. A qualitative methodology was adopted to evaluate the effectiveness of eight critical issues that bio-energy developers, scholars and policymakers should consider in terms of agronomic, techno-economic and methodological practices for growing bioenergy feedstock. The issues investigated on selected case studies are: Greenhouse gas emissions; soil quality; land restoration and phytoremediation capacity; water use and efficiency; biodiversity; land use/cover changes; farmers’ willingness and acceptance of new agro-system, and profitability of value chain. Starting from an in-depth analysis of the definition of marginal land from the perspective of ecosystem service cascade, we synthesize how these challenges are nowadays addressed and which are the key bottlenecks, trends and potential directions for guiding future research into bioenergy production in the Mediterranean regions. The findings of this study suggest that dedicated energy crops can be grown on marginal lands with substantial positive effects in terms of sustainability aspects, although more efforts should be carried out through agronomic research especially on water use efficiency and biodiversity conservation, as well as by national and EU institutions and policies for promoting economic opportunities and integration with surrounding agro-ecosystems and farmers’ involvement. Developing a site-specific landscape design with the use of Life Cycle Assessment and certification schemes with sustainability indicators is of primary importance for the effective bioenergy production on marginal lands. © 2018 The Author(s)","Bioenergy crops; Biomass production; GBEP sustainability indicators; Marginal land","Agronomy; Biodiversity; Biofuels; Biomass; Bioremediation; Crops; Cultivation; Economics; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Feedstocks; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Biodiversity conservation; Bioenergy crops; Biomass productions; Economic opportunities; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Marginal lands; Qualitative methodologies; Sustainability indicators; Life cycle",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059064725

Tapioca powder as a source of organic carbon was utilized in the synthesis of carbon dots through optimization of the synthesis parameters such as temperature, dosage and time. Photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) was obtained under the visible region of 340 nm at 34.9%, which was achieved without dopants such as sulfur and nitrogen that are popularly used to increase the value of photoluminescence. The characterization of carbon dots such as FTIR and HrTem, were carried out for the analysis of functional groups, particle sizes (1-5 nm) and shapes (quasi-spherical). The high carbon-carbon bonds and oxygen groups detected in FTIR analysis validates the basis of fluorescence of carbon dots and also presence of hydroxyl (OH), carboxylic acids (COO), and other vital functional groups (C=O, C−O-C, C−H). These characteristics makes tapioca based carbon dots suitable for application in the fields of environmental studies including sensitive detection and absorbance of pollutants in water and bio imaging in health sciences. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Attention has been paid to diesel vehicle NOx emissions that are much higher than legislative type-approval limits. This paper analysed exhaust emissions of a fleet of ten Euro 5 diesel vehicles. NOx emissions were measured during laboratory and track testing. In both cases, the type-approval test was carried out with cold and warm starts. Moreover, in the laboratory, a modified type-approval test and a real urban driving cycle were executed in order to characterise emissions in multiple operating conditions, outside of the homologation boundaries. The testing environment did not influence the emissions behaviour of the tested vehicles. Track and laboratory results, in fact, were comparable when ambient conditions were comparable. The parameter which played the main role in terms of NOx emissions is the ambient temperature, fixed at 23 °C in laboratory and not controlled on the track. Above 28 °C, NOx emissions were much higher than the approval limit (almost 600 mg/km). Moreover, warm driving cycles always introduced higher NOx emissions than cold ones, because of the partial use and/or deactivation of the EGR circuit (one of effective measures to reduce NOx formation). The ratio between warm and cold emissions ranged from 2 to 5. The engine parameter which helped explain the relationship between NOx emissions and thermal engine status was the intake air temperature. For intake air temperatures below 40 °C, NOx emissions were lower than 0.2 g/km. Above 40 °C, they suddenly increased up to almost 0.6 g/km. Another issue highlighted by the experimental results was that dynamic real driving caused the highest NOx emissions (almost 1 g/km). © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Diesel cars; EGR; Exhaust emissions; Intake air temperature; NOx; Track test","air temperature; automobile; diesel engine; exhaust emission; laboratory method; operations technology; testing method; gasoline; air pollutant; analysis; exhaust gas; laboratory; temperature; Air Pollutants; Gasoline; Laboratories; Temperature; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061657871

By contrast, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from German croplands have continuously increased over the past decades as a result of soil organic carbon (SOC) losses. Contrasting results, however, have been obtained on the C sink or source function of European croplands based on long-term experiments and rather recent eddy covariance (EC) measurements. Over a period of eight years (2010–2017), we measured the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO 2 on six intensively managed cropland sites in two climatically different regions of southwest Germany (Kraichgau (KR) and Swabian Jura (SJ)) using the EC technique. Additionally, we measured aboveground crop biomass at three development stages and estimated management-related C inputs and exports. The inter-annual on-site variability of cumulated annual NEE was large, and neither the region nor the different sites significantly affected NEE budgets. Winter rapeseed showed the lowest CO 2 uptake capacity among the observed crops, and the mean annual NEE in the years with winter rapeseed harvest was significantly lower compared to winter wheat, silage maize and winter barley. On average over 46 site-years, annual NEE showed a distinct CO 2 uptake of −2580 kg CO 2 -C ha −1 yr −1 . Considering management-related C fluxes, the resulting net biome productivity (NBP) indicated a C source function of the study sites with mean annual losses of 1190 kg C ha −1 yr −1 . Due to high C removals after whole plant harvests, silage maize cropping resulted in significantly higher C losses of 4280 kg C ha −1 yr −1 compared to winter rapeseed, winter wheat and winter barley, with mean annual NBPs of 1430, −188 and −1340 kg C ha −1 yr −1 , respectively. Consequently, a higher share of exported C in annual NBP resulted in higher C losses. We conclude that the recently increased importance of silage maize in crop rotations destabilizes SOC stocks, threatening the efforts in enhancing soil C sequestration. This calls for further investigations on the C sequestration potentials of more diverse crop rotations including perennial phases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon removal; Crop rotation; Eddy covariance; Soil organic carbon","agricultural land; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; climate change; crop rotation; eddy covariance; global climate; net ecosystem exchange; net ecosystem production; organic carbon; seasonal variation; soil carbon; Baden-Wurttemberg; Germany; Kraichgau; Swabian Alb; Brassica napus; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062063031

Currently, both domains themselves, driving automation as well as powertrain electrification, face the challenge of a rising development complexity with extensive use of virtual testing environments. However, state-of-the-art virtual testing environments typically strictly focus on just one domain and neglect the other. This paper shows the results of a simulation-based case study considering both domains simultaneously. The influence of energy saving automated functionalities on a conventional, a hybrid, and a pure electric powertrain is investigated for a carefully selected inner-city driving scenario. The vehicle simulation models for the different powertrain configurations are calibrated using test bench results and vehicle measurements. A model predictive acceleration controller is developed for realizing the speed optimization function. By considering traffic conditions such as traffic light schedules and a preceding vehicle as the boundary conditions, unnecessary accelerations and decelerations are avoided to reduce the energy demand. The case study is realized by applying this function to the three powertrains variants. As a final result, a clear difference in energy demand is observed: the hybrid powertrain benefits the most in terms of energy demand reduction in the given use case. The results clearly underscore that in future vehicle development programs, the powertrain and the real-world driving functionalities have to be optimized simultaneously to minimize the energy demand during everyday vehicle operation. © IMechE 2018.","automated driving; electrification; energy saving; Powertrain; powertrain development; predictive driving","Automation; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electric utilities; Energy conservation; Energy management; Fuels; Virtual reality; Automated driving; Efficiency improvement; Electric power trains; electrification; Powertrain configuration; Predictive drivings; Real-world drivings; Vehicle fuel efficiencies; Powertrains",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047815803

For point sources, we consider the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) containing reported emissions from major industrial facilities. We consider all other sources as diffuse, and we estimate European average chemical emission factors from available measurements of dissolved phase concentrations, assuming simple emission patterns such as population and agricultural land. The emission inventory enables modelling concentrations, which have been compared with independent measurements. Due to the way they are estimated, they cannot withstand a point-by-point comparison. However, predicted concentrations exhibit a frequency distribution and order of magnitude compatible with observations, and match a fair proportion of independently reported exceedances of environmental quality standards for many of the substances studied. While apparently a preliminary picture based on crude simplifications, our representation suggests that simple drivers such as population and agriculture are useful to describe chemical pollution at European scale. From our preliminary inventory, E-PRTR industrial point emissions seem to account for a relatively small share of total emissions. Consequently, apart from specific measures such as upgrades to urban wastewater treatment plants in certain high impact areas, the management of priority substances may require a more strategic approach to emission control, addressing chemical use across sectors and the management of out-phased, legacy chemicals. At the same time, we advocate that improving emission inventories requires monitoring data reflecting the variability of emission patterns across Europe, as presently available monitoring data do not enable a catchment-specific estimation of emissions. © 2019 The Authors","Emission inventorying; Inverse modelling; IPChem; Priority substances; Water Framework Directive","Agriculture; Catchments; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Indicators (chemical); Monitoring; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Environmental quality standards; Inverse modelling; IPChem; Pan-European assessments; Pollutant release and transfer registers; Priority substances; Urban wastewater treatment plants; Water Framework Directives; River pollution; environmental chemical; chemical substance; emission inventory; environmental quality; European Union; inverse analysis; numerical model; river pollution; agricultural land; Article; Europe; industrial waste; measurement; pollution monitoring; population; priority journal; river; statistical analysis; waste water management; water pollutant; water pollution; water standard; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060477232

We use a revised version of Schaffrin et al.'s (2015) Index of Policy Activity (IPA)1 to examine the historical development (1998–2015) of federal and state/provincial renewable energy policies across five federal countries in the Americas: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the United States. Here the focus is on “policy output,” which is defined as a function of policy density and intensity. Policy density is measured by counting the number of policies in each country relating to a particular goal during our time frame, while policy intensity, or the strength the policy has toward meeting specific goals, is measured by summing scores for six indicators: objective, scope, integration, budget, implementation and monitoring. The higher the policy score for a country, the more likely the country will be able to meet its intended goals. Our results show that the U.S. has the densest renewable energy policy output followed by Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and finally Argentina has the least-dense policy output. Overall, Brazil and Canada's renewable energy policies were the most intense, followed by Argentina's and the U.S.'s, with Mexico's policies receiving the lowest intensity scores. These countries differ in how long they have supported renewable energy policies and the levels of government that implement them. These findings show that countries may be spending resources on producing myriad renewable energy policies, but without coordination between different levels of government or a concerted effort to ensure that the policy instruments are effective, those resources may be wasted while GHGs continue to rise. This research contributes to the understanding of how individual federal and state/provincial government make efforts toward implementing or enforcing energy policies to influence long-term policy change. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Pan-America; Policy output; Renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057817514

The 1986–2012 survey from the more intense acid rain period in the mid-eighties until the present allowed the quantification of the interaction between atmospheric deposition and vegetation and the long-term evolution following pollutant emission trends. The long-term monitoring evidenced some significant temporal trends (pH, conductivity, SO42−, Cl−, NO3−, Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+). Significant decreases in the concentrations and fluxes of several ions were observed (H+ and SO42−, Cl−, and Ca2+) in open field precipitation and throughfalls. The regular and strong decrease in protons and sulfate followed the decreases in anthropogenic SO2 and NOx (proton precursors) since the 1980s. The decrease in Cl− concentrations was weaker and could have been related to the regional reduction in HCl emissions and/or to changes in the precipitation regime. The annual calcium fluxes were reduced from approximately 15 to 9 and 6 to 2 kg ha−1 under spruces and beeches, respectively, as a consequence of reductions in anthropogenic industrial dust. In such calcium-limited resource soils, the atmospheric Ca flux exceeded the Ca flux from mineral weathering and was highly bioavailable for vegetation growth. This decrease in nutrient input had strong consequences for soil nutrients and may thus have participated in forest decline. The two tree plantations had contrasting effects on the physico-chemical parameters of the incoming precipitation with higher water interception and chemical concentrations under spruces than under beeches, which underlined the role of tree species in atmospheric inputs to soils. The structure and persistence of spruce needles enhanced the capture of particles and water, accentuating the acidity of the deposition and leading to the intensification of acidification processes, nutrient leaching in soils and forest decline. In contrast, beech leaves were able to neutralize a portion of the atmospheric protons, which minimized and reduced the negative effects of acid rain. In addition, the throughfalls represented an important part of the biological cycle of trees for some elements such as K or N, as indicated by the contrasting patterns at year and long-term scales regarding the vegetation type. However, our study indicated that the influence of tree species might change over time with changes in atmospheric pollution, in precipitation regime, or in stand structure. This study outlined the importance of the long-term record of open field precipitation and throughfalls under various tree types to better evaluate the real inputs of elements to forest ecosystems and among them, essential mineral nutrients. © 2018","Acid rain; Atmospheric deposits; Beech; Long-term data; Nutrient; Spruce; Throughfall","Acid rain; Air pollution; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric structure; Calcium; Catchments; Chlorine compounds; Deposition; Ecosystems; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Meteorological problems; Nutrients; Pollution control; Soils; Sulfur compounds; Vegetation; Atmospheric deposits; Beech; Long-term data; Spruce; Throughfall; Forestry; calcium ion; magnesium ion; potassium ion; acid rain; anthropogenic source; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; catchment; concentration (composition); data set; deciduous tree; dust; evergreen tree; forest ecosystem; growth; nutrient dynamics; physicochemical property; precipitation (chemistry); precipitation (climatology); soil nutrient; throughfall; trend analysis; vegetation type; acidification; acidity; air pollution; Article; beech; calcium transport; canopy; catchment; chemical composition; conductance; electric conductivity; pH; physical chemistry; plant leaf; precipitation; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); spruce; tree; France; Grand Est; Haut Rhin; Strengbach; Fagus; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061332082

Their characteristics and seasonal behavior were evaluated based on the thermal/optical reflectance (IMPROVE_TOR) method. Diagnostic indices for their emission sources and the black carbon (BC) concentration were assessed using an aethalometer and related to the monthly emission inventory (EI) of particle-bound BC and organic carbon (OC) in order to investigate the contribution of agricultural activities and forest fires as well as agro-industries in Thailand. Monthly provincial EIs were evaluated based on the number of agricultural crops produced corresponding to field residue burning and the use of residues as fuel in agro-industries, and also on the number of hot spots from satellite images corresponding to the areas burned by forest fires. The ratio of char-EC/soot-EC describing the relative influence of biomass combustion to diesel emission was found to be in agreement with the EI of BC from biomass burning in the size range &lt;1 μm. This was especially true for PM0.1, which usually tends to be indicative of diesel exhaust particles, and was shown to be very sensitive to the EI of biomass burning. In Chiang Mai, the northern part of Thailand, the forest fires located upwind of the monitoring site were found to be the largest contributor while the carbon behavior at the site in Bangkok was better accounted for by the EI of provinces in central Thailand including Bangkok and its surrounding provinces, where the burning of crop residues and the cultivation of sugarcane for sugar production are significant factors. This suggests that the influence of transportation of polluted air masses is important on a multi-provincial scale (100–200 km) in Thailand. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Biomass burning; Carbon; Emission inventory; PM0.1","Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Biomass; Carbon; Combustion; Crops; Cultivation; Deforestation; Diesel engines; Fire hazards; Organic carbon; Sugar industry; Agricultural activities; Agricultural biomass; Biomass-burning; Carbonaceous components; Diesel exhaust particles; Emission inventories; Fractionated particles; PM0.1; Fires; black carbon; diesel fuel; organic carbon; carbon; agricultural emission; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; black carbon; concentration (composition); crop residue; emission inventory; forest fire; particulate matter; satellite imagery; agriculture; algorithm; Article; biomass; calculation; cassava; coculture; combustion; controlled study; environmental impact; forest fire; geography; maize; nonhuman; particulate matter; plant residue; potato; rice; soybean; sugarcane; Thailand; agriculture; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; biomass; city; crop; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; fire; particle size; particulate matter; satellite imagery; soot; statistics and numerical data; wildfire; Bangkok; Central Region [Thailand]; Chiang Mai [Chiang Mai (PRV)]; Chiang Mai [Northern Region]; Krung Thep Mahanakhon; Northern Region [Thailand]; Thailand; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Biomass; Carbon; Cities; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; Fires; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Satellite Imagery; Soot; Thailand; Vehicle Emissions; Wildfires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060954045

Conclusions that are derived from studies in non-mountainous areas are not suitable for predicting the effects of land-use changes on tropical mountains because the climatic environment rapidly changes with elevation, which may mitigate or amplify the effects of land use4,5. It is of key importance to understand how the interplay of climate and land use constrains biodiversity and ecosystem functions to determine the consequences of global change for mountain ecosystems. Here we show that the interacting effects of climate and land use reshape elevational trends in biodiversity and ecosystem functions on Africa’s largest mountain, Mount Kilimanjaro (Tanzania). We find that increasing land-use intensity causes larger losses of plant and animal species richness in the arid lowlands than in humid submontane and montane zones. Increases in land-use intensity are associated with significant changes in the composition of plant, animal and microorganism communities; stronger modifications of plant and animal communities occur in arid and humid ecosystems, respectively. Temperature, precipitation and land use jointly modulate soil properties, nutrient turnover, greenhouse gas emissions, plant biomass and productivity, as well as animal interactions. Our data suggest that the response of ecosystem functions to land-use intensity depends strongly on climate; more-severe changes in ecosystem functioning occur in the arid lowlands and the cold montane zone. Interactions between climate and land use explained—on average—54% of the variation in species richness, species composition and ecosystem functions, whereas only 30% of variation was related to single drivers. Our study reveals that climate can modulate the effects of land use on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and points to a lowered resistance of ecosystems in climatically challenging environments to ongoing land-use changes in tropical mountainous regions. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"animal community; biodiversity; biomass; carbon footprint; climate; cold stress; driver; human; land use; letter; microbial community; nutrient; precipitation; productivity; soil property; species composition; species richness; Tanzania; turnover rate; agriculture; altitude; animal; ecosystem; humidity; microbiology; plant; statistics and numerical data; temperature; tropic climate; Animalia; rain; Agriculture; Altitude; Animals; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Humidity; Microbiology; Plants; Rain; Tanzania; Temperature; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063626315

A superstructure was developed and a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model was formulated, with the aim of selecting the technologies that process solar, wind, biomass and waste sources to meet the demand for power and steam that minimize the total annual cost of the system. Two case studies, one in Mexico and another one in Scotland, were considered. Results show that the biomass boiler provides the most economical cogeneration scheme. Resource availability plays a major role in the technology selection. As the biomass availability decreases, the solar technologies become the best choice to produce steam and power. The renewable-based utility plant shows a significant reduction in CO2 emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Mathematical optimization; Power plant; Process design; Renewable energy","Biomass; Integer programming; Power plants; Process design; Biomass availability; Mathematical optimizations; Mixed integer nonlinear programming models; Renewable energies; Renewable resource; Resource availability; Solar technology; Technology selection; Nonlinear programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060936326

Current bioremediation strategies for hydrocarbon contamination, uses induced mixed microbial cultures. This in-vitro study demonstrates the utilization of naturally occurring communities in suitable habitats for achieving highly efficient, synergistic degradation of hydrocarbons in a simple community structure without additives. Methods: Enrichment media supplemented with 1% (7652.53 mg/L) hexadecane (HXD) as the sole carbon source were inoculated with samples of soil with waste polythene, collected from a municipal landfill in order to isolate microbial communities. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed on HXD grown co-cultures and individual counterparts after 14 days incubation and percentage degradation was calculated. Microbes were identified using 16S rRNA gene and Internal Transcribed Spacer region sequencing. Biofilm formation was confirmed through scanning electron microscopy, in the most efficient community. Results: Three mixed communities (C1, C2 and C3) that demonstrated efficient visual disintegration of the HXD layer in the static liquid cultures were isolated. The C1 community showed the highest activity, degrading > 99% HXD within 14 days. C1 comprised of a single fungus and a bacterium and they were identified as a Bacillus sp. MM1 and an Apsergillus sp. MM1. The co-culture and individual counterparts of the C1 community were assayed for HXD degradation by GC-MS. Degradation by the fungal and bacterial monocultures were 52.92 ± 8.81% and 9.62 ± 0.71% respectively, compared to 99.42 ± 0.38% by the co-culture in 14 days. This proved the synergistic behavior of the community. Further, this community demonstrated the formation of a biofilm in oil-water interface in the liquid medium. This was evidenced from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showing the Bacillus cells attached on to Aspergillus mycelia. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the utilization of naturally formed fungal-bacterial communities for enhanced biodegradation of hydrocarbons such as hexadecane and reports for the first time, synergistic degradation of hexadecane through biofilm formation, by a community comprising of Bacillus cereus group and Aspergillus flavus complex. © 2019 The Author(s).","Aspergillus; Bacillus; Biodegradation; Biofilm; Hexadecane; Hydrocarbon; Microbial community; Synergism","hexadecane; hydrocarbon; internal transcribed spacer; alkane; n-hexadecane; RNA 16S; spacer DNA; 16S rRNA gene; Article; Aspergillus flavus; Bacillus cereus; bacterium culture; bacterium identification; biodegradation; biofilm; carbon source; controlled study; enrichment culture; fungus identification; gene sequence; inoculation; microbial community; nonhuman; organismal interaction; RNA gene; scanning electron microscopy; species habitat; Aspergillus flavus; Bacillus cereus; bioremediation; genetics; mass fragmentography; metabolism; microflora; Alkanes; Aspergillus flavus; Bacillus cereus; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biofilms; DNA, Intergenic; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Microbiota; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065241699

This increase stems from both the decline of technology costs and also from the support policies adopted worldwide. Yet, the achieved diffusion levels and the related impacts vary across locations. By applying a new analytical approach to thirteen international case studies, the study provides an exhaustive systematization of policies and regulatory adjustments of PVDG diffusion, focusing on the electricity distribution sector. The goal is to identify possible common patterns and path dependence trajectories. The results show that the policy impacts and the regulatory adjustments vary mostly according to the category of the support policies implemented. In countries where feed-in tariffs (FiTs) have been introduced, the main concern is the increasing cost of policies maintenance. The regulatory adjustments are mostly PV specific involving, in most cases, the reduction of the FiTs. In regions where net metering policies have been implemented, otherwise, the impacts are predominantly related to cost-shifting issues, thus requiring regulatory changes which can also be prosumers’ specific, but that attempt to correct allocative distortions through electricity tariffs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cost-shifting; Distributed generation; Feed-in tariffs; Net metering; Photovoltaic","Diffusion; Electric utilities; Analytical approach; Electricity distribution; Electricity tariff; Feed-in tariff; Net metering; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic distributed generations; Photovoltaic distributed generations (PVDG); Distributed power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059025254

How to control the geothermal to approach these problems in cold regions is an important issue. Two-phase closed thermosyphons (TPCTs) are simple and efficient energy exchangers that are used in low-temperature refrigeration systems. In this study, a series of experiments were carried out to explore the geotemperature control process of a TPCT in an air-TPCT-soil system by storing renewable ambient cool energy. To enhance the control efficiency of the TPCT, we considered different operating conditions, with inclination angles of 90° 70° and 50°. The results indicate that the TPCT can cool the surrounding soil by selectively capturing the ambient energy due to its thermal semi-conductor effect. The inclination angle can change the efficiency of the TPCT, which should be accounted in engineering design. Under the experimental conditions, the geotemperature control efficiency of the TPCT with an inclination angle of approximately 70° was the optimal. The results of this study could provide a basis for the design of TPCTs used in cool energy utilization and other energy storage applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Efficiency utilization; Geothermal control; Heat pipe; Thermal diode; Thermal semiconductor","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Flow patterns; Geothermal energy; Heat pipes; Refrigeration; Siphons; Soils; Temperature; Thermosyphons; Different operating conditions; Efficiency optimization; Energy storage applications; Experimental conditions; Laboratory investigations; Low temperature refrigeration; Thermal diodes; Two-phase closed thermosyphon; Process control; carbon dioxide; degradation; design; electrical conductivity; energy efficiency; experiment; laboratory method; optimization; permafrost; pipe; soil strength; temperature; thawing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061306878

To understand and manage the impacts of N deposition, we need metrics which accurately reflect N deposition pressure on the environment, and are responsive to changes in both N deposition and its impacts over time. In the UK, the metric typically used is a measure of total N deposition over 1–3 years, despite evidence that N accumulates in many ecosystems and impacts from low-level exposure can take considerable time to develop. Improvements in N deposition modelling now allow the development of metrics which incorporate the long-term history of pollution, as well as current exposure. Here we test the potential of alternative N deposition metrics to explain vegetation compositional variability in British semi-natural habitats. We assembled 36 individual datasets representing 48,332 occurrence records in 5479 quadrats from 1683 sites, and used redundancy analyses to test the explanatory power of 33 alternative N metrics based on national pollutant deposition models. We find convincing evidence for N deposition impacts across datasets and habitats, even when accounting for other large-scale drivers of vegetation change. Metrics that incorporate long-term N deposition trajectories consistently explain greater compositional variance than 1–3 year N deposition. There is considerable variability in results across habitats and between similar metrics, but overall we propose that a thirty-year moving window of cumulative deposition is optimal to represent impacts on plant communities for application in science, policy and management. © 2019","Air pollution; Biodiversity; Community ecology; Cumulative deposition; Environmental change; Nitrogen deposition; Vegetation","Air pollution; Binary alloys; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Large dataset; Nitrogen; Potassium alloys; Uranium alloys; Vegetation; Community ecology; Compositional variability; Deposition models; Environmental change; Low-level exposure; Nitrogen deposition; Redundancy analysis; Terrestrial ecosystems; Forestry; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; biodiversity; community ecology; environmental change; nitrogen; plant community; pollution effect; vegetation structure; air pollution; article; biodiversity; community ecology; environmental change; human; nitrogen deposition; plant community; vegetation; air pollution; analysis; ecology; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; plant; procedures; standards; statistics and numerical data; United Kingdom; nitrogen; Air Pollution; Ecology; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060937554

Evaluating the perceptions of farmers is an effective tool for addressing this issue because it reflects the full range of drivers associated with changes in land use. This study utilizes historical agricultural area, population, and climate data for 1910–2010, combined with a series of applied household surveys and focus group discussions to assess farmers’ perceptions of these changes and identify the major drivers. The paired t-test was employed to measure differences between various groups of drivers. The total area of agricultural land in Nepal has expanded rapidly since 1910, more intensively in the southern (Tarai) and central (Hill) ecological regions of the country, and has decreased slightly near large cities in recent decades. Farmers’ perceptions show that socioeconomic variables were considered to be the crucial drivers of changes in agricultural land use. The three other major drivers were grouped as: neighborhood, climate–topography, and policy drivers. In particular, farmers pointed to the high level of population growth (93.96%) as the main factor underlying the changes, and the majority of drivers are associated with this variable. Access to roads (77.36%), urbanization (33.77%), government policies (23.58%), and remittance impact (16.79%) are other notable triggering variables. The paired t-test results equating variables from different groups of drivers and ecological regions indicate varied significance (p-values range from 0.004 to 0.983). Our analysis confirms that the synergy between social and natural observations can be integrated to obtain research findings that identify scientific and social issues. The interplay between the drivers should be emphasized in developing plans for sustainable agricultural land use management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural land use changes; Driving factors; Farmers’ perceptions; Human activities; Nepal","agricultural land; human activity; land use change; perception; population growth; urbanization; agricultural land; agricultural worker; article; city; climate; driver; government; household; human; neighborhood; Nepal; perception; population growth; remission; rural area; statistical significance; topography; urbanization; agriculture; climate change; environmental protection; Nepal; Nepal; Tarai; Agriculture; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Farmers; Humans; Nepal; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060909991

Over the years, several development interventions have been undertaken to address these issues. Although recent studies particularly emphasize the need to integrate climate change adaptation into development planning, empirical analysis of causal relationships is less explored, specifically in India. Consequently, this study firstly attempts to identify whether synergies exist between development activities and agricultural adaptation decision-making. Secondly, it assesses the impact of such decisions on farmers’ well-being. The empirical analysis is based on a survey of 549 rural households in drought-prone regions of western Odisha, India, where western Orissa rural livelihoods project was implemented in the last decade to improve the living standards. Using an ‘endogenous switching regression approach’, this study reveals two findings. Firstly, livelihood interventions enhance the likelihood of undertaking farm-level adaptation measures, and the other drivers are access to technical education, formal and informal institutions and agricultural extension services. Secondly, adaptations lead to significant gains in income from crops. The paper concludes with implications for policies to promote various rural livelihoods projects in rural India. From a broader policy perspective, it is imperative to integrate climate change in development planning to reduce the risk of maladaptation. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","crop income; development interventions; endogenous switching regression; farm-level adaptation; India; western Odisha","adaptive management; agricultural extension; climate change; decision making; developing world; drought; livelihood; malnutrition; regression analysis; rural area; India; Odisha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037984330

However, those data are often not available, or data sets may be incomplete or have questionable quality. Various procedures were proposed in FAO56 to overcome these limitations and an abundant literature has been and is being produced relative to alternative computational methods. Studies applied to a variety of climates, from hyper-arid to humid, have demonstrated that improved methods to compute PM-ET o from temperature only (PMT approach) have appropriate accuracy. These methods refer to estimating: (i) the dew point temperature (T dew ) from T min or, in case of humid climates, from the mean temperature, T mean ; (ii) R s from the temperature difference (TD = T max -T min ); and (iii) u 2 using default global or regional values. Greater difficulties refer to the need for locally calibrating the radiation adjustment coefficient (k Rs ) used with the R s equation. Therefore, considering that calibrated k Rs values were made available by past studies for a large number of locations and diverse climates, the current study developed and tested simple computational approaches relating locally calibrated k Rs with various observed weather variables – TD, relative humidity (RH) and average u 2 . The equations were developed using CLIMWAT monthly full-data relative to all the Mediterranean countries. The equations refer to all available data, or to data grouped as hyper-arid and arid, semi-arid, dry and moist sub-humid, and humid climates. To test those k Rs equations, ET o computed from temperature and using the predicted k Rs values were compared with ET o computed with full data sets of the same Mediterranean locations and of Iran, Inner Mongolia, Portugal and Bolivia. RMSE average values result then small, ranging from 0.34 to 0.54 mm day −1 , therefore not very far from values obtained when a trial and error procedure was used for all the same locations, from 0.27 to 0.46 mm day −1 . These indicators allow to propose the use of k Rs obtained from the predictive equations instead of locally calibrated k Rs values, which greatly eases computations and may largely favour the use of the PMT approach. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Default wind speed; Dew-point temperature; PM-ET o with reduced datasets (PMT); Predictive equations for k Rs; Radiation adjustment coefficient k Rs; Solar radiation","Evapotranspiration; Location; Solar radiation; Wind; Adjustment coefficient; Dewpoint temperature; Mediterranean countries; Predictive equations; Reference crop evapotranspirations; Trial-and-error procedures; Vapour pressure deficits; Wind speed; Computational methods; accuracy assessment; calibration; computer; dew point; evapotranspiration; grass; numerical method; Penman-Monteith equation; relative humidity; solar radiation; vapor pressure; wind velocity; Bolivia; China; Iran; Nei Monggol; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060647506

This study investigates a novel approach for biogas upgrading to biomethane, aimed at reducing the methane loss. A plant based on hot potassium carbonate was fed with 150–200 Nm3 h−1 of biogas from municipal waste. CO2 is removed in a K2CO3 absorption column, with negligible CH4 absorption. An assessment of biomethane quality was performed to check its compliance with recent National and European standard specifications. Results show that a methane slip below 0.1% can be achieved with this technology, thus significantly reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated to biomethane industry. This leads to a lower capital expenditure because no off-gas post-treatment is required. Heat and electricity consumption were monitored, and operational expense resulted to be lower than membrane separation in the specific case study, by applying life cycle cost (LCC) methodology. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuels; Biogas upgrading; Biomethane; CH4; Water scrubbing absorption","Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Compliance control; Costs; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Methane; Potash; Regulatory compliance; Water absorption; Biogas upgrading; Biomethane; Capital expenditures; Global warming potential; Heat and electricity; Life cycle costs (LCC); Membrane separation; Water scrubbing; Biogas; absorption; biofuel; biogas; carbon emission; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; methane; separation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062222449

Increased population is requiring more water and changing climate is altering the hydrological cycle making the water less accessible at the time when it is required. Combining the measurement of water availability and the socioeconomic capacity towards its access gives new insights in the fields of water resources management and poverty alleviation, which ultimately address the agenda of sustainable development. This paper customizes the water poverty index (WPI) indicators to encompass the climatic extremes and social settings to analyse the water stresses to the community people and their capacity to manage the water extremes focusing on the water availability in climatic variability condition in Karnali river basin in western Nepal. The indicators of the WPI were based on the multiple aspects of water focusing to water quantity and availability.

The aim of this study was to analyse the forest biomass potential for Lithuania's energy pathways, while comparing the projected demand of forest bioenergy feedstock with resource projections. This was performed using the Landscape simulation and Ecological Assessment (LEcA) tool and the energy model MESSAGE. Biomass demand can be met up to 2050, after which demands under a Biomass Low pathway can still be met by the domestic forest resource if other wood uses are reduced, while Biomass High leads to a biomass deficit regarding domestic forest resources.

Although new-energy buses are more environmentally friendly compared with traditional diesel buses, they may also generate kinds of greenhouse gases as well as harmful pollutants. Currently, there exist few studies on the emission characteristics of buses with new-energy fuels, especially the liquefied natural gas (LNG) bus. The primary objective of this study is to analyze and estimate the emission rates for LNG bus in real-world driving. First, the differences in emission distribution characteristics between LNG bus and other fuel types of buses are analyzed using visualization and statistical methods. Then, a gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT) approach is applied to estimate the rates of several kinds of emissions for LNG bus, including CO, CO 2 , HC, and NO x , by incorporating the information of driving state in the current period and several previous periods. The performance of the developed approach is evaluated by comparing with the polynomial regression method which is widely adopted in existing literature. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the competitive method for the emissions estimation of LNG bus, with the average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reduced by 27.3%, the average Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) decreased by 33.4%, and the average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) decreased by 22.1%. The results indicate that the proposed model is a promising approach for estimating emission rates of LNG bus. Also, this study would provide theoretical support for emission simulation tools such as MOVES, where the LNG bus emission estimation is unavailable in its current version. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; Emissions; Gradient boosted regression tree; LNG bus; Real-traffic conditions; Vehicle specific power","Air quality; Errors; Forestry; Gas emissions; Gas fuel purification; Greenhouse gases; Mean square error; Particulate emissions; Regression analysis; Boosted regression trees; Emission characteristics; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Mean absolute percentage error; Polynomial regression; Real traffic conditions; Root mean square errors; Vehicle specific power; Liquefied natural gas; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; diesel fuel; fuel; hydrocarbon; liquefied natural gas; nitrogen oxide; air quality; bus transport; diesel; emission inventory; error analysis; estimation method; experimental study; greenhouse gas; liquefied natural gas; regression analysis; Article; bus; conceptual framework; exhaust gas; gradient boosted regression tree; intermethod comparison; machine learning; mean absolute error; mean absolute percentage error; motor vehicle; priority journal; regression analysis; root mean square error; simulation; statistical parameters; traffic; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059858895

Then, the authors analyzed the effect of environmental policy on carbon emission efficiency based on a difference in difference model. Finding: Carbon emission efficiency has been significantly improved since the environmental policy China’s national program to address climate change was put forwarded, but the positive impact in different periods and regions is different. In addition, the environmental policy improves the carbon emission efficiency through the reduction of energy intensity and adjustment of the industrial structure.

For such frameworks to be useful, used and long-lived, their development requires collaboration between creators and potential users. Therefore, we undertook extensive consultation throughout the design, build and evaluation. In this paper, we explore those aspects of the consultation that focused on understanding and addressing user needs and how CoastAdapt could best provide support to effectively carry out adaptation planning and action. The first step was to identify, through an online survey and workshops, the knowledge gaps and barriers that could be addressed by CoastAdapt. The responses fed into the design and build, together with additional feedback from users on the layout and content. Following release of the beta version, further comments from users were collected and scrutinised to identify modifications that could increase relevance and utility. Finally, test cases were carried out to understand whether CoastAdapt is truly fit for purpose in addressing ‘real-world’ adaptation situations. The end result is a supportive framework for coastal adaptation that will require constant monitoring and updating to ensure it remains fit for purpose given Australia’s rapidly evolving adaptation landscape. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"Climate change; Sea level; Decision support framework; Decision supports; Design and build; Fit for purpose; Information delivery; Knowledge barriers; Online surveys; Potential users; Decision support systems; adaptive management; climate change; decision support system; environmental planning; knowledge; sea level change; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044208384

Respirometric analysis and model evaluation of the oxygen utilization rate profiles generated at critical phases of the experimental period showed that, continuous exposure to tetracycline caused complete suppression of substrate storage aside from mild inhibition on the growth kinetics and it exerted a significant binding action with available organic carbon, leading to less oxygen consumption.

Refurbishment at district scale may contain several benefits compared to mere building renovations, such as reduced costs due to smaller unit costs. Furthermore, it provides municipalities better opportunities to implement energy and sustainability strategies. This paper introduces a district-scale procedure for analyzing energy-efficient refurbishment of buildings. The main targets for the developed procedure were: 1) easy way for feeding information, 2) dynamic calculation capacity, and 3) support for decision makers. In order to support the targets, the procedure combines energy simulation, 3D data modelling and visualization. Additionally, CityGML is utilized to receive building related district data. The procedure was tested in a Finnish case district where altogether six realistic refurbishment scenarios were compared by means of operational costs, energy usages and CO 2 emissions. The test analyses demonstrates that different scenarios may have conflicting impacts which give important information to the decision-makers. The procedure is not limited to the demonstrated scenarios but it can be modified for different purposes. Additionally, the procedure was compared to other district-level procedures identified from the literature. The procedure turned out to be a promising basis for assessing district-scale energy renovation alternatives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CityGML; District; Energy; Procedure; Refurbishment; Renovation; Simulation","3D modeling; Buildings; Data visualization; Decision making; Three dimensional computer graphics; CityGML; District; Energy; Procedure; Refurbishment; Renovation; Simulation; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061194685

NOx, formed as a byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuels (e.g., natural gas, gasoline, diesel, etc.), can be converted to dinitrogen (N2) through ammonia (NH3) selective catalytic reduction (SCR). In this study, we closely examine the low-temperature storage, isothermal desorption, reactive consumption, and thermal release of NH3 on commercial Cu-SSZ-13 and V2O5-WO3/TiO2 SCR catalysts. Catalyst core-reactor, N2 adsorption (BET) surface area, and in-situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments are utilized to investigate the fundamental chemical processes relevant to low-temperature (T &lt; 250°C) NH3 SCR. Results show that NH3 stored at low-temperature continuously, yet slowly releases from the SCR catalysts, and that nearly all of the weakly bound NH3 stored on Cu2+ sites of the Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst will isothermally desorb from the catalyst in the absence of NOx. However, in the presence of NOx, a large fraction of this weakly bound NH3 will react with NOx, contributing to the total NOx conversion of the catalyst. The authors anticipate that the results presented herein can benefit the research communities' efforts to reduce NOx emissions in comparison to today's regulated limits by improving the understanding of critical low temperature chemical processes. © 2019 SAE International.

We here report Hg concentrations and pool sizes of different plant functional groups and plant species across nine tundra sites in northern Alaska. Significant spatial differences were observed in bulk vegetation Hg concentrations at Toolik Field station (52 ± 9 μg kg −1 ), Eight Mile Lake Observatory (40 ± 0.2 μg kg −1 ), and seven sites along a transect from Toolik Field station to the Arctic coast (36 ± 9 μg kg −1 ). Hg concentrations in non-vascular vegetation including feather and peat moss (58 ± 6 μg kg −1 and 34 ± 2 μg kg −1 , respectively) and brown and white lichen (41 ± 2 μg kg −1 and 34 ± 2 μg kg −1 , respectively), were three to six times those of vascular plant tissues (8 ± 1 μg kg −1 in dwarf birch leaves and 9 ± 1 μg kg −1 in tussock grass). A high representation of nonvascular vegetation in aboveground biomass resulted in substantial Hg mass contained in tundra aboveground vegetation (29 μg m −2 ), which fell within the range of foliar Hg mass estimated for forests in the United States (15 to 45 μg m −2 ) in spite of much shorter growing seasons. Hg stable isotope signatures of different plant species showed that atmospheric Hg(0) was the dominant source of Hg to tundra vegetation. Mass-dependent isotope signatures (δ 202 Hg) in vegetation relative to atmospheric Hg(0) showed pronounced shifts towards lower values, consistent with previously reported isotopic fractionation during foliar uptake of Hg(0). Mass-independent isotope signatures (Δ 199 Hg) of lichen were more positive relative to atmospheric Hg(0), indicating either photochemical reduction of Hg(II) or contributions of inorganic Hg(II) from atmospheric deposition and/or dust. Δ 199 Hg and Δ 200 Hg values in vascular plant species were similar to atmospheric Hg(0) suggesting that overall photochemical reduction and subsequent re-emission was relatively insignificant in these tundra ecosystems, in agreement with previous Hg(0) ecosystem flux measurements. © 2019","Alaska; Arctic; Mercury; Stable Hg isotopes; Tundra; Vegetation","Deposition; Ecosystems; Forestry; Fungi; Isotopes; Landforms; Mercury (metal); Meteorological problems; Vegetation; Alaska; Arctic; Atmospheric depositions; Isotopic fractionations; Photochemical reduction; Plant functional groups; Tundra; Vascular plant species; Mercury compounds; mercury; stable isotope; mercury; biological uptake; concentration (composition); functional group; mercury (element); spatial variation; species pool; stable isotope; temporal variation; tundra; vegetation; Alaska; arctic tundra; Article; atmospheric deposition; Betula nana; biomass; birch; Carex (genus); Carex aquatic; Cetraria islandica; controlled study; dust; fractionation; Hylocomium splendens; isotope analysis; leaf senescence; lichen (organism); litter fall; Masonhalea richardsonnii; moss; nonhuman; plant development; plant leaf; plant tissue; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; Sphagnum; United States; vascular plant; vegetation; analysis; chemistry; climate change; soil pollutant; tundra; Alaska; Arctic; Toolik Field Station; United States; Betula nana; Bryophyta; Tracheophyta; Alaska; Climate Change; Lichens; Mercury; Mercury Isotopes; Soil Pollutants; Tundra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060076987

Despite the success of SPDC, its higher-order analogs have never been observed, even though it has been suggested that they generate far more unique and exotic states than SPDC. An example of this is the emergence of non-Gaussian states without the need for postselection. Here we calculate the expected rate of emission for nth-order SPDC with and without external stimulation (seeding).

In the experiment pristine Xe and mixed Xe/Ar clusters as well as Xe atoms are ionized in the vicinity of the 4d→f giant resonance of Xe. We compare the relative streaking delay between the center-of-mass oscillations of electrons that have final kinetic energies in the spectral region of the Xe(4d) photoline. Our results show that clusters are ionized at the beginning of the 100 fs FEL pulse as supported by calculations of target frustration in the focal volume. We have identified a significantly larger 40 fs relative streaking delay between mixed Xe-Ar clusters vs Xe atoms compared to a 15 fs relative delay found for pristine Xe clusters. This is attributed to the high sensitivity of our spectroscopic measurement to the degree of condensation of the cluster target. Our results show that THz streaking is a powerful technique to temporally study electron emission from extended targets under intense FEL radiation on time scales that are significantly shorter than the FEL pulse duration. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,"Atoms; Electron emission; Electrons; Ionization; Kinetic energy; Terahertz waves; X rays; Xenon; Center-of-mass oscillations; Degree of condensation; Extended targets; High sensitivity; Ionization of atoms; Neutral clusters; Soft X ray pulse; Spectroscopic measurements; Free electron lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064861832

Even in the context of an extreme greenhouse climate, existing planktic foraminiferal δ18O data from the Falkland Plateau (paleolatitude of ~55°S) suggest anomalous warmth, with sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) &gt;30 °C for much of the Late Cretaceous, followed by sudden cooling in the Campanian. Over the last two decades, there has been discussion as to whether these high δ18O-based SSTs reflect a genuine temperature signal and, if so, whether there was a local temperature anomaly in the South Atlantic or whether the data are representative of zonal paleotemperatures at 55°S. To provide new insights into the degree of ocean warming in the southern high latitudes during the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian to Campanian), new SST records from the Falkland and Kerguelen Plateaus are presented here using the organic geochemical paleothermometer TetraEther indeX of 86 carbon atoms (TEX86). Overall, the TEX86 data support the δ18O data, indicating extreme and widespread warmth in the middle to high southern latitudes in the Late Cretaceous, with SSTs from 27 to 37 °C. Crucially, the TEX86 data show slow, steady cooling from the Turonian to the Campanian and suggest that temperature gradients during the Campanian did not become as steep as suggested by some planktic foraminiferal data. ©2019.

Climate change will exacerbate the existing threats to vulnerable communities, such as the poor, and threaten the food security of populations in coastal areas through the effects of flooding due to coastal inundation. Indonesia is an Archipelagic State of over 17,000 islands and is vulnerable to climate change impacts in its coastal areas and especially in its highly populated low lying delta areas, such as Jakarta and Semarang, where vulnerability to sea level rise is evident. The adequacy of the legal adaptation framework in Indonesia to respond to this climate vulnerability is assessed and it is found to have limited consideration of the community burden arising from these climate and SLR uncertainties. A more inclusive social justice approach could assist government to respond to the impacts from these issues and to their implications for vulnerable groups.

Objective: This study was conducted to identify leaf mQTL in tomato and to assess the association of leaf metabolites and physiological traits with the metabolite levels from other tissues. Methods: The analysis of components of leaf metabolism was performed by phenotypying 76 tomato ILs with chromosome segments of the wild species Solanum pennellii in the genetic background of a cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum) variety M82. The plants were cultivated in two different environments in independent years and samples were harvested from mature leaves of non-flowering plants at the middle of the light period. The non-targeted metabolite profiling was obtained by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS). With the data set obtained in this study and already published metabolomics data from seed and fruit, we performed QTL mapping, heritability and correlation analyses. Results: Changes in metabolite contents were evident in the ILs that are potentially important with respect to stress responses and plant physiology. By analyzing the obtained data, we identified 42 positive and 76 negative mQTL involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Conclusions: Overall, these findings allowed the identification of S. lycopersicum genome regions involved in the regulation of leaf primary carbon and nitrogen metabolism, as well as the association of leaf metabolites with metabolites from seeds and fruits. © 2019, The Author(s).","Leaf metabolism; Metabolite network; Metabolite QTL; Tomato","alanine; aspartic acid; fructose; glucose; glutamic acid; glyceric acid; glycine; isoleucine; leucine; nitrogen; proline; psicose; serine; sucrose; tyrosine; allele; amino acid analysis; Article; biotic stress; electron transport; gas chromatography; gene expression; gene location; genetic background; genetic variation; genotype; harvest index; mass fragmentography; metabolite; metabolomics; nonhuman; phenotype; photosynthesis; plant gene; plant growth; plant leaf; quantitative trait locus; time of flight mass spectrometry; tomato; chemistry; chromosomal mapping; fruit; genetics; metabolism; metabolome; plant leaf; plant seed; procedures; tomato; Chromosome Mapping; Fruit; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Lycopersicon esculentum; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Phenotype; Plant Leaves; Quantitative Trait Loci; Seeds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062981459

Improved understanding of fine-scale spatial and temporal variation in soil N availability is needed to better predict tundra responses to a warming climate. We quantified plant-available inorganic nitrogen at multiple soil depths in 12 microhabitats associated with a gradient from low-center ice-wedge polygons to high-center polygons in coastal tundra at Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska. We measured vegetation composition, biomass, N content, and rooting depth distribution, as well as soil temperature, moisture, pH, and thaw depth to determine relationships between the spatial and temporal variability in N availability and environmental and vegetation drivers. Soil moisture varied across the microhabitats of the polygonal terrain and was the most important variable linked to distribution of both ammonium and nitrate, with ammonium predominating in wetter areas and nitrate predominating in drier areas. Total inorganic N availability increased as the soil in the active layer thawed, but the newly available N near the permafrost boundary late in the season was apparently not available to roots and did not contribute to plant N content. Nitrate in the drier sites also was not associated with plant N content, raising the possibility of N losses from this N-limited ecosystem. The strong relationship between soil moisture, inorganic N availability, and plant N content implies that understanding hydrological changes that may occur in a warming climate is key to determining nutrient cycling responses in complex polygonal tundra landscapes. © 2018, The Author(s).","active layer; ammonium; Arctic; ice-wedge polygons; microhabitat; nitrate; plant-available nitrogen; root distribution; thaw; tundra","active layer; ammonium; freeze-thaw cycle; inorganic nitrogen; microhabitat; nutrient availability; nutrient cycling; permafrost; root system; rooting; temporal analysis; temporal variation; tundra; Alaska; Arctic; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051551563

This approach estimates vulnerabilities in term of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. While Pekan is more vulnerable in terms of social network, knowledge and skill but less adaptive in capacity to cope with climate and in contrast, Temerloh is the most vulnerable to natural disaster and climate variability, and sensitivity in term of health, food, finance and income and livelihood strategy.

However, the current Coalition Government in Australia does not prefer such methods and has argued that these policies would substantially increase the electricity price, and weaken the Australian competitiveness and the whole economy. Subsequently, the Government replaced the carbon tax policy in July 2014 with its Emissions Reduction Fund, which fundamentally uses the government budget of A$2.55 billion to buy emission abatements from polluters. There are major arguments among the Australian public about the efficiency and the effects of this approach, but the economic effects are still unidentified. This study aims to examine the economy-wide effects of this policy on the Australian economy by employing a national environmental and economic general equilibrium model so that Australians and international audience would be aware of the impacts and how the reverse auction and carbon subsidy work as a policy to reduce emissions at large scales across all sectors in a country. Results show that Australia only experiences relatively small impact on its economy. Real GDP only declines by 0.3%–0.4% over all scenarios. Industrial and private sectors also experience relatively small unfavourable impacts, but the output and export level of the agricultural commodity will decline substantially. The renewable sectors are expanded to compensate output reductions in fossil fuel electricity generation sectors, though the expansion is insufficient to compensate for the losses. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Abatement subsidy; Australia; CGE modelling; Emissions reduction fund; Renewable electricity generation sectors; Reverse auction","Agriculture; Budget control; Carbon; Climate change; Economic analysis; Electric power generation; Electronic commerce; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Public policy; Agricultural commodities; Australia; Electricity generation sectors; Emissions reduction; Emissions Trading Scheme; General equilibrium models; Renewable electricity; Reverse auction; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060924686

Here, we present a modelling approach that assesses the relative impact of disturbances on carbon storage and sequestration, and how this will alter under climate change. Our case study is semi-arid Australia where large areas of land are managed to offset over 122 million tonnes of anthropogenic carbon emissions over a 100-year period. These carbon offsets include mature vegetation that has been protected from clearing and regenerating vegetation on degraded agricultural land. We use a Bayesian Network model to combine multiple probabilistic models of the risk posed by fire, drought, grazing and recruitment failure to carbon dynamics. The model is parameterised from a review of relevant literature and additional quantitative analyses presented here. We found that the risk of vegetation becoming a net source of carbon due to a mortality event, or failing to realise maximum sequestration potential, through recruitment failure in regenerating vegetation, was primarily a function of rainfall in this semi-arid environment. However, the relative size of an emissions event varied across vegetation communities depending on plant attributes, specifically resprouting capacity. Modelled climate change effects were variable, depending on the climate change projection used. Under ‘best-case’ or ‘most-likely’ climate scenarios for 2050, similar or increased projections of mean annual precipitation, associated with a build-up of fuel, were expected to drive an increase in fire activity (a 40–160% increase), but a decrease in drought (a 20–35% decrease). Under a ‘worst-case’ climate scenario, fire activity was expected to decline (a 37% decrease), but drought conditions remain similar (a 5% decrease). These projected changes to the frequency of drought and fire increase the risk that vegetation used for carbon offsetting will fail to provide anticipated amounts of carbon abatement over their lifetime. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Drought; Forest; Grazing; Mortality; Wildfire","carbon; fuel; carbon; carbon; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; disturbance; drought; extreme event; forest; grazing; modeling; mortality; rainfall; risk; semiarid region; wildfire; woodland; agricultural land; Article; Australia; carbon dynamics; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; climate; climate change; drought; fire; forest; forest fire; grazing; mortality; precipitation; semiarid climate; vegetation; water availability; Bayes theorem; Australia; Australia; Bayes Theorem; Carbon; Climate Change; Forests",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060760726

Changes in farming practices are necessary to reduce emissions and to adapt to climate change. However, such modifications to common practices depend, to a large extent, on farmers' knowledge and attitudes towards climate risks. An empirical study of farmers' attitudes and knowledge of climate change mitigation and adaptation practices is useful to understand how farmers' knowledge influences their attitudes and practices towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. Based on a case study characterised by four agricultural farming systems (extensive dairy sheep, intensive dairy cattle, horticultural farming, and rice farming) in the Province of Oristano in Italy, this study contains an investigation of (i) farmers' knowledge of climate change causes and effects, how they construct such knowledge, and how they adapt to the phenomenon; (ii) what and how are farmers' attitudes towards climate change causes are shaped under their contextual social interests and values; and (iii) if their practices in responding to climate variability are influenced by their constructed knowledge. The research results showed that farmers' declarative knowledge of climate change did not affect their adaptation practices but directed farmers’ attitudes towards climate change causes. The findings also underscore the necessity of facilitating social learning spaces for enhancing virtuous behaviours towards climate change mitigation and the sharing and co-production of procedural knowledge for developing shared sustainable climate adaptation practices at the farm level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Attitude; Farming systems; Knowledge; Practice; Social construction","adaptive management; agricultural worker; climate change; farmers attitude; farming system; knowledge; local adaptation; social construction; Italy; Oristano; Sardinia; Bos; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061565405

A marked spatial and temporal variability in the water quality was observed in this study. Principal component analysis (PCA) reveals the influence of salinity, anthropogenic factors, as well as vegetation on the water quality. The higher concentration of nitrate (NO3−) and phosphate (PO43−) in certain pockets of the lagoon water was due to the prevalence of agricultural, municipal, and domestic waste. A positive correlation between PO43− and DSi indicates their terrigenous input from freshwater influx. Cyclone Phailin had profound impact on several water quality parameters. pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are governed largely by the presence of macrophytes. The impact of severe cyclone Phailin can be assessed from the very low salinity values persisting in the lagoon even 2.5 months after the cyclone hit Odisha coast. Some toxic heavy metals like Copper (Cu), Lead (Pb), Nickel (Ni), Cobalt (Co), Manganese (Mn), and Iron (Fe) exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards at many locations in both the seasons. Non-conservative behavior of nutrients indicates well mixed nature of lagoon which is also indicative of good primary productivity. Northern sector (NS) of the lagoon is susceptible to eutrophication being riverine influenced region. Southern sector has more stable ion chemistry as a result of least freshwater discharge, constant supply of saline water, and lesser water renewal. © 2019, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Chilika lagoon; Dissolved nutrients; Macrophytes; Non-conservative behavior; Phailin","concentration (composition); cyclone; dissolved inorganic carbon; dissolved oxygen; eutrophication; freshwater; macrophyte; primary production; spatiotemporal analysis; water quality; Chilka Lake; India; Odisha; Odisha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063573040

We analyse a set of different policies in three areas with particularly high consumption-based emissions in Austria: building construction, public health, and transport. To capture the substitution possibilities triggered by these policies and the induced emission reductions along the full global supply chain, our analysis combines a Computable General Equilibrium with a Multi-Regional Input-Output model. For construction of buildings we find that a carbon added tax is highly effective in reducing consumption-based emissions whereas an information obligation on vacant dwellings combined with a penalty payment when vacant buildings are not made available is ineffective because of reallocated investment capital. Mandatory energy efficiency improvements in public health and mobility are found equally effective in reducing consumption- and production-based emissions while a decarbonization of freight transport logistics stronger reduces production-based emissions. Overall, the effectiveness of policies, to mitigate consumption-based emissions, is therefore determined by the backward and forward linkages of the sector addressed by the policy as well as the substitution effects within final demand. © 2018","Carbon footprint; Computable General Equilibrium analysis; Emissions embodied in trade; Multi-Regional Input-Output model; National climate policy; Policy analysis","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon footprint; computable general equilibrium analysis; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental policy; freight transport; investment; policy analysis; supply chain management; trade; Austria; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059819599

Reducing the nitrogen (N) footprint of agriculture is a global challenge that depends, among other things, on our ability to quantify the N2O emission intensity of the world's most widespread and productive agricultural systems. In this context, biogeochemistry (BGC) models are widely used to estimate soil N2O emissions in agroecosystems. The choice of spatial scale is crucial because larger-scale studies are limited by low input data precision, while smaller-scale studies lack wider relevance. The robustness of large-scale model predictions depends on preliminary and data-demanding model calibration/validation, while relevant studies often omit the performance of output uncertainty analysis and underreport model outputs that would allow a critical assessment of results. This study takes a novel approach to these aspects. The study focuses on arable eastern Scotland - a data-rich region typical of northwest Europe in terms of edaphoclimatic conditions, cropping patterns and productivity levels. We used a calibrated and locally validated BGC model to simulate direct soil N2O emissions along with NO3 leaching and crop N uptake in fields of barley, wheat and oilseed rape. We found that 0.59&amp;thinsp;% (±0.36) of the applied N is emitted as N2O while 37&amp;thinsp;% (±6) is taken up by crops and 14% (±7) is leached as NO3. We show that crop type is a key determinant of N2O emission factors (EFs) with cereals having a low (mean EF &gt; 0.6%), and oilseed rape a high (mean EF = 2.48%), N2O emission intensity. Fertiliser addition was the most important N2O emissions driver suggesting that appropriate actions can reduce crop N2O intensity. Finally, we estimated a 74&amp;thinsp;% relative uncertainty around N2O predictions attributable to soil data variability. However, we argue that higher-resolution soil data alone might not suffice to reduce this uncertainty. © Author(s) 2019.",,"agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; agricultural soil; anthropogenic effect; biogeochemistry; estimation method; fertilizer application; nitrous oxide; soil emission; Europe; Scotland; United Kingdom; Brassica napus; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064678289

With the use of biological processes, we can transform these wastes into fertilizers for a sustainable agriculture. We used three different methods anaerobic digestion, aerobic digestion, and crude agricultural waste management system to produce organic fertilizers. The obtained compounds were chemically analysed to verify if their characteristics fell into the marketability limits permitted by the current Italian regulation. Their effects on soil were subsequently assessed. Results evidenced that all the by-products obtained were suitable as fertilizers. They were able to increase soil organic matter, microbial biomass, and nutrients with beneficial effects on soil fertility, but at different extent. The best effects were in the order: compost, olive pomace-sulphur-bentonite pelletized and digestate. Considering that the three different methodologies dispose different amounts of olive pomace (90% in aerobic digestion, 12% in anaerobic digestion and 5% in sulphur bentonite pelletized) in different time (4 months for compost, 1 month for anaerobic digestion and 1 day for sulphur-bentonite pelletized) and processing set-up, each method can be differently competitive for environment and/or agriculture. Aerobic digestion has economic advantage over other alternatives and has the greatest fertilizer effect even if the production time is longer than the other two. Digestate, coming from anaerobic digestion, reduces the environmental impact of greenhouse gas emissions it is rich in nutrients and can be obtained in a shorter time than compost. Olive pomace-sulphur-bentonite pelletized represents a crude waste management systems that reduce greenhouse gas emission in the atmosphere producing fertilizers able to generate, mainly in alkaline soils, a soluble zone of nutrients while minimizing leaching losses to the environment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aerobic digestion, anaerobic digestion; Compost; Digestate; Olive wastes; Sulphur-bentonite","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Bentonite; Composting; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Nutrients; Olive oil; Pelletizing; Soil pollution; Sulfur; Water quality; Aerobic digestions; Agricultural purpose; Digestate; Mediterranean countries; Organic fertilizers; Soil organic matters; Sustainable agriculture; Waste management systems; Anaerobic digestion; bentonite; digestate; organic fertilizer; soil organic matter; sulfur bentonite; unclassified drug; fertilizer; anaerobic digestion; bentonite; compost; industrial waste; soil fertility; sulfur; vegetable oil; waste management; water quality; aerobic digestion; aerobic metabolism; alkalinity; anaerobic digestion; Article; carbon footprint; cleaning; compost; controlled study; economic aspect; environmental impact; Italy; leaching; microbial biomass; nonhuman; nutrient; olive pomace; priority journal; soil fertility; waste management; agriculture; economics; olive tree; procedures; waste management; Mediterranean Region; Agriculture; Fertilizers; Italy; Olea; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060289097

Though adherents of decentralization argue that local governments are more likely to conceive and implement proadaptation-related interventions, evidence from Ghana provides fascinating lessons. This paper shows that local governments’ ability to mainstream adaptation-related actions into local governance is constricted by taxonomy of local political economy issues and the “science-heaviness” of climate change.

The seasonal flux of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) in a restoration concession in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, was measured in the two contrasting land covers: shrubs and secondary forests growing on peatlands. We found that land covers had high, but insignificantly different, soil carbon stocks of 949 + 56 and 1126 + 147 Mg ha −1 , respectively. The mean annual CO 2 flux from the soil of shrub areas was 52.4 ± 4.1 Mg ha −1  year −1 , and from secondary peat swamp forests was 42.9 ± 3.6 Mg ha −1  year −1 . The significant difference in mean soil temperature in the shrubs (31.2 °C) and secondary peat swamp forests (26.3 °C) was responsible for the difference in total CO 2 fluxes of these sites. We also found the mean annual total soil respiration was almost equally partitioned between heterotrophic respiration (20.8 + 1.3 Mg ha −1  year −1 ) and autotrophic respiration (22.6 + 1.5 Mg ha −1  year −1 ).

Following completion of the field trial, we report here a series of in-vitro incubations of the degraded biochars to determine CO2 efflux rates, 14C concentration and δ13C values in CO2 to quantify the contributions of biochar carbon and other sources of carbon to the CO2 efflux. The 14C concentration in CO2 showed that microbial degradation led to respiration of CO2 sourced from indigenous biochar carbon (≈0.5-1.4 μmoles CO2/g biochar C/day) along with a component of carbon closely associated with the biochars but derived from the local environment.

Thanks to standardized greenhouse gas equivalencies and carbon-intensity metrics for everyday activities, many organizations have created online carbon footprint calculators, often with a great deal of input categories and user customization. This particular study critically examines the state of online carbon footprint calculators that target the individual. A calculator Feature Index was developed using guidance from carbon calculator literature and an extensive review of common calculator features and architecture. This index was then applied to 31 online carbon footprint calculators, summarized in heat index tables and scores generated using radar plot methodology.

Recently, the concept of climate scenario planning attempts to simplify climate information by developing a series of plausible future “storylines.” In some cases, however, these storylines lack quantitative detail on extremes that may be useful to decision-makers. Here, we analyse a large suite of statistically downscaled climate projections from two methods to develop quantitative projections for hydrologic extremes (heavy precipitation and drought) across Oklahoma and Texas in the United States. Downscaled projections are grouped into four specific temperature/precipitation scenarios, including “Warm/Wet,” “Hot/Dry,” “Central Tendency,” and the full multi-model ensemble average. The region is split into three sub-domains spanning the region's west–east precipitation gradient, and projections are examined throughout the mid- and late-21st century, using two emissions scenarios (“mid-range” and “high”). Most scenarios project increased frequency and duration of moderate or greater drought across the whole domain, with the high-emissions Hot/Dry projections showing the most severe examples. The Warm/Wet scenario also increases the frequency of dry months, particularly in the Southern High Plains, but does not discernably alter duration, and retains a similar frequency of pluvial (wet) periods. The mid-range projections generally retain similar evolutions among scenarios, but they reduce drought intensity and project no change in drought/pluvial frequency with the Warm/Wet scenario. Notably, the occurrence of intense precipitation increases across all scenarios and emissions categories and does not significantly differ between any of the scenarios, including Hot/Dry versus Warm/Wet. Some observed differences in extreme precipitation magnitudes between the two downscaled data sets are briefly discussed. © 2018 Royal Meteorological Society","climate change; drought; extreme precipitation; regional projections; scenario planning; statistical downscaling","Decision making; Drought; Extreme precipitation; Intense precipitation; Management challenges; Precipitation gradients; regional projections; Scenario Planning; Southern great plains; Statistical downscaling; Climate change; climate change; downscaling; drought; extreme event; future prospect; precipitation (climatology); scenario analysis; statistical analysis; Great Plains; Oklahoma [United States]; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061076026

Yet there is a profound requisite to identify the most effective plant species by their leaf traits that can enhance particle capture and improve ambient air quality. In this study, we investigated leaves of 96 perennial urban plant species consisting of 43 deciduous broadleaf trees, 32 deciduous broadleaf shrubs, 14 deciduous and evergreen needle/scale-like, 5 evergreen broadleaves, and 2 climber species for their differences in net particle accumulation. Leaf saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM), a proxy for traffic and industry induced particle accumulation, along with morphological and anatomical leaf traits were analyzed in a common garden experiment in June and September 2016. Leaf SIRM varied significantly between plant species. The most effective net particle accumulating plant species with a median value of 23.0 μA were Buddleja davidii, Viburnum opulus, Carpinus betulus, Quercus ilex, Viburnum lantana, Rosa rugosa, Sorbus aria, Aesculus hippocastanum, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Acer campestre. The least effective net particle accumulating plant species with a median value of 10.4 μA were Populus alba, Alnus glutinosa, Larix kaempferi, Larix decidua, Plantanus x acerilifolia, Acer pseudoplatanus, Robinia pseudoacacia, Quercus palustris, Rosa canina, Liquidambar styraciflua. The “variable importance” in net particle accumulation for the investigated plant species was achieved using ®randomForest. The presence of leaf trichomes and specific leaf area were identified as important leaf traits for categorization of the selected plant species in low, medium, and high net particle accumulators. The extensive analysis of plant species at leaf-level with distinct micro-morphology contributes to a better understanding of plant species behavior in net particle capture and their contribution in reducing atmospheric particulate matter. Furthermore, this study has practical implications for policymakers in making informed choices when planning urban green infrastructures. Lastly, our study can become a basis to validate atmospheric deposition model using species-specific information. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Inter-species differences; Leaf traits; Net particle accumulation; Particulate matter; randomForest; Urban environments","Air quality; Forestry; Meteorological problems; Particles (particulate matter); Saturation magnetization; Inter-species differences; Leaf traits; Particle accumulation; Particulate Matter; randomForest; Urban environments; Plants (botany); air quality; ambient air; anatomy; atmospheric deposition; bioaccumulation; climbing plant; deciduous tree; evergreen tree; experimental study; greenspace; interspecific variation; leaf; micromorphology; morphology; particulate matter; shrub; trichome; urban pollution; Acer pseudoplatanus; Aesculus hippocastanum; Alnus glutinosa; article; atmospheric deposition; Buddleja; decidua; Douglas fir; evergreen; Lantana; Larix; leaf area; Liquidambar; micromorphology; nonhuman; particulate matter; Populus; Quercus ilex; Robinia pseudoacacia; Rosa canina; shrub; Sorbus; species difference; trichome; urban area; Viburnum; Acer campestre; Acer pseudoplatanus; Aesculus hippocastanum; Alnus glutinosa; Buddleja davidii; Carpinus betulus; Larix decidua; Larix kaempferi; Liquidambar styraciflua; Populus alba; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Quercus ilex; Quercus palustris; Robinia pseudoacacia; Rosa canina; Rosa rugosa; Sorbus aria; Viburnum lantana; Viburnum opulus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061354163

A representative zero-energy office building in Norway is investigated with alternative design solutions to achieve zero-emission status i.e., the extensive use of locally generated energy through photovoltaic (PV) panels and the use of materials with low embodied emissions, such as low-carbon concrete and wood. A life cycle environmental and economic assessment is performed to evaluate specific indicators during the building life cycle: cumulative energy (CED), global warming potential (GWP), and equivalent annual cost (EAC). The extensive use of PV panels was most effective in lowering the operational energy because it reduced the CED by about 30% compared to the building as-built. However, the extensive use of wood in the construction contributed the most to GWP reduction, with around 30% decrease compared to the building as-built. Finally, the differences in EAC were interestingly insignificant among the alternatives, with the investment costs dominating the EAC for all designs examined. The findings of this paper emphasise that a full compensation of the life cycle GHG emissions from materials is difficult to achieve through renewable energy, even with extensive use of PV panels, especially in a low-carbon grid situation as in Norway. A pathway strategy from zero-energy towards zero-emission buildings must therefore strongly focus on the materials’ embodied energy and emissions because low operational energy demand is already a regulatory priority in most countries. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Economic sustainability; Environmental sustainability; Life cycle; Zero-emission buildings; Zero-energy buildings","Air pollution; Carbon; Costs; Energy conservation; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Life cycle; Office buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Sustainable development; Alternative designs; Economic assessments; Economic sustainability; Environmental and economic performance; Environmental sustainability; Global warming potential; Life-cycle GHG emissions; Zero emission buildings; Zero energy buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061620436

The term ‘energy communities’ is, however, used to denote a range of different circumstances thus risking overly simplifying the phenomenon. The intention of this article is to discuss what these communities really are or could be. The article is structured into five sections. The first section introduces the main topic. The second section clarifies the use of the term community, and propose an energy community taxonomy (we consider two pairs of options which generate a four-cell matrix: a first distinction can be made between “place-based” and “non-place-based” communities on the basis of a potential correspondence between the community and a specific area; a further difference is that between communities which take shape solely for energy purposes and those with a range of objectives including goals encompassing shared management of energy systems - in this sense, we can distinguish between “single-purpose” and “multi-purpose” communities). The third section considers certain examples which test and exemplify this taxonomy. The fourth section discusses the most significant features which have emerged and considers the main implications (e.g. policy implications).

A strong relationship between vehicle emissions standard and in-vehicle concentrations was established. Extensive measurements of PM2.5, eBC, and CO were carried out inside the system buses and stations. Measurements were performed during eleven months covering all the system lanes and a significant fraction of the bus fleet and stations. Based on the observed in-bus and in-station concentrations, travel times, and urban ambient levels, the contribution of a typical round trip in the BRT system to the daily inhaled dose was estimated to be 60% for PM2.5, and between 79% and 90% for eBC. The mean PM2.5 dose inhaled by commuters in a typical round trip in the system is 1.2 times the dose a subject would inhale over 24 h exposed to WHO guideline of 25 μgm−3. In 52 out of 180 buses sampled the mean in-cabin concentration of eBC was in excess of 100 μgm−3. Measurements show that mean ratio of in-bus to urban ambient concentration is 8:1 for PM2.5 and 4:1 for CO. These ratios were observed to be much larger when traveling inside the older fraction of the BRT fleet, reaching 11:1 and 7:1 for PM2.5 and CO respectively. These older buses consist exclusively of Euro II and Euro III nominal emission standard vehicles. Average exposure levels inside Euro II and III buses was twice as large as those measured inside vehicles with stricter emission standards, Euro IV or superior. Overall, the measurements suggest that the entrainment of polluted pockets of air to the semi enclosed micro-environments in the system, namely, buses and stations, explains the extreme observed exposure concentrations. Measurements inside an underground bus-station where traffic is restricted to only BRT buses, and on-board a zero emission fully electric BRT bus suggested most of the pollution in the system comes from entrainment of the exhaust of the diesel-powered BRT buses. The significantly lower exposure and inhaled dose of PM2.5, eBC, and CO observed for commuters in newer vehicles suggests that a fleet renewal could have a disproportionately large impact on reducing population exposure to air pollutants. The extent of the reduction in exposure and inhaled dose through fleet renewal is proportional to the gradient of in-bus to urban ambient air pollution levels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Black carbon; Black carbon exposure; Bus rapid transit system; Fine particulate; Micro-aethalometer loading correction; Urban air pollution","Air entrainment; Air quality; Bus transportation; Buses; Carbon monoxide; Light rail transit; Rapid transit; Transit time devices; Travel time; Aethalometer; Black carbon; Bus rapid transit systems; Fine particulates; Urban air pollution; Fleet operations; carbon monoxide; aging; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; guideline; particle size; particulate matter; pollution exposure; traffic emission; urban area; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; airborne particle; ambient air; Article; Colombia; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; human; inhalation; particle size; population exposure; priority journal; standard; Bogota; Colombia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060492693

The approach combines four methods—analysis of waste and area characteristics, data acquisition and evaluation by GIS, mathematical projection of existing and future collection systems, and identification of most suitable alternatives through comparative multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The approach is applied in Bangalore, India with 1.66 million inhabitants and 46.7-km 2 area of investigation, and stratified based on population density. Two possible collection mechanisms (door-to-door (D2D) and community bin (CB)) are analyzed with a varied combination of collection coverage and waste segregation level. The study results confirm that both operational and investment expenses of the collection system decrease with an increasing rate of CB collection. Moreover, overall CO 2 emissions of waste collection from the entire area of investigation decrease from 5.2 to 3.1 tons per day if the present 100% D2D collection is replaced with 100% CB collection system. Also, the increase of segregation at source contributes to the reduction of operational expenses and CO 2 emissions; for example, a 20% increase of segregation level for D2D collection system leads to a 6% reduction of CO 2 emissions. Considering all decision parameters through MCDA, a collection system comprising only CB with one separate compartment for wet waste and another combined compartment for dry and mixed waste is determined to be the most favorable approach. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Multi-criteria decision analysis; Municipal solid waste; Newly industrialized countries; Waste collection","Bins; Carbon dioxide; Data acquisition; Decision making; Population statistics; Decision parameters; Industrialized countries; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Multi-stage optimization; Operational expense; Population densities; Solid waste collection; Waste collection; Municipal solid waste; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data acquisition; decision analysis; industrial development; industrial district; multicriteria analysis; municipal solid waste; optimization; urban region; waste disposal; Article; Asia; carbon footprint; developed country; geographic information system; human; investment; municipal solid waste; population density; urban area; developing country; India; solid waste; waste disposal; waste management; Bengaluru; India; Karnataka; Asia; Developed Countries; India; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058241545

Recent experimental programs and analytical approaches reveal that basalt-based fiber-reinforced materials may be effective for a number of structural applications in civil engineering. Depending on the fiber treatment and arrangement, as well as on the matrix type (polymeric or cementitious) different composite materials have been conceived.

Mechanical thinning regimes reduced the yield by 28% (moderate thinning) and 53% (severe thinning) compared to non-thinned SMPH and increased TSS by 0.8 and 1.3 brix, respectively. Delayed bunch rot epidemic and maturity progress give rise to the opportunity for a longer maturity period in cooler conditions, making this system of particular interest in future, warmer climatic conditions. Providing that yield levels are managed properly, SMPH might represent an interesting climate change adaptation strategy. © 2019 by the authors.","Botrytis cinerea; Low-input; Mechanical thinning; Viticultural training system; Yield formation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064174914

Many natural populations are adapted to local abiotic and biotic environmental conditions they have experienced during their evolutionary histories. Currently, human actions are altering climatic and nonclimatic selection agents, which can lead to discrepancies between average phenotype and the phenotype associated with the greatest fitness under new environmental conditions. Climate change may impose strong novel selection, shifting fitness landscapes and reducing survival and fecundity in natural populations. Indeed, altered seasonal dynamics of plants and animals are one of the strongest biotic signals of contemporary climate change. In addition to depressing fitness, shifts in selection mediated by climate change could result in widespread patterns and increased risk of local-or even regional-extinction.Here we synthesize field studies using warming manipulations to investigate impacts on fitness components in wild plants (quantities of flowers, fruits, and seeds, seed viabilities, and seedling establishment success) and reproductive phenology (seasonal and interannual timing of reproductive events). We use a comprehensive approach in that we include reproduction and establishment events from initial flowering to survivorship and growth responses of resulting F1 seedlings with continued warming. In contrast to reproductive investigations of increased atmospheric CO2, we did not find many references addressing pollen responses to warming under field conditions, so we begin here with flowering, fruiting, and seed responses to soil warming. We include new data exploring warming impacts on plant reproduction from a temperate deciduous forest and a Low Arctic tundra and conclude with a reproductive case study covering desert and dryland ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

By embedding an effective initiative as well as best practices, environmental sustainability performance of universities can be improved. Realising the benefits of these factors, this book chapter aims at constructively reviewing the university's environmental sustainability initiatives (ESI) by highlighting underlying issues and necessary improvements. To accomplish this, the ESI of three research universities in Malaysia were reviewed in accordance with UI GreenMetric World University Ranking. Around 36 major initiatives as well as several environmental sustainability courses that have been conducted by all three research universities was categorised using the descriptions and rationales of the six (6) main environmental category in UI GreenMetric which are Setting and Infrastructure, Energy and Climate Change, Waste, Water, Transportation and Education and Research. It can be concluded that the key factors that should be included in the ESI plan are awareness and environmental knowledge, green space and land use management, energy efficiency and water conservation, natural resource limitation, climate change mitigation, waste minimisation, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, environmental education programme and research collaboration as well as environmental sustainability guidelines and policies. These factors can help and guide universities to produce a good and strategic plan in practicing and conducting ESI towards a better future. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

Extensive research has been conducted into geopolymers during the past two decades, demonstrating the potential for the alkali-activated cement to replace ordinary Portland cement. However, there are a number of challenges facing the adoption of geopolymers. Much of the research into geopolymers uses sodium silicate solution as the alkali activator. Studies have noted that sodium silicate solutions are highly corrosive, and, as such, can be defined as user-hostile systems. Alternative alkali activators, such as potassium silicate solutions, have been proposed as more user-friendly and therefore more favourable for industry adoption. The highly variable nature of waste materials needs to be a focus of future research, with mix designs that focus on locally available waste materials with minimal processing. Much research has focused on heat-cured geopolymers; however, this increases the embodied energy while reducing the environmental benefit, which also acts as a limiting factor for in situ applications. Research into ambient temperature curing, addressing the issues of compressive strength, the rate of strength development, and curing time is required. Durability issues need to be addressed with studies finding the compressive strength of geopolymers being reduced after relatively short time periods of immersion in water, and potential problems relating to chloride induced corrosion of reinforcing steel. Further research is recommended for developing standardized leachate analysis for geopolymers containing recycled waste materials. The objective of this paper is to review the research into waste-incorporated geopolymers and highlight the barriers to industry adoption with a view to pointing the way forward for future research.

In this regard various applications aim towards improvement in urban planning, food system and transport planning. Reducing carbon footprint due to food waste and long transport distances for food is a key issue for smart and sustainable cities. The positive impact of this is both on the urban and peri-urban scale. Typically the provision of food in any city is designed around departmental stores which cater to larger population sizes and residential communities. This manuscript gives an overview of how smart systems can be used to reduce food waste and circulate food within residential apartment buildings without being stored for unnecessarily longer time periods. This idea works in tandem with the recently advancing proposals of vertical farming in which each apartment resident can grow, monitor and circulate the food produced in his apartment. A proposed ICT model on how this system can be adapted towards any typical residential building is studied. © 2019 IEEE.","Food wastage; Information and Communication Technology; IOT; Smart City","Apartment houses; Artificial intelligence; Carbon footprint; Population statistics; Smart city; Apartment buildings; Departmental stores; Food wastages; Information and Communication Technologies; Residential building; Residential communities; Sustainable society; Transport distances; Urban transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065605367

Electric vehicle (EV) with rechargeable battery has been proved to be a practical solution for the above problem. In order to utilize the maximum capacity of the battery, a proper power management and control mechanism need to be developed such that it does not affect the performance, reliability and safety of vehicle. Different optimization techniques along with deterministic dynamic programming (DDP) approach are used for the power distribution and management control. The battery-operated electric vehicle can be recharged either by plug-in a wired connection or by the inductive mean (i.e. wirelessly) with the help of the electromagnetic field energy. These inductive and wireless charging techniques utilize the principle of electromagnetic induction for transferring the power. The design of the wireless charging system, can be divided into three primary stage such as coil design, compensation topology and power converter with the control mechanism for transferring power efficiently. Different coil structures are proposed for maximizing the magnetic flux therefore helping in transferring the energy effectively. Compensation topology is used for the tuning of the high-frequency AC ranging from a few kHz to MHz between the primary coil and secondary coil. Different advance machine learning techniques are evolved for optimization of the parameters such as state of charge (SoC) and state of health (SoH), temperature, current etc. Based on the data obtained by pre-processing through data analysis techniques and then applying ML technique and prescriptive analytics are applied to estimate the value. In order to provide the secure charging environment, blockchain technology framework is proposed along with appropriate cyber security algorithm where ever required. © 2019 SAE International.

The film that forms on the chamber walls and piston bowl produces soot post-combustion. While some droplets stick to the wall surface, others splash and interact with the gas present inside the combustion chamber. Accurate prediction of both the film thickness and splashed mass is crucial for surface film model development since it leads to a precise estimation of the amount of soot and other exhaust gases formed. This information could guide future studies aimed at a comprehensive understanding of the combustion process and might enable development of engines with reduced emissions. Dynamic structure Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence model implemented for in-cylinder sprays [1] has shown to predict the flow structure of a spray more accurately than the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes turbulence model. Therefore, using dynamic structure LES turbulence model to analyze the interaction of turbulent gas phase region with the liquid deposited as film and with the splashed droplets is a promising area to study turbulent multiphase flows interacting with a solid surface. Three dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were carried out in OpenFOAM to compare multiple surface film models (Stanton-Rutland [2], O'Rourke-Amsden [3] and Bai-Gosman [4]) working with the LES dynamic structure turbulence model on the basis of experimental results of properties such as, splash penetration, film thickness and film area. It was found that for different properties, some surface film models performed better than the others. A comparison was made based on a model's overall ability to predict all the aforementioned properties accurately. © 2019 SAE International.

The Hague Court of Appeal thereby acknowledged the existence of a ‘duty of care’ in Dutch law based on the European Convention on Human Rights. A closer analysis of the judgment reveals that the concrete content of this duty of care is derived not from human rights, but from scientifically proven and internationally endorsed greenhouse gas emission reduction targets which are imperative to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. This article analyses the judgment and examines whether it is consistent with the existing environmental case law of the European Court of Human Rights. It demonstrates that the judgment forms part of a tidal wave of judicial enquiry into the accountability of governments for their climate action on the basis of human rights and that it is the virtue of human rights law to be conducive to resolving the accountability issue of governments for their climate action.

Considering state of the art gasoline engine architecture (dual variable valve timing, direct injection with turbocharger) it is common to have at least 12 degrees of freedom as system inputs. The understanding of interactions and inter-dependencies of these inputs is therefore key in optimising the performance of the engine. MAHLE Powertrain has developed a process using a global Design of Experiment (DoE) technique based on Gaussian processes that can be used to accurately model and optimise many aspects of an engine's performance. The output of this optimisation is then coupled with the proposed calibration architecture, which enables key calibration models to be completed early in the product development program. In this paper careful application of this methodology has been applied to a high specific output, 3 cylinder gasoline internal combustion engine which has allowed for the engine development test program to be condensed through not only reducing the number of test points but also increasing the overlap between base engine development and calibration activities. Furthermore, when applied to specific performance attributes the process has highlighted optima that would otherwise have been potentially overlooked as part of a conventional test program. © 2019 SAE International.

Using a Serbian case study, the effects of different waste disposal techniques on GHG emissions were analyzed in three scenarios: the current one, the worst one, and the best one. According to the Serbian national-waste management strategy, a large number of dumpsites and unsanitary landfills should be merged into several regional sanitary landfills. Results obtained from the SWM-GHG Calculator have shown potentially higher emissions from modern regional landfills than from dumpsites. Related environmental policy should therefore be analyzed in detail and applied. Environmental policy options are analyzed using the SWOT technique. The policy option to be implemented depends on country-specific circumstances, such as the adequate functioning of institutions, the effectiveness of the judicial system, the established legal framework, and the general level of competence in the waste management sector. If all of these conditions are in place, the ‘polluter pays’ option is the superior one. However, if the level of knowledge and capacity in waste sector is low, and if there are no adequate institutions, or if the judicial system is inefficient, the first option appears to be the right one. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","GHG emission; landfill policy; methane; polluter pays; technical standards","Chemical industry; Developing countries; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Disposal techniques; Environmental policy; GHG emission; polluter pays; Technical standards; Transitional economies; Unsanitary landfill; Waste management strategies; Land fill",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061832821

Given that heavy-atom tunneling plays a role in planar bond shifting of cyclobutadiene, we computationally explored the contribution of heavy-atom tunneling to planar Ï€-bond shifting in the major (CTCTCTCT, 5a) and minor (CTCTTCTT, 6a) known isomers of [16]annulene. UM06-2X/cc-pVDZ calculations yield bond-shifting barriers of ca. 10 kcal/mol. The results also reveal extremely narrow barrier widths, suggesting a high probability of tunneling for these bond-shifting reactions. Rate constants were calculated using canonical variational transition state theory (CVT) as well as with small curvature tunneling (SCT) contributions, via direct dynamics. For the major isomer 5a, the computed SCT rate constant for bond shifting at 80 K is 0.16 s-1, corresponding to a half-life of 4.3 s, and indicating that bond shifting is rapid at cryogenic temperatures despite a 10 kcal/mol barrier. This contrasts with the CVT rate constant of 8.0 × 10-15 s-1 at 80 K. The minor isomer 6a is predicted to undergo rapid bond shifting via tunneling even at 10 K. For both isomers, bond shifting is predicted to be much faster than competing conformation change despite lower barriers for the latter process. The preference for bond shifting represents cases of tunneling control in which the preferred reaction is dominated by heavy-atom motions. At all temperatures below â50 °C, tunneling is predicted to dominate the bond shifting process for both 5a and 6a. Thus, [16]annulene is predicted to be an example of tunneling by 16 carbons. Bond shifting in both isomers is predicted to be rapid at temperatures accessible by solution-phase NMR spectroscopy, and an experiment is proposed to verify these predictions. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Atoms; Electronic states; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Plants (botany); Rate constants; Variable speed transmissions; Canonical variational transition-state theories; Conformation change; Cryogenic temperatures; Heavy atom tunneling; High probability; Shifting process; Small-curvature tunneling; Tunneling control; Isomers; annulene derivative; carbon; Article; chemical bond; chemical phenomena; chemical structure; conformation; isomer; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; planar bond shifting; prediction; reaction analysis; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063383109

Methane emissions not only contribute to global warming, as it has 25 times the global warming potential (GWP) of CO 2 , but also represent approximately 0.1~3.3% of digestive energy loss. Methanogens also play an important role in maintaining the balance of the gut microbiome. The large intestines are the main habitat for the microbiome in pigs. Thus, to better understand the mechanism of methane production and mitigation, generic-specific and physio-ecological characteristics (including redox potential (Eh), pH and volatile fatty acids (VFAs)) and methanogens in the large intestine of pig were studied in this paper. Thirty DLY finishing pigs with the same diet and feeding conditions were selected for this experiment. Result: A total of 219 clones were examined using the methyl coenzyme reductase subunit A gene (mcrA) and assigned to 43 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on a 97% species-level identity criterion. The family Methanobacteriaceae was the dominant methanogen in colonic digesta of finishing pigs, accounting for approximately 70.6% of the identified methanogens, and comprised mainly the genera Methanobrevibacter (57%) and Methanosphaera (14%). The order Methanomassiliicoccales, classified as an uncultured taxonomy, accounted for 15.07%. The methanogenic archaeon WGK1 and unclassified Methanomicrobiales belonging to the order of Methanomicrobiales accounted for 4.57 and 1.37%, respectively. The Eh was negative and within the range - 297.00~423.00 mV and the pH was within the range 5.04~6.97 in the large intestine. The populations of total methanogens and Methanobacteriales were stable in different parts of the large intestine according to real-time PCR. Conclusion: The major methanogen in the large intestine of finishing pigs was Methanobrevibacter. The seventh order Methanomassiliicoccales and species Methanosphaera stadtmanae present in the large intestine of pigs might contribute to the transfer of hydrogen and fewer methane emissions. The redox potential (Eh) was higher in the large intestine of finishing pigs, which had a positive correlation with the population of Methanobacteriale. © 2019 The Author(s).","Large intestine; Methanogen; Pig; Redox potential","carbon dioxide; fatty acid; hydrogen; methane; oxidoreductase; endodeoxyribonuclease McrA; restriction endonuclease; ribosome DNA; RNA 16S; volatile fatty acid; Article; community structure; controlled study; gene; greenhouse effect; habitat; human; large intestine; livestock; mcrA gene; Methanobacteriaceae; methanogen; methanogenic archaeon; Methanomicrobiales; Methanosphaera; Methanosphaera stadtmanae; microbial diversity; microbiome; nucleotide sequence; oxidation reduction potential; phylogeny; pig; real time polymerase chain reaction; animal; China; classification; colon; female; genetics; intestine flora; isolation and purification; large intestine; male; metabolism; Methanobrevibacter; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; pH; Animals; China; Colon; DNA Restriction Enzymes; DNA, Ribosomal; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Intestine, Large; Male; Methane; Methanobacteriaceae; Methanobrevibacter; Oxidation-Reduction; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065257786

Children have the highest diarrhea incidence, especially in India, where many lack safe water and sanitation. OBJECTIVES: In a prospective cohort of 1,284 children under 5 y of age from 900 households across 25 villages in rural Tamil Nadu, India, we examined whether high temperature and heavy rainfall was associated with increased all-cause diarrhea and water contamination. METHODS: Seven-day prevalence of diarrhea was assessed monthly for up to 12 visits from January 2008 to April 2009, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) presence in drinking water, a fecal contamination indicator, was tested in a subset of households. We estimated associations between temperature and rainfall exposures and diarrhea and H2S using binomial regressions, adjusting for potential confounders, random effects for village, and autoregressive-1 error terms for study week. RESULTS: There were 259 cases of diarrhea. The prevalence of diarrhea during the 7 d before visits was 2.95 times higher (95% CI: 1.99, 4.39) when mean temperature in the week before the 7-d recall was in the hottest versus the coolest quartile of weekly mean temperature during 1 December 2007 to 15 April 2009. Diarrhea prevalence was 1.50 times higher when the 3 weeks before the diarrhea recall period included ≥1 d (vs. 0 d) with rainfall of &gt;16:82 mm (95% CI: 1.12, 2.02), and 2.60 times higher (95% CI: 1.55, 4.36) for heavy rain weeks following a 60-d dry period. The H2S prevalence in household water was not associated with heavy rain prior to sample collection. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that, in rural Tamil Nadu, heavy rainfall may wash pathogens that accumulate during dry weather into child contact. Higher temperatures were positively associated with diarrhea 1–3 weeks later. Our findings suggest that diarrhea morbidity could worsen under climate change without interventions to reduce enteric pathogen transmission through multiple pathways. © 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Cereals were also studied for their sterols content. Few insights have been devoted to other tetraploid species than emmer and durum wheats. This work examined phytosterol and phytostanol content in seed of six tetraploid wheat species cultivated during two successive years under rainfed organic conditions in Auch (near Toulouse, France). Sterols (free and esterified sterols) were measured by gas-chromatography-flame ionisation detector. Mean value of sterols + stanols content was 99.5 mg 100 g −1 DW. The main sterol was β-sitosterol. Results showed a year effect on sterol content, whatever the wheat species. This could be explained by the differences in climatic conditions prevailing during plant cycle and grain filling. A large variability for sterols content was found between species and within each species. Emmer wheat revealed the lowest values for all sterols and stanols. Higher values of sterols were obtained in durum wheat. This work is the first report studying T. carthlicum, T. polonicum, T. turgidum, T. timopheevi. These species exhibited intermediate values of sterol contents between emmer and durum wheats. Wheat tetraploid species showed interesting levels of sterols and could serve as a great source of these healthy compounds mainly in Mediterranean region where they are consumed as wholegrain. Variation in climatic conditions could help to manage the level of these secondary metabolites. © 2019 by the authors.","Climatic conditions; Durum wheat; Emmer wheat; Metabolic diversity; Phytosterols-phytostanols; T. polonicum; T. timopheevi; T. turgidum; Tetraploid wheats; Triticum carthlicum",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064640059

Control system complexity, calibration and validation effort has increased dramatically over the past decade. A trend that is likely to continue considering the next steps in emission and GHG emission legislation. Control-oriented engine models are valuable tools for efficient development of engine monitoring and control systems. Furthermore, these (predictive) engine models are more and more used as part of control algorithms to ensure legislation compliant and optimized performance over the system lifetime. For these engine models, it is essential that simulation and prediction of system variables during non-nominal engine operation, such as non-standard ambient conditions, is well captured. This paper presents the validation of a semi-empirical control-oriented diesel engine model for non-standard ambient conditions. Measurements on a Heavy-Duty Diesel engine for long haulage applications are performed using TNO's Climate Altitude Chamber. Inhere, ambient conditions are varied ranging from -15°C to + 30°C and ambient pressure ranging from 990 mbar (sea level) to 710 mbar (2500m altitude). Both steady-state and transient engine operation, using both type approval and real-world duty cycles, are considered. For the mentioned range of ambient conditions, the engine model is validated for key performance indicators, like manifold conditions, engine-out temperature, fuel consumption (CO2 emissions) and NOx emissions. The paper will end with a brief overview of possible (future) applications of the validated engine models and outlook to future work. © 2019 SAE International.

To overcome this challenge, this study determined the optimal inoculation strategy (complete premix/slurry application) for reusing solid digestate as inoculum and the optimal leachate circulation method (percolation/immersion) using batch digestion. Initially, percolation and immersion (1 h per 3 days) were compared and the result shows that immersing rice straw into leachate was superior to leachate percolation in methane production. Effect of the immersion period (24, 48 and 72 h) in each circulation cycle on methane production was then evaluated for each inoculation strategy. Methane production increased until the immersion period up to 24 h and then decreased, while the average cumulative methane yield with an immersion period of 24 h was (180 mL/g volatile solids).

MSW is a promising feedstock for bio-butanol production as it has a high lignocellulosic fibre content such as paper, wood, and food waste, about 50 wt% of a typical MSW stream. The study evaluates acetone, butanol, ethanol and hydrogen production from autoclaved municipal solid waste feedstock. Life cycle assessment is undertaken to evaluate the acetone, butanol, ethanol and hydrogen production process, considering cogeneration of heat and power from residual biogenic waste based on experimental data and process modelling. Acetone, butanol, and ethanol product yield can be achieved at 12.2 kg butanol, 1.5 kg ethanol, 5.7 kg acetone, and 0.9 kg hydrogen per tonne MSW. The product yield is relatively low compared to other lignocellulosic feedstocks primarily because of the lower hydrolysis yield (38% for glucose) achieved in this study; however, hydrolysis yields could be improved in future optimisation work. The conversion shows a net primary energy demand of −1.11 MJ/MJ liquid biofuels (butanol and ethanol) and net greenhouse gas emission of −12.57 g CO 2 eq/MJ liquid biofuels, achieving a greenhouse gas reduction of 115% compared to gasoline comparator. © 2019","ABE fermentation; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Life cycle assessment; Municipal solid waste; Waste autoclaving","Acetone; Biofuels; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Feedstocks; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen production; Life cycle; Wood; Abe fermentations; Co-generation of heat and power; Greenhouse gas reductions; Hydrogen production process; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Lignocellulosic feedstocks; Lignocellulosic fibres; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Municipal solid waste; acetone; alcohol; biofuel; butanol; gasoline; glucose; hydrogen; lignocellulose; biofuel; butanol; biofuel; enzyme; ethanol; fermentation; hydrolysis; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; waste treatment; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; distillation; energy conversion; environmental impact; fermentation; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; heat; hydrolysis; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; priority journal; process model; solid waste; United Kingdom; Acetone; Biofuels; Butanols; Ethanol; Fermentation; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063880804

With significant regional diversities in China, it is important to conduct the EE assessment at the regional level. Usually, the regional EE assessment is applied to 30 regions in Mainland China using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique. With the “Belt and Road” strategy initiated by the Chinese government, it is reasonable and necessary to take Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan into consideration. However, such data expansion for China’s regional EE assessment using DEA can reverse the relative rankings of some decision-making units, which is called the “rank reversal” phenomenon. In this paper, we illustrate in theory that rank reversal occurs in general DEA models, and apply the most popular five DEA models to assess China’s regional energy efficiency from 2000 to 2014. The empirical study shows that the 30 regions in Mainland China have the least rank reversal when Tone’s slack-based model (SBMT) is adopted. The main cause of ranking reversal is the addition of decision-making units lying on production frontier. Better understanding of the rank reversal phenomenon is critical for the energy efficiency assessment using DEA to inform the policy makings. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","China; Data envelopment analysis; Energy efficiency; Rank reversal","Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; China; Chinese Government; Data envelopment analysis technique; Decision making unit; Energy efficiency assessment; Energy-related emissions; Production frontier; Rank reversals; Energy efficiency; assessment method; data envelopment analysis; decision making; energy efficiency; policy making; ranking; China; Hong Kong; Macau; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054554093

Due to their high commercial value, several illegal practices of removal and commercialization have led to the verge of extinction. This study aimed to develop protocols for in vitro conservation under slow growth and acclimatization of species of the subfamily Epidendroideae (Orchidaceae), from the state of Sergipe, Brazil. Two experiments were conducted: the first one tested four concentrations of MS (MURASHIGE and SKOOG, 1962) (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%), three orchid species (Catasetum macrocarpum, Oeceoclades maculata, and Polystachya estrellensis), and two temperatures (18 and 25ºC); the second one tested three combinations of carbon sources and osmotic regulators (20 g L -1 sucrose; 10 g L -1 sucrose + 5 g L -1 de mannitol; 10 g L -1 sucrose + 5 g L -1 sorbitol) and the same three species and two temperatures. For the in vitro conservation of C. macrocarpum, O. maculata, and P. estrellensis over 450 days, the use of 25% of MS salts or 20 g.L -1 sucrose at 25ºC is recommended. C. macrocarpum seedlings were acclimatized using sand + shredded pine bark + worm castings at a ratio of 2:2:1 (w:w:w).

Notably, the Tropical-Andean region has a strong rainfall variability because of the confluence of many global climate processes altered by morphological features. An approach for a synthetical climate description is the use of global indicators and their regional teleconnections. However, typically this is carried out using filters and correlations, which results in seasonal and inter-annual teleconnections information, which are difficult to integrate into a modeling framework. A new methodology, based on rainfall signal extraction using dynamic-harmonic-regressions (DHR) and stochastic-multiple-linear-regressions (SMLR) between rainfall components and global signals for searching intra-annual and inter-annual teleconnections, is proposed. DHR gives non-stationary inter-annual trends and intra-annual quasi-periodic oscillations for monthly rainfall measurements. Time-variable amplitudes of quasi-periodical oscillations are crucial for finding intra-annual teleconnections using SMLR, while trends are better suited for the case of inter-annual ones. The methodology is tested over a Tropical-Andean region in southern Ecuador. The following results were obtained: (1) trans-Niño-Index (TNI) and Tropical-South-Atlantic signals are strongly connected to inter-annual and intra-annual time-scales. (2) However, TNI progressively weakens its relation with intra-annual components; meanwhile, El-Niño-Southern-Oscillation 3 gains ground for such time-scales. (3) Finally, an inter-annual connection with the North-Atlantic-Oscillation (NAO) is revealed. These results are consistent with previous literature, although the TNI and NAO connections are interesting findings, taking into account the differences in the connected scales. These results show the methodology’s capability of unraveling global teleconnections in different space and time scales using attributes embedded in an integral mathematical framework, which could be interesting for other purposes—such as the analysis of climate mechanisms or climate modeling. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","ENSO 3; Inter-annual-scales; Intra-annual-scales; North-Atlantic-Oscillation; Stochastic-multiple-linear-regressions; Trans-Niño-Index; Tropical-South-Atlantic","air-sea interaction; annual variation; climate modeling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global climate; North Atlantic Oscillation; rainfall; regression analysis; teleconnection; Andes; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (South)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052103836

Concomitantly, due to immigration, there is a growing number of ethnic minority individuals (African, Asian or Middle Eastern descent) living in westernised Higher Latitude Countries (HLC) (e.g. Europe, Canada, New Zealand). Of concern is the fact that there is already a clear vitamin D deficiency epidemic in HLC, a problem which is likely to grow as the ethnic minority population in these countries increases. This is because 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) status of ethnic groups is significantly lower compared to native populations. Environmental factors contribute to a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in HLC, particularly during the winter months when there is no sunlight of appropriate wavelength for vitamin D synthesis via the skin. Also, climatic factors such as cloud cover may reduce vitamin D status even in the summer. This may be further worsened by factors related to urban living, including air pollution, which reduces UVB exposure to the skin, and less occupational sun exposure (may vary by individual HLC). Tall building height may reduce sun exposure by making areas more shaded. In addition, there are ethnicity-specific factors which further worsen vitamin D status in HLC urban dwellers, such as low dietary intake of vitamin D from foods, lower production of vitamin D in the skin due to increased melanin and reduced skin exposure to UVB due to cultural dress style and sun avoidance. A multidisciplinary approach applying knowledge from engineering, skin photobiology, nutrition, town planning and social science is required to prevent vitamin D deficiency in urban areas. Such an approach could include reduction of air pollution, modification of sun exposure advice to emphasise spending time each day in non-shaded urban areas (e.g. parks, away from tall buildings), and advice to ethnic minority groups to increase sun exposure, take vitamin D supplements and/or increase consumption of vitamin D rich foods in a way that is safe and culturally acceptable. This review hopes to stimulate further research to assess the impact of high latitude, urban environment and ethnicity on the risk of vitamin D deficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","25(OH)D; 25-Hydroxyvitamin D; Ethnicity; Latitude; Rural; Urban","25 hydroxyvitamin D; ozone; 25-hydroxyvitamin D; vitamin D; air pollution; altitude; built environment; cloud; cultural factor; diet therapy; ethnicity; heredity; human; latitude; Review; risk factor; rural area; season; skin pigmentation; sun exposure; urban area; vitamin D deficiency; vitamin metabolism; vitamin supplementation; analogs and derivatives; blood; lifestyle; sunlight; ultraviolet radiation; urban population; vitamin D deficiency; Air Pollution; Altitude; Humans; Life Style; Seasons; Skin Pigmentation; Sunlight; Ultraviolet Rays; Urban Population; Vitamin D; Vitamin D Deficiency",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059894042

More specifically, the demand for heat drives much of the demand for energy and fossil fuels in the industrial sector. We conduct a top-down analysis to characterize historical energy and fossil fuel use in 14 top-GHG-emitting industries in the United States, their heat demand requirements, and the potential to substitute heat from geothermal, solar thermal (including concentrating technologies), and small modular nuclear reactors to meet these needs while reducing fossil-fuel use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We base this analysis on publicly-available facility-level GHG emissions and fuel-combustion data, in addition to assumed requirements for process temperature, to demonstrate the potential value to industry energy analysts of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program data. We estimate on a county level that the adoption of these alternative heat sources could have reduced 2015 fossil-fuel use by approximately 31% and combustion GHG emissions by approximately 24%. The most extensive substitution opportunities are in the ethyl alcohol manufacturing and wet corn-milling industries; petroleum refining represents the largest absolute emissions mitigation potential. This initial top-down analysis of substitution potential does not consider more detailed technical factors, including resource availability that will influence the actual deployment of alternative energy technologies. The analysis also does not consider the economic or market factors, including the expected cost to build and operate these generators. We do assume process byproducts that are extensively used for combustion fuels would not be good candidates for substitution for alternative energy generators. Based on these caveats, our analysis could be considered a top-range estimate for this mix of heat generators and industry heat demands. Any subsequent analysis of these alternate energy sources should increase the level of technical, economic, and policy detail. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emissions; Industry; Manufacturing; Thermal energy","Combustion; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Electric equipment protection; Environmental Protection Agency; Factor analysis; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Gas fuel analysis; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Industry; Manufacture; Nuclear reactors; Particulate emissions; Petroleum refining; Thermal energy; Alternate energy sources; Alternative energy technologies; Concentrating technology; Emissions mitigation; Greenhouse gas reporting; Resource availability; Small modular nuclear reactors; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Geothermal energy; alternative energy; data set; demand analysis; energy resource; ethanol; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; heat source; industrial emission; manufacturing; market conditions; resource availability; technological change; thermal power; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061260169

Model experiments run with the Pothole Complex Hydrologic Model using downscaled climate data (variables relating to precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration at 1/8° spatial resolution under four general circulation climate models and two gas emissions scenarios) were used to forecast the abundances of six focal wetland-dependent bird species in the Missouri Coteau portion of the PPR, providing ensemble scenarios at a spatial scale relevant to resource management. Although the projected number of May ponds (waterbodies present during bird breeding season) fluctuated through time with some decadal periodicity (and with the number present in a given year reflecting abundance over the previous three years), the ensemble model average indicated an increase in the average number of waterbodies present by the turn of the next century. Overall, the model experiments conservatively projected an 11.75% increase in the number of waterbodies present by 2090–2099 compared to a baseline period from 1967 to 2005 in the PPR. Wetland-dependent bird occurrence and abundance were significantly associated with temporal patterns and decadal periodicity in waterbody dynamics. Because of the strong associations between wetland-dependent bird occurrence and abundance and the number of prairie potholes, projected waterbody increases are forecasted to result in an 11.97% overall increase in occurrence and 8.63% increase in abundance of the six focal species by the end of the 21st century; these results contrast with forecasted drought-associated declines in waterbodies and birds in the PPR. This integrated hydrological–climatological approach offers a means of assessing how wetland-dependent bird populations may respond to changes in wetland habitat availability due to a changing climate. Our results provide information that can help managers decide how to mitigate the effects of climate shifts on the distribution of wetland habitat and biota. © 2019 The Authors.","downscaled model; forecasting; Pothole Complex Hydrologic Model; Prairie Pothole Region; time-series analyses; waterbodies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065015096

For nearly 60 years, the ATS has provided the basis for peaceful use of the Antarctica and facilitated international cooperation on scientific research on the continent. The ATS now faces several new challenges largely driven by global environmental change from human activities carried out outside the region. Most prominently, human-induced climate change is impacting the Antarctic cryosphere and marine ecosystems of the Southern Ocean and increasing the scope of human activities in these areas. A key challenge for Antarctic governance will be managing regime interaction between the ATS and the growing number of environmental, resource management and wider regimes operating in the region. Given this institutional complexity, we argue that the concept of an ‘Antarctic regime complex' provides useful insights for understanding interaction between the ATS and other institutions operating within the region. Finally, we conclude that the ATS will likely require a new level of institutional resilience in interacting other regimes within the Antarctic regime complex, as it continues to perform a key role in shaping governance of the region. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063190527

The estimated δ13CPI values and measured δ13CG.bulloidesTC values from the core tops are higher than the modern values due to the Suess Effect. However, there is poor agreement between the δ13CPI values and core top δ13CG.bulloidesTC values south of 40°S as the back-calculation approach using chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11) method for removing the anthropogenic δ13C is not effective at these higher southern latitudes.

The climate of the Altai region in Russia is sharply continental and characterized by dry air and significant weather variability, both in individual seasons and years. The current study is determined by the lack of detailed area-related analytical generalizations for the territory of the Altai region over the past 30 years. Most of the published data dealing with an integrated analysis of the agro-climatic conditions in the Altai region date back to the late 1960s and early 1970s; in most cases, this data is from climate reference-books based on the generalized data from the first half of the 20th century. To make accurate forecasts and to efficiently manage agricultural production in the Altai region, area-related data on the state and dynamics of agro-climatic changes have been analysed. The results reveal that in the period between 1964 and 2017, significant climatic changes occurred in the territory of the Altai region. These climatic changes affected the growing season length, which increased due to a shift in the dates of the air temperature transition above 10 °C, to earlier dates in spring and to later dates in autumn. Furthermore, the current study also revealed that the foothills of the Altai Mountains are the most moistened parts of the region and the Kulunda lowland is the most arid part. In the Altai region, the accumulated temperatures and amounts of precipitation during the growing season increased significantly, and the values of integrated coefficients and indices that reflect the moisture supply conditions for the territory also changed significantly. Based upon the results, a schematic map of the current precipitation distribution on the Altai region’s territory has been generated. These results and this map may be used to conduct more detailed studies in the field of agro-climatology and to update the current borders of agro-climatic areas and revision of the agro-climatic zonation scheme. © 2019 by the authors.

However, establishment of FREL relies heavily on the accurate estimates of carbon stock as one of the input variable for computation of the emission factors (EFs). The product of an EF and activity data, such as the area of deforestation, results in the total emissions needed for establishment of FREL. This study presents the carbon stock estimates for different land cover classes based on an analysis of Tanzania's national forest inventory data generated through the National Forest Resources Monitoring and Assessment (NAFORMA). Results: Carbon stocks were estimated in three carbon pools, namely aboveground, belowground, and deadwood for each of the three land cover classes (i.e. Forest, non-forest, and wetland). The weighted average carbon stock was 33.35 t C ha-1 for forest land, 4.28 t ha-1 for wetland and 5.81 t ha-1 for non-forest land. The uncertainty values were 0.9% for forest land, 11.3% for wetland and 1.8% for non-forest land. Average carbon stocks for land cover sub-classes, which make up the above mentioned major land cover classes, are also presented in our study. Conclusions: The values presented in this paper correspond to IPCC tier 3 and can be used for carbon estimation at the national scale for the respective major primary vegetation type for various purposes including REDD+. However, if local based estimates values are needed, the use of auxiliary data to enhance the precision of the area of interest is recommended. © 2019 The Author(s).","Carbon stock; Emission factor; FREL; REDD+; Uncertainty","carbon emission; carbon sequestration; deforestation; environmental economics; forest inventory; land cover; uncertainty analysis; vegetation type; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064994426

This high rate of emission is released in highly populated areas where diesel driven internal combustion engines are running in inefficient operating ranges. Except the propulsion, the internal combustion engine is powering the auxiliary devices such as refrigerator unit, etc. The auxiliary units are significant contributor to the overall pollutant production. In this paper the auxiliary load power supply for refrigerator unit is shifted from internal combustion engine to PEM fuel cell. The decrease in CO2 accumulated emissions was estimated by simulation model containing vehicle model (tire, brake, differential, gearbox and driver model), diesel engine model and auxiliary power demand model. Four stroke diesel engine was modeled and investigated. For this investigation the fully filled truck was used for simulating 100% weight load. The gross weight is 7500 kg. The novelty of the approach is the simulation performed on realistic combination of city and urban road cycle. The focus was on modelling the realistic truck driving cycle in order to correctly predict emission and fuel consumption reduction. Since initial investigation are performed on constant load demand of fuel cell, simplified model of PEMFC was applied. PEM fuel cell stack was designed in order to meet the demands of auxiliary consumers. The H2 consumption and size of hydrogen tank was estimated based on assumed 8-h daily drive. Finally, the migration of power supply for auxiliary units on commercial vehicle from internal combustion engine showed potential of fuel savings and CO2 reduction of up to 9% for a given case on this specific test cycle. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Commercial vehicle; PEM fuel cell; Realistic cycle simulation","Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Combustion equipment; Diesel engines; Fuel economy; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Refrigerators; Roads and streets; Trucks; Auxiliary device; Cycle simulation; Four stroke diesel engines; Fuel consumption reduction; Operating ranges; PEM fuel cell; PEM fuel cell stack; Pollutant production; Commercial vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059627126

Some studies have looked at the effects of climate change on labor productivity and gross domestic product, yet they have not considered the interaction between socioeconomic and climate systems. This study therefore examined that aspect as well as the economic impact of climate-change-induced labor productivity change. Business-as-usual and two emissions reduction scenarios—2°C and Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5—were adopted. Data analysis employed a computable general equilibrium model and a simple climate model. The results show that global economic impacts of climate-change-induced labor productivity change have not been large. A negative effect on economic activities was found when the relationship between climate change and labor productivity was considered in the economic model. Although such impacts were larger in the business-as-usual scenario, that was not the case in the 2 °C scenario. The results suggest that greater levels of climate change are in accordance with greater socioeconomic impact at the global level. In particular, impact on high-temperature regions was found to be considerable. Interestingly, not all regions experienced economic loss from climate change. Some in the low- to medium-temperature zones received a positive economic effect because of comparative advantage caused by differences in labor productivity changes among regions. The coupled modeling scheme ultimately was effective in evaluating the interaction. Expanded assessment of climate change, mitigation, and adaptation will aid further understanding of the interaction of climate change and socioeconomic activities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Economic activities; Energy supply; Gross domestic product; Labor productivity; Model interactions","Climate models; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Losses; Productivity; Economic activities; Energy supplies; Gross domestic products; Labor productivity; Model interaction; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058707738

The cumulative acoustic energy released during such a process seems to generally follow a power law form, which is compatible with the view that the fracturing process is a phenomenon with developing critical dynamics. In the present work, the cumulative energy released by the AE signals emitted during the deformation of LiF samples has been calculated and fitted by two different fitting functions, which are both power laws decorated with log-periodic corrections. The comparison of the produced results would lead to the conclusion of whether each one of the two equations can produce valid acoustic energy release modeling, which can describe the fracturing procedure of solid materials and its underlying mechanics. It should be noted that one of the models managed to fit the experimental data more accurately in the majority of the cases studied. We show that both of the studied log-periodic models managed to acceptably fit the data, which means that this field of study could possible lead to new methods of predicting the time point of a material's failure. In conclusion, this comparative study reveals that these models could be a valuable tool in cases of monitoring materials or structures being under load at the region of their mechanical tolerance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Acoustic emissions – AE; Laboratory experiments; Log-periodic power law; Microfracturing","Deformation; Fits and tolerances; Fracture; Lithium compounds; Acoustic emission signal; Comparative studies; Deformation of solids; Fracturing process; Laboratory experiments; Log-periodic power law; Mechanical tolerances; Microfracturing; Acoustic emission testing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046170480

Here, we investigate the mechanisms behind climate change effects on the reproductive traits of highly mobile, West Australian bird taxa, the forest red-tailed black cockatoo Calyptorhynchus banksii naso (FRTBC). Using a dataset of annual breeding frequency spanning 19 yr, in combination with hydrological, climatological, and remotely sensed data, we modeled the effects of environmental variation on the annual breeding frequency of FRTBCs. We found several significant relationships between annual breeding frequency of FRTBCs and environmental variation. While the model, which included a proxy for the availability of the cockatoo's primary food source and the previous season's rain, explained 49% of annual breeding frequency, there were also direct and indirect effects of heatwaves and forest productivity. Forest red-tailed black cockatoo breeding appears to be linked to the spatiotemporal availability of its primary food sources, the fruit from the tree species, marri Corymbia calophylla and jarrah Eucalyptus marginata. However, Western Australia is experiencing significant climate change, with increases in temperature and declines in rainfall altering the phenologies of these species, while declining rainfall is affecting the vegetation structure of the region. As drought events and temperatures are anticipated to increase over the region, it is expected that the food resources during the breeding season for cockatoos will become increasingly limited in time and space, thus threatening the persistence of this iconic species. This scenario is likely to be representative of many other situations where wide-ranging species rely on patchy food resources in a changing environment. As global biodiversity is increasingly threatened, this study presents timely evidence illustrating how climate change is affecting the persistence of a threatened, mobile species, and what the implications are for mobile species around the world. © 2019 The Authors.","climate change; ecological modeling; heatwaves; hydrology; mobile species; remote sensing; reproductive behavior",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065039290

Low-energy housing, e.g. whole house retrofits and zero-energy new houses, is still rare in the United Kingdom, yet very much required to reduce emissions. This paper contributes to research on low-energy housing by adding new empirical material through analysing how specific drivers linked to knowledge, public policy and intermediary actors can influence successful projects. Based on in-depth case study research of both existing and new built low-energy housing projects in Brighton, United Kingdom (UK), we show that in addition to motivations to improve existing housing conditions, knowledge and available skills of householders and project participants, and both local and national policies, drive such projects. We also find that intermediaries inspire projects, connect different actors and facilitate learning between projects. Intermediaries are important for advancing projects through local actors and knowledge-networks, especially at a time when national policy support for low-energy housing remains limited and a wider transition to low-energy housing is not complete. © 2019","Buildings; Energy efficiency; Housing; Intermediaries; Low-energy; Retrofit","Buildings; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Housing; Retrofitting; Case study research; Intermediaries; Knowledge networks; Low energy housing; Low-energy; National policies; Project participants; Retrofit; Low power electronics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060930232

Selective excitation of a naphthalenediimide radical anion (NDIâ€¢-) covalently linked at the 4-, 5-, or 6-positions of the bipyridine (bpy) in the Re(bpy)(CO)3X (X = Cl or pyridine) carbon dioxide reduction catalyst results in electron transfer from 2NDIâ€¢- to Re(bpy)(CO)3X to form Re(bpyâ€¢-)(CO)3X, the first intermediate in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Femtosecond UV/vis, near-IR, and mid-IR spectroscopy on these constitutional isomers and a set of appropriate reference molecules show that systematically varying the electronic coupling as well as the reaction free energy increases the lifetime of Re(bpyâ€¢-)(CO)3X by an order of magnitude when the NDI chromophore is attached to the 6-position of bpy.

Forest management policies, such as assisted migration, may help forests to adapt their species distribution to changing climate conditions. Nonetheless, it certainly requires a better knowledge of climate influences on trees to ensure the success of specific management actions. In this study, we apply dendroclimatological methods to investigate the growth response of the main forest species present in Moncayo Natural Park to climate to assess their current relationship and to model these responses over the potential distribution of each species across the study area. Our results revealed large differences in the response of beech, pine and Pyrenean oak to prevailing climate factors and indicated species-specific patterns of climate sensitivity. The general importance of summer conditions for tree growth was confirmed. In addition, we found directional trends in correlation with specific climate factors along spatial gradients; these results are consistent with the autoecology of the studied species. Based on these findings, we present a new model approach that can serve as a key tool for forest managers to design forest communities that are more stable during climatic change. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate; Dendrochronology; Forest management; GAMs; Tree growth","climate change; climate effect; dendroclimatology; forest management; growth modeling; growth response; spatial distribution; Sierra del Moncayo; Spain; Fagus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060719612

Although several programs aiming at fuelling climate change mitigation have been adopted internationally in the last decades and localized improvements have been observed, the results expected by international institutions are regrettably still out of reach. Meanwhile, societies have experienced a significant proliferation of community-based initiatives (CBIs) fostering sustainable societal transition through different practices. Some studies claim that bottom-up activities may address sustainability issues more efficiently than top-down policies when appropriately scaled up. However, these are based mostly on anecdotal local evidence, and a systematic evaluation of the extent of CBIs’ potential contribution to climate change mitigation action at a larger scale has never been investigated. This paper elaborates a scaling-up exercise for CBIs’ carbon reduction at a broader scale and presents results about potential implications for European countries. Our findings suggest that, although varying greatly among countries, CBIs’ contribution to reach GHG reduction targets at the European scale can be important. However, a carbon reduction of such magnitude requires a substantial societal engagement in sustainable activities. Although societies cannot rely solely on the scaling-up of lifestyle changes promoted by CBIs to fulfill future environmental targets, policy makers should not neglect the large potential of societal engagement and should try to facilitate synergies between CBIs, industries, and institutions in developing climate change mitigation action. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change mitigation; Community-based initiatives; GHG; Sustainable development goals; Sustainable societal transition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061272036

In order to achieve this, Mexico has undergone extreme institutional and legal reforms, opening up fields for private participants, encouraging investment and reforming the governance framework. This article analyses the post-reform changes in light of Nelson's criteria of state intervention, concluding that while Mexico has shifted from an autocratic form of participatory intervention to a form akin to that of Norway, there are further reforms necessary in order for the development of Mexico's petroleum resources to achieve the goals of optimizing income and contributing to the long-term development of the Mexico. Such reforms include legislative reform of the Hydrocarbons Law 2014 to include mandatory field optimization, akin to section 4-1 of the Norwegian Petroleum Activities Act, and a legal requirement for development to aid the Mexican industrial sector and stimulate industrial and economic development, which will significantly contribute to the long-term development of the Mexican nation. Furthermore, the article concludes that although the current Mexican governance framework is capable of delivering the goals of optimization of revenue and long-term development of Mexico, the success will depend on political stability, consensus and a reduction in corruption, which present major challenges to Mexico. © The Author(s) 2019.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072402771

The powdery dust got into everything, abrading spacesuit fabric, clogging seals and other critical equipment. Even inside the lunar module, Apollo astronauts were exposed to this dust after they removed their dust coated spacesuits. The lunar dust is comprised of fine particles, with electric charges imparted by solar winds and ultraviolet radiation. As such, it adheres readily, and easily penetrates through the smallest crevices into mechanisms. While efforts are under way to figure out how to return astronauts to the Moon and set up habitats for long duration missions, the issue of lunar dust remains relevant. Consequently, NASA has identified dust as a critical environmental challenge to overcome for future planetary surface missions characterized by dusty environments. Several concepts were successfully investigated by the international research community for preventing deposition of lunar dust on rigid surfaces (ex: solar cells and thermal radiators). However, applying these technologies for flexible surfaces and specifically to spacesuits has remained an open challenge, due to the complexity of the suit design, geometry, and dynamics. In our research, we developed a SPacesuit Integrated Carbon nanotube Dust Ejection/Removal (SPIcDER) system to protect spacesuits and other flexible surfaces from lunar dust. SPIcDER leverages the efficient Electrodynamic Dust Shield concept developed at NASA for use on solar cells. It is customized for dust mitigation on flexible surfaces, using novel materials and specialized design techniques. The result is a self-cleaning spacesuit that can repel lunar dust. This paper provides an overview of the SPIcDER system and showcases our working prototypes, ranging from coupons to a scaled portion of a lunar spacesuit segment. The design is supported by parametric analysis in ANSYS Maxwell for optimizing SPIcDER integration into the spacesuit outerlayer. The paper emphasizes design considerations for astronaut safety, based on analysis and experimental results. The SPIcDER system can be optimized efficiently for potential missions to Mars and asteroids, as well as for Earth based applications. © 2018","Active and passive spacesuit dust removal; CNT fiber in spacesuits; Lunar dust; Spacesuit dust mitigation","Carbon nanotubes; Manned space flight; Moon; Nanostructured materials; NASA; Solar cells; Spacecraft equipment; Yarn; Carbon nanotube technology; CNT fibers; Dust mitigation; Dust removal; Environmental challenges; International researches; Lunar dust; Planetary surface missions; Dust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059197483

Use of topology optimization methods to increase piston surface temperatures is a promising approach to solve this challenge, but existing applications have focused largely on basic small-scale canonical scenarios in the steady-state. In this work an algorithm was developed and demonstrated which is aimed at optimizing the internal structure of an engine piston to increase piston surface temperatures during the early phases of engine cold start, while subjected to a peak temperature limit during hot steady-state conditions. Finite difference heat transfer models of a light duty aluminum engine piston were created and an evolutionary optimization algorithm in conjunction with the Lagrange Multiplier Method were used to develop optimal piston topologies. Overall the methods developed represent a unique successful application of topology optimization techniques to an unsteady thermal system at a practical scale. Various optimal designs were generated and common geometric traits between them were identified, providing insight for future piston designs. The relationship between mean piston surface temperature after one minute of cold operation and maximum piston temperature during hot steady-state operation was quantified, defining optimal design limits and quantifying the trade-off between the two temperatures. © 2019 SAE International.

One of the ways to reduce the harmful emissions is to use renewable energy sources. Biodiesel, being one of the less environment-damaging options to fuel diesel engines, is making its way globally as a greener portion of diesel engines emissions. For countries where utilization of high technological energy sources is a real challenge, then vegetable oils and waste oils from local sources are the possible option. This greener fuel has been mandated of its usage in many countries across the continents in a blending range up to 20% with petro-diesel. The concept of biorefinery is a must as to make the biodiesel industry viable, and to gauge its practicability, Biorefinery Complexity Index (BCI) is a way to go.

Whether exposure to PM2.5 and ozone is associated with patients' health status and quality of life is unknown. We used data from 2 prospective myocardial infarction (MI) registries to assess the relationship between long-term PM2.5 and ozone exposure with health status outcomes 1 year after an MI. Methods and Results: TRIUMPH (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction) and PREMIER (Prospective Registry Evaluating Myocardial Infarction: Events and Recovery) enrolled patients presenting with MI at 31 US hospitals between 2003 and 2008. One year later, patients were assessed with the disease-specific Seattle Angina Questionnaire, and 5-year mortality was assessed with the Centers for Disease Control's National Death Index. Individual patients' exposures to PM2.5 and ozone over the year after their MI were estimated from the Environment Protection Agency's Fused Air Quality Surface Using Downscaling tool that integrates monitoring station data and atmospheric models to predict daily air pollution exposure at the census tract level. We assessed the association of exposure to ozone and PM2.5 with 1-year health status and mortality over 5 years using regression models adjusting for age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, date of enrollment, and comorbidities. In completely adjusted models, higher PM2.5 and ozone exposure were independently associated with poorer Seattle Angina Questionnaire summary scores at 1-year (β estimate per +1 SD increase =-0.8 [95% CI, -1.4 to -0.3; P=0.002] for PM2.5 and -0.9 [95% CI, -1.3 to -0.4; P&lt;0.001] for ozone). Moreover, higher PM2.5 exposure, but not ozone, was independently associated with greater mortality risk (hazard ratio =1.13 per +1 SD [95% CI, 1.07-1.20; P&lt;0.001]). Conclusions: In our study, greater exposure to PM2.5 and ozone was associated with poorer 1-year health status following an MI, and PM2.5 was associated with increased risk of 5-year death. © 2019 American Heart Association, Inc.","comorbidities; myocardial infarction; ozone; particulate matter; quality of life","ozone; ozone; adult; air pollutant; air quality; all cause mortality; angina pectoris; Article; cardiovascular mortality; comorbidity; disease association; female; follow up; Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events; health status; heart infarction; human; long term exposure; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality risk; outcome assessment; particulate matter; population; priority journal; Short Form 12; social status; adverse event; aged; cause of death; clinical trial; comparative study; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; exposure; health status; heart infarction; mortality; multicenter study; particulate matter; prognosis; register; risk assessment; risk factor; time factor; United States; Aged; Air Pollutants; Cause of Death; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Health Status; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Prognosis; Registries; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064312451

The hierarchy of green transportation puts cyclists and pedestrians first because of its low cost, space efficiency, and zero environmental impact; followed by public transit because of its shared passenger-transport service, thereby helping in reduction of an individual's carbon footprint. The government has therefore, aimed at constant development of the public transport system in the country for better connectivity and to promote a healthier lifestyle. The expansion of this sector will lead to construction of new transportation hubs to support it. Research on efficient planning for these public transit hubs is relatively underdeveloped. Buses act as the highest acceptable mode of public transportation in India, this paper aims at Efficient planning techniques for the construction of infrastructure supporting public transportation and to promote non-motorized transit modes. The outcome of this study would be utilized by the researchers to have an idea as to how the aspect like planning of green design will cause a difference in the society not only economically and socially but also environmentally and also moving towards a green development path. © BEIESP.","India; Planning; Public transportation; Transit hubs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067058097

Study focus: Human activities and consequent pollution have put the freshwater and marine ecosystems of the Mediterranean region under pressure, with high risk of eutrophication phenomena. In this study, an extended version of the Geospatial Regression Equation for European Nutrient losses model (GREEN), originally developed for estimating nutrient loads from diffuse and point sources in Europe, was extended to include additional nutrient sources using a grid cell discretization. The spatial resolution is 5 arc minute and the model inputs consist of the latest and best available global data. New hydrological insights for the region: The results of this study show that during 2003–2007 (baseline), 1.87 Tg/y of total nitrogen (TN), 1.22 Tg/y of nitrates (N-NO 3 ), 0.11 Tg/y of total phosphorus (TP) and 0.03 Tg/y of orthophosphate (P-PO 4 ) were discharged in the Mediterranean Sea. The source apportionment analysis showed that the main contributor to total nitrogen and nitrate loads is agriculture followed by natural background, while for orthophosphate dominant sources include wastewater and scattered dwellings. Two scenarios were investigated to assess sustainable water and nutrient management options, showing that the reduction of 50% of nitrogen surplus leads to a significant reduction of nitrogen emission in regions characterized by high intensity agriculture, while the upgrading of wastewater treatment plants to tertiary level was more efficient for TP reduction. © 2019 The Authors","Diffuse and point sources; Mediterranean Sea; Modelling; Nutrients; Source apportionment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062341425

Electrical energy required to run these units plays a major role in it. In the present work, feasibility of penetrating biomass renewable energy in power supply system of a cement manufacturing plant in India has been analysed. For this, three hybrid systems, i.e. biomass–grid, PV–biomass–grid and PV–biomass–battery, have been modelled and simulated using HOMER tool for supplying power to selected plant loads presently run by state grid. Lowest cost of energy (COE), net present cost (NPC) and pollutant emissions were taken as the criteria of selecting feasible system configuration. It was found that biomass–grid system has lowest COE and NPC of $0.0694/kWh and $10,597,290, respectively, but the system comprising PV–biomass–battery emits lowest pollutants at highest COE and NPC. Implementation of biomass–grid system ensures annual saving of $184,736.3 with capital cost payback period of 4.84 years along with reduction of pollutant emissions by 88.22% as against present scenario of only-grid supply system. A sensitivity analysis was performed for variations in real discount rate and rice husk prices. It was found that the system becomes a financially feasible option for real discount rate of 0.98% and rice husk price of $2.96/tonne. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Biomass; Cement plant; Cost; Feasibility; PV","alternative energy; biomass; capital; cost analysis; discount rate; emission control; energy efficiency; feasibility study; fuel cell; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; pollutant; power plant; sustainability; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036559546

Most existing bias correction techniques (i) only focus on the bias in the mean value or on the extreme values separately, and (ii) exclude zero values from analysis, even though their presence is significant in daily precipitation. We developed a copula-based bias correction scheme that is suitable for zero-inflated daily precipitation data to correct the bias in mean as well as in extreme precipitation at any specific statistical quantile. In considering the whole of Germany as a test bed, the proposed scheme is found to work well across the entire study area, including the German Alpine regions. The joint distribution between observed and regional climate model (RCM)-derived precipitation is developed through copulas. In particular, the joint distribution is modified to make it discrete at zero in order to account for zero values. The benefit of considering zero precipitation values is revealed through the improved performance of bias correction both in the mean and extreme values. Second, the quantile that best captures the bias (whether in the mean or any extreme value) is determined for a specific location and varies spatially and seasonally. This relaxation in selecting the location-specific optimal quantile renders the proposed methodology spatially transferable. By acknowledging possible changes in extreme precipitation due to climate change, the proposed scheme is expected to be suitable for climate change impact assessments for extreme events worldwide. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.","Bias; Climate change; Extreme events","climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; extreme event; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064730784

This article assesses sustainable biomass export potential from Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Kenya, Ukraine, and the United States by applying a number of sustainability criteria. Only biomass types with the highest potential are selected, to take advantage of economies of scale, e.g. pulpwood, wood waste, and residues in the United States, and agricultural residues in Ukraine. This study found that, except for the United States, pellet markets in the sourcing regions are largely undeveloped. The export potential depends strongly on pellet mill capacity and assumed growth rates in the pellet industry. Results show that the United States, Ukraine, Indonesia, and Brazil offer the highest biomass export potential. In the Business As Usual 2030 scenario, up to 204 PJ could potentially be mobilized; in the High Export scenario this could increase to 1423 PJ, with 89% of the potential being available for costs ranging from 6.4 to 15 €/GJ. These potentials meet the European Commission requirements for a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions set in the Renewable Energy Directive. The total export potentials do not reflect the net possible import potentials to the European Union, as biomass could be imported to other countries where there is a demand for it, where less strict sustainability requirements are applied, and which are proximate to the sourcing regions, notably South Korea, Japan, and China. © 2018 The Authors.

In order to understand the sources and formation processes of aliphatic carbonyl compounds, the concentrations of saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons and carbonyl compounds were determined in the PM2.5 from an urban area of Beijing sampled in November–December 2016 and analysed using two dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS). The data were separated into non-haze and haze days (PM2.5 ≥ 75 μg m−3). n-Alkanes (C10-C36) and n-alkenes (C12-C26) were abundant in the samples during the sampling campaign regardless of non-haze and haze conditions, and the middle chain length n–alkanes (C25–C34) were the most abundant. Aliphatic carbonyls, specifically n-alkanals (C8-C29), n-alkan-2-ones (C8-C31) and n-alkan-3-ones (C8-C30) were also detected in the PM2.5 at concentrations much lower than n-alkanes. The n-alkanals were the most abundant compounds amongst the aliphatic carbonyls, accounting for 65.4% on average of the total mass of aliphatic carbonyls. For the non-haze days, it seems likely that the OH oxidation of n-alkanes was a source of carbonyl compounds, whereas vehicle exhaust makes a significant contribution to the n-alkanes and n-alkanals, but makes a much smaller contribution to the n-alkan-2-ones and n-alkan-3-ones. It appears that primary sources are likely to be a major contributor to concentrations of the high molecular weight carbonyl compounds during the haze episodes, probably deriving from coal combustion. In addition, furanones (γ-lactones) and phytone (6, 10, 14-trimethylpentadecan-2-one) were also detected in our samples and are oxidation products of hydrocarbons and a marker of biogenic input, respectively.

Policy-makers have formulated ecological protection measures to facilitate sustainable development. However, traditional conservation planning mainly focuses on protecting specific green spaces, with limited consideration of the connectivity among green spaces from a habitat network perspective. Using citizen science data and occupancy modelling, we predicted habitat suitability, built habitat networks and identified key habitat patches based on their contribution to the functional connectivity of the habitat network for three focal water, forest, and open-habitat bird species. Based on the habitat requirement, small waterbodies and intermediate forest and open-habitat cover facilitate preserving water, forest and open-habitat birds. In regards to the network analysis, we found that key habitat patches with a high conservation priority were generally characterized by a relatively large patch size and/or located at critical positions in the habitat network (at central positions in the habitat network, or near large patches). We suggest that key habitat patches in restricted built-up areas are converted to protected areas or are kept as cropland under future urban planning. We emphasize the usefulness of the focal species concept in urban biodiversity conservation. Our study offers conservation recommendations from a habitat network perspective for urban planners to safeguard urban biodiversity and ecosystem health. © 2019 by the authors.","Focal species; Forest birds; Habitat suitability; Occupancy model; Open-habitat birds; Restricted built-up areas; Urban ecological planning; Water birds","biodiversity; bird; connectivity; conservation management; conservation planning; ecological modeling; environmental protection; forest ecosystem; greenspace; habitat structure; policy making; prioritization; sustainable development; urban planning; urbanization; waterfowl; Beijing [China]; China; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064082138

Road pricing, is not only effective for urban transportation management, but also helpful in reducing the negative externalities caused by transportation. In this study, an inexact two-phase minimal emission programming (TMEP) model is proposed for design of the environment-friendly toll scheme with an acceptable road network performance. Through introduction of fuzzy stochastic programming, multiple uncertainties involved in vehicle emission evaluation are dealt with; the Traffic Performance Index (TPI) based constraints are incorporated to reflect the decision-maker's requirements for network congestion management. The solution method is proposed for generating the range of fuzzy stochastic objectives. An optimal toll scheme associated with the minimal emission based flow pattern is obtained through searching for a set of the best and the worst optimal solutions. A numerical experiment and a real-world road network in Beijing of China are used to illustrate the application of the developed method. In the case study, the toll scheme is obtained at the desired congestion level. The effects of emission and congestion abatement are analyzed under different policy scenarios. The proposed TMEP method can generate the toll scheme with obvious improvements in total emission reduction and congestion mitigation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Emission uncertainty; Fuzzy-random variable; Road pricing; Traffic performance index","design; emission control; experiment; fuzzy mathematics; heuristics; index method; road pricing; road transport; stochasticity; traffic congestion; traffic emission; uncertainty analysis; urban transport; air pollution control; article; China; stochastic model; uncertainty; exhaust gas; heuristics; uncertainty; Beijing [China]; China; Beijing; China; Heuristics; Uncertainty; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061674418

Air quality was assessed using 24-hr fine-particulate matter (PM2.5) samples collected from two sites, Korangi (industrial/residential) and Tibet Center (commercial/residential). Spatial and temporal characteristics and sources of pollution were evaluated from August 2008 through August 2009 using samples analyzed for PM2.5, black carbon (BC), trace elements, and water-soluble ions. Elemental enrichment factors (EFs) and a receptor model/positive matrix factorization (PMF), were used to delineate the anthropogenic and natural sources. The mean 24-hr PM2.5 was 101 ± 45.6 μg m−3 at Korangi and 76.5 ± 38.4 μg m−3 at Tibet Center. Every 24-hr sample analyzed from both sites exceeded the WHO 24-hr guideline value of 25 μg m−3. Average PM2.5 levels were higher during winter, suggesting increased combustion activity and decreased air dispersion. EFs suggest significant contributions of trace elements from anthropogenic activities. Air pollution levels were higher at the Korangi site than Tibet Center, highlighting major contributions from industrial activities near the site. From PMF analysis, five sources and their relative contributions were determined at Korangi and Tibet Center, respectively: 1) oil combustion (25% and 21%); 2) soil and urban dust resuspension (28% and 25%); 3) vehicular emissions (23% and 5%); 4) sea spray (13% and 26%); and 5) industrial emissions (11% and 23%).

Evaluating and analysing the spatial distribution of carbon emissions are the foundations of low-carbon city development and carbon emissions reduction. In this study, carbon emission inventory was first constructed and carbon emissions in Wuhan were estimated on the basis of energy consumption. Second, the spatial distribution models of carbon emissions in different sectors were developed on the basis of the census of the Wuhan geographical conditions data and other thematic data. Third, the carbon emission distribution inWuhan was analyzed at the central urban, functional, new urban, built-up, and metropolitan development area scale. Results show that the industry sector emits most of the carbon emissions in Wuhan, followed by the residential population. Carbon emissions in the metropolitan development area can stand for the true carbon emissions in Wuhan. Thus, a geographically weighted (GW) model was adopted to analyze the correlation coefficients between economical-social factors (gross domestic product, population density, road density, industrial land and residential land) and carbon emissions in the metropolitan development area. Comparisons with other studies show that the disaggregation method we proposed in this work, especially the adoption of geographical condition census data, can reflect the spatial distribution of carbon emissions of different sectors at the city scale. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emissions in different sectors; Census of Geographical Conditions Data; Disaggregation models; Estimation of carbon emissions; Spatial analysis","carbon emission; correlation; emission control; emission inventory; estimation method; geographical region; methodology; metropolitan area; numerical model; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; urban area; urban development; China; Hubei; Wuhan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064071907

Nowadays, advances in exhaust aftertreatment systems are primarily required to achieve regulation requirements within the whole engine operating range. Nevertheless, flow parameters, such as the exhaust gas temperature, must be also addressed. This makes engine calibration a fundamental step, but also leads to reconsider the passive design of the exhaust line as a way to improve the engine efficiency. Under this context, a study has been conducted to explore the benefits of heat losses limitation looking for aftertreatment inlet temperature increase at the same time fuel economy is improved. To do so, a baseline diesel engine has been modeled using a gas dynamic software taking special care of the heat transfer processes in the exhaust. The investigation covers the definition of different strategies for exhaust ports and turbine thermal insulation, which are evaluated in a representative range of steady-state operating conditions. As a first step, the theoretical limits and representative technology solutions are considered for each exhaust region. Then, a combination of the most promising strategies has been computed to provide a comprehensive database and analysis of the potential of passive exhaust heat losses control. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Diesel engine; Emissions regulation; Exhaust aftertreatment system; Exhaust thermal insulation; Fuel consumption; Turbine outlet temperature","Automotive industry; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Fuel consumption; Fuel economy; Gas dynamics; Heat losses; Heat transfer; Thermal insulation; Turbines; Emissions regulations; Exhaust aftertreatment; Exhaust gas temperatures; Heat transfer process; Pollution reduction; Steady-state operating conditions; Technology solutions; Turbine outlet temperatures; Exhaust systems (engine); calibration; database; diesel engine; energy efficiency; fuel consumption; heat transfer; insulation; pollution control; software; turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061571282

In total, 58 vertical profiles were obtained, including of the PM 2.5 , BC mass concentration (m BC ) and relevant meteorological parameters. Four profile types were categorized: I: uniform vertical distributions (38%), II: higher values at lower altitudes (29%), III: bimodal distributions with high values near the ground and at higher altitudes (17%), and IV: unimodal distributions with high values at higher altitudes (11%). A further analysis confirmed that all types were mainly influenced by the PBL diurnal evolution and local emissions, while types III and IV were strongly associated with the temperature inversions at low altitudes. The diurnal variations of the BC vertical profiles mainly followed the evolution of the PBL. In the early morning, the average m BC within the PBL (M BL, BC ) increased significantly, reaching the highest level in the diurnal cycles, i.e., approximately 13.0 μg m −3 . The pollutants were confined to a thin layer &lt;0.2 km above the ground, which contributed to the smoke produced by local residential biomass burning. Around noon, the accumulated BC in the layer was diluted as a result of the development of the PBL. The height of the PBL (H PBL ) reached its maximum in the afternoon, with an average of 0.65 km, while M BL , BC dropped to its minimum, with an average of 7.8 μg m −3 . As evening approached, the BC produced by local residential biomass burning gradually accumulated near the ground and linearly declined along the standardized height (H S ) within the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL). There were large differences in the BC concentration within and above the PBL both in the daytime and at night. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Black carbon; Tethered balloon; Vertical profile; Yangtze River Delta","Boundary layer flow; Carbon; Fog; Housing; Hydraulic structures; Rivers; Smoke; Black carbon; Meteorological parameters; Nocturnal boundary layers; Planetary boundary layers; Temperature inversions; Tethered balloon; Vertical profile; Yangtze river delta; Boundary layers; black carbon; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; balloon observation; black carbon; boundary layer; concentration (composition); diurnal variation; rural area; vertical distribution; winter; aerosol; altitude; Article; biomass; China; circadian rhythm; combustion; controlled study; industrialization; meteorology; particulate matter; pollutant; priority journal; rural area; thin layer chromatography; urbanization; winter; China; Yangtze Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059965636

More precisely it examines interaction between a climate change mitigation project and the ngaju Dayaks. ngaju Dayaks living along the Kahayan River have practiced hunting, and gathering different forest products and shifting cultivation for centuries. Hunted game brought back to their community was shared with people nearby as well as some other forest products or rice harvest to the family or close kin. ngaju also engaged in both market and non-market exchange. earlier anthropological discussions on sharing treated sharing as a type of reciprocity, but more recently anthropologists have debated whether sharing is a transactional form in its own right or a part of reciprocal transactions. sharing suggests and supports the values of autonomy and non-accumulation of wealth, while exchange creates dependencies and thus hierarchical relations. this article shows that sharing may acceptably turn into exchange in certain circumstances, which makes it a much more complicated and conflated concept than the idea of sharing as a completely separate transaction would suggest. © Liverpool University Press","Climate change mitigation; Kalimantan; Ngaju; Sharing; Value",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064538172

The Canadian province of British Columbia (BC) is an attractive location for EV deployment because ∼85% of its electricity is sourced from large hydropower. The driving ranges of EVs and their potential to reduce local emissions mean they are well suited to urban contexts, where most residential buildings in BC are located. The challenges associated with installing new charging stations, particularly in Multi-Unit Residential Buildings (MURBs), can become barriers to uptake of EVs. In this study, we develop a conceptual framework to identify the challenges, potential barriers and stakeholders involved in the process of charging infrastructure installation in MURBs. We establish four main domains to this problem, each of which involves specific stakeholders: charging infrastructure installation, building limitations, governance issues and parking availability. Mapping out these problem domains using decision-making flow diagrams allows us to characterize their internal dynamics and the relationships between stakeholders. As EV markets continue to grow both in Canada and across the world, a better understanding of barriers to stakeholders in these residential settings is essential for informing policy interventions. © 2018","Alternative fuel vehicles; Climate change; Energy infrastructure; Energy policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057478484

However, addressing the increasingly evident threats of climate change in the neoliberal, post-financial-crisis city raises several questions about its equitable implementation. This paper suggests that the prioritisation of a specific mode of climate resilient urban development represents a departure from the previous decades’ movement toward sustainable urbanism. We refer to this new development paradigm as ‘climate urbanism’, a policy orientation that (1) promotes cities as the most viable and appropriate sites of climate action and (2) prioritises efforts to protect the physical and digital infrastructures of urban economies from the hazards associated with climate change. We argue that the potential social justice impacts of climate urbanism have not been fully interrogated. Certainly, cities are appropriate sites for addressing climate change, but in the current neoliberal context, the transition from policy rhetoric to climate action presents a potentially problematic landscape of inequality and injustice. With that in mind, this paper offers a critical lens to evaluate the merits of climate urbanism and to interrogate its potential outcomes. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2018.","climate change; climate urbanism; displacement/gentrification; environment/sustainability; social justice; theory","action plan; climate change; climate effect; economic planning; fiscal reform; gentrification; implementation process; neoliberalism; policy making; social justice; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; urban development; urban economy; urban policy; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049005601

Thus, comprehensive planning of energy systems management is important for social and economic development, as well as environmental sustainability. In addition, uncertainties and complexities, as well as their potential interactions pose a great challenge for effective management in energy and environmental system. This study proposes a stochastic factorial energy systems management model to conduct uncertainties and risks in the energy systems, as well as handle their interaction effects among different environmental policies. The developed method can not only tackle uncertainties expressed as probability distributions and even interval values, but also be applied to determine decision alternatives associated with multiple economic penalties if the formulated environmental policy targets are violated. Meanwhile, by introducing the factorial technology, it can analyze a parameter's impact on the system and their coordination effect. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, the developed model was applied to a hypothetical case study for energy structure optimization under considering energy supply, SO2 emissions reduction, and environmental quality requirements. Multiple facilities, related environmental pollutants, and energy demand levels were taken into account. Moreover, the key factors of the system and their interaction effect were discovered. The results indicated that the developed method can resolve meritorious uncertainties in decision-making and analysis, generate effective management programming under multi-levels of the proposed energy and environmental systems. The method can be used for supporting the adjustment for allocating fossil fuels and renewable energy resources, analyzing the tradeoff between conflicting economic and environmental objectives and formulating the local policies. © 2019 by the authors.","Energy systems management; Policy making; Pollution control; Sensitive analysis; Sustainability","air quality; alternative energy; decision making; economic development; energy use; environmental policy; environmental quality; optimization; pollution control; renewable resource; sensitivity analysis; sustainability; sustainable development; trade-off; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066925756

Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and methane (CH 4 ) produced by human activities, are the main cause of global warming. According to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), agriculture is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions, so reduction of such emissions is of great significance to global climate change. There are many driving factors affecting agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. These factors are interrelated and interact with each other, so the mechanism of action is complicated. In this paper, first, the driving factors of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and emission sources are introduced. Second, the factors influencing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions are analyzed and summarized. Third, to clarify the factors influencing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, measures and countermeasures for reducing greenhouse gas emission are proposed, discussed, and compared.

Theoretical studies have verified that ridesharing is not only beneficial to drivers and passengers but particularly to the environment. Nevertheless, the exact impact of ridesharing on energy consumption and exhaust emission has been barely explored based on real carpooling data. In this study, using massive mobile internet based carpooling data offered by DiDi Company, a trip-specific model was initially proposed to study the intrinsic mechanism of carpooling services and then estimate the fuel savings of individual carpooling trip. According to the estimation results, delicacy subsidy strategies under the Personal Carbon Trading scheme were suggested to guarantee the moderation and equity in promoting carpooling services. The developed methodology was further tested in the case city of Beijing and associated results showed that ridesharing could be a feeder for public transit to support the commuting demands of workers living in suburban. More importantly, the fuel savings of ridesharing are considerable, every trip saving 1.23 L on average, and the carbon subsidies are moderate, per trip reaching ¥5.38 with the strictest subsidy ceiling. From the spatial-temporal perspective, the Chaoyang district and the daily peak-hour period generate the largest number of both ridesharing orders and fuel savings. All the results demonstrate that the trip-specific model has the advantages of delicacy, reliability and accuracy, which could facilitate the estimation on the trip-specific fuel savings and the formulation of carpooling promotion strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carpooling; Fuel savings; Path length; Subsidies; Trip-specific","Carbon; Emission control; Energy utilization; Fuel economy; Carpooling; Fuel savings; Path length; Subsidies; Trip-specific; Fuels; accuracy assessment; empirical analysis; estimation method; exhaust emission; Internet; numerical model; policy making; reliability analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; subsidy system; Beijing [China]; Chaoyang; China; Liaoning; Basidiomycota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061581757

This reduces the chance of shifting impacts outside the system boundary. However, sustainability also requires that supporting ecosystems are not adversely affected and remain capable of providing goods and services for supporting human activities. Conventional LCA does not account for this role of nature, and its metrics are best for comparing alternatives. These relative metrics do not provide information about absolute environmental sustainability, which requires comparison between the demand and supply of ecosystem services (ES). Techno-ecological synergy (TES) is a framework to account for ES, and has been demonstrated by application to systems such as buildings and manufacturing activities that have narrow system boundaries. This article develops an approach for techno-ecological synergy in life cycle assessment (TES-LCA) by expanding the steps in conventional LCA to incorporate the demand and supply of ecosystem goods and services at multiple spatial scales. This enables calculation of absolute environmental sustainability metrics, and helps identify opportunities for improving a life cycle not just by reducing impacts, but also by restoring and protecting ecosystems. TES-LCA of a biofuel life cycle demonstrates this approach by considering the ES of carbon sequestration, air quality regulation, and water provisioning. Results show that for the carbon sequestration ecosystem service, farming can be locally sustainable but unsustainable at the global or serviceshed scale. Air quality regulation is unsustainable at all scales, while water provisioning is sustainable at all scales for this study in the eastern part of the United States. © 2018 by Yale University","biofuel; ecosystem services; environmental metrics; industrial ecology; life cycle assessment (LCA); sustainability assessment","Air quality; Biofuels; Carbon; Life cycle; Mergers and acquisitions; Sustainable development; Ecosystem services; Environmental metrics; Industrial ecology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Sustainability assessment; Ecosystems; air quality; biofuel; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; environmental impact; human activity; industrial ecology; life cycle analysis; sustainability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043227062

Energy conservation and emission reduction for ICEs have become the driving force of the industrial R&D in recent years. Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is a feasible technology to recover the waste heat of an ICE so that the energy efficiency can be enhanced apparently. However, there are still many obstacles needed to be overcome for the application of an ORC together with an ICE. When a vehicle is driving, the operation conditions of the ICE vary in a large range. The operation of the ORC needs to be regulated accordingly to achieve maximum efficiency. In this study, the operation characteristics of an ICE-ORC combined system is investigated and the transient performance is analyzed. First, an integrated simulation model of the ICE and the ORC was built in GT-POWER software. A 5 kW single-screw expander was employed for the ORC system. The working characteristics of the ORC system were evaluated under various working conditions of the ICE. The matching principles of the ORC with the ICE were discussed and the optimal operation conditions of the ORC over the entire engine's working range were obtained. Subsequently, a feedforward control strategy for the ORC system was designed in MATLAB/SIMULINK. Finally, the entire model was simulated under a transient driving cycle of a vehicle. The results indicate that the pump speed and the expander speed are two important parameters and must be adjusted according to the engine's working condition. The speed of the single-screw expander maintains in the low-speed region and the pump speed is tuned to achieve a high evaporation pressure and a proper superheat degree of the working fluid at the inlet of the expander. Thus, the net power output can be maximized. The designed feedforward control strategy can adjust the working condition of the ORC automatically to match with the working condition of the ICE. The ORC operates intermittently and an impulse power is output under the urban driving conditions. However, the working time of the ORC is increased significantly and the power output is relatively higher under the highway conditions. © 2019 by the authors.","Exhaust heat recovery; Internal combustion engine; Organic Rankine cycle; Performance match; Single-screw expander; Transient simulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067131188

We adapted the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Models-3/Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system to predict the spatial and temporal concentrations of 11 TEs (arsenic, selenium, lead, cadmium, chromium, nickel, antimony, manganese, cobalt, copper, and zinc) in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in January, April, July, and October of 2012 over Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei (BTH) region of Northern China, one of the most polluted areas in China with frequent occurrences of haze episodes. A localized emission inventory that includes both conventional air pollutants and TEs established by our previous study was used in the model. Predicted concentrations of TEs were compared with observations collected at a site located in Beijing Normal University. The results show that arsenic, selenium, lead, copper, nickel, and zinc predictions better agree with observations made in both months. Manganese, antimony, and cobalt simulations display different abilities to reproduce observations between months. Chromium predictions have lower correlation coefficients. Cadmium predictions, similar to previous findings, show the least ability to reproduce observations. According to the model predictions, higher concentrations of TEs are primarily identified in the central and southern areas of the BTH region, and seasonally January sees the highest TEs. Potential causes for high concentrations of TEs were examined by evaluating emissions and contributions from major sources. Finally, specific countermeasures for emissions reduction of TEs were proposed. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

PM2.5) pollution and acid rain in recent decades, which exert adverse impacts on human health and the ecosystem. Recently, ammonia (i.e., NH3) emission reduction has been proposed as a strategic option to mitigate haze pollution. However, atmospheric NH3 is also closely bound to nitrogen deposition and acid rain, and comprehensive impacts of NH3 emission control are still poorly understood in China. In this study, by integrating a chemical transport model with a high-resolution NH3 emission inventory, we find that NH3 emission abatement can mitigate PM2.5 pollution and nitrogen deposition but would worsen acid rain in China. Quantitatively, a 50% reduction in NH3 emissions achievable by improving agricultural management, along with a targeted emission reduction (15%) for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, can alleviate PM2.5 pollution by 11−17% primarily by suppressing ammonium nitrate formation. Meanwhile, nitrogen deposition is estimated to decrease by 34%, with the area exceeding the critical load shrinking from 17% to 9% of China’s terrestrial land. Nevertheless, this NH3 reduction would significantly aggravate precipitation acidification, with a decrease of as much as 1.0 unit in rainfall pH and a corresponding substantial increase in areas with heavy acid rain. An economic evaluation demonstrates that the worsened acid rain would partly offset the total economic benefit from improved air quality and less nitrogen deposition. After considering the costs of abatement options, we propose a region-specific strategy for multipollutant controls that will benefit human and ecosystem health. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

The produced synthetic natural gas can power gas turbines and realize bidirectional energy flow between power and natural-gas systems. P2G, therefore, has significant potential for unlocking inherent flexibility in the integrated system, but also poses new challenges of increased system complexity. A coordinated operation strategy that manages power and natural-gas network constraints together is essential to address such challenges. In this paper, a novel low-carbon economic environmental dispatch strategy is presented considering all the constraints in both systems. The multi-objective black-hole particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOBHPSO) is adopted. In addition to P2G, a gas demand management strategy is proposed to support gas flow balance. A new solving approach that combines the effective redundancy method, trust region method, and Levenberg-Marquardt method is proposed to address the complex coupled constraints. Case studies that use an integrated IEEE 39-bus power and Belgian high-calorific 20-node gas system demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed model and optimization method. The analysis of dispatch results illustrates the benefit of P2G for the wind power accommodation, and low-carbon, economic, and environmental improvement of integrated system operation. © 2019 by the authors.","Economic environmental dispatch; Hybrid electricity-natural gas energy systems; Levenberg-Marquardt method; Low-carbon; Power to gas (P2G); Trust region method","Carbon; Complex networks; Electric power system economics; Flow of gases; Gases; Integrated control; Natural gas; Natural gas substitutes; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Wind power; Economic environmental dispatches; Levenberg-Marquardt method; Low carbon; Natural gas energy; Power to gas (P2G); Trust-region methods; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065700773

Engine conversion can be achieved through the addition of a gas injector in the intake manifold and of a spark plug in place of the diesel injector. This paper investigated combustion characteristics and engine performance at several lean-burn operating conditions that changed spark timing, mixture equivalence ratio, and engine speed, using methane as NG surrogate. The results show that the bowl-in-piston geometry separated the combustion process into two distinct events: an inside-the-bowl burning (due to the squish effect) that had a short duration and consumed a high fraction of fuel, and a slower inside-the-squish burning process, most probably due to the large surface/volume ratio (that increased the heat transfer to the boundaries) and to the lower in-cylinder pressure and temperature during the expansion stroke. While the operating conditions affected the overlapping of these two combustion stages, conditions that increased their phasing separation produced a second peak in the rate of heat release. Moreover, despite the variations in the magnitude and location of the 2nd peak in the rate of heat release and the lean-burn operation, the standard deviation of peak cylinder pressure and combustion phasing were below 3.5 bar and 2 CAD, respectively, for all the conditions investigated here, suggesting acceptable engine operation. As the combustion phenomena inside the squish region is complex, the combustion strategy for such engine should optimize the fraction of the fuel that burns inside the squish region for better efficiency and reduced emissions. © 2019 SAE International.

Particularly in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) regions, particulate matter concentrations have consistently exceeded the national air quality standards. Over the last years, China implemented ambitious measures to reduce emissions from the power, industry and transportation sectors, with notable success during the 11th and 12th Five Year Plan (FYP) periods. However, such strategies appear to be insufficient to reduce the ambient PM2.5 concentration below the National Air Quality Standard of 35 μg m−3 across the BTH region within the next 15 years. We find that a comprehensive mitigation strategy for the residential sector in the BTH region would deliver substantial air quality benefits. Beyond the already planned expansion of district heating and natural gas distribution in urban centers and the foreseen curtailment of coal use for households, such a strategy would redirect some natural gas from power generation units towards the residential sector. Rural households would replace biomass for cooking by liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and electricity, and substitute coal for heating by briquettes. Jointly, these measures could reduce the primary PM2.5 and SO2 emissions by 28% and 11%, respectively, and the population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations by 13%, i.e., from 68 μg m−3 to 59 μg m−3. We estimate that such a strategy would reduce premature deaths attributable to ambient and indoor air pollution by almost one third. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Human exposure; Natural gas; Outdoor and indoor health benefits; PM2.5; Solid fuel substitution","Air quality standards; Briquets; Coal industry; Fuels; Heating; Housing; Indoor air pollution; Liquefied petroleum gas; Natural gas; Quality control; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Health benefits; Human exposures; Liquid petroleum gasses (LPG); National Air Quality Standards; PM2.5; Power generation units; Solid fuels; Air quality; coal; liquefied petroleum gas; natural gas; coal; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission inventory; mitigation; mortality; pollutant source; pollution control; pollution effect; pollution exposure; air pollution; air quality; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; economic development; electricity; heating; household; human; particulate matter; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); residential area; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; urbanization; adverse event; air pollutant; cooking; ecosystem restoration; housing; indoor air pollution; premature mortality; China; Jingjinji; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Beijing; China; Coal; Cooking; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Heating; Housing; Humans; Mortality, Premature; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060950241

Flexibility from hydro and storage complements the high temporal variability of wind and solar, and transmission infrastructure helps the power balancing by moving electricity in the spatial dimension. We study cost-optimal highly-renewable Chinese power systems under ambitious CO2 emission reduction targets, by deploying a 31-node hourly-resolved techno-economic optimization model supported by a validated weather-converted 38-year-long renewable power generation and electricity demand dataset. With a new realistic reservoir hydro model, we find that if CO2 emission reduction goes beyond 70%, storage facilities such as hydro, battery and hydrogen become necessary for a moderate system cost. Numerical results show that these flexibility components can lower renewable curtailment by two thirds, allow higher solar PV share by a factor of two and contribute to covering summer cooling demand. We show that expanding unidirectional high-voltage DC lines on top of the regional inter-connections is technically sufficient and more economical than ultra-high-voltage-AC-connected “One-Net” grid. Finally, constraining transmission volume from the optimum by up to 25% does not push total costs much higher, while the significant need for battery storage remains even with abundant interconnectivity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Decarbonization; Hydro power; Large-scale integration of renewables; Storage; Wind power","Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Decarbonization; Electric batteries; Emission control; Energy storage; HVDC power transmission; Hydroelectric power; Hydrogen storage; Wind power; China; CO2 emission reduction; Electricity demands; Hydro power; Renewable power generation; Scale integration; Temporal variability; Ultra high voltage; Electric power system economics; alternative energy; carbon emission; cost analysis; demand analysis; electricity; emission control; energy storage; environmental degradation; hydroelectric power; optimization; power generation; technical efficiency; temporal variation; wind power; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061386494

It is commonly believed that nitrogen starvation triggers a metabolic shift that reroutes carbon flux from Krebs cycles to lipogenesis. In this study, we systematically surveyed and dynamically profiled the transcriptional activity of 22 lipogenic promoters aiming to delineate a picture how nitrogen starvation regulates lipogenesis in Y. lipolytica. These lipogenic promoters drive the expression of critical pathways that are responsible for the generation of reducing equivalents (NADPH), carbon backbones (acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, DHAP, etc.), synthesis and degradation of fatty acids. Specifically, our investigated promoters span across an array of metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, Krebs cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, mannitol cycle, glutamine–GABA cycle, fatty acid and lipid synthesis, glyoxylate, β-oxidation, and POM (pyruvate–oxaloacetate–malate) cycle. Our work provides evidences that mannitol cycle, glutamine–GABA cycle and amino acid degradation, pyruvate oxidation, and acetate assimilation pathways are lipogenesis-related steps involved in generating cytosolic NADPH and acetyl-CoA precursors. This systematic investigation and dynamic profiling of lipogenic promoters may help us better understand lipogenesis, facilitate the formulation of structure-based kinetic models, as well as develop efficient cell factories for fuels and chemical production in oleaginous species. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon backbones; Lipogenesis; Nitrogen starvations; Oleaginous yeast; Reducing equivalents","Amino acids; Carbon; Metabolism; Nitrogen; Oxidation; Polyols; Carbon backbone; Lipogenesis; Nitrogen starvation; Oleaginous yeasts; Reducing equivalents; Fatty acids; 4 aminobutyric acid; acetic acid; acetyl coenzyme A; glutamine; glyoxylic acid; malonyl coenzyme A; nitrogen; oxaloacetic acid; pyruvic acid; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; fatty acid; lipid; amino acid; biodegradation; carbon flux; cell component; fatty acid; gene expression; metabolism; nitrogen; oxidation; protein; starvation; yeast; Article; citric acid cycle; clinical pathway; controlled study; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid synthesis; gene expression; glycolysis; lipogenesis; metabolism; nonhuman; pentose phosphate cycle; precursor; promoter region; starvation; Yarrowia lipolytica; biosynthesis; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; lipid metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; Yarrowia; Yarrowia lipolytica; Citric Acid Cycle; Fatty Acids; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Glycolysis; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Lipogenesis; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Oxidation-Reduction; Pentose Phosphate Pathway; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Transcription, Genetic; Yarrowia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061298872

The findings suggest that higher income inequality increases US carbon emissions in the short term, whereas it promotes carbon reduction in the long term. Furthermore, we find that the absolute values for the coefficients on income inequality in the states from the 70th to the 90th quantiles are larger than those from the 10th to the 40th quantiles. This indicates that income inequality reduces more carbon emissions in states with higher per capita carbon emissions.

The organic-rich shale within this formation not only provides favorable hydrocarbon source rocks for conventional reservoirs, but also has excellent potential for shale oil exploration due to its thickness, abundant organic matter, the overall mature oil generation state, high hydrocarbon retention, and commonly existing overpressure. Geochemical analyses of the total organic carbon content (TOC) and rock pyrolysis evaluation (Rock-Eval) have allowed for the quantitative evaluation of the organic matter in the shale. However, the organic matter exhibits a highly heterogeneous spatial distribution and its magnitude varies even at the millimeter scale. In addition, quantification of the TOC distribution is significant to the evaluation of shale reservoirs and the estimation of shale oil resources. In this study, well log data was calibrated using the measured TOC of core samples collected from 11 boreholes in the study area; the continuous TOC distribution within the target zone was obtained using the ΔlogR method; the organic heterogeneity of the shale was characterized using multiple fractal models, including the box-counting dimension (Bd), the power law, and the Hurst exponent models. According to the fractal dimension (D) calculation, the vertical distribution of the TOC was extremely homogeneous. The power law calculation indicates that the vertical distribution of the TOC in the first member of the Qingshankou Formation is multi-fractal and highly heterogeneous. The Hurst exponent varies between 0.23 and 0.49. The lower values indicate higher continuity and enrichment of organic matter, while the higher values suggest a more heterogeneous organic matter distribution. Using the average TOC, coefficient of variation (CV), Bd, D, inflection point, and the Hurst exponent as independent variables, the interpolation prediction method was used to evaluate the exploration potential of the study area. The results indicate that the areas containing boreholes B, C, D, F, and I in the western part of the Gulong Sag are the most promising potential exploration areas. In conclusion, the findings of this study are of significant value in predicting favorable exploration zones for unconventional reservoirs. © 2019 by the authors.","Box-counting; China; Fractal; Hurst exponent; Shale oil; Songliao Basin",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066444129

We find that voltage-biased transistors indeed emit in the THz frequency range, as reported in the literature; however, our data let us conclude that this radiation cannot be directly attributed to plasmonic instability phenomena. Instead, two other distinct mechanisms are identified. One is based on high-frequency self-oscillations originating from positive feedback within the frequency range where the transistor provides gain. Such oscillations are especially facilitated by the integration of antenna structures and cease to exist after taking specific measures for circuit stabilization. Another mechanism is identified for the case of broadband emission from multifinger transistors fabricated without any specific antenna. In contrast to the predictions of the plasmonic instability picture, the spectra of this emission depend on the gate and drain biasing conditions and on the bias modulation frequency. This emission can be understood as a combination of thermal emission from the heated material and from thermally excited plasmons and trap states. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Aluminum gallium nitride; Antennas; Circuit oscillations; Electron mobility; Feedback; Gallium nitride; III-V semiconductors; Plasmonics; Plasmons; Terahertz waves; Thermionic emission; Transistors; AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors; Antenna structures; Biasing conditions; Broadband emission; High frequency HF; Multi-finger transistor; Self-oscillations; Terahertz emissions; High electron mobility transistors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064161758

The energy factor includes three types of energy forces for both bonding and non-bonding interactions in variant type of MOFs structures: that is, 1) metal–gas interactions, 2) heteroatom–gas bonds, and 3) non-bonding interactions, including Van der Waals as well as Coulomb interactions. The subspace factor includes: 1) geometrical void fraction volume, 2) surface area, and 3) the limiting local pore size. Under this catalogue, more than 65 000 types of MOFs with relative high gas capture are studied; a linear scaling law can be approached via the group combination of the energy and space factor. Moreover, the decomposed scaling law indicates that for the exploring of high gas storage MOFs structure, the design of spatial geometry takes more importance than the chemical bonding of gas–MOFs interactions.

To ensure that policy targeting industrial emissions are achieved, standard mean based models underperforms, so exploring a quantile framework, varying effects of economic development, energy structure, energy efficiency, industrial structure and urbanization across the levels of carbon dioxide emissions were analyzed for the industrial sector of Shanghai where estimates both described the distribution of carbon dioxide emissions and their marginal effects on different quantiles. Explanatory variables were emission friendly and did not exert same effects on the acceleration of carbon emissions.

An optimized energy efficiency will be the best mitigating variable that could curb carbon dioxide emissions, then followed by energy structure.

Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) may be an effective mean of combating global warming. However, little research focuses on the influence of ETS price on energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and the economy. This paper analyzes the impact of different ETS price level by applying a dynamic recursive Computable General Equilibrium model. The results show that GDP will reduce more with increasing ETS price level. The output of energy industries is more sensitive to ETS price than other industries. Higher ETS price, lower marginal reduction of fossil energy consumption of ETS price. Moreover, low ETS prices will undermine the capacity of the carbon market to reduce emissions. Higher ETS price will lead to a higher reduction in CO2 emission, but the economic costs cannot be ignored. Therefore, this paper argues that ETS prices in China's ETS pilot cities are too low, and would provide little emission reduction. Maintaining ETS prices at $10 and gradually increasing carbon price to $20 is suggested in this paper. Also, we should focus on the appropriate subsidies for new energy generation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission; Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model; Emission Trading Scheme (ETS); Energy consumption; ETS price","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Emission control; Energy utilization; Global warming; Carbon emission trading; CO2 emissions; Computable general equilibrium model; Emission reduction; Emission trading scheme; ETS price; Fossil energy consumption; Human activities; Costs; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cost analysis; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; fossil fuel; global warming; Gross Domestic Product; market conditions; price determination; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060867202

We first construct a sustainable indicator, which is defined as eco-efficiency, by using the non-directional distance function method. Then we evaluate the effect of ESER policy on eco-efficiency by adopting the Difference-in-differences method. The conclusions based on the findings include: (1) The eco-efficiency of Chinese cities has been effectively improved during the study period. (2) The baseline estimate reveals that the ESER policy has a positive and statistically significant effect on eco-efficiency, while the event study corroborates that ESER policy is ineffective in the short term, but the policy effect emerges three years later after the implementation of ESER policy.

Using China's provincial panel data from 2000 to 2015, and regarding the CO 2 emissions as the proxy of climate change, this paper identifies the relationship between RETI and CO 2 emissions as well as seeks to confirm the role of RETI on climate change. The linear regression model confirms that the RETI has a significant negative effect on CO 2 emissions. In addition, considering the disparities of energy structure, the impacts of RETI on CO 2 emissions may be distinct. We, therefore, construct a panel threshold model by taking into account the distinct effect of RETI under different energy structure. We find that the effect of RETI on curbing CO 2 emissions decreases with the rising of coal-dominated energy consumption structure but in contrast, this effect increases with the growing proportion of renewable energy generation.

Indonesian peatlands are subject to much greater anthropogenic activity than Peru’s, including drainage, logging, agricultural conversion, and burning, resulting in high greenhouse gas and particulate emissions. To derive insights from the Indonesian experience, we explored patterns of impact in the two countries, and compared their predisposing factors. Impacts differ greatly among Indonesian regions and the Peruvian Amazon in the following order: Sumatra > Kalimantan > Papua > Peru. All impacts, except fire, are positively related to population density. Factors enhancing Indonesian peatlands’ susceptibility to disturbance include peat doming that facilitates drainage, coastal location, high local population, road access, government policies permitting peatland use, lack of enforcement of protections, and dry seasons that favor extensive burning. The main factors that could reduce peatland degradation in Peru compared with Indonesia are geographic isolation from coastal population centers, more compact peatland geomorphology, lower population and road density, more peatlands in protected areas, different land tenure policies, and different climatic drivers of fire; whereas factors that could enhance peatland degradation include oil and gas development, road expansion in peatland areas, and an absence of government policies explicitly protecting peatlands. We conclude that current peatland integrity in Peru arises from a confluence of factors that has slowed development, with no absolute barriers protecting Peruvian peatlands from a similar fate to Indonesia’s. If the goal is to maintain the integrity of Peruvian peatlands, government policies recognizing unique peatland functions and sensitivities will be necessary. © 2018, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.","Agriculture; Fire; Forest cover loss; Indonesia; Oil palm; Peru; Plantations; Population density; Roads; Tropical peatlands","comparative study; deciduous tree; disturbance; forest cover; forest fire; greenhouse gas; human activity; land tenure; peatland; plantation forestry; policy development; population density; protected area; road; Amazonia; Borneo; Greater Sunda Islands; Indonesia; Kalimantan; Papua [(PRV) Indonesia]; Peru; Sumatra; Sunda Isles; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042602013

However, the fuel ethanol blended in ethanol gasoline blends currently is usually anhydrous ethanol, which requires dewatering implementer in production process, and the cost is high. Therefore, the production cost can be significantly reduced by replacement of anhydrous ethanol with hydrous ethanol while exerting the advantage of ethanol gasoline blends. In this study, computation fluid dynamics (CFD) software CONVERGE is employed to establish a simulation model of an actual gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine, and investigate the effect of burning hydrous ethanol gasoline blends and different injection strategy on combustion process and emission, and the validity of the model was validated by experiments. The numerical results show that compared with ordinary gasoline burning hydrous ethanol gasoline blends can accelerate combustion, expand the high temperature region during combustion, and reduce the formation of soot. When changing the start of injection (SOI) timing, due to factors such as wall impingement, fuel evaporation of and in-cylinder flow, the case with injection at -270 CAD has the best uniformity of mixture gas has, the fastest rate of heat release (RoHR), the highest in-cylinder pressure peak and optimal timing of pressure peak. Double injection strategy can improve the fuel evaporation rate, optimize the distribution of the mixture gas, and reduce NOx emissions. The optimal secondary injection timing is -130 CAD with a ratio of 25%. The lean stratified combustion mode is also explored, and has the capability to reduce the combustion pressure and temperature.

However, few studies have examined the effectiveness of long-term use of indoor air filters for reduction of PM2.5 exposure and associated decrease in adverse health impacts in urban India. We conducted 20 simulations of yearlong personal exposure to PM2.5 in urban Delhi using the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s CONTAM program (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Simulation scenarios were developed to examine different air filter efficiencies, use schedules, and the influence of a smoker at home. We quantified associated mortality reductions with Household Air Pollution Intervention Tool (HAPIT, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA). Without an air filter, we estimated an annual mean PM2.5 personal exposure of 103 µg/m3 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 93, 112) and 137 µg/m3 (95% CI: 125, 149) for households without and with a smoker, respectively. All day use of a high-efficiency particle air (HEPA) filter would reduce personal PM2.5 exposure to 29 µg/m3 and 30 µg/m3, respectively. The reduced personal PM2.5 exposure from air filter use is associated with 8-37% reduction in mortality attributable to PM2.5 pollution in Delhi.

However, in the context of climate change, the response of vegetation Net Primary Production (NPP) in this region has not been scientifically studied in depth. NPP suffers from the comprehensive effect of multiple climatic factors, and how to eliminate the effect of interfering variables in the correlation analysis of NPP and target variables (temperature or precipitation) is the major challenge in the study of NPP influencing factors. The correlation coefficient between NPP and target variable was calculated by ignoring other variables that also had a large impact on NPP. This increased the uncertainty of research results. Therefore, in this study, the second-order partial correlation analysis method was used to analyze the correlation between NPP and target variables by controlling other variables. This can effectively decrease the uncertainty of analysis results. In this paper, the univariate linear regression, coefficient of variation, and Hurst index estimation were used to study the spatial and temporal variations in NPP and analyze whether the NPP seasonal and annual variability will persist into the future. The results show the following: (i) The spatial distribution of NPP correlated with precipitation and had a gradually decreasing trend from southeast to northwest. From 2000 to 2015, the NPP in the study area had a general upward trend, with a small variation in its range. (ii) Areas with negative partial correlation coefficients between NPP and precipitation are consistent with the areas with more abundant water resources. The partial correlation coefficient between the NPP and the Land Surface Temperature (LST) was positive for 52.64% of the total study area. Finally, the prediction of the persistence of NPP variation into the future showed significant differences on varying time scales. On an annual scale, NPP was predicted to persist for 46% of the study area. On a seasonal scale, NPP in autumn was predicted to account for 49.92%, followed by spring (25.67%), summer (13.40%), and winter (6.75%).","400 mm annual precipitation; climate change; Hurst index; net primary production; second-order partial correlation; spatial and temporal variation","rain; China; climate change; ecosystem; season; statistical model; temperature; theoretical model; China; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Linear Models; Models, Theoretical; Rain; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065488852

Small mammals, often considered competitors with livestock, have been reported to increase in recent years and have been identified for their negative impacts on ecosystem services such as plant production and soil carbon sequestration. However, these increases and impacts by small mammals have rarely been studied with respect to how they may be influenced by livestock grazing. Here we experimentally manipulated large enclosures on the alpine grassland of Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, each with different livestock assemblages: yak (Bos grunniens), Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries), mixed populations of yak and sheep, and a control plot containing no livestock to study the potential impacts of livestock on the dominant small mammalian herbivore in the region, the plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae). We found that during the period of peak vegetative growth all pika populations in livestock experimental plots increased compared with those in the control plots. Additionally, pika populations and active pika burrow density increased more in experimental plots containing yaks compared with the sheep-only experimental plots. These results provide evidence that livestock grazing can increase the risk of pika outbreaks, which has led to this species being classified as a pest and subject to widespread control measures. We suggest explicitly incorporating livestock species identity in addition to grazing intensity and duration into management considerations to ensure maintenance of native biodiversity and long-term sustainability on the alpine grasslands of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Alpine meadow; Grassland management; Indirect effect; Large herbivore; Sanjiangyuan; Source of the Three Rivers","alpine environment; burrowing; carbon sequestration; grassland; grazing; herbivore; livestock; meadow; small mammal; soil carbon; sustainability; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Bos grunniens; Mammalia; Ochotona curzoniae; Ochotonidae; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060333108

Current O3 pollution in the United States is estimated to decrease the yields of maize (Zea mays) up to 10%, however, many bioenergy feedstocks including switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) have not been studied for response to O3 stress. Using Free Air Concentration Enrichment (FACE) technology, we investigated the impacts of elevated O3 (~100 nmol mol− 1) on leaf photosynthetic traits and capacity, chlorophyll fluorescence, the Ball–Woodrow–Berry (BWB) relationship, respiration, leaf structure, biomass and nutrient composition of switchgrass. Elevated O3 concentration reduced net CO2 assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), and maximum CO2 saturated photosynthetic capacity (Vmax), but did not affect other functional and structural traits in switchgrass or the macro- (except potassium) and micronutrient content of leaves. These results suggest that switchgrass exhibits a greater O3 tolerance than maize, and provide important fundamental data for evaluating the yield stability of a bioenergy feedstock crop and for exploring O3 sensitivity among bioenergy feedstocks. © 2019 by the authors.

Improving carbon productivity consists a possible way to seek a coordination between economic development and carbon emission reduction. Therefore, it is of great significance to examine the effects of socioeconomic development on China's carbon productivity and accordingly provide policy suggestions for China's low-carbon economic development. However, this topic has not been adequately addressed in previous studies. In order to fill this gap, this study detailed an empirical investigation into the impacts of socioeconomic development on China's carbon productivity. First, aided by spatial analysis methods, a detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics of China's province-level carbon productivity was conducted. Moreover, using an extended STIRPAT model and panel data modeling technique, the effects of a range of socioeconomic factors on China's carbon productivity were quantitatively examined. The results indicated that China's carbon productivity increased gradually between 1997 and 2016, and carbon productivity in East China was much higher than that of their counterparts in Central China and West China. Provincial administrative units with highly developed economies witnessed spectacular increases in carbon productivity. Panel data analysis demonstrated that GDP per capita, technology level, trade openness, and foreign direct investment exerted positive effects, while energy consumption structure, industrial proportion, and urbanization level exerted negative effects, on China's carbon productivity. Based on the findings of this study, a series of policy suggestions with respect to improving China's carbon productivity were proposed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon productivity; China; Low-carbon economy; Panel data analysis; Socioeconomic determinants; Spatiotemporal patterns","Carbon; Data handling; Developing countries; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Information analysis; Investments; Productivity; Renewable energy resources; Carbon productivities; China; Low carbon economy; Panel data analysis; Socioeconomic determinants; Spatiotemporal patterns; Economic and social effects; carbon; carbon emission; developing world; economic development; emission control; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; panel data; socioeconomic conditions; Article; carbon dynamics; carbon footprint; chemical model; China; economic development; economic evaluation; energy consumption; gross national product; industrialization; investment; panel study; priority journal; quantitative analysis; socioeconomics; spatiotemporal analysis; technology; trade union; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059397252

Taxis in urban transportation systems contribute to air pollution in two ways: through direct emissions, and through the indirect emissions of other vehicles resulting from increased traffic flow and saturation of the road network caused by vacant taxis. To analyze the differences between emissions in urban road transportation systems with and without taxis quantitatively, this study estimates the on-road emissions and fuel consumption (FC) of vehicles before and during a taxi strike in Nanning, China using license plate recognition data. The spatiotemporal features of the emissions and FC before and during the taxi strike are analyzed, including temporal variations and spatial distributions. The emissions and FC in four typical road segments are also analyzed with and without taxis. The results demonstrate that in the event of a taxi strike, the total emissions and FC decrease to a larger extent compared to the decrease in total travel distance. However, the temporal and spatial patterns of pollutant emissions in the city exhibit no significant change. The amounts of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), FC, and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) decrease by 12.54%, 12.98%, 8.01%, 7.80%, 11.33%, and 11.33%, respectively, between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m. during the taxi strike. During the morning peak period (8 a.m.–10 a.m.), the reductions in emissions and FC are significant, i.e., 14.74%, 15.05%, 11.70%, 10.75%, 14.17%, and 14.17% for CO, HC, NOx, PM, FC, and CO 2 , respectively. Finally, from the results based on a large dataset, informative insights for improving taxi management systems and reducing emissions and FC are discussed to promote the sustainable development of urban transportation systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emission and fuel consumption; License plate recognition data; Taxi management policy; Taxi strike","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Fuels; Highway administration; Large dataset; License plates (automobile); Nitrogen oxides; Optical character recognition; Roads and streets; Taxicabs; Traffic control; License plate recognition; Management policy; Pollutant emission; Spatio temporal features; Taxi strike; Temporal and spatial pattern; Transportation system; Urban transportation systems; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060945923

The results show that, over the entire BTH area, the policies could generate an average annual loss of 1.4% of Gross Regional Product growth in the Action Plan scenario and 2.3% in the Enhanced Action Plan scenario. Moreover, realizing the 2020 PM2.5 BTH area concentration targets will not be possible in the Enhanced Action Plan scenario, even with a reduction in emissions of over 60% of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and primary PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 µm) and over 30% of VOCS (volatile organic compounds).

Then, a first assessment of the spatial-temporal change in national vulnerability from 1996 to 2008 was provided from the global perspective. Finally, 171 countries were grouped, and hotspots of climate change were identified. Based on the results, the earth is more vulnerable than invulnerable, and the average rate of increase in the vulnerability index from 1996 to 2008 was 0.30%. African countries were identified as hotspots of vulnerability and instability in the changing climate, and 8 groups were clustered based on the key influencing index of 171 countries. The results of this new framework are consistent with the previous Fragile State Index and World Risk Index but provide more details and quantitative vulnerability analysis.

However, high ozone (O3) concentrations have become a more and more severe air pollution issue in the rapidly developing Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of eastern China including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces. The 90th percentile of O3-8 h concentration in the YRD region increased from 144 μg/m3 in 2013 to 168 μg/m3 in 2017. To investigate the sources of O3 within the YRD region, we use a tagged-species method in the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) called Ozone Source Apportionment Technology (OSAT) to quantify O3 contributions by source regions and sectors in Spring, Summer and Fall. We find that the O3 pollution in Shanghai, southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang is caused by the joint effect of local to regional precursor emissions combined with super-regional O3 transport. However, these contributions vary among seasons and pollution events. Super regional transport is the major contributor to average O3 concentration while local and upwind adjacent area contributions can dominate during high O3 concentration episodes. Source sector analysis indicates that industry and vehicle emissions are major anthropogenic sources. Within the industrial sector, power plants, boilers, and petroleum industry are the top three contributors. Reducing super-regional O3 transport is of the most importance to lowering the O3 background but local to regional precursor emission reductions are also of great significance to control O3 episodes with collaboration at the regional level offering potential for synergistic benefits to adjacent cities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ozone; Source contributions; Yangtze River Delta","Air quality; Emission control; Ozone; Petroleum industry; Quality control; Rivers; Anthropogenic sources; Comprehensive air quality model with extensions; Emission control measures; Seasonal differences; Sectoral contribution; Source apportionment; Source contributions; Yangtze river delta; River pollution; ozone; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; industrial emission; ozone; pollutant transport; power plant; source apportionment; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; analytic method; Article; autumn; China; combustion; electric power plant; exhaust gas; industry; Ozone Source Apportionment Technology; petrochemical industry; priority journal; season; simulation; spring; summer; traffic and transport; China; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060977056

Katydids are known for using high-frequency broadband signals whereas most cricket songs are pure tones with a frequency range of 2–8 kHz. Pseudophyllus titan is a special katydid emits low-frequency pure tone songs similar to that of crickets. Acoustic communication of Ensifera were widely studied, but song evolution could deserve new examination taking into account the newly available phylogenies. To examine the song evolution of P. titan in the Ensifera, the mitogenomes of P. titan and three other ensiferan species (Sphagniana ussuriana, Oecanthus sinensis, Truljalia hibinonis) were obtained by high-throughput sequencing. In addition, the phylogeny of Ensifera was reconstructed including 63 in-group taxa, and the divergence time was further estimated for major ensiferan lineages. Lastly, the evolutions of song frequency were evaluated based on an ancestral character state reconstruction (ACSR). Moreover, we have studied the calling songs of 78 katydids and performed ACSR based on five genes. All phylogeny analyses confirmed that the superfamily Schizodactyloidea was placed basally to the non-grylloid clade. P. titan was in the Pseudophyllinae clade, and this clade had a distant relationship form other lineages in Phaneropteridae. The ACSR showed that P. titan evolved low-frequency pure tone songs independently after ancestors of katydids evolved high-frequency broadband noise. Referring to the geologic time scale, we suggest that the song frequency evolution in the Ensifera to some extent caused by adaptations to the changing habitat under conditions of climate change and plant evolution. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Ensifera; evolution; insect song; mitogenome; phylogeny","article; cladistics; climate change; controlled study; geological time; habitat; high throughput sequencing; human; noise; nonhuman; plant evolution; plesiomorphy; pure tone audiometry; Tettigoniidae; acoustics; animal; animal communication; genetics; Orthoptera; phylogeny; physiology; mitochondrial DNA; Acoustics; Animal Communication; Animals; DNA, Mitochondrial; Orthoptera; Phylogeny",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054484611

Regulatory monitors can be used to determine if regional concentrations meet regulatory standards of air pollution. As assessments of air pollutant exposure become more spatially resolved, evaluation is needed to assess the spatial representativeness of monitors in different environments. We measured NO2, ultrafine particle concentration (UFP), and PM1 with both stationary and mobile platforms in Pittsburgh, PA in 2016 and 2017. We sampled in eight ∼1 km2 neighborhoods representing different land use and exposure regimes (e.g., urban and suburban, high and low traffic). Mobile sampling was conducted on up to 25 days in each neighborhood to study fine-scale spatial variation in pollutant concentrations. NO2 exhibited within-neighborhood spatial variation, with hotspots elevated by up to a factor of 5 above the regional background. Spatial differences in UFP within the same 1 km2 neighborhoods could be a factor of 2.4 times regional background. PM1 was more regional and less spatially variable. Most neighborhoods exhibited less than 1 μg m−3 spatial variability in PM1. Spatial variability of NO2 and UFP showed moderate correlation (R2 &gt; 0.5) with traditional land use covariates such as traffic volume and restaurant density. We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to calculate the fraction of each neighborhood represented by the same underlying concentration distribution. PM1 was the most spatially homogeneous, with 80–100% of each 1 km2 area being statistically similar to a reference location. Quantifying pollutant spatial patterns with high fidelity (e.g., &lt;2 ppb NO2 or &lt;1 μg m−3 PM1) seems unattainable in many urban areas unless the sampling network is significantly dense, with more than one or two nodes per km2. © 2019 The Author(s)","Exposure; Low-cost sensors; Particulate matter; Spatial variations","Air quality; Forestry; Land use; Nitrogen oxides; Adverse health effects; Concentration distributions; Exposure; Low-cost sensors; Particulate Matter; Pollutant concentration; Spatial variations; Wilcoxon rank sum test; Pollution detection; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); exhaust emission; land use change; neighborhood; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; pollution exposure; sensor; spatial variation; air monitoring; air pollutant; air quality; air sampling; Article; grid cell; land use; priority journal; restaurant; suburban area; traffic; United States; urban area; Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060999815

Interestingly, the bromine-substituted enaminone fluorophore (BrE) exhibits unexpected stronger emission in solid states than unsubstituted enaminone fluorophore (HE), which is seldom observed for organic fluorophores. Remarkably, the fluorescence quantum efficiency of BrE crystal is ten times as large as that of HE crystal. Based on single-crystal analysis and theoretical calculation, the unusual fluorescence behavior is attributed to the important effect of bromide substituents which not only form intermolecular Br⋅⋅⋅Br halogen bonding to block nonradiative relaxation pathways efficiently but also promote the radiative process. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The results indicated that the spatial correlation of inter-provincial haze emission in China presented a typical “central–marginal” network structure. The provinces in the network center were mostly located in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region and the Yangtze River Delta region. The synergistic governance development of haze in China showed a lower level and fluctuating upward trend. In addition, the increase of network density, the decline of network grade, and the decrease of network efficiency would all improve the level of synergistic governance development. Therefore, focusing on the haze of the central provinces, improving the network structure, and improving regional synergy are important measures for effective governance. This paper improves the previous research model, considers the impact of economic and demographic factors on haze pollution, establishes a new model for analyzing spatial correlation structure of haze and calculating the synergistic governance level of haze, and designs feasible ways to raise the synergistic governance level of haze in China. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Haze emission; Spatial correlation; Synergistic governance development","atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; correlation; governance approach; haze; network analysis; social network; spatial analysis; China; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; China; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; government; legislation and jurisprudence; particulate matter; pollution; procedures; river; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Policy; Environmental Pollution; Government; Models, Theoretical; Particulate Matter; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062689227

Here, using a long-term remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset, we quantified the vegetation changes in the Loess Plateau (LP) over the last three decades (1982–2015), which includes the period before the Chinese“Grain for Green Program”(GGP) was launched (1982–1999), and the period after the GGP (1999–2015). The correlations between the NDVI and four climate related variables, i.e., precipitation, temperature, root-soil moisture (RSM), and a drought proxy-standardized evapotranspiration deficit index (SEDI), were also examined. The results indicated that, (i) the GGP strongly changed the vegetation in the LP. The growing-season mean NDVI (GSM-NDVI) and the annual mean NDVI (AM-NDVI) decreased slightly before the GGP launched in 1999, with slopes of −3.38 × 10−3 and − 8.00 × 10−4 year−1, respectively. However, they showed slight and significant (p &lt; 0.05) increases after the GGP, with slopes of 4.75 × 10−3 and 2.32 × 10−3 year−1, respectively. (ii) Climate change (i.e., warming and drying) resulted in adverse effects on vegetation in the LP during the period before the GGP. However, the observed changes (i.e., wetting and reduced drought) exerted positive effects on the vegetation during the period after the GGP. (iii) Inter-annual variations of spatially averaged NDVI over the LP were primarily determined by RSM rather than any other climate related variables. In the southeastern LP, the inter-annual variation of GSM-NDVI was mainly determined by precipitation and SEDI, while the inter-annual variation of AM-NDVI was mainly caused by SEDI and RSM. Inter-annual variations of both GSM-NDVI and AM-NDVI were mainly determined by SEDI and RSM in the northwestern LP, and by temperature in the southwestern LP. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Drought; Grain for Green Program (GGP); Loess Plateau; Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Remote sensing","Drought; Landforms; Remote sensing; Sediments; Soil moisture; Vegetation; Grain for greens; Interannual variation; Loess Plateau; Normalized difference vegetation index; Related variables; Vegetation change; Vegetation dynamics; Vegetation index; Climate change; climate change; data set; drought; environmental monitoring; NDVI; remote sensing; vegetation dynamics; Article; China; climate change; controlled study; drought; environmental parameters; environmental protection; environmental temperature; evapotranspiration; geographic and geological phenomena; Grain for Green Program; Loess Plateau; normalized difference vegetation index; plant root; precipitation; priority journal; revegetation; seasonal variation; soil moisture; spatial analysis; standardized evapotranspiration deficit index; temperature; vegetation; vegetation dynamics; agriculture; biota; environmental monitoring; grassland; plant; procedures; China; Loess Plateau; Agriculture; Biota; China; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Grassland; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059752721

However, the energy consumption rebound effect, as an important proxy for achieving sustainable low-carbon development, has not been adequately investigated across industrial enterprises in this area. This study adopts an alternative estimation model based on neoclassical economic theory to measure the energy rebound effect of industrial enterprises in the BTH region from 1996 to 2015. Four main results are obtained. First, the energy rebound effects in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei are significantly different in the temporal and spatial dimensions. Second, technological progress does not reduce energy consumption, and the local government must simultaneously consider technological progress, industrial structure, and policy formulation to achieve the ECER goals. Third, ECER policies combined with government administrative measures do not have an impact on reducing energy consumption. Fourth, in the process of implementing the integration development of the BTH region, Hebei faces greater pressure to attain ECER goals in the future than the other regions. This study provides suggestions based on these derived results from the perspectives of market-oriented measures, management factors, development mode, and regional cooperation to achieve the sustainable development of the BTH region. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Industrial enterprises; Neoclassical growth model; Rebound effect; Technological progress","Emission control; Energy policy; Industrial economics; Administrative measures; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Industrial enterprise; Neoclassical growth models; Rebound effect; Reduce energy consumption; Reducing energy consumption; Technological progress; Energy utilization; consumption behavior; economic development; emission control; energy use; environmental economics; future prospect; industrial enterprise; policy approach; policy implementation; sustainability; technological development; China; Jingjinji",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055931944

Designing policies that are aimed at achieving such radical transitions in the energy system will require ever more in-depth modelling of end-use demand, efficiency and fuel switching, as well as an increasing need for regional, sectoral, and agent disaggregation to capture technological, jurisdictional and policy detail. Building and using these models entails complex trade-offs between the level of detail, the size of the system boundary, and the available computing resources. The availability of data to characterise key energy system sectors and interactions is also a key driver of model structure and parameterisation, and there are many blind spots and design compromises that are caused by data scarcity. We may soon, however, live in a world of data abundance, potentially enabling previously impossible levels of resolution and coverage in energy economy models. But while big data concepts and platforms have already begun to be used in a number of selected energy research applications, their potential to improve or even completely revolutionise energy economy modelling has been almost completely overlooked in the existing literature. In this paper, we explore the challenges and possibilities of this emerging frontier. We identify critical gaps and opportunities for the field, as well as developing foundational concepts for guiding the future application of big data to energy economy modelling, with reference to the existing literature on decision making under uncertainty, scenario analysis and the philosophy of science. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Climate policy; Decarbonisation; Energy data; Energy modelling; Energy policy","Big data; Climate models; Decarbonization; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Energy policy; Uncertainty analysis; Climate policy; Decarbonisation; Decision making under uncertainty; Energy data; Energy modelling; Energy-economy modelling; Energy-economy models; Philosophy of science; Structural design; data set; decision making; energy policy; environmental policy; hydrological modeling; scenario analysis; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061209019

This included a waste hauler and a city transit bus, each with a 0.02 g/bhp-hr NOx L9N near zero (NZ) natural gas engine. The vehicles were tested over a variety of different cycles, including the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), port drayage cycles, transit bus cycles, and a refuse truck cycle. For both vehicles, the NOx emissions results were below the 0.02 g/bhp-hr level for most cycles, with the exception of some cold start tests. For the waste hauler, NOx emissions averaged between 0.014 and 0.002 g/bhp-hr for the hot start tests, and from 0.043 to 0.014 g/bhp-hr for the cold start tests. This represented NOx emissions reductions from 97%-100% of compared with previous ISL G 8.9 engines. For the transit bus, the NOx emissions ranged from 0.0007 g/bhp-hr to 0.0042 g/bhp-hr for the warm tests and up to 0.04 g/bhp-hr for the cold start tests. The NOx results for the warm tests are 99% lower than the existing 2010 NOx diesel standard (0.2 g/bhp-hr) and 90% lower than the optional low NOx standard (0.02 g/bhp-h). In contrast, some elevation of ammonia emissions was observed for both vehicles, due to reactions that occur over the three way catalyst. Overall, the results suggest that ultralow NOx NG engines could play an important role in reducing NOx emissions from heavy-duty vehicles towards near zero levels in urban areas. The particle mass emissions were low and typically were more than 90% lower than the 2010 certification standard (10 mg/bhp-hr) for the L9N engine for both applications. Particle number (PN) emissions for the L9N (0.02 g/bhp-h) and other previous tests of ISL G 8.9 (0.2 g/bhp-h) engines both show higher PN emissions compared to diesel vehicles equipped with diesel particle filters (DPFs).

However, meeting the Paris Agreement warming limits requires notably stronger greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts by major emitters than existing pledges. We examine the impact of Paris-era decision-making by the world's three largest greenhouse gas emitters (EU, USA, and China) on projected future extreme temperature events. Country-level contributions to the occurrence of future temperature extremes are calculated based on current emissions policies and sequential mitigation efforts, using a new metric called the Contribution to Excess Risk Ratio. We demonstrate the Contribution concept by applying it to extreme monthly temperature projections. In many regions, future extremes depend on the current and future carbon dioxide emissions reductions adopted by major emitters.

Understanding how these modified fire regimes impact vegetation structure and dynamics is essential for informed biodiversity conservation and carbon management in savanna ecosystems. We used a fire experiment at the Territory Wildlife Park (TWP), northern Australia, to investigate the consequences of altered fire regimes for vertical habitat structure and above-ground carbon storage. We mapped vegetation three-dimensional (3-D) structure in high spatial resolution with airborne lidar across 18 replicated 1 ha plots of varying fire frequency and season treatments. We used lidar-derived canopy height and cover metrics to extrapolate field-based measures of woody biomass to the full extent of the experimental site (R2 D 0:82, RMSED7.35 tC ha1) and analysed differences in above-ground carbon storage and canopy structure among treatments. Woody canopy cover and biomass were highest in the absence of fire (76% and 39.8 tC ha1) and lowest in plots burnt late in the dry season on a biennial basis (42% and 18.2 t Cha1). Woody canopy vertical profiles differed among all six fire treatments, with the greatest divergence in height classes < 5 m. The magnitude of fire effects on vegetation structure varied along the environmental gradient underpinning the experiment, with less reduction in biomass in plots with deeper soils. Our results highlight the large extent to which fire management can shape woody structural patterns in savanna landscapes, even over time frames as short as a decade. The structural profile changes shown here, and the quantification of carbon reduction under late dry season burning, have important implications for habitat conservation, carbon sequestration, and emission reduction initiatives in the region. © Author(s) 2019.",,"biodiversity; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate conditions; conservation status; dry season; environmental gradient; fire management; habitat conservation; habitat structure; landscape; savanna; spatial resolution; tropical region; vegetation structure; Australia; Northern Territory; Territory Wildlife Park",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064188962

Evidence is drawn from extensive parallel literature devoted to radical-based reactions involving metal ions in aqueous and carboxylate-containing media undertaken with flash photolysis and pulse radiolysis, in addition to classical photolysis and the impact of semiconductor mediated metal ion reduction (removal) from solution. A general model of homogeneous redox reactions emerges, driven by several widely recognized ubiquitous powerful reducing radicals, notably e(aq)−, H, R and CO2−. In each of the metal ion based systems, reduction to the elemental state is thermodynamically feasible, followed by trapping with excess concentrations of H, H3C and CO arising from concurrent VUV photolysis and concomitant decarboxylation of formic and/or acetic acid to yield the identified product. For complex oxyanions ([MxOy]n−), such as those of Se(vi), slow kinetics of reduction to Se0 can be overcome by the intervention of heterogeneous catalysis based on TiO2 or other “designer” semiconductor photocatalysts that facilitate rapid reactions on their surfaces, to which the metal species have adsorbed. While applications of photocatalysts are more cumbersome, they provide an alternative means of generating CO2− and other reducing radicals (derived from added carboxylic acids or alcohols serving as sacrificial oxidants), at wavelengths higher than frequently used VUV and UV-C sources, depending on the band gap of the semiconductor and the redox potential of its conduction band. As with most redox processes, the reduction potential in the system may be pH dependent, manifesting itself in several ways, including the degree of complexation in some metal-carboxylate systems, the extent of surface adsorption of species onto catalytic surfaces, the Nernstian potential of the redox couple involved and the degree of ionization of the HCOO−/CO2− couple (hence its redox potential). In the case of the halogens, either direct photochemical generation of X followed by radical-radical coupling with H3C yields the XCH3 product, or the intervention of transition metal halides which permit radical halogen-transfer from such species as FeX2+ find utility for photosynthesis of XCH3. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carboxylation; Catalysis; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Energy gap; Halogen elements; Ionization potential; Magnetic semiconductors; Metal halides; Metal ions; Photolysis; Radiation chemistry; Radiolysis; Selenium compounds; Surface reactions; Titanium dioxide; Transition metals; Catalytic surfaces; Degree of ionization; Mechanistic aspects; Photochemical generation; Radical-radical coupling; Reduction potential; Semiconductor photocatalyst; Surface adsorption; Redox reactions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063515971

Bioenergy supply chain planning methodologies can provide viable frameworks for policy-making. However, current methodologies lack the ability to simultaneously consider CO 2 emission reduction targets while designing a bioenergy supply chain. As such, the objective of this work is to present a hybrid methodology that combines both carbon emission pinch analysis with superstructure-based optimisation technique. The proposed methodology was demonstrated via a palm-based case study, focused on the state of Selangor, Malaysia. The case study was broken into two scenarios. The first scenario accounted for an output-driven energy policy, whereby the electricity output of the bioenergy supply chain network (BSCN) is prioritised and the corresponding emission reduction is analysed. Results from the first scenario suggests that the optimised BSCN with 5,040 TJ output could reduce CO 2 emission intensity by 9.71%. The second scenario focused on an emission-driven policy. Emission-driven policy establishes the emission reduction targets first and then determines the corresponding BSCN to achieve it. Results from this scenario indicate all oil palm plantations could afford to operate on low growth factors of up to 0.8 to avoid sharp drops in possible CO 2 reductions for the BSCN. This policy was explored further by conducting sensitivity analysis on the agricultural growth and biomass export factors respectively. The analyses found that the optimised BSCN experience minimal change in costs when plantations have growth factors beyond 1.1. Lastly, analysis was performed to evaluate the range of technologies chosen based on the electricity output. The analysis found that power plant technologies were favoured more as compared to combined heat and power systems. © 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Carbon emission pinch analysis; Emission-driven; Output-driven; Palm biomass; Process integration; Superstructural optimisation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062649432

We used a global model to estimate the climate and public health outcomes attributable to fossil fuel use, indicating the potential benefits of a phaseout. We show that it can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 (2.96–4.21) million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide. This could be up to 5.55 (4.52–6.52) million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Because aerosols affect the hydrologic cycle, removing the anthropogenic emissions in the model increases rainfall by 10–70% over densely populated regions in India and 10–30% over northern China, and by 10–40% over Central America, West Africa, and the drought-prone Sahel, thus contributing to water and food security. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51(±0.03) °C and all pollution particles 0.73(±0.03) °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36(±0.06) °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane. We conclude that a rapid phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources are needed to save millions of lives, restore aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, and limit global warming to 2 °C. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Adaptation tends to involve balancing selection between high growth rates and stress resistance: a trade-off in resource allocation between stress tolerance and competitive ability that determines fundamental life history strategies. The growth-cold tolerance trade-off, in particular, has been well documented for many conifers but evidence in broadleaf deciduous species is scarce. Using populations’ mean total tree height and provenance climate from range-wide provenance tests established in the USA between 1960 and 1975, we evaluate and model growth clines along climatic gradients and assess evidence of the growth rate-cold tolerance trade-off in five eastern North America broadleaf deciduous species: Acer rubrum (red maple), Betula alleghaniensis (yellow birch), Juglans nigra (black walnut), Prunus serotina (black cherry), and Quercus rubra (northern red oak). Number of populations and provenance tests in this study varies by species, ranging from 31 to70 and 4 to 8, respectively. For each species, observations were separated into two groups, those where the population was moved to a test site climate milder than at its origin, and those where the population was moved to a colder test site climate. Clines of growth potential along climate gradients were evaluated using the group of observations in which the populations had been transferred to a milder test climate, while cold-limited responses were evaluated using the observations in the group of populations moved to colder test climate. Results showed steep clines in association with temperature variables for black walnut and black cherry and less pronounced clines for red maple. Population differentiation in northern red oak and yellow birch was weak. Growth potential clines had slopes opposite to the cold-limited growth responses, providing strong evidence for the growth-cold tolerance trade-off in broadleaf deciduous species. The results show that genetic growth responses to climate will differ considerably among species and thereby demand different management strategies to mitigate climate change impacts. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Climate change responses; Ecological genetics; Growth potential-cold hardiness trade-off; Local adaptation; Provenance tests","adaptation; boreal forest; broad-leaved forest; climate change; climate conditions; cline; cold tolerance; competitive ability; deciduous forest; differentiation; ecological approach; genetic variation; growth; growth rate; life history theory; local adaptation; resource allocation; stress resistance; temperate forest; testing method; trade-off; United States; Acer rubrum; Betula alleghaniensis; Coniferophyta; Juglans nigra; Prunus serotina; Quercus rubra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062832040

One alternative to solve the problem is energy generation using vegetal-oil-based fuels, made of local raw materials that are renewable and have a lower impact on the environment. The objective of the present work was to assess the performance and emissions of a diesel engine for energy generation that operated with soybean, linseed, and crambe vegetal-oil-based fuels. The fuels were tested in a 5-kVA generator engine at a load from 750 W to 3000 W. Biofuels were obtained from a mixture of conventional diesel oil with soybean, linseed, and crambe oil at incremental levels of 10%, 30%, 50%, and 70% of vegetal oil in the fuel mixture composition. The increase in soybean oil proportion at low load (750 W) resulted in lower specific consumption. At a high load (3000 W), there was a reduction in specific consumption when compared to conventional diesel fuels.

This process provided a solution to reduce waste volume and disposal cost. Pilot-scale combustion trials were conducted for in site disposal at phytoremediation sites. The reaction mechanism of arsenic capture during pilot-scale combustion should be determined to control the arsenic emission in flue gas. This study investigated three Pteris vittata L. biomass with a disposal capacity of 600 kg/d and different arsenic concentrations from three sites in China. The arsenic concentration in flue gas was greater than that of the national standard in the trial with no emission control, and the arsenic concentration in biomass was 486 mg/kg. CaO addition notably reduced arsenic emission in flue gas, and absorption was efficient when CaO was mixed with biomass at 10% of the total weight. For the trial with 10% CaO addition, arsenic recovery from ash reached 76%, which is an ∼8-fold increase compared with the control.

Six research questions are proposed: (i) How can we improve the access to input data for hydrological and ecological modeling? (ii) What is the role of glacier and snow in modifying the hydrological services? (iii) How can we best assess hydrologic services supplies and demands with the available data and tools? (iv) What will be the impact of the main hydrologic changes on species diversity in rivers? (v) Can we meet the targets of multi-sectorial river-related policies under different climate and landuse forecasting scenarios? (vi) How detailed do ES data and models need to be to answer relevant policy questions? The above questions are tackled through an integrated framework to access, share, process, model, and deliberate on hydrologic ecosystems services. State-of-the-art models have been selected, and will be compared and improved to model different ecosystems and their services. Initial results from a first SWAT model of Switzerland and Species Distribution Models are presented. Expected outputs from various climate and land use change scenarios include rivers’ hydrology, predicted biodiversity, and the assessment of ecosystem services in terms of provisioning services (e.g. water resources), regulating services (e.g. nutrient, sediment and flood water retention), and cultural services (e.g. biodiversity, recreation).

Four Euro 4 light-duty diesel vehicles (LDVs) manufactured in Korea were driven on a chassis dynamometer and on test routes that included urban and rural roads and a motorway. NOx emissions, average speed, and acceleration were measured and calculated for each 1 km trip. We focused in particular on the possibility of vehicle malfunctions causing increased NOx emissions, and compared NOx emissions before and after the repair of faulty exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valves, which are a key NOx reduction system for LDVs. The current NOx EF for Euro 4 LDVs only estimates 27–31% of on their on-road NOx emissions, and low acceleration during the standard driving cycle is a part of the reason for this weak representativeness. Another is the lack of tools with which to monitor EGR valve degradation. Even with fully functioning EGR valve hardware, the capability of vehicles to control NOx emissions differ in laboratory and on-road conditions; it is weaker for the latter compared to the former because the software controls are different. The findings here provide insights for different regions where Euro 4 LDVs are still in use, depending on their age. For Korea and the EU, where the fleet is old, accurate assessments of the real risk of NOx emissions are beneficial in terms of increasing the effectiveness of control measures. In countries where the Euro 4 fleet is still young, comprehensive changes are recommended for the on-board diagnostic system and the subsequent maintenance of the hardware and software of EGR valve. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Driving cycle; Engine control unit (ECU) modification; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve; Portable emissions measurement system (PEMS); Relative positive acceleration (RPA)","Air pollution control equipment; Automobile manufacture; Control systems; Diesel locomotives; Dynamometers; Emission control; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Risk assessment; Roads and streets; Vehicles; Driving cycle; Engine control unit; Exhaust gas recirculation valves; Portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS); Relative positive acceleration (RPA); Exhaust gas recirculation; control system; diesel engine; equipment component; hardware; maintenance; nitric oxide; performance assessment; pollution control; road transport; software; traffic emission; acceleration; air pollution control; Article; car driving; exhaust gas; Korea; motor vehicle; priority journal; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060676198

Despite its high fuel economy potential, it emits large amounts of particulate matter (PM) because the locally rich mixture is formed at the periphery of a spark plug. Furthermore, the combustion phasing angle is not realized at MBT ignition timing, which can bring high work conversion efficiency. Since PM emission and work conversion efficiency are in a trade-off relation, this research focused on reducing PM emission through achieving high work conversion efficiency. Two intake air control strategies were examined in this research; throttle operation and late intake valve closing (LIVC). The experiment was conducted in a single cylinder spray-guided direct injection spark ignition (SG-DISI) engine with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The injected fuel amount was fixed so as to investigate the effect of each strategy. The throttle valve strategy decreased the filter smoke number (FSN) as the restriction of inhaled air was increased. By contrast, the number of particles was increased. When the LIVC strategy was applied, both FSN and the number of particles were decreased; additionally, stabilized combustion was realized. Combustion visualization was performed in an optical engine. When the throttle valve was applied, the locally rich mixture was reduced due to the low ambient pressure. As a result of inhaled air reduction, the global fuel-air ratio was increased. Therefore, randomly distributed high luminous flame was detected. In the case of LIVC, the high luminous flame was not detected near the spark plug due to its lower ambient pressure and increased in-cylinder flow. In conclusion, the LIVC strategy could achieve low PM emission with reduced sacrifice of IMEP. © 2019 SAE International.

Dedicated cardiac SPECT cameras incorporating novel, highly efficient detector, collimator, and system designs have emerged with the expansion of nuclear cardiology. Solid-state radiation detectors incorporating cadmium zinc telluride, which directly convert radiation to electrical signals and yield improved energy resolution and spatial resolution and enhanced count sensitivity geometries, are increasingly gaining favor as the detector of choice for application in dedicated cardiac SPECT systems. Additionally, hybrid imaging systems in which SPECT and PET are combined with X-ray CT are currently widely used, with PET/MRI hybrid systems having also been recently introduced. The improved quantitative SPECT/CT has the potential to measure the absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow and flow reserve. Rapid development of silicon photomultipliers leads to enhancement in PET image quality and count rates. In addition, the reduction of emission–transmission mismatch artifacts via application of accurate time-of-flight information, and cardiac motion de-blurring aided by anatomical images, are emerging techniques for further improvement of cardiac PET.

Various low reactivity gasoline-range fuels were compared with ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel (ULSD) for steady-state engine performance and emissions. Specially, particulate matter (PM) emissions were examined for their mass, size and number concentrations, and further characterized by organic/elemental carbon analysis, chemical speciation and thermogravimetric analysis. As more fuel-efficient PPCI combustion was promoted, a slight reduction in fuel consumption was observed for all gasoline-range fuels, which also had higher heating values than ULSD. Since mixing-controlled combustion dominated the latter part of the combustion process, hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were only slightly increased with the gasoline-range fuels. In contrast, soot emissions were significantly reduced with the gasoline-range fuels, including a ∼70% reduction in micro soot sensor measurements and a >50% reduction in smoke meter measurements. All gasoline-range fuel PM samples were also found to contain higher amount of volatile species and organic carbon fractions compared to ULSD PM samples as measured by thermogravimetric and EC-OC analyses. Various partially oxidized HC species and nitrophenolic compounds were also detected by TDP-GC-MS and CE-MS techniques, which indicated that more pronounced PPCI combustion occurred with the gasoline-range fuels. Overall similar PM oxidation behavior was observed despite the differences in reactivity and chemical properties of the fuels, although there may be some significant impacts under certain operating conditions. © 2019 SAE International; Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Empirical evidence has shown that high concentrations of ambient air pollutants such as CO 2 have been positively associated with an increased risk of morbidity (eg, respiratory conditions including asthma and lung cancer) and premature mortality. The purpose of this study was to examine the impacts of RGGI on death rates in infancy. Design A quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design. Setting and participants We estimated the impacts of RGGI on infant mortality from 2003 through 2014 in the USA (6 years before and after RGGI implementation). Our analytic models included state- and year-fixed effects in addition to a number of covariates. Outcome measures Death rates in infancy: neonatal mortality rates (NMRs), deaths under 28 days as well as infant mortality rates (IMRs), deaths under 1 year. Results Implementation of RGGI was associated with significant decreases in overall NMRs (a reduction of 0.41/1000 live births) and male NMRs (a reduction of 0.43/1000 live births). However, RGGI did not have a significant effect on female NMRs. Similarly, overall IMRs and male IMRs decreased significantly by 0.37/1000 live births and 0.61/1000 live births, respectively, after implementation of RGGI while female IMRs were not significantly affected by RGGI. Conclusions RGGI was associated with decreases in overall infant mortality and boy mortality through reducing air pollutant concentrations. Of note, the impact of this environmental policy on infant girls was much smaller. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.","garbon dioxide (co2); infant mortality; neonatal mortality; regional greenhouse gas initiative (rggi)","Article; birth weight; child death; female; greenhouse gas; human; infant; infant mortality; live birth; male; mortality rate; newborn; newborn mortality; quasi experimental study; United States; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; etiology; greenhouse gas; legislation and jurisprudence; perinatal death; prevention and control; sex factor; carbon dioxide; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Female; Greenhouse Gases; Humans; Infant; Infant Death; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Male; Perinatal Death; Sex Factors; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063911795

Tracking rates of bicycling and walking over time is important for assessing progress towards this goal. In the United States, most data are limited to cross-sectional self-report surveys (e.g., National Household Travel Surveys [NHTS]) or capture only the main commute mode (e.g., American Community Survey [ACS]). This study examines temporal trends (while controlling for spatial factors) of active travel in 13 US metropolitan areas between 2004 and 2016 (with 78% of counts occurring between 2010 and 2016) using repeated counts of bicycle and pedestrian traffic (n = 1319 count locations; 5554 bicycle and 5166 pedestrian counts). We used multilevel mixed-effects models to examine the multi-year trend in bicycling and walking during morning and afternoon peak periods. In the 5 out of 8 models where the temporal trend was statistically significant, we found that, on average, traffic volumes increased at a rate of 2–6% (bicycle) and 2–3% (pedestrian) per year among count locations, holding other variables constant.

Current mature calibration approaches for the VVT system are predominantly based on steady state techniques which fail to consider the engine dynamic behaviour in real world driving, which is heavily transient. In this study the total integrated fuel consumption and engine-out NOx emissions over a 2-minute segment of the transient Worldwide Light-duty Test Cycle are minimised in a constrained multi-objective optimisation framework to achieve an updated calibration for the VVT control. The cycle segment was identified as an area with high NOx emissions. The optimisation framework was developed around a Mean Value Engine Model (MVEM) with representative engine controls which was validated against an engine tested on a dynamometer. The aim of this study was to demonstrate a practical benefit without having to significantly change the existing engine control strategy. Offline optimization with the MVEM model allows exploitation of workstation computational performance to effectively explore the calibration space, reducing both time and investment in engine testing. The initial simulation optimization results show a strong dominance of both fuel and NOx objectives with a potential reduction in fuel consumption and engine out NOX emissions of up to 5% and 18% respectively compared to the original steady-state based VVT calibration. Engine experimental results have confirmed that NOX emissions can be significantly reduced without any significant detriment to fuel economy over this 2min transient. © 2019 SAE International; Ford Motor Company.

Acute effects of heat are well recognised, but there is less understanding of potential longterm adverse outcomes. Our aim was to review recent medical literature for clinical cases of environmental heatstroke with a focus on neurological outcome. Structured search strategies were designed to retrieve publications of heatstroke case reports using Ovid Medline and Embase (2000-2016). One thousand and forty-nine abstracts were identified, and after application of exclusion criteria 71 articles deemed relevant. Ninety cases were identified from 71 articles. 100% presented with acute neurological symptoms; 87.8% presented with non-neurological symptoms. 44.4% patients recovered fully, 23.3% died, 23.3% suffered convalescent or long-term neurological sequelae, and in 8.9% no long-term follow up was available. 57.1% of the patients who died or had a neurological deficit had no documented co-morbidity. Patterns of neurological deficits included 66.7% patients with motor dysfunction, 9.5% cognitive impairment, 19% both motor and cognitive impairment and 4.7% other. In total 71.4% of the impaired patients had long-term cerebellar dysfunction. Adverse long-term neurological outcomes were common in surviving patients presenting with environmental heatstroke. Permanent neurological deficits were present in 34.4% of survivors where outcome was known; many were young, healthy individuals. Cerebellar injury was common suggesting cerebellar structures are vulnerable to heat. These findings highlight that people of all ages and pre-morbid states are at risk of severe heat-related illness.

A recent study in Climatic Change by Obradovich and Guenther reported that framing responsibility for climate change in terms of collective—as opposed to personal—behaviors generated greater donations to environmental groups as well as higher self-reported levels of willingness to adopt environmentally-friendly behaviors. As East Asia is the leading emitter of greenhouse gases globally, these findings are or clear relevance to the region. Nonetheless, recent findings in cultural psychology suggest that this framing intervention may not have the same results in an East Asian cultural context. We therefore sought to determine whether these findings could be replicated in East Asia. For this study, 2085 university students in Taiwan were randomly assigned to receive either a collective responsibility priming task, a personal responsibility priming task, or a daily routine priming task (control). They were then given the opportunity to donate to a climate-related cause and asked to report on their likelihood of changing their personal behaviors to reduce carbon emissions. Participants in the collective and personal conditions donated significantly more than those in the control condition and those in the personal responsibility condition reported significantly lower probabilities of changing their behaviors than those in both the control and collective responsibility conditions. Our study provides a partial replication with a different demographic group and in a different cultural setting, strengthening the argument for collective responsibility framing and setting the stage for research into practical implementations. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Greenhouse gases; Collective responsibility; Demographic groups; Environmental groups; Lower probabilities; Partial replication; Personal behavior; Personal responsibility; University students; Climate change; climate change; collective action; greenhouse gas; local participation; mitigation; psychology; student; university sector; willingness to pay; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062936887

It confers stress tolerance in both emitting and non-emitting species and has large impacts on gene regulation as well as on atmospheric chemistry. Understanding the control of isoprene emission from plants is important to understanding plant responses to future atmospheric conditions. In this study we determined that suppression of isoprene emission from plants by high CO2 concentrations is reduced but not eliminated by high temperature. We tested whether the CO2 suppression is caused by the reduction in ATP or NADPH availability caused by triose phosphate utilization (TPU) limitation of photosynthesis at high CO2. We measured CO2 assimilation as well as several photosynthetic electron transport parameters under multiple atmospheric conditions in four plant species grown at ambient CO2. While CO2 sensitivity of isoprene emission was somewhat correlated with TPU in some species, in other species it was not. Poplar exhibited significant CO2 suppression of isoprene emission but no evidence for TPU so we investigated further, measuring the electrochromic shift that gives information on ATP synthesis and photosystem I oxidation state. In all cases photosynthetic parameters were unchanged while isoprene emission dropped in response to increasing CO2. Non-photorespiratory conditions (2% O2) led to an increase in isoprene emission at low CO2 but did not alleviate suppression by high CO2. In all measured species the combination of higher temperature along with higher CO2 concentrations led to a net increase of isoprene emission in response to a moderate scenario for temperature and CO2 concentration in 2100 in the upper Midwest. © Copyright © 2019 Lantz, Solomon, Gog, McClain, Weraduwage, Cruz and Sharkey.","chloroplast; climate change; CO2; high temperature; isoprene; triose phosphate utilization limitation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070740822

Developing an agronomic management that reduces GHG emissions while still ensuring optimum soybean yields is strongly required. Field experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 growing seasons in the Golestan province (North of Iran) to evaluate different combinations of GHG mitigation strategies for soybean cultivation. Treatments included: two tillage methods [conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (ZT)], two residue management [wheat residue removed (R − ) and wheat residue left on the system (R + )] and four levels of nitrogen (N) fertilization [0, 40, 80 and 120 kg N ha −1 (N 1 , N 2 , N 3 and N 4 , respectively)]. Soil moisture and temperature, GHG fluxes, yield and agronomic efficiency of nitrogen (AEN) were measured. The CT and R + generally caused greater CO 2 fluxes than the ZT and R − , respectively. The maximum CO 2 flux occurred in August and this was about 362.6 and 284 mg m −2 h −1 under CT-R + -N4 and ZT-R + -N 4 . Soil CO 2 emissions were higher in fertilized than non-fertilized treatments. Wheat residue left on the system under ZT reduced N 2 O emissions than CT, especially in N1. The cumulative N 2 O emissions were maximum under CT-R + -N 4 and minimum under ZTR + -N 1 (2.28 and 0.70 kg N 2 O-N ha −1 , respectively). In this study, there was no significant effect on CH 4 emissions. Soybean yield was similar among tillage systems and residue management, while N 3 in combination with wheat residue showed the highest response of seed yield. CO 2 emissions per unit of grain yield were the lowest under no-tillage associated with wheat residue mulch and nitrogen fertilizer. The results showed that GHG emissions could be mitigated in soybean crop in Iran. In particular, wheat residues left on the soil surface under no-tillage with 80 kg N ha −1 showed a reduction of GHG emissions, maintain crop yield providing environmentally-friendly option. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation tillage; Crop residue management; Environmental impact; Nitrogen fertilization; Semi-arid environment; Sustainable agriculture","Agricultural wastes; Agronomy; Amino acids; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen fixation; Plants (botany); Soil conservation; Soil moisture; Sustainable development; Conservation tillage; Crop residue management; Nitrogen fertilization; Semi-arid environments; Sustainable agriculture; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen; nitrogen fertilizer; carbon dioxide; fertilizer; methane; nitric oxide; nitrogen; alternative agriculture; carbon emission; conservation tillage; crop residue; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; management practice; nitrogen; semiarid region; soybean; sustainability; air temperature; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; conventional tillage; crop management; cropping system; grain yield; greenhouse gas; harvest; Iran; mulch; nitrous oxide emission; no tillage; nonhuman; plant residue; precipitation; priority journal; seed yield; soil moisture; soil temperature; soybean; sustainable agriculture; total organic carbon; agriculture; analysis; environmental monitoring; pollution; prevention and control; procedures; sustainable development; Golestan; Iran; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Agriculture; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Gases; Iran; Methane; Nitric Oxide; Nitrogen; Soybeans; Sustainable Development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060083318

Yet, the Agreement's implementation rulebook is still under negotiation. During this transition, from the Kyoto Protocol to the new regime under the Paris Agreement, many non-state actors are facing a high level of uncertainty. In particular, actors in the voluntary carbon market are struggling to define their new role. The business model of producing carbon credits in developing countries and selling them elsewhere is threatened. Although its financial significance and achieved emission reductions are limited, the voluntary market's role as an incubator for innovation has made it a prominent representative of non-state mitigation mechanisms. Therefore, we ask: What effects will the regime change to the Paris Agreement have on the voluntary carbon offset market (VCM) and how does it react to these effects? This study analyses perceptions of, and reactions to, the new regulatory environment within the VCM. We apply the Discursive Agency Approach to scrutinize the institutions, discourses and influential agents involved in the VCM, and the strategic practices they apply to manage the transition towards the Paris regime. We find two dominant coping strategies: to align the voluntary offsetting mechanism with the Paris Agreement, and to re-invent its overall purpose as a tool to deliver sustainable development rather than solely emission reductions. Based on these results, we outline ‘thought spaces’ for a future VCM: (1) voluntary and non-party offsetting beyond nationally determined contributions (NDCs), (2) results-based financing for emission reductions and sustainable development, and (3) private climate action under international oversight. Key policy insights The Paris Agreement threatens the VCM's business model, prompting market agents to frame and legitimize their work in new ways. The voluntary market's viability depends on the future accounting rules for emission reductions under Paris Agreement Article 6. Discursive struggles surround the risks of double counting and NDC ambitions. Based on an understanding of the past, we can draw lessons from agents’ attempts to re-legitimize their role under the new Paris Agreement; their future visions will shape the debates about this nascent regime. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agency; carbon credits; Carbon markets; climate governance; discourse; Paris Agreement","carbon emission; emissions trading; environmental policy; future prospect; governance approach; implementation process; international agreement; Kyoto Protocol; market conditions; political discourse",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058679357

This transition takes place at multiple and complementary scales, including bottom-up approaches such as community-based initiatives (CBIs). However, empirical research on CBIs has focused until now on anecdotal evidence and little work has been done to quantitatively assess their impact in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this paper, we analyze 38 European initiatives across the food, energy, transport, and waste sectors to address the following questions: How can the GHG reduction potential of CBIs be quantified and analyzed in a systematic manner across different sectors? What is the GHG mitigation potential of CBIs and how does the reduction potential differ across domains? Through the comparison of the emission intensity arising from the goods and services the CBIs provide in relation to a business-as-usual scenario, we present the potential they have across different activities. This constitutes the foundational step to upscaling and further understanding their potential contribution to achieving climate change mitigation targets. Our findings indicate that energy generation through renewable sources, changes in personal transportation, and dietary change present by far the highest GHG mitigation activities analyzed, since they reduce the carbon footprint of CBI beneficiaries by 24%, 11%, and 7%, respectively. In contrast, the potential for some activities, such as locally grown organic food, is limited. The service provided by these initiatives only reduces the carbon footprint by 0.1%. Overall, although the proliferation of CBIs is very desirable from a climate change mitigation perspective it is necessary to stress that bottom-up initiatives present other important positive dimensions besides GHG mitigation. These initiatives also hold the potential of improving community resilience by strengthening local economies and enhancing social cohesion. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon footprint; Grassroots initiatives; Greenhouse gas emissions; Low carbon economy; Sustainability transitions; Sustainable lifestyles",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055933339

Based on stakeholder interviews and content analysis of strategies and projects relevant to climate adaptation and mitigation in the cities of Copenhagen and Helsinki, we present empirical examples of synergies, conflicts and trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation that are driven by the cross-scale interactions. These examples show that jurisdictional and institutional scales shape the implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and tasks at the management scale, creating benefits of integrated solutions, but also challenges. Investigating the linkages between adaptation and mitigation through a scale framework provides new knowledge for urban climate change planning and decision-making.

Also, it dictates the thermal comfort level upon entry, air conditioning (AC) load, and fuel consumption. This study is the first attempts to experimentally evaluate the impact of integrating a solar chimney (SC) on a vehicle exposed to direct sunlight in terms of its cabin soak temperature (CST), thermal comfort, AC power, and driving ranges. Therefore, outdoor thermal soak tests on two identical vehicles were carried out. The results confirmed a significant reduction of the soak cabin temperature, decreasing the cabin soak air temperature by 20.5 °C (max). This reduction can lead to a significant effect on the initial thermal solar loads, thereby exposure time to high temperature environment (thermal stress and anxiety) can significantly be reduced, while also enhance interior air quality, improve vehicle fuel economy, an 85% reduction in compressor power, increasing driving range by 26.25 km within the city drive cycle and 17.5 km on the highway cycle while operating the AC system, and reduce tailpipe emissions while preserving the integrity of the cabin's interior from cracking and fading.

In this study the perceived level of importance of 6 urban forest ES, attitude to the forest park non-use values, and the factors influencing willingness to pay (WTP) for forest park preservation were explored through a survey conducted on January 2018 to the college students (17–28 years, n=684) from 4 universities in the City of Manila. Survey showed that air quality regulation (mean=3.73) and climate and temperature regulation (mean=3.71) were the two most important urban forest ES. Binary logistic regression showed significant relationship of WTP with natural log allowance (p=0.000), air quality regulation ES and residence (p=0.007), and option value (p=0.008).

The natural log of the positive WTP was weakly but highly significantly correlated with the natural log of students’ allowance (r=0.193, p=0.000). Male students had higher WTP than female despite the lower allowance of male students. This study provided evidence that pro-environment decision was significantly influenced by attitude and socio-economic factors.

Changes in climate are particularly relevant to the agricultural sector, given the increasing demand for food, less predictable water supplies, and more expensive energy. Among these challenges, however, are opportunities to improve human health with climate-conscious approaches to field crop production. Such opportunities may be emerging in historically productive areas in the Appalachian region of the United States including West Virginia that are often typified by food deserts. Long-term records of farm count, farm area, and crop yield data for West Virginia’s most valuable crops are presented relative to national averages to better understand emergent challenges and opportunities associated with local climate changes. Observed datasets of daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation for 18 climate observation sites in West Virginia dating back to at least 1930 were used to assess climatic trends between 1900 and 2016. To account for the regions’ complex physiography, daily data were averaged annually and spatially (all 18 sites). The maximum temperatures were shown to decrease significantly (− 0.78 °C/century; p = 0.001), whereas the minimum temperatures increased significantly (0.44 °C/century; p = 0.017), and precipitation increased (25.4 mm/century). Additionally, intra-annual variance of maximum temperatures decreased (− 0.22 °C/century), minimum temperatures increased significantly (0.39 °C/century; p = 0.041), and precipitation increased (25.4 mm/century). Observed climate trends suggest that local and regional changes in land-atmosphere interactions may result in a wetter and more temperate Appalachian climate characterized by longer growing seasons that may be supportive of a broader range of crops. Results suggest that strategically expanding local agriculture to adapt to changing climate could simultaneously improve human health and socioeconomic status in West Virginia, the broader Appalachian region, and other similar physiographic locations globally. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agriculture; Appalachia; Climate change; Climate variance; Food desert; Land-atmosphere coupling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060354794

In the Red Sea, latitudinal gradients in environmental conditions and primary production have been ascribed to fluctuations in Gulf of Aden Water inflow, upwelling/mixing, and regenerated nutrient utilization i.e. rapidly recycled nitrogen in upper layers. However, our understanding of upper layer dynamics and related changes in plankton communities, metabolism and carbon and nitrogen export is limited. We surmised that stratification and mesoscale eddies modulate the nutrient availability and taxonomic identity of plankton communities in the Red Sea. Based on remote-sensing data of sea level anomalies and high resolution in situ measurements (ScanFish) we selected stations for hydrographic CTD profiles, water sampling (nutrients, seawater oxygen stable isotopes [δ 18 O SW ]), phytoplankton and zooplankton collections. In fall 2014, strong stratification subjected the plankton community to an overall nitrogen and phosphorus shortage. The nutrient deficiency increased numbers of heterotrophic dinoflagellates, microzooplankton, and diazotrophs (Trichodesmium, diatom-diazotroph associations [DDAs]), albeit largely decreased phytoplankton and mesozooplankton abundances. In spring 2015, mesoscale eddies increased the nutrient availability, and the thermohaline characteristics and low δ 18 O SW point to the interaction of eddies with Gulf of Aden Surface Water (GASW). Cyclonic eddies and, most likely, the availability of nutrients associated with the GASW, increased the abundances of autotrophs (diatoms, Prasinophytes) and supported larger numbers of zooplankton and their larvae. We demonstrate that the interplay of stratification, advection of Gulf of Aden water and mesoscale eddies are key elements to better understand changes in plankton community composition, ecosystem metabolism, and macronutrient export in the Red Sea in space and time. © 2019 The Authors","Biogeochemistry; Circulation; Diatom-Diazotroph Associations (DDAs); Mesoscale eddies; Red Sea; Seawater oxygen stable isotopes (δ 18 O SW ); Trichodesmium","Aquatic ecosystems; Biogeochemistry; Boiler circulation; Hydrographic surveys; Isotopes; Metabolism; Nitrogen; Physiology; Phytoplankton; Plankton; Recycling; Remote sensing; Sea level; Seawater; Surface waters; Diazotroph; Mesoscale eddy; Oxygen stable isotopes; Red sea; Trichodesmium; Nutrients; aquatic ecosystem; biogeochemistry; community composition; community dynamics; diatom; dinoflagellate; environmental conditions; mesoscale eddy; mesoscale meteorology; nutrient availability; nutrient cycling; oceanic circulation; oxygen isotope; plankton; primary production; seasonal variation; seawater; stable isotope; zooplankton; Arabian Sea; Gulf of Aden; Indian Ocean; Red Sea [Indian Ocean]; Bacillariophyta; Dinophyceae; Prasinophyceae; Trichodesmium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063629831

Still, the complexity of these interactions cannot be resolved by the commonly used air quality models. By embedding the sectional aerosol module SALSA2.0 into the large-eddy simulation model PALM, a novel, high-resolution, urban aerosol modelling framework has been developed. The first model evaluation study on the vertical variation of aerosol number concentration and size distribution in a simple street canyon without vegetation in Cambridge, UK, shows good agreement with measurements, with simulated values mainly within a factor of 2 of observations. Dispersion conditions and local emissions govern the pedestrian-level aerosol number concentrations. Out of different aerosol processes, dry deposition is shown to decrease the total number concentration by over 20&thinsp;%, while condensation and dissolutional increase the total mass by over 10&thinsp;%. Following the model development, the application of PALM can be extended to local- and neighbourhood-scale air pollution and aerosol studies that require a detailed solution of the ambient flow field. © 2019.

Serving this demand, sustainability certification schemes and eco-friendly labels have become prominent mechanisms of climate governance. Smallholder farmers in Jambi province, Indonesia, producing palm oil and rubber as the two dominant smallholder crops, are impacted by this distal demand. Zimmerer et al. (2018) suggest analyzing the potential sustainability in such a context with the multilevel smallholder telecoupling framework. Applying this framework to case studies from Jambi province, our first case reveals that smallholder certification for so-called sustainable palm oil does not necessarily influence smallholder towards more sustainable management practices. One explanation might be a discrepancy in sustainability perception between sender and receiver systems. The second case is the setup of an allegedly eco-friendly rubber plantation. The establishment of this model plantation is implemented by a transnational corporation in collaboration with a nature conservation organization, impacting the access to land for adjacent smallholders. The struggle over access to land is not only negotiated between smallholders and the corporation producing ""eco-friendly"" rubber but also between smallholders and big land mammals lacking access to land since the rubber plantation began to be established. We argue that the concept of sustainability as demanded by the receiving system does not mirror management practices in the sending system, even though the products reach the Global North as supposedly socially and climate-friendly. The smallholder telecoupling framework is helpful for assessing potential sustainability but can be expanded towards conflictive spillovers, second order effects, and a mismatch in sustainability perceptions in order to draw a more comprehensive picture. © 2019 by the authors.","Multi-stakeholder initiatives; Roundtable for sustainable palm oil; Sustainability; Sustainable natural rubber initiative; Telecoupling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067107978

To help gauge these challenges to the power system, we quantify IAV of wind and solar resource and electricity generation across the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power system, then assess the IAV of wind and solar electricity generation during peak-load hours (i.e. IAV of wind and solar capacity values) for the current ERCOT wind and solar generator fleet. To do so, we leverage the long timespan of four reanalysis datasets with the high resolution of grid integration datasets. We find the IAV (quantified as the coefficient of variation) of wind generation ranges from 2.3%-11% across ERCOT, while the IAV of solar generation ranges from 1.7%-5% across ERCOT. We also find significant seasonal and regional variability in the IAV of wind and solar generation, highlighting the importance of considering multiple temporal and spatial scales when planning and operating the power system. In addition, the IAV of the current wind and solar fleets' capacity values (defined as generation during peak-load hours) are larger than the IAV of the same fleets' capacity factors. IAV of annual generation and capacity values of wind and solar could impact operations and planning in several ways, e.g. through annual emissions, meeting emission reduction targets, and investment needs to maintain capacity adequacy. © 2019 The Author(s).

Some patients who recover from the insult of acute carbon monoxide toxicity may later develop delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after a lucid period in the form of cognitive impairments, a broad spectrum of neurological deficits and affective disorders. Here, we present the first case of DNS following carbon monoxide poisoning in Sri Lanka and epidemiology of the exposure of nine (9) more victims. Case presentation: A 55-year-old patient and nine other people developed effects of carbon monoxide poisoning in two different occasions after sleeping few hours in the same room in their work place in Sri Lanka. These patients developed spectrum of symptoms with the acute carbon monoxide poisoning. However, one patient developed neurological deterioration pertaining to delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after 1 month of lucid interval. His MRI scan of the brain showed diffuse high signal intensity involving subcortical white matter, globus pallidus on FLAIR and T2W images. These areas showed high signals in DWI images with no significant changes appreciated on ADC map. There was no abnormal contrast enhancement appreciated in the above areas. EEG showed generalized slow waves. He gradually deteriorated over next 2 weeks, exhibited athetoid movements of his feet and hands and went into rigid akinetic mute state. He could not response to any stimulation and even displayed decorticated-like posture and died. Others had normal MRI brain finding at 8 weeks of acute toxicity and all were neurologically normal after 1 year. Conclusion: Though, it is uncommon in a tropical country like Sri Lanka, clinicians should have high degree of suspicion with the correct circumstances, as it is a challenge for the emergency physicians, even in countries with higher rate of CO poisoning. The exact mechanisms of acute and delayed toxicity, preventive methods and the suggested treatments are yet to be elucidated and this needs further attention and studies. © 2019 The Author(s).","Carbon monoxide poisoning; Delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae; Epidemiological study; Sri Lanka","carbidopa plus levodopa; carbon monoxide; dexamethasone; acute toxicity; adult; apparent diffusion coefficient; Article; aspiration pneumonia; athetosis; autopsy; behavior change; blood pressure; brain dysfunction; brain hemorrhage; carbon monoxide intoxication; case report; clinical article; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; confusion; contrast enhancement; delta rhythm; diarrhea; diffusion weighted imaging; drinking behavior; drowsiness; electroencephalography; environmental exposure; faintness; feces incontinence; Glasgow coma scale; globus pallidus; headache; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; hyperreflexia; lack of drug effect; lethargy; male; medical history; memory disorder; middle aged; mood disorder; mortality; neuroimaging; neurologic disease; neurologic examination; night shift; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oxygen therapy; rigidity; self care; sleep; sleep disorder; slow brain wave; Sri Lanka; teaching hospital; unconsciousness; urine incontinence; vomiting; white matter; workplace; adverse event; carbon monoxide intoxication; complication; fatality; toxicity and intoxication; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning; Environmental Exposure; Fatal Outcome; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Sri Lanka",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064139178

The local distribution of vegetation, however, depends on local edaphic conditions (soils and topography) and disturbances (fire, herbivory, and anthropogenic activities). Abrupt spatial or temporal changes in vegetation distribution can occur if there are positive (i.e., amplifying) feedbacks favoring certain vegetation states under otherwise similar climatic and edaphic conditions. Previous studies in the tropical savannas of Africa and other continents using the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation continuous fields (VCF) satellite data product have focused on discontinuities in the distribution of tree cover at different rainfall levels, with bimodal distributions (e.g., concentrations of high and low tree cover) interpreted as alternative vegetation states. Such observed bimodalities over large spatial extents may not be evidence for alternate states, as they may include regions that have different edaphic conditions and disturbance histories. In this study, we conduct a systematic multi-scale analysis of diverse MODIS data streams to quantify the presence and spatial consistency of alternative vegetation states in Sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis is based on the premise that major discontinuities in vegetation structure should also manifest as consistent spatial patterns in a range of remote sensing data streams, including, for example, albedo and land surface temperature (LST). Our results confirm previous observations of bimodal and multimodal distributions of estimated tree cover in the MODIS VCF. However, strong disagreements in the location of multimodality between VCF and other data streams were observed at 1 km scale. Results suggest that the observed distribution of VCF over vast spatial extents are multimodal, not because of local-scale feedbacks and emergent bifurcations (the definition of alternative states), but likely because of other factors including regional scale differences in woody dynamics associated with edaphic, disturbance, and/or anthropogenic processes. These results suggest the need for more in-depth consideration of bifurcation mechanisms and thus the likely spatial and temporal scales at which alternative states driven by different positive feedback processes should manifest. © 2019 by the authors.","Albedo; Alternative stable states; Land surface temperature; MODIS VCF; Savanna","Atmospheric temperature; Bifurcation (mathematics); Data mining; Forestry; Land surface temperature; Radiometers; Rain; Remote sensing; Solar radiation; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Topography; Tropics; Vegetation; Albedo; Alternative stable state; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS VCF; Multimodal distributions; Savanna; Spatial and temporal scale; Vegetation continuous fields; Spatial distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063983081

The shift from traditional crops to these food crops also leads to the problems like depletion of ground water, soil degradation and ecological imbalance (Sidhu et al 2010). Because paddy crop needs huge water but in Punjab the ground water and canal irrigated area is relatively less. The burning of residue of paddy is also challenge for the government because of air pollution and soil degradation (Sharma 2008). Irrigation facilities are the reason for adoption of this crop cycle and decline of area gram, oilseeds, cotton, vegetables and pulses. Wheat and paddy are economically secured because having MSP and other crops have fluctuations every year (Sharma 2008).Cost of production is increases because of diseases and soil degradation but there is stagnation in production and growth rate of agriculture. After 1980s every decade decline in growth rate of agriculture (Kumar and Singh 2010). The monoculture of wheat-paddy leads to excessive use natural resources and chemical use which results the depletion of ground water, soil degradation and steady growth of agriculture. The diversification will be the solution for this. Government adopts many schemes for this but there is very steady growth in this diversification. © BEIESP.","Concentration; Diversification; Punjab; Rupnagar district",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066755550

Cities are both a source of emissions and a leverage-point for the necessary transformation processes. Iceland is blessed with an ample supply of renewable energy sources. Hydropower and geothermal are widespread in the country and they dominate the country's electricity and district heating systems. Despite this huge potential, per capita emissions in Iceland are still way above levels required to meet the 2 degrees target. This is because decarbonisation processes have, so far, fallen short of addressing emissions from sectors such as waste and transportation. Against this background, this paper investigates the low carbon transition in the northern Icelandic municipality of Akureyri. With roughly 18,000 inhabitants, the town of Akureyri is the biggest urban centre in the north of the country. Here, a number of key actors have initiated an ambitious urban transformation process of local carbon flows. Based on 19 semi-structured interviews, we analysed the role of key actors and their resources and strategies. To better explore the transition's underlying mechanisms, we analysed the dynamics through the lens of the multi-level perspective (MLP), applied in a descriptive context. We found that a key factor for success of the urban transition was a strategy that integrated several previously disconnected carbon flows of the community. Important success factors were close community connections, public-private partnerships, the enthusiasm of multiple individuals who drove the process, the establishment of a strong intermediary organisation, and stable political support. The case can teach us about the challenges of transitions that integrate disconnected carbon flows in an urban context. Furthermore, it provides valuable findings on the role intermediary organisations play in these processes. © 2019 by the authors.","Green place branding; Iceland; Integrating carbon flows; Intermediary; Transition champion; Urban climate governance; Urban renewable energy; Urban sustainability; Urban transformation","alternative energy; carbon emission; climate change; electricity; energy resource; geothermal energy; global perspective; heating; integrated approach; sustainability; urban area; Iceland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064041454

This paper conducts a comprehensive review of techno-economic assumptions in the electricity sector among fifteen different global and national integrated assessment models. Particular focus is given to six major economies in the world: Brazil, China, the EU, India, Japan and the US. The comparison reveals that techno-economic characteristics are quite different across integrated assessment models, both for the base year and future years. It is, however, important to recognize that techno-economic assessments from the literature exhibit an equally large range of parameters as the integrated assessment models reviewed. Beyond numerical differences, the representation of technologies also differs among models, which needs to be taken into account when comparing numerical parameters. While desirable, it seems difficult to fully harmonize techno-economic parameters across a broader range of models due to structural differences in the representation of technology. Therefore, making techno-economic parameters available in the future, together with of the technology representation as well as the exact definitions of the parameters should become the standard approach as it allows an open discussion of appropriate assumptions. © 2019 The Authors","Capital and O&M costs; Conversion efficiency; Integrated assessment models; Levelised cost of energy; Lifetime; Techno-economic assumptions","Climate change; Conversion efficiency; Decision making; Climate change mitigation; Global integrated assessments; Integrated assessment models; Levelised cost of energies; Lifetime; Structural differences; Techno-economic assessment; Techno-economics; Climate models; climate change; cost analysis; decision making; electricity industry; energy efficiency; integrated approach; Brazil; China; India; Japan; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062412475

It is known that LiBOB increases the SEI resistance, but there is very little fundamental knowledge about the influence of LiBOB on the structure of the SEI as well as on ion and molecule transport mechanisms in the SEI. Here, we study SEIs grown at the interface between a planar glassy carbon electrode and battery electrolytes containing different amounts of LiBOB. The SEIs are characterized by a combination of FIB-SEM, AFM, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and redox probe experiments. The transport of Li+ ions and of redox molecules becomes slower with increasing LiBOB concentration in the electrolyte, but like observed for a LiBOB-free electrolyte, the effective diffusion coefficients of Li+ ions and ferrocene molecules in the SEIs are virtually identical and show the same temporal evolution after voltammetric SEI formation. This gives strong indication that both Li+ ions and molecules are transported in the liquid electrolyte phase inside the pores of the SEI and thus challenges the common view of a solid-electrolyte-type Li+ transport mechanism in SEIs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","LiBOB; Lithium ion battery; SEI; Transport","Additives; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Glass membrane electrodes; Ions; Iron compounds; Lithium compounds; Molecules; Organometallics; Seebeck effect; Solid electrolytes; Solid-State Batteries; Effective diffusion coefficients; Fluoroethylene carbonates; Glassy carbon electrodes; LiBOB; Lithium bis(oxalate)borate; Lithium bis(oxalato)borate; Solid electrolyte interphase; Transport; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061771850

In light of the changing climate, it is relevant to investigate to what extent climate change directly impacts future highly weather-dependent electricity systems. Here, we use three IPCC CO 2 concentration pathways for the period 2006–2100 with six high-resolution climate experiments for the European domain. Climate data are used to calculate bias-adjusted 3-hourly time series of wind and solar generation and temperature-corrected demand time series for 30 European countries using a state-of-the-art methodology. Weather-driven electricity system analysis is then applied to compare five key metrics of highly renewable electricity systems. We find that climate change changes the need for dispatchable electricity by up to 20%. The remaining key metrics, such as the benefit of transmission and storage as well as requirements for balancing capacity and reserves, change by up to 5%. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Globally, electricity production from wind and solar sources is increasing significantly. The increase is primarily driven by lower costs and by political efforts to mitigate climate change. Climate change, however, may radically change the weather that drives these sources of renewable energy. We find that the impact of climate change on a future highly renewable European electricity system is up to 20% for a few key metrics when compared to corresponding numbers for a historical climate scenario. In most cases, however, the relative impact is an order of magnitude smaller. The level of impact is, in general, smaller than corresponding differences from one weather year to another and also compared to differences between system designs, e.g., with different levels of international power transmission lines or different mixes of wind and solar generators. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Wind and solar sources currently drive an increased weather-dependent electricity production because of decreasing costs and efforts to mitigate climate change.

Emerging changes in global freshwater availability have been recently detected as a combined result of human interventions, natural variability and climate change. Expected future socio-economic and climatic changes will further impact freshwater resources. The quantification of the impacts is challenging due to the complexity of interdependencies between physical and socio-economic systems. This study demonstrates a vulnerability based assessment of global freshwater availability through a conceptual framework, considering transient hydro-climatic impacts of crossing specific warming levels (1.5 °C, 2 °C and 4 °C) and related socio-economic developments under high-end climate change (RCP8.5). We use high resolution climate scenarios and a global land surface model to develop indicators of exposure for 25,000 watersheds. We also exploit spatially explicit datasets to describe a range of adaptation options through sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators according to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The combined dynamics of climate and socio-economic changes suggest that although there is important potential for adaptation to reduce freshwater vulnerability, climate change risks cannot be totally and uniformly eliminated. In many regions, socio-economic developments will have greater impact on water availability compared to climate induced changes. The number of people under increased freshwater vulnerability varies substantially depending on the level of global warming and the degree of socio-economic developments, from almost 1 billion people at 4 °C and SSP5 to almost 3 billion people at 4 °C and SSP3. Generally, it is concluded that larger adaptation efforts are required to address the risks associated with higher levels of warming of 4 °C compared to the lower levels of 1.5 °C or 2 °C. The watershed scale and country level aggregated results of this study can provide a valuable resource for decision makers to plan for climate change adaptation and mitigation actions. © 2019","Adaptation; Global climate impacts; Vulnerability; Water resources","Decision making; Economics; Global warming; Water; Water resources; Adaptation; Climate change adaptation; Conceptual frameworks; Global climate impact; Global sustainability; Socio-economic development; Socio-economic systems; Vulnerability; Climate models; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; global perspective; land surface; socioeconomic status; sustainability; vulnerability; water availability; watershed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061127217

Water is one of the important compounds that which influences the human life. Initially, mankind used water for domestic purposes such a drinking, cooking, washing. However the present uses of water may be classified as domestic, public, commercial and industrial. Due to fast growth of industries, population and large quantity use of different chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides in producing crops are causing heavy and rapid pollution in aquatic environment leading to deterioration of water condition and depletion of aquatic biota. Due to use of polluted water, human suffers from water borne diseases. It is need and compulsion to check the water pollutants at regular interval of time. The water may consist of pollutants and toxic metals which are injurious and damage thehumanhealth. Thebelow are common characteristics of potable water pollutants and examples of each parameter: Physicalpollutants initially impact theappearance or other physical properties of water. Examples of physical pollutants are sediment or organic material settled down in the water of lakes, rivers and streams from transportation of soil and erosion. Chemicalcontaminants are elements or compounds. Chemical pollutants are naturally occurring or man-made. Majority of the chemical pollutants are man-made Examples of chemical contaminants include nitrogen, bleaching, salts, pesticides used in different places, metals, toxins produced by bacteria, and human or animal drugs are caused chemical contamination. Biologicalpollutants and contaminants are organisms in water. They are also referred to as microbes or microbiological contaminants. Examples of biological or microbial contaminants include bacteria, viruses, protozoan, and parasites. Radiologicalcontaminants are radioactive elements with an unbalanced number of protons and neutrons resulting in unstable atoms that can emit ionizing radiation. Examples of radiological contaminants include cesium, plutonium and uranium. The condition of water compound, generally examined according to its physical, chemical and biological agents. Water samples are collected from different sources and the different required water characteristics, and required parameters that may be tested include temperature, pH, turbidity, salinity, nitrates and phosphates, generally all required parameters may be tested. An assessment of the aquatic macro invertebrates can also provide an indication of water quality.

However, the deployment of renewable energies at scale requires not only public but also private capital, such as foreign direct investment (FDI). Many countries with favourable conditions for renewables, such as the countries of the Middle East and North African (MENA) region, are not attracting sufficient FDI. Risk perceptions of FDI stakeholders are one of the reasons. This paper discusses the de-risking approach as a possible tool to address subjective risk perceptions and assesses with a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model macroeconomic feedback-effects of employing a de-risking strategy for FDI into a particular kind of renewable electricity (RES-E) technology, concentrated solar power, in the MENA region. Our results show that the application of a de-risking approach reduces the costs for deployment of CSP, and therefore, also volumes of subsidies that would be needed to make CSP cost competitive with fossil fuel based electricity generation. This, in turn, leads to positive GDP and welfare effects in the MENA region. Our results allow us developing of recommendations for energy policy the implementation of the de-risking approach as a potential consensual option with high political feasibility to reduce climate change mitigation costs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","De-risking approach; Foreign direct investment; Middle East and North African region; Renewable energy sources","Cost reduction; Developing countries; Energy policy; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Investments; Natural resources; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Solar energy; Climate change mitigation; Computable general equilibrium model; Concentrated solar power; De-risking; Electricity generation; Foreign direct investments; Middle East; Renewable energy source; Climate change; alternative energy; climate change; cost analysis; developing world; energy policy; foreign direct investment; renewable resource; Middle East; North Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059147603

Recent studies have suggested that maternal exposure to air pollution and high and low ambient temperatures may increase the risk of preterm birth, whereas proximity to green space may decrease it. This review summarizes these findings and suggests avenues for further research. Recent findings Particulate matter may be associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, but the magnitude of the effect remains unclear. Heat and cold likely increase the risk of preterm birth, with stronger evidence for heat. The first and third trimesters may be sensitive periods for exposure to both temperature and particulate matter, but the underlying biological mechanisms are incompletely understood. Context-appropriate green space can substantially reduce particulate matter levels and mitigate urban heat islands. Summary In a warming, urbanizing world, exposure to unusual temperatures and elevated particulate matter levels represent an increasing risk for pregnant women. Green infrastructure might help mitigate this risk, but further research is needed to confirm its effects in complex urban environments and evaluate the contribution of both indoor and outdoor particulate matter and air temperature to personal exposure and preterm birth.

The experimental studies were accompanied with DFT/TDDFT calculations. DSC investigations showed that both the free ligands and Re(I) complexes melted at high temperature (164–309 °C) and some of them are able to form amorphous materials. CV measurements revealed that energy band gaps calculated on the basis of ionization potential and electron affinity of the Re(I) complexes, which are correlated with energy levels of frontier molecular orbitals, fall in the range of 2.14–2.32 eV, being lower than the corresponding ligands, what makes the complexes promising for organoelectronic applications. The photophysical properties of the synthesized triimine ligands and Re(I) complexes were studied in detail by electronic absorption and emission. In solution they exhibited photoluminescence quantum yields ranging from 0.15% to 84.42% depending on the chemical structure. The presence of pyrazine units significantly reduced ability for radiative emission. All the compounds were emissive also in a solid state. Preliminary tests of electroluminescence ability demonstrated that most of the devices with Re(I) complexes exhibited red or orange emission, while diodes with ligands showed maximum of emission band located mainly in the green region.

Because many of these fungi have only recently been discovered and sequenced, the independent and interactive responses of plants and their fungal symbionts to a warming climate is an area of active research. Here we describe a conceptual framework linking the range of phenotypic plasticity and rates of shifts in community composition of each symbiont (plants and fungal leaf endophytes) to overall changes in abundance of each organism in a 26-year-long warming experiment in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. In this system, leaf endophytic fungi exhibit large plasticity in growth rates in response to experimental warming in the laboratory, but no shifts in composition after 26years of warming in the field. Instead, fungal composition in the field changed in response to plant species composition. In contrast, the C3 grasses examined in this study shifted in composition in response to field warming within 4years. In addition, the abundance of individual fungi was much more variable among field temperatures than that of plants. Overall, we find support that fungi are potentially more phenotypically plastic in response to warming whereas plants are more likely to shift composition. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To increase the spatial coverage, methane observations are increasingly made from satellites that retrieve the column-averaged dry air mole fraction of methane (XCH4). To understand and quantify the spatial differences of the seasonal cycle and trend of XCH4 in more detail, and to ultimately help reduce uncertainties in methane emissions and sinks, we evaluated and analyzed the average XCH4 seasonal cycle and trend from three Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) retrieval algorithms: National Institute for Environmental Studies algorithm version 02.75, RemoTeC CH4 Proxy algorithm version 2.3.8 and RemoTeC CH4 Full Physics algorithm version 2.3.8. Evaluations were made against the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) retrievals at 15 TCCON sites for 2009-2015, and the analysis was performed, in addition to the TCCON sites, at 31 latitude bands between latitudes 44.43°S and 53.13°N. At latitude bands, we also compared the trend of GOSAT XCH4retrievals to the NOAA's Marine Boundary Layer reference data. The average seasonal cycle and the non-linear trend were, for the first time for methane, modeled with a dynamic regression method called Dynamic Linear Model that quantifies the trend and the seasonal cycle, and provides reliable uncertainties for the parameters. Our results show that, if the number of co-located soundings is sufficiently large throughout the year, the seasonal cycle and trend of the three GOSAT retrievals agree well, mostly within the uncertainty ranges, with the TCCON retrievals. Especially estimates of the maximum day of XCH4 agree well, both between the GOSAT and TCCON retrievals, and between the three GOSAT retrievals at the latitude bands. In our analysis, we showed that there are large spatial differences in the trend and seasonal cycle of XCH4. These differences are linked to the regional CH4 sources and sinks, and call for further research. © 2019 by the authors.","GOSAT; Greenhouse gas; Methane; Remote sensing; Seasonal cycle; TCCON; Trend","Boundary layers; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Tellurium compounds; Weather satellites; Environmental studies; Evaluation and analysis; GOSAT; Greenhouse gases observing satellites; Marine boundary layers; Seasonal cycle; TCCON; Trend; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069843988

The chabazite-structured SSZ-13-based catalysts enabled the wide implementation of urea-SCR technology for mobile applications due to their robust thermal stability up to 750°C compared to the thermally unstable ZSM-5-based technologies. However, the thermally stable Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst starts losing its initial activity with the increase of aging time at 850°C, where the SCR catalyst on SDPF can possibly be exposed during filter regeneration under a drop-to-idle (DTI) condition. Therefore, more durable SCR catalysts that survive under higher temperatures have been strongly desired in automotive industry. Recently, we found Cu-exchanged high silica LTA revealed an excellent hydrothermal stability. In this study, our work successfully demonstrated the hydrothermally ultra-stable Cu/LTA catalyst that can potentially become a good candidate for the next generation SDPF application that enables tighter real-world driving emission requirement. After hydrothermal aging at 900°C for 12h, the NOx reduction over the Cu/LTA catalyst is superior to those of the state-of-the-art Cu/SSZ-13 based commercial catalyst in the entire reaction temperature. Furthermore, the Cu/LTA catalyst can maintain remarkable high-temperature NOx conversion after lean/rich cyclic aging at 620°C, due to the low oxidation of NH3 to NO. More stable NH3 storage capacity of Cu/LTA upon hydrothermal aging compared to the case for Cu/SSZ-13 will provide an additional benefit in integrating the on-board urea dosing control for the maximum system performance. Finally, the performance of the Cu/LTA catalyst under the simulated dynamic WLTC mode test will be presented. We believe that these enhanced features will help improving the future lean NOx aftertreatment systems under the real-world driving conditions. © 2019 SAE International.

The objective of this study is to develop an analytical method for determining PAHs, OCPs and PCBs in ambient PM2.5 using selective pressurized liquid extraction (SPLE). To maximize the extraction efficiency of target analytes, the extraction parameters of SPLE, particularly solvent type, temperature, static time, and cycle number, were optimized. The highest recoveries were observed under the conditions of dichloromethane:acetone (9:1), 100℃ 5 min of static time, and 1 cycle extraction, which is selected as the optimal method of SPLE. In the method validation, the results showed that the suggested method can quantify 17 PAHs, 20 OCPs, and 63 PCBs in PM2.5. Using urban dust SRM (1648a) and ambient PM2.5 samples, the applicability of the method was also confirmed. Total concentration of PAHs was the highest (2639.42–7377.75 pg/m 3 ) followed by OCPs (80.57–674.69 pg/m 3 ) and PCBs (1.39–9.34 pg/m 3 ). Most of the PAHs were detected, whereas 2–7 compounds among 20 OCPs and 2–6 compounds among 63 PCBs were determined. The developed analytical method is highly efficient in terms of process (a one-step extraction process), time (15 min extraction time per one sample) and solvent usage (less than 30 mL per one sample), showing good performance. This method can be applied to investigate the organic toxicants in PM2.5, and it can contribute to monitoring and risk assessment, leading to an effective risk management policy for PM2.5 in Korea. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry; Organochlorine pesticides; PM2.5; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Pressurized liquid extraction","Acetone; Air pollution; Dichloromethane; Dust; Extraction; Gas chromatography; Hydrocarbons; Liquid chromatography; Liquids; Mass spectrometry; Mineral oils; Pesticides; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Risk assessment; Risk management; Extraction efficiencies; Organochlorine pesticides; PM2.5; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Pressurized liquid extraction; Selective pressurized liquid extractions; Tandem mass spectrometry; Organic pollutants; acetone; dichloromethane; organochlorine pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; solvent; polychlorinated biphenyl; air pollutant; air temperature; ambient air; analytic method; analytical parameters; Article; concentration (parameter); dust; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; extraction time; gas chromatography; Korea; particulate matter; priority journal; process optimization; risk assessment; risk management; selective pressurized liquid extraction; tandem mass spectrometry; urban area; validation study; analysis; liquid liquid extraction; mass fragmentography; particulate matter; pollutant; procedures; tandem mass spectrometry; Environmental Pollutants; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Liquid-Liquid Extraction; Particulate Matter; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059673142

Baglica, Etimesgut, Ankara, 06810, Turkey","Along with continuing the efforts of decoupling CO2 emissions from sustainable development, exergy-rational cities are becoming universally important. This statement does not mean that energy rationality and energy efficiency are ignored. But it is a fact that the mission of the First-Law of Thermodynamics has been almost completed in a pretty good rate of success. Because the Second-Law is especially important and often ignored in geothermal energy, especially for low-enthalpy sources, now it is time to analyze such systems in terms of exergy. Within this context, ORC systems, which are touted as useful systems for utilizing low-enthalpy geothermal resources and ground-source heat pumps, are critically analyzed. In this context, two cases regarding an ORC, which is used only for power generation without utilizing its waste heat and a heat pump operating on grid power, were examined and was concluded that they are not exergetically sustainable, if they operate as individual systems. This study developed an analytical model, which reveals with case studies and examples that a broad hybridization of combining geothermal energy-based ORC technology, heat pumps, absorption units, thermal storage, and other renewable energy resources, like solar and wind provides sustainable and exergetically rational design solutions. New evaluation and rating metrics based on Rational Exergy Management Model were introduced. The option of incorporating low-enthalpy geothermal energy resources at about 80°C to support the model is evaluated. The Hydrogen City model is applied to a new settlement area with an expected 200,000 inhabitants to find that the proposed model can enable a nearly net-zero exergy district status. The results have implications for settlements using geothermal energy and hydrogen energy together towards meeting net-zero targets.Such an enrichment of the multiple systems even in a simplistic manner in an exergy economy cycle analytically reduces CO2 emissions by about 66%, when compared to a conventional district energy system utilizing natural gas. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Enthalpy; Exergy; Gas emissions; Geothermal fields; Heat storage; Renewable energy resources; Waste heat; District energy systems; First law of thermodynamics; Geothermal resources; Individual systems; Management Model; Multiple systems; Solar and winds; Thermal storage; Geothermal heat pumps",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064856243

These projects are regularly evaluated against their core objective of conserving carbon stocks, but their contribution to biodiversity conservation has rarely been assessed. To assess the conservation value of the area and the relative performance of a REDD+ land use plan in Yaeda Valley, a semi-arid savannah ecosystem in northern Tanzania, we implemented an annual wildlife monitoring scheme. Based on direct sightings and indirect signs of wildlife, obtained from stratified walking transects conducted annually from 2015–2018, we estimated annual trends of mammal species richness and wildlife densities in three REDD+ and three non-REDD+ land-use strata. Our surveys document a near complete mammal community in the area. Species accumulation curves, and subsequent statistical comparisons, indicated highest mammal species richness in the woodland habitats (both REDD+ and non REDD+ strata) as compared to more human and livestock impacted areas, and suggested constant species richness from 2015–2018. To estimate stratum- and year-specific livestock and wildlife densities (cattle, donkey, goat and sheep combined, Thomson’s gazelle, Kirk’s dik-dik) and wildlife sign densities (aardvark, bushbuck, bushpig, Kirk’s dik dik, eland, elephant, Maasai giraffe, greater kudu, hyena, impala, lesser kudu, warthog, wildebeest, Plains zebra), we fitted species-specific detection functions in a distance sampling framework. Species-specific densities varied between 2015 and 2018 and showed substantial increases and occasional declines in other species-stratum combinations. However, population growth rates were not systematically associated with specific land-use strata. Although our results do not explicitly provide evidence that REDD+ land-use plans directly co-benefit wildlife conservation, they show that REDD+ areas have the potential to maintain intact wildlife assemblages. To ensure effective long-term conservation outcomes, we advocate for a more formal integration of wildlife conservation goals in the REDD+ scheme. © 2019 Kiffner et al.

The alternative asphalt binder used in this study is AP Soil 600, which is a pre-activated polymer that reacts with water. One of the advantages of a polymer-based pavement is reduced heat absorption that could effectively reduce pavement temperatures as well as the reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases (such as CO 2 ) during and after construction. The natural color of the polymer is light brown, which has higher albedo than asphalt concrete and as a result reflects more of the solar radiation that falls on the pavement. This study presents a methodology to design the mix constituents, polymer, and water content including the optimum curing and compaction processes. Performance testing was conducted to evaluate the polymer-based mixes’ mechanical strength under compression, indirect tension, and resistance to rutting as compared to conventional asphalt mixes. The impact of curing process of the polymer samples on the unconfined compressive strength, indirect tensile strength, and rutting were comparatively evaluated. The results indicated that polymer-based mixes can meet the demand for low volume road construction considering their relative easy workability, increasing strength in dry conditions, and environmental benefits. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative asphalt binder; Compressive strength; Indirect tensile strength; Polymer road pavement; Rutting","Asphalt; Binders; Compressive strength; Curing; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Pavements; Polymers; Solar radiation; Asphalt binders; Environmental benefits; Indirect tensile strength; Pre-activated polymers; Road pavements; Rutting; Unconfined compressive strength; Urban Heat Island Effects; Tensile strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060911169

This results in reduced carbon emission, consumer electricity cost, and increased grid sustainability. Most of the existing DSM techniques ignore priority defined by consumers. In this paper, we present priority-induced DSM strategy based on the load shifting technique considering various energy cycles of an appliance. The day-ahead load shifting technique proposed is mathematically formulated and mapped to multiple knapsack problem to mitigate the rebound peaks. The autonomous energy management controller proposed embeds three meta-heuristic optimization techniques; genetic algorithm, enhanced differential evolution, and binary particle swarm optimization along with optimal stopping rule, which is used for solving the load shifting problem. Simulations are carried out using three different appliances and the results validate that the proposed DSM strategy successfully shifts the appliance operations to off-peak time slots, which consequently leads to substantial electricity cost savings in reasonable waiting time, and also helps in reducing the peak load demand from the smart grid. In addition, we calculate the feasible regions to show the relationship between cost, energy consumption, and delay. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Demand side management; Home energy management; Knapsack; Meta-heuristic algorithms; Smart grid","Combinatorial optimization; Cost reduction; Demand side management; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy management; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Binary particle swarm optimization; Demand Side Management (DSM); Home energy managements; Knapsack; Meta heuristic algorithm; Meta-heuristic optimization techniques; Multiple knapsack problem; Smart grid; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048703560

The study included six GCIP projects that are DC solar water pump, bitsym watersense device, jal-bujh device, BOLT bike, biomass cooking stove, and dry bio-waste gasifier. A simplified version of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method for estimating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fuel consumption was used. Research was conducted in three stages—data collection through questionnaires and interviews, environmental analysis by calculating carbon footprints of Business as usual (BAU) and emission reduction by replacing BAU with GCIP projects, and economic analysis by estimating Payback period in case of technology adoption and replacement. Results indicated that all projects have capacity to cut down carbon emissions, among which solar pump can contribute (0.32%) in carbon emission reduction followed by bitsym watersense device (7%), jal-bujh device (61.8%), BOLT bike (0.48%), biomass stove (7.2%), and agriculture dry biomass gasifier (23.2%), making gross annual CO2 reduction of 176.76tCO2e/annum.

Due to greater plant efficiency, such HRIs could lead to increased generation and emissions, known as an emissions rebound effect. The EPA Regulatory Impact Analysis for the ACE and other analyses to date have not quantified the magnitude and extent of an emissions rebound. We analyze the estimated emissions rebound of carbon dioxide (CO2) and criteria pollutants sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NO X ), using results from the EPA's power sector model, under the ACE in 2030 at model coal plants and at the state and national levels compared to both no policy and the CPP. We decompose emissions changes under a central illustrative ACE scenario and find evidence of a state-level rebound effect. Although the ACE reduces the emissions intensity of coal plants, it is expected to increase the number of operating coal plants and amount of coal-fired electricity generation, with 28% of model plants showing higher CO2 emissions in 2030 compared to no policy. As a result, the ACE only modestly reduces national power sector CO2 emissions and increases CO2 emissions by up to 8.7% in 18 states plus the District of Columbia in 2030 compared to no policy. We also find that the ACE increases SO2 and NO X emissions in 19 states and 20 states plus DC, respectively, in 2030 compared to no policy, with implications for air quality and public health. We compare our findings to other model years, additional EPA ACE scenarios, and other modeling results for similar policies, finding similar outcomes. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the emissions rebound effect and its effect on sub-national emissions outcomes in evaluating the ACE and similar policies targeting HRIs. © 2019 The Author(s).

In our case, we model emission load profiles at the regional or city level. However, we found missing values, redundancy and inconsistency in the datasets, and in most cases data preprocessing is unavoidable. Data pre-processing converts the data into a clean and tidy dataset for the subsequent modelling steps or statistical analyses. Therefore, some common techniques for data pre-processing such as cleaning, transformation, integration, reduction and some terms in data mining such as filtering and selection have been applied in our case study. We usually do the data pre-processing of moderate problems and a small amount of data using a spreadsheet application, whereas we use the programming language to do the more complex and big data size tasks. As a result, it has been found that understanding the nature of our data collection, the data flow process and the desired output comprehensively is the key for efficiency in data pre-processing. The applied techniques have helped us to provide the proper input for modelling the regional emission load profile efficiently. © 2019 IEEE.","Cleaning; Data pre-processing; Emissions; Integration; Load profile; Modelling; Reduction; Selection; Transformation","Cleaning; Data acquisition; Data mining; Integration; Metadata; Models; Particulate emissions; Reduction; Data collection; Data preprocessing; Data-sources; Load profiles; Missing values; Selection; Spreadsheet applications; Transformation; Data integration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072826852

This study, describes the state-of-the-art of cement modelling in IAMs, suggests possible improvements and discusses the impacts of these on energy and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the IMAGE global IAM. It is found that two cement-sector specific GHG mitigation measures are often not explicitly accounted for in IAMs, namely: (i) retrofitting and (ii) reducing the clinker to cement ratio. For retrofitting, many measures are identified as cost-effective and when incorporating these in the IMAGE model overall energy use reduces between 2010 and 2035 by 9.8 and 11 EJ (4% and 5%) under the baseline and GHG mitigation scenarios, respectively. When incorporating the clinker to cement ratio by linking material availability to the activities in the steel industry and coal-fired power plants, the 2050 energy use reduces by 15% under the baseline scenario and increases by 9% under the GHG mitigation scenario as fewer coal-fired power plants are in operation. This is even more prominent in the long term. The 2100 energy use is 14% higher in the GHG mitigation scenario as even fewer coal-fired power plants are used drastically limiting the potential for clinker substitution with fly ash. These results highlight the importance of capturing cross-sectoral relationships between industries and of including sector specific mitigation measures in long-term energy models. © 2019","Cement industry; Clinker to cement ratio; Energy efficiency; Integrated Assessment Models; Retrofitting; Supplementary cementitious materials","Cement industry; Cements; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fly ash; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Image enhancement; Industrial emissions; Mining; Retrofitting; Steelmaking; Clinker to cement ratio; Coal-fired power plant; Global integrated assessments; Integrated assessment models; Material availability; Mitigation measures; State of the art; Supplementary cementitious material; Coal industry; carbon emission; cement (construction material); coal-fired power plant; construction industry; energy efficiency; energy use; environmental assessment; greenhouse gas; industrial technology; long-term change; mitigation; numerical model; power plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062021649

This is important for evaluating composting as a waste management option and for understanding how changes to current composting management practices could help reduce emissions. This study uses micrometeorological mass balance (MMB) and open flow-through chamber techniques to measure emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from a windrow of composting green-waste in Northern California. The MMB technique yielded mean upwind–downwind concentration differences over the study period that showed sourcing of all three GHGs. CO2 showed a stronger signal than CH4 and N2O. A strong diel pattern was found in the concentration differences at lower levels and fluxes of CO2, with substantial noise likely obscuring any possible daily patterns for CH4 and N2O. Fluxes normalized by the time since the previous turn event revealed an initial rapid rise in CO2 concentration differences (at lower levels) and fluxes, peaking close to 13 h after the turn event followed by a gradual decline. The same pattern was not as clear for the other two gases but overall declines in concentration differences and fluxes were apparent with increasing time since the previous turn event. Substantial differences between MMB and chamber calculated fluxes were found, due to both differences in the techniques as well as sampling frequency. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; CO2 concentration; Composting process; Greenhouse gas fluxes; Management practices; Measurements of; Nitrous oxide; Sampling frequencies; Waste management options; Waste treatment; chemical mass balance; composting; concentration (composition); equipment; flux measurement; greenhouse gas; measurement method; micrometeorology; waste technology; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065669589

Biodiversity conservation could therefore be a critical aspect of climate mitigation policies. There is, however, limited understanding of the role of individual species for this relationship, which could aid in focusing conservation efforts and forest management planning. This study characterizes the functional specialization and redundancy for 95% of all tree species (basal area weighted percentage) in a diverse tropical forest in the central Congo Basin and relates this to species' abundance, contribution to aboveground carbon, and maximum size. Functional characterization is based on a set of traits related to resource acquisition (wood density, specific leaf area, leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content, and leaf stable carbon isotope composition). We show that within both mixed and monodominant tropical forest ecosystems, the highest functional specialization and lowest functional redundancy are solely found in rare tree species and significantly more in rare species holding large-sized individuals. Rare species cover the entire range of low and high functional redundancy, contributing both unique and redundant functions. Loss of species supporting functional redundancy could be buffered by other species in the community, including more abundant species. This is not the case for species supporting high functional specialization and low functional redundancy, which would need specific conservation attention. In terms of tropical forest management planning, we argue that specific conservation of large-sized trees is imperative for long-term maintenance of ecosystem functioning. © 2019 The Authors.

Using a transdisciplinary approach, we combined scientific and technical knowledge to evaluate nine environmental pressures in terms of ecosystem services in European farmland and assessed the carbon storage potential of suitable agroforestry systems, proposed by regional experts. First, regions with potential environmental pressures were identified with respect to soil health (soil erosion by water and wind, low soil organic carbon), water quality (water pollution by nitrates, salinization by irrigation), areas affected by climate change (rising temperature), and by underprovision in biodiversity (pollination and pest control pressures, loss of soil biodiversity). The maps were overlaid to identify areas where several pressures accumulate. In total, 94.4% of farmlands suffer from at least one environmental pressure, pastures being less affected than arable lands. Regional hotspots were located in north-western France, Denmark, Central Spain, north and south-western Italy, Greece, and eastern Romania. The 10% of the area with the highest number of accumulated pressures were defined as Priority Areas, where the implementation of agroforestry could be particularly effective. In a second step, European agroforestry experts were asked to propose agroforestry practices suitable for the Priority Areas they were familiar with, and identified 64 different systems covering a wide range of practices. These ranged from hedgerows on field boundaries to fast growing coppices or scattered single tree systems. Third, for each proposed system, the carbon storage potential was assessed based on data from the literature and the results were scaled-up to the Priority Areas. As expected, given the wide range of agroforestry practices identified, the carbon sequestration potentials ranged between 0.09 and 7.29 t C ha −1 a −1 . Implementing agroforestry on the Priority Areas could lead to a sequestration of 2.1 to 63.9 million t C a −1 (7.78 and 234.85 million t CO 2eq a −1 ) depending on the type of agroforestry. This corresponds to between 1.4 and 43.4% of European agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, promoting agroforestry in the Priority Areas would contribute to mitigate the environmental pressures identified there. We conclude that the strategic and spatially targeted establishment of agroforestry systems could provide an effective means of meeting EU policy objectives on GHG emissions whilst providing a range of other important benefits. © 2019 The Authors","Carbon storage; Climate change mitigation; Ecosystem services; Farmland; Resource protection; Spatial deficit analysis","agroforestry; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; ecosystem service; environmental policy; mitigation; resource management; spatial analysis; Denmark; France; Greece; Italy; Romania; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062387086

We examined grassland responses to a long-term drought on the Darling Downs, eastern Australia, using the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), a remotely sensed measure of primary productivity. This extreme drought period had rainfall deficits comparable to the hottest and driest projected climate change scenarios for 2030 and was followed by extreme rainfall. This juxtaposition allowed investigation of grassland dynamics (decline and recovery) under extreme climatic variability. Our aim was to determine whether factors associated with grassland decline during extreme drought are the same as those that drive recovery post drought. There is limited knowledge about whether the determinants of grassland decline and recovery are consistent, but this information is important for understanding how best to reduce grassland decline, without inhibiting recovery. We calculated EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) trends at 2549 grassland sites situated in an agricultural landscape and used boosted regression trees to model these against multiple hydro-climatic and land use factors. As anticipated, hydro-climatic variables were key drivers of EVI trends in both the drought and wet phases, with higher soil moisture corresponding to less decline in the drought phase and enhanced recovery in the wet phase; however, land use and plant trait variables were also important predictors of EVI trends. Higher proportions of dryland agriculture in the local landscape, high C3:C4 ratios and lower proportions of woody vegetation in the local landscape were associated with negative EVI trends (i.e. greater decline) during drought, but had inverse or negligible effects during the post drought recovery phase. Our results suggest that mitigating decline and fostering grassland recovery following drought requires considering multiple hydro-climatic, land use and plant trait drivers and how their importance changes under drought and wet phases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Extreme weather; Millennium drought; Pasture; Remote sensing; Resilience","agricultural land; agricultural production; agrometeorology; drought stress; dryland farming; ecosystem resilience; extreme event; grassland; land use change; pasture; precipitation intensity; remote sensing; soil moisture; vegetation index; woody plant; Australia; Darling Downs; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059685666

However, a long-term view of this interaction requires a great amount of computational time. In this work a cost-effective methodology is proposed to surpass this shortcoming and estimate bed level evolution. The technique is relied on an objective criterion to assess spectral wave time series of wave height, period and direction and identify the wave conditions that contribute to the initiation of sediment movement. After implementing the so-called Shields criterion, the full wave climate is reduced to two classes of representative wave conditions: the over-critical ones, mainly responsible for long-term erosion, and the sub-critical wave conditions. By applying a well-known process-based model, the representative wave conditions are used as input for the wave-current-sediment transport simulation and rates of bed level changes are obtained, on the basis of which the long-term effects of waves on beach erosion are estimated. Taking into account that erosion is a threatening phenomenon along the sandy beaches of Mediterranean Sea, the present method is demonstrated at a sandy coast of Sitia Bay, Crete. The bed levels derived from the proposed methodology and the full time series are compared. The results indicate reasonable agreement at the selected locations with deviations under 7%, and conformity of the tendency of seabed evolution, rendering the new methodology a useful tool. © 2018 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences","Beach erosion; Bed level evolution; Shields criterion; Sitia-Crete coast; Wave/current modelling","beach erosion; modeling; sediment transport; wave climate; wave height; wave-current interaction; Aegean Islands; Crete [Greece]; Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059536937

In demanding applications with highly transient operating profiles, however, premix gas engines have disadvantages compared to diesel engines because of the potential for knocking and misfire to occur. Operating a gas engine using the diesel cycle requires high gas injection pressures. Furthermore, a source of ignition is needed due to the high autoignition temperature of methane. State-of-the-art solutions inject a small quantity of diesel fuel before introducing the natural gas. One monofuel alternative ignites the gas jets with flame torches that originate in a prechamber. This paper presents the simulation based development of a prechamber ignited high pressure direct injection (HPDI) gas combustion concept and subsequent experimental validation. After the most promising arrangement of the prechamber and the high pressure gas injector was selected, the main focus was on optimizing the prechamber geometry and prechamber operating conditions. 3D simulation models were set up to determine the optimal geometry of the prechamber combustion volume as well as the number, size and shape of the channels connecting the prechamber to the main combustion chamber. The prechamber optimization targets include trapped fuel mass and mixture quality in the prechamber. Combustion of the gas jets was predicted with the ECFM-3Z model under the assumption of ideal injection rates. The results of the 3D simulation were transferred to a 1D multicylinder engine model to generate statements about engine efficiency and to provide boundary conditions for experimental validation. The best prechamber design was selected for prototype manufacturing and testing on the single cylinder research engine.

PEV GHG intensity can vary over time (and regionally), making it unclear how policymakers should regulate PEVs in the short and long-term. To explore this uncertainty, we model the short-term (Study 1) and long-term (Study 2) well-to-wheels GHG intensity of PEVs in three regions with very different electricity grid profiles: the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. Study 1 uses empirical data on vehicle preferences, driving patterns, and recharge access from a representative survey of new vehicle buyers in Canada (n = 1754) to construct a temporally-explicit model of PEV usage in 2015. Fleet-wide emissions intensity of PEVs varies substantially between regions, with the greatest reduction potential relative to conventional gasoline vehicles seen in British Columbia (78–98%), followed by Ontario (58–92%) and Alberta (34–41%). Study 2 simulates the potential long-term dynamics of technology, behavior, and emissions with the CIMS energy-economy model. With the emissions intensity of electricity decreasing by at least one-third by 2050 and vehicle energy efficiency improving over time, simulation results find that, compared to 2015, 2050 fleet average PEV emissions are 40–52% lower in British Columbia, 57–74% lower in Alberta, and 36–46% lower in Ontario. Overall, we find that PEVs offer substantial GHG emissions benefits compared to conventional vehicles in all scenarios explored. Policy makers seeking deep GHG cuts may want to support PEV adoption, even in jurisdictions that presently use relatively carbon-intensive electricity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Consumer behavior; Greenhouse gas emissions; Passenger vehicles; Plug-in electric vehicles; Well-to-wheel","Climate change; Consumer behavior; Electric automobiles; Energy efficiency; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Vehicle-to-grid; Wheels; Conventional gasoline; Emissions intensity; Energy-economy models; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Long-term perspective; Passenger vehicles; Reduction potential; Well-to-wheel; Plug-in electric vehicles; climate change; electric vehicle; emission control; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; numerical model; policy making; Alberta; British Columbia; Canada; Ontario [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061615648

In order to reduce the ecological impact of the data center Greenhouse Gas (GhG) emissions, this paper addresses the problem as a whole, by proposing a global mathematical formulation, based on the joint optimization of the Virtual Machine (VM) placement and their related traffics, along with a workload consolidation method and a cooling maximization technique that considers the dynamic behavior of the cooling fans. As the Virtual Machine Placement Problem (VMPP) is classified as an NP-hard problem, with the addition of the traffic embedding, the problem becomes more complex and stays NP-hard. Therefore, we propose a hybrid approach, for solving such problem and find good feasible solutions in a polynomial time. The results obtained from comparing with the exact method and other reference approaches help in assessing the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, as the carbon footprint costs are relatively close to the lower bound, with an average gap of about 3 percent, and found within a reasonable amount of time. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Carbon footprint; cloud computing; hybrid heuristics; iterated local search; optimization; tabu search","Cloud computing; Computational complexity; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Network security; Optimization; Polynomial approximation; Problem solving; Tabu search; Virtual addresses; Virtual machine; Computing environments; Ecological impacts; Hybrid heuristics; Iterated local search; Joint optimization; Mathematical formulation; Virtual machine placements; Workload consolidation; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064248183

Approximately 73% of models reproduce the internal natural variability allied with AMO, but mostly all underestimate the variance. Amongst these, very few replicate the explicit comma-shaped AMO sea surface temperature (SST) pattern, whereas rest illustrates warm SSTs over the sub-polar region and very weak or non-existent AMO’s signature over the sub-tropical North Atlantic. However, only 53% of models emulate the observed AMO–ISMR relationship. The observational analysis bestows the compelling evidence that the AMO influences ISMR through two physical processes: firstly by modulating the El Niño related anomalous Walker and regional Hadley circulations asymmetrically and secondly through the tropospheric response allied with the Rossby wave train. The models that fail to reproduce the AMO–ISMR teleconnection are incompetent in capturing the first physical mechanism correctly, whereas in general all models show limitations in simulating the second physical mechanism. The results divulge a moderate relationship between the quality of reproducing the AMO pattern and the AMO–ISMR teleconnection in models, particularly with respect to the tropical–extratropical Pacific SST gradients during AMO phases. The models, which do show the observed rainfall response over India, also simulate the large-scale features allied with AMO like the cross-equatorial flow, the tropical easterly jets, the anomalous divergence/convergence over the Indian sub-continent at upper/lower levels, the Webster and Yang Monsoon index, and the Monsoon Hadley Circulation index. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","AMO–ISMR teleconnection; Atlantic multidecadal oscillation; Atmospheric circulation; CMIP5 models; Decadal-to-multidecadal variability; Monsoon prediction","Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; atmospheric circulation; climate modeling; climate prediction; decadal variation; Hadley cell; monsoon; rainfall; Rossby wave; sea surface temperature; summer; teleconnection; temperature gradient; troposphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051198249

Despite living in diverse contexts, Indigenous peoples face a number of common challenges. Disproportionate threats from climate change exist due to a range of factors including unique relationships with the natural environment, socioeconomic deprivation, a greater existing burden of disease, poorer access to and quality of health care, and political marginalization. Responses to climate change at global, national, and local levels also threaten Indigenous people’s rights. While climate action presents many opportunities to improve health and reduce inequities, there is also significant potential for climate mitigation and adaptation policies to inflict harm on Indigenous peoples. An important aspect of this is the impact on traditional lands, which are acknowledged as a fundamental determinant of Indigenous health and well-being. This article seeks to elucidate the relationships between climate change and Indigenous health and to inform health promotion solutions to achieve climate justice for Indigenous peoples. The underpinning analysis is founded on a Kaupapa Māori positioning, which seeks transformative change and involves critiquing Western knowledges and structures that undermine Indigenous rights. A central theme is that anthropogenic climate change is intimately connected to the ideologies, systems and practices of colonialism, and that the impacts on Indigenous peoples can be conceptualized as an intensification of the process of colonization. It is not possible to understand and address climate-related health impacts for Indigenous peoples without examining this broader context of colonial oppression, marginalization and dispossession. The challenge for health promotion is to engage in a process of decolonization. This involves deconstructing its own systems and practices to avoid reinforcing colonialism and perpetuating inequities. It also requires health promotion practitioners to support Indigenous self-determination and recognize Indigenous knowledges as a critical foundation for climate change and health solutions. © The Author(s) 2019.","climate change; English; environmental health/pollution; equity/social justice; health promotion; Indigenous health; South Pacific/Oceania","climate change; colonialism; global health; health care delivery; health promotion; health status; human; human rights; indigenous health care; personal autonomy; procedures; socioeconomics; Climate Change; Colonialism; Global Health; Health Promotion; Health Services Accessibility; Health Services, Indigenous; Health Status; Human Rights; Humans; Indigenous Peoples; Personal Autonomy; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064233926

Montane ecosystems may be especially sensitive to extreme weather because of complex abiotic and biotic interactions that propagate from climate-driven reductions in snowpack. Snowpack not only protects subnivean biotas from extreme cold, but also influences forage availability through timing of melt-off and water availability. We related relative abundances of an alpine mammal, the American pika (Ochotona princeps), to measures of weather and snowpack dynamics over an 8-yr period that included before and after a year of record-low snowpack in Washington, USA. We sought to (1) quantify any change in pika abundance associated with the snowpack anomaly and (2) identify aspects of weather and snowpack that influenced abundance of pikas. Pikas showed a 1-yr lag response to the snowpack anomaly and exhibited marked declines in abundance at elevations below 1,400 m simultaneous with increased abundances at higher elevations. Atmospheric moisture, indexed by vapor pressure deficit (VPD), was especially important, evidenced by strong support for the top-ranked model that included the interaction of VPD with snowpack duration. Notably, our novel application of VPD from gridded climate data for analyses of animal abundances shows strong potential for improving species distribution models because VPD represents an important aspect of weather that influences the physiology and habitat of biota. Pikas were apparently affected by cold stress without snowpack at mid elevations, whereas changes to forage associated with snowpack and VPD were influential at high and low elevations. Our results reveal context dependency in pika responses to weather and illustrate how snow drought can lead to rapid change in the abundance of subnivean animals. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","alpine ecosystem; American pika; climate change; extreme weather; Ochotona princeps; phenology; snow drought; vapor pressure deficit","alpine environment; atmospheric moisture; climate change; cold tolerance; drought stress; ecological approach; elevation; environmental stress; extreme event; lagomorph; phenology; prediction; relative abundance; snowpack; vapor pressure; water availability; weather; United States; Washington [United States]; Animalia; Mammalia; Ochotona princeps; Ochotonidae; animal; climate change; ecology; ecosystem; lagomorph; Washington; Animals; Climate Change; Ecology; Ecosystem; Lagomorpha; Washington",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062963999

Recruitment and population trends of elk (Cervus canadensis) have been downward in the last 4 decades across the northern Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest, USA. In Oregon, changes in vegetation composition and land use practices occurred, cougar (Puma concolor) populations recovered from near-extirpation, and black bear (Ursus americanus) populations increased. Our goal was to provide managers with insight into the influence of annual climatic variation, and bottom-up and top-down factors affecting recruitment of elk in Oregon. We conducted our research in southwestern (SW; Toketee and Steamboat) and northeastern (NE; Wenaha and Sled Springs) Oregon, which had similar predator assemblages but differed in patterns of juvenile recruitment, climate, cougar densities, and vegetative characteristics. We obtained monthly temperature and precipitation measures from Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) and estimates of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for each study area to assess effects of climate and vegetation growth on elk vital rates. To evaluate the nutritional status of elk in each study area, we captured, aged, and radio-collared adult female elk in SW (n = 69) in 2002-2005 and NE (n = 113) in 2001-2007. We repeatedly captured these elk in autumn (n = 232) and spring (n = 404) and measured ingesta-free body fat (IFBF), mass, and pregnancy and lactation status. We fitted pregnant elk with vaginal implant transmitters (VITs) in spring and captured their neonates in SW (n = 46) and NE (n = ?100). We placed expandable radio-collars on these plus an additional 110 neonates in SW and 360 neonates in NE captured by hand or netgunning via helicopter and estimated their age at capture, birth mass from mass at capture, and sex. We monitored their fates and documented causes of mortality until 1 year of age. We estimated density of cougars by population reconstruction of captured (n = ?96) and unmarked cougars killed (n = ?27) and of black bears from DNA analysis of hair collected from snares. We found evidence in lactating females of nutritional limitations on all 4 study areas where IFBFautumn was below 12%, a threshold above which there are few nutritional limitations (9.8% [SE = 0.64%, n = 17] at Toketee, 7.9%[SE = 0.78%, n = 17] at Steamboat, 7.3% [SE = 0.33%, n = 46] at Sled Springs, and 8.9% [SE = 0.51%, n = 23] at = enaha).

One simulation represents the current climate, and another represents an ~2050 climate using a pseudo-global warming approach. The climate perturbations are derived from the ensemble mean of 15 global climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). These simulations provide an estimate of average changes in wintertime orographic precipitation enhancement and finescale distribution across mountain ranges. The variability in these changes among CMIP5 models is quantified using statistical downscaling relations between orographic precipitation distribution and upstream conditions, developed in Part I. The CMIP5 guidance indicates a robust warming signal (~2K) over the IWUS by ;2050 but minor changes in relative humidity and cloud-base height. The IWUS simulations reveal a widespread increase in precipitation on account of higher precipitation rates during winter storms in this warmer climate. This precipitation increase is most significant over the mountains rather than on the surrounding plains. The increase in precipitation rate is largely due to an increase in low-level cross-mountain moisture transport. The application of the statistical relations indicates that individual CMIP5 models disagree about the magnitude and distribution of orographic precipitation change in the IWUS, although most agree with the ensemble-mean-predicted orographic precipitation increase. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.","North America; Orographic effects; Orographic effects; Orographic effects","Global warming; Landforms; Precipitation (meteorology); Storms; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; North America; Orographic effects; Orographic precipitation; Precipitation distribution; Regional climate simulation; Statistical downscaling; Statistical relations; Climate models; climate modeling; global warming; mountain region; orographic effect; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; winter; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064901118

To date, there are considerable gaps in modeling ecosystem fluxes and their responses to physiological constraints in these old-growth forests. These model shortcomings limit our ability to understand and project how the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest will respond to global climate change. This study applies the cohort-based Ecosystem Demography Model 2 (ED2) to the Wind River Experimental Forest (Washington, USA), a well-studied old-growth Douglas-fir–western hemlock ecosystem. ED2 is calibrated and validated using an extensive suite of forest inventory, eddy covariance, and biophysical observations. ED2 is able to reproduce observed forest composition and canopy structure, and carbon, water, and energy fluxes at the site. In the simulations, the effect of limited water supply on ecosystem carbon fluxes is mediated primarily by the forest's gross primary productivity (GPP) response, rather than its heterotrophic respiration response. The simulation indicates that stomatal conductance is mainly determined by soil moisture during periods of low vapor pressure deficit (VPD). However, when VPD is high, stomatal conductance is greatly reduced regardless of soil moisture status. During summer droughts, reduced soil moisture and increased VPD result in considerable stomatal closure and GPP reduction, which in turn decreases net carbon uptake. Cohort-based scheme integrates all canopy layers (species) that have distinct sensitivity to microclimate and respond distinctly to drought. This study is an initial first step to explore the potential importance of cohort-based model in simulating forest with complex structure, and to lay the foundation for applying cohort-based model at regional scales across the Pacific Northwest. © 2019 The Authors.","carbon flux; cohort-based model; old-growth coniferous forest; physiological constraint; tree physiology; water flux",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065020917

The liver is the metabolic center in the body. However, the effect of short-term HS on the liver mitochondria and its mechanism are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of short-term HS on liver mitochondrial function. We found that HS reduced Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) protein level, increasing protein carbonylation in mice liver. HS intake decreased ATP production, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and complex I level. SIRT3 knockout (SKO) mice exhibited similar results with HS-treated wild-type mice but with a less extent of carbonylation and ATP reduction. Our study shows that short-term HS led to increased hepatic oxidative state, impaired mitochondrial biosynthesis, and bioenergetics. HS-treated mice could still maintain hepatic glucose homeostasis by compensatory activation of Adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, in HS-treated SKO mice, AMPK was not activated, instead, the glycogen synthase activity increased, which caused an exceptionally increased glycogen accumulation. This study provides evidence that short-term HS intake could cause the early hepatic metabolic changes, highlighting the importance of controlling salt intake especially in those patients with defects in SIRT3.Highlights High salt intake down-regulates SIRT3 protein level and increases oxidation. High salt intake activates AMPK via AMP-dependent pathway. High salt intake impairs energy metabolism.

In this study, PL emission red-shifts were observed when tartaric acid (TA) was added into m-phenylenediamine (mPD) or o-phenylenediamine (oPD) solutions as carbon sources to prepare CDs, i.e., from blue to green for mPD and from yellow-green to red for oPD. Morphology and structure analyses revealed that the increased surface oxidation and carboxylation were responsible for the red-shifts of emission, indicating that TA played a key role in tuning the surface state of CDs. These factors could be employed as effective strategies to adjust PL emissions of CDs. Consequently, multicolor PL CDs (i.e., blue-, green-, yellow-greenand red-emissive CDs) can be facilely prepared using mPD and oPD in the absence and presence of TA. Particularly, the obtained red-emissive CDs showed a high PL quantum yield up to 22.0% and an emission covering red to NIR regions, demonstrating great potentials in optoelectronic devices and bioimaging. Moreover, multicolor phosphors were further prepared by mixing corresponding CDs with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), among which the blue, green, and red ones could serve as three primary color phosphors for fabricating multicolor and white light-emitting diodes (LEDs).

In this paper, the economic impact of a less carbon-intensive economy on agricultural markets is estimated by means of an integrated modelling framework. First, the macroeconomic impacts of moving into a global low carbon economy are analysed by applying different carbon taxes in a general equilibrium modelling framework. Second, the potential adoption of emission mitigation technologies is quantified and used in the Aglink-Cosimo model to assess the impacts on agricultural markets of emission mitigation scenarios compatible with the 2.0 °C target prescribed in the Paris Agreement. Results for 2030 show reductions in global non-CO2 GHG emissions from agriculture (i.e., methane and nitrous oxide) by 10, 16 and 19% in 50, 100 and 150 USD/t CO2eq global carbon tax scenarios, respectively (Least Developed Countries excluded). Only between 0.6% and 1.3% of the global reduction is caused by indirect macroeconomic effects, although at the regional level they can cause up to 5.8% of the reduction in agricultural emissions. Results suggest that ambitious mitigation targets can provoke significant negative impacts on agricultural production and underline the importance of integrating GHG emission developments and impacts of related policies into agricultural market projections. © 2019 by the authors.","Aglink-Cosimo; agricultural sector; Climate changemitigation; market outlook; Paris agreement","agricultural emission; agricultural market; agroindustry; carbon emission; climate change; economic impact; environmental economics; global perspective; greenhouse gas; macroeconomics; market conditions; pollution tax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066960867

We collected seasonal leaf-level gas exchange, nutrient content and stand allometric data from the field-layer community (i.e., Maianthemum trifolium (L.) Sloboda), understory shrubs (Rhododendron groenlandicum (Oeder) Kron and Judd, Chamaedaphne calyculata (L.) Moench., Kalmia polifolia Wangenh. and Vaccinium angustifolium Alton.) and overstory trees (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P. and Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch). We found significant interspecific seasonal differences in specific leaf area, nitrogen content (by area; Na) and photosynthetic parameters (i.e., maximum rates of Rubisco carboxylation (Vcmax25°C), electron transport (Jmax25°C) and dark respiration (Rd25°C)), but minimal correlation between foliar Na and Vcmax25°C, Jmax25°C or Rd25°C, which illustrates that nitrogen alone is not a good correlate for physiological processes such as Rubisco activity that can change seasonally in this system. ELM-SPRUCE was sensitive to the introduction of observed interspecific seasonality in Vcmax25°C, Jmax25°C and Rd25°C, leading to simulated enhancement of net primary production (NPP) using seasonally dynamic parameters as compared with use of static parameters. This pattern was particularly pronounced under simulations with higher temperature and elevated CO2, suggesting a key hypothesis to address with future empirical or observational studies as climate changes. Inclusion of species-specific seasonal photosynthetic parameters should improve estimates of boreal ecosystem-level NPP, especially if impacts of seasonal physiological ontogeny can be separated from seasonal thermal acclimation. © 2019 Oxford University Press.

A 3D steady-state RANS CFD simulation with a SST k-ω turbulence model was used to evaluate the temperature distribution and age of air for two cases of heat source and smart windows and two ventilation openings. The model was first validated for the first case with full-scale experimental data. For window-to-wall-ratio (WWR) ranges of 20–40% and four different room outlet opening locations, the validated model was used to determine the thermal comfort metrics of the studied building with smart windows cases. The mixed-climate environmental conditions of Atlanta-GA was used for setting up the boundary conditions. The results of thermal comfort analysis showed WWR = 30% and 40% are preferred for all studied windows and smart windows with electrochromic glazing, respectively. It also showed that up to 50% temperature difference reduction between the floor and ceiling is achievable with electrochromic windows. Smart windows with/without electrochromic glazing reduced the maximum relative air temperature between the floor and ceiling by 87%/30% compared to regular windows.

The corresponding molar volumes of CO2/H2S-saturated liquid phase were also measured in the above temperature and pressure ranges. At the same temperature and pressure, the solubility of hydrogen sulfide in [C2mim][BF4], expressed on the molality scale, is more than three times that of CO2. The Henry's law constants were determined from the new experimental data, which in turn were used to derive the change of some thermodynamic functions for dissolution of the gases in that particular ionic liquid. The partial molar volume at infinite dilution for CO2/H2S + [C2mim][BF4] mixtures was estimated from the measured molar volumes. The new experimental data were correlated by using two models: (a) a model comprised of the extended Henry's law and Pitzer's virial expansion for the excess Gibbs energy, and (b) a generic Redlich-Kwong (GRK) type of cubic equation of state. Both models adequately good correlate the experimental data; however, the first model shows a slightly higher correlative accuracy than the second one.

These areas represent social-ecological systems that will require increasing management intervention to maintain their biological and socio-cultural values. Managers of protected areas have begun to recognize the inevitability of ecosystem change and the need to embrace dynamic approaches to intervention. However, significant uncertainty remains about the onset and severity of some impacts, which makes planning difficult. For Indigenous communities, there are intrinsic links between cultural heritage and the conservation of place and biodiversity that need to be better integrated in protected area planning and management. In New SouthWales, Australia, management of public conservation reserves and national parks is the responsibility of a State government agency, the National Parks andWildlife Service (NPWS). This paper describes the outcomes of a participatory planning process with NPWS staff to, firstly, identify the options available, the available 'tool kit', to manage biodiversity and cultural heritage in protected areas; secondly, explore how the selection of management actions from the 'tool kit' is associated with the level of climate risk to biodiversity or cultural heritage assets; and thirdly, to understand how the form of individual management actions might adapt to changes in climate risk. Combining these three elements into a series of risk-based, adaptive pathways for conservation of biodiversity and cultural heritage is a novel approach that is currently supporting place-based planning for public conservation areas. Incorporation of the trade-offs and synergies in seeking to effectively manage these discrete but related types of values and the implications for conservation practice are discussed. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptation; Biodiversity; Climate change; Cultural heritage; Pathways; Planning; Risk",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064606699

A qualitative study exploring conditions of the urban poor in Khulna, Bangladesh demonstrates how the appropriation of private, parochial and public spaces by residents of informal settlements influences their capacity to cope with climate risks. Because of the spatial implications of the predominant patriarchal system, women remain vulnerable in private spaces. The parochial spaces they use for productive work also leave them exposed and sensitive to climate hazards. On the other hand, men, who make greater use of public spaces, still have negligible capacity to take any anticipatory and reactive actions in response to risks there. This paper, which provides a comparison to earlier research in Dhaka, argues that gendered constraints in both inhabiting and shaping spaces is an underlying cause of differential climate resilience; alternatively, planning climate-resilient spaces can be seen as a fundamental change contributing to transformative adaptation. © 2019 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).","Bangladesh; climate resilience; gendered space; informal settlements; Khulna","climate change; environmental policy; informal settlement; low income population; public space; womens status; Bangladesh; Khulna [Bangladesh]; Khulna [Khulna (ADS)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061897801

The effects of temperature on k cat /K m for 3α-HSD/CR acting on androsterone, 2-decalol, and cyclohexanol show the reactions are entropically favorable but enthalpically unfavorable. Thermodynamic analysis from the temperature-dependent values of K m and k cat shows the binding of the E-NAD + complex with either 2-decalol or cyclohexanol to form the ternary complex is endothermic and entropy-driven, and the subsequent conversion to the transition state is both enthalpically and entropically unfavorable. Hence, solvation entropy may play an important role in the binding process through both the desolvation of the solute molecules and the release of bound water molecules from the active site into bulk solvent. As compared to the thermodynamic parameters of 3α-HSD/CR acting on cyclohexanol, the hydrophobic interaction of the B-ring of steroids with the active site of 3α-HSD/CR contributes to catalysis by increasing exclusively the entropy of activation (ΔTΔS ‡ = 1.8 kcal/mol), while the BCD-ring of androsterone significantly lowers ΔΔH ‡ by 10.4 kcal/mol with a slight entropic penalty of −1.9 kcal/mol. Therefore, the remote non-reacting sites of androsterone may induce a conformational change of the substrate binding loop with an entropic cost for better interaction with the transition state to decrease the enthalpy of activation, significantly increasing catalytic efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Binding energy; Enthalpy and entropy; Enzyme catalysis; Gibbs free energy change; Steady-state kinetics","2 decalol; 3alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; alkanol; androsterone; carbonyl reductase; cyclohexanol; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; unclassified drug; 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-carbonyl reductase; hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; recombinant protein; Article; catalysis; catalytic efficiency; conformational transition; controlled study; enthalpy; entropy; enzyme activation; enzyme active site; enzyme structure; enzyme substrate complex; hydrophobicity; mathematical model; nonhuman; phase transition; solvation; steady state; temperature dependence; temperature sensitivity; thermodynamics; biocatalysis; biosynthesis; chemistry; enzyme specificity; Escherichia coli; genetics; isolation and purification; kinetics; metabolism; temperature; thermodynamics; Biocatalysis; Escherichia coli; Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; Kinetics; NAD; Recombinant Proteins; Substrate Specificity; Temperature; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062076111

Regeneration occurs under conditions distinct from, and typically more harsh than, the catalysis, placing strict requirements on physicochemical material properties that divert catalyst optimization toward addressing regenerability over high activity and selectivity. Deactivation arises from mechanical, structural, or chemical modifications to active sites, promoters, and their surrounding matrices, and the prevailing mechanism for deactivation varies with the reaction, the catalyst, and the reaction conditions. Methanol-to-hydrocarbons processes utilize zeolites and zeotypes - crystalline, microporous oxides widely deployed as catalysts in the refining and petrochemical industries - as solid acid catalysts. Deposition and growth of highly unsaturated carbonaceous residues within the micropores congest molecular transport and block active sites, resulting in deactivation. In this Account, we describe studies probing the underlying mechanisms of deactivation in methanol-to-hydrocarbons catalysis and discuss examples of leveraging the acquired mechanistic insights to mitigate deactivation and prolong catalyst lifetime. These fundamental principles governing carbon deposition within zeolites and zeotypes provide opportunity to broaden versatility of processes for C1 valorization and to relax constraints imposed by hydrothermal catalyst stability considerations to achieve more active and more selective catalysis.Methanol-to-hydrocarbons catalysis occurs via a chain carrier mechanism. A zeolite/zeotype cavity hosts an unsaturated hydrocarbon guest to together constitute the supramolecular chain carrier that engages in a complex network of reactions for chain carrier propagation. Productive propagation reactions include olefin methylation, aromatic methylation, and aromatic dealkylation. Methanol undergoes unproductive dehydrogenation to formaldehyde via methanol disproportionation and olefin transfer hydrogenation. Subsequent alkylation reactions between formaldehyde and active olefinic/aromatic cocatalysts instigate cascades for dehydrocyclization, resulting in the formation of inactive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and termination of the chain carrier.Addition of a distinct catalytic function that selectively decomposes formaldehyde mitigates chain carrier termination without disrupting the high selectivity to ethylene and propylene in methanol-to-hydrocarbons catalysis on small-pore zeolites and zeotypes. The efficacy of this bifunctional strategy to prolong catalyst lifetime increases with increasing proximity between the active sites for formaldehyde decomposition and the H+ sites of the zeolite/zeotype. Coprocessing sacrifical hydrogen donors mitigates chain carrier termination by intercepting, via saturation, intermediates along dehydrocyclization cascades. This strategy increases in efficacy with increasing concentration of the hydrogen donor and provides opportunity to realize steady-state methanol-to-hydrocarbons catalysis on small-pore zeolites and zeotypes. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071391175

The proposed process consists of four basic steps: i) identifying risks/hazards; ii) development of the worst-case scenario; iii) simulating the emission and dispersion of the toxic chemicals; and iv) assessing the severity of the impact to the people and the surroundings. It makes use of different techniques including accidental release source term, atmospheric dispersion modeling and results in the concentration and extent of the toxic chemicals in the atmosphere for either the direct evaporation of toxic chemicals as a primary emission or the dispersion of toxic chemicals as a domino effect of a fire or explosion accident. This process has been applied in a contrived case study in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

The work presented in this study investigates the effectiveness of secondary injection of hydrogen to imperfectly premixed methane and ethylene flames in reducing heat release oscillations. Both acoustically forced and unforced flames were studied, and simultaneous OH and H atom PLIF (planar laser induced fluorescence) was conducted. The tests were carried out on a laboratory scale bluff-body combustor with a central V-shaped bluff body. Two-microphone method was used to estimate velocity perturbations from pressure measurements, flame boundary images were captured using high speed Mie scattering, while global heat release fluctuations were determined from OH* chemiluminescence. The results showed that hydrogen addition considerably reduced heat release oscillations for both methane and ethylene flames at all the forcing frequencies tested, with the exception of methane flames forced at 315 Hz, where oscillations increased with hydrogen addition. The addition of hydrogen reduced the extent of flame roll-up for both methane and ethylene flames, however, this reduction was larger for methane flames. NOx exhaust emissions were observed to increase with hydrogen addition for both methane and ethylene flames, with absolute NOx concentrations higher for ethylene flames, due to higher flame temperatures. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Combustion oscillations; Flame describing function; Flame dynamics; H atom PLIF; Hydrogen addition; OH PLIF","Atom lasers; Combustors; Deterioration; Ethylene; Exhaust gases; Hydrogen; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Thermoacoustic engines; Combustion oscillation; Flame describing functions; Flame dynamics; H atom PLIF; Hydrogen addition; OH PLIF; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062909481

Critical to these efforts is the accurate monitoring, reporting and verification of current forest cover and carbon stocks. For planning, the additional step of modeling is required to quantitatively estimate forest carbon sequestration potential in response to alternative land-use and management decisions. To be most useful and of decision-relevant quality, these model estimates must be at very high spatial resolution and with very high accuracy to capture important heterogeneity on the land surface and connect to monitoring efforts. Here, we present results from a new forest carbon monitoring and modeling system that combines high-resolution remote sensing, field data, and ecological modeling to estimate contemporary above-ground forest carbon stocks, and project future forest carbon sequestration potential for the state of Maryland at 90 m resolution. Statewide, the contemporary above-ground carbon stock was estimated to be 110.8 Tg C (100.3-125.8 Tg C), with a corresponding mean above-ground biomass density of 103.7 Mg ha-1 which was within 2% of independent empirically-based estimates. The forest above-ground carbon sequestration potential for the state was estimated to be much larger at 314.8 Tg C, and the forest above-ground carbon sequestration potential gap (i.e. potential-current) was estimated to be 204.1 Tg C, nearly double the current stock. These results imply a large statewide potential for future carbon sequestration from afforestation and reforestation activities. The high spatial resolution of the model estimates underpinning these totals demonstrate important heterogeneity across the state and can inform prioritization of actual afforestation/reforestation opportunities. With this approach, it is now possible to quantify both the forest carbon stock and future carbon sequestration potential over large policy relevant areas with sufficient accuracy and spatial resolution to significantly advance planning. © 2019 The Author(s).

The same logic also applies elsewhere in the world, where diverse residents face a host of challenges, opportunities, and obstacles, with climate change but one among many issues. Our proposed approach to regional and global environmental change research draws on the ideas of decolonization, emphasizing collaborative approaches and Indigenous voices in research and policy instead of top-down measures designed outside the affected communities.

However, increasing evidence has shown that real-driving emissions (RDE) could be much higher than laboratory type approval limits and the advantages of HEVs over their conventional ICE counterparts under real-driving conditions have not been studied extensively. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the real-driving fuel consumption and pollutant emissions performance of HEVs against their conventional ICE counterparts. Two pairs of hybrid and conventional gasoline vehicles of the same model were tested simultaneously in a novel convoy mode using two portable emission measurement systems (PEMSs), thus eliminating the effect of vehicle configurations, driving behaviour, road conditions and ambient environment on the performance comparison. The results showed that although real-driving fuel consumption for both hybrid and conventional vehicles were 44%–100% and 30%–82% higher than their laboratory results respectively, HEVs saved 23%–49% fuel relative to their conventional ICE counterparts. Pollutant emissions of all the tested vehicles were lower than the regulation limits. However, HEVs showed no reduction in HC emissions and consistently higher CO emissions compared to the conventional ICE vehicles. This could be caused by the frequent stops and restarts of the HEV engines, as well as the lowered exhaust gas temperature and reduced effectiveness of the oxidation catalyst. The findings therefore show that while achieving the fuel reduction target, hybridisation did not bring the expected benefits to urban air quality. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Conventional vehicles; Convoy testing mode; Hybrid electric vehicles; Portable emission measurement system; Real-driving emissions","Air quality; Energy efficiency; Fuels; Ice; Internal combustion engines; Vehicle performance; Convoy testing mode; Emission measurement systems; Emissions performance; Exhaust gas temperatures; Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); Performance comparison; Real drivings; Vehicle configuration; Hybrid vehicles; carbon monoxide; comparative study; fuel consumption; traffic emission; transport vehicle; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; car driving; carbon footprint; combustion; comparative study; environmental policy; environmental temperature; exhaust gas; fuel and fuel related phenomena; motor vehicle; oxidation; priority journal; reduction (chemistry)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059147824

It argues that the convergence of state-centered climate politics and market-oriented climate governance, which has a multi-level feature, has shaped the “climate-focused” behavior of Chinese exporting companies. Specifically, nation-states, multinational enterprises, and non-governmental organizations have contributed in the following ways: (1) at the global level, nation-states co-established and interpreted international norms, which generally justify the stance of the Chinese government, have been an indirect source of influence; (2) at the national level, the Chinese government has been the most influential actor, which has put emphasis on energy-saving when interpreting and operationalizing international norms; (3) at the industrial level, multinational enterprises and international non-governmental organizations have been influential contributors by playing a proactive role in launching and running low-carbon initiatives; and (4) transnational public–private partnerships launched in China and some developed countries have offered limited momentum. © The Author(s) 2018.","Chinese exporting companies; multi-level climate governance; non-state actors; state actors; “climate-focused”",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058654345

SEM/TEM and XPS analysis indicated that the carbonaceous materials were mostly coated on the TiO 2 surface and clearly revealed that the Cu species exhibited multivalence states, existing as CuO x (0x2). The optimal catalyst showed a 56-fold enhanced hydrogen evolution rate compared with that of the pure C/TiO 2 catalyst. Further, an intensive multiple electron transfer effect originating from CuO x and the carbonaceous materials is proposed to be responsible for the elevated photoactivity. CuO x species serve as electron donors facilitating charge carrier transfer and proton reduction sites. The carbonaceous materials function as the “bridge” that transfers the electrons of TiO 2 to the CuO x species, which provides a new route for electron transfer and reinforces the effect of CuO x as a co-catalyst. In this study, the CuO x and C co-modified TiO 2 catalyst was prepared with multiple electron transport pathways and enhanced hydrogen production evolution, which provides a deep understanding for the design of co-catalyst-based photocatalysts. © 2019 Huang et al.

Under relatively clear and specific low-carbon development goals, the ongoing power transition has recently been studied intensively in the frame of global sustainable transition. With the development of renewable technologies, besides the long-term development goals, learning and diffusion of innovative technologies and the incentive effect of supportive policies are also important driving forces of the transition. The levelized power generation cost is the power generation cost when the net present value of the power project is zero. In this paper, the levelized power generation cost model with a learning curve and policy scenario is used to reflect the impact of technology diffusion and incentive policies from the economy perspective. By treating it as a state transfer function, a dynamic power generation-transmission integrated planning model based on the Markov Decision Process is established to describe the long-term power transition pathway under the impact of power technology diffusion and incentive policies. Through the calculation of power demand forecasting data up to 2050 and other power system information, the dynamic planning result shows that the current low-carbon policies cannot obviously reduce the expansion of coal power, but if strict low-carbon policies are implemented, the renewable power will gradually become dominant in the power structure before 2030. © 2019 by the authors.","China's power sector; Electric power economy; Electric power structure; Generation- and transmission-integrated planning; Low-carbon police portfolio","alternative energy; cost analysis; electrical power; electricity industry; energy conservation; energy planning; energy policy; integrated approach; model; power generation; technology diffusion; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066848930

Results of global and local Moran’s I analyses suggested a significant clustered pattern of PM2.5 across the country with hot spots mainly concentrated in cities located in the North China Plain. Spatially interpolated PM2.5 estimates showed that most of China’s territories experienced unhealthy concentrations of PM2.5 except during summer, while much larger proportions of China’s population was exposed to unhealthy PM2.5 all year round. Results from regression analyses suggested that the spatial variations of PM2.5 were positively associated with air pollution but inversely related to meteorological factors.

Close-coupled DOC-DEF-SCR on filter with underfloor SCR architectures, offer a balance of NOx performance at cold start and highway driving conditions. In contrast, the DOC-DPF-DEF-SCR architecture has been most commonly selected to meet the on-road and non-road heavy duty emission regulations worldwide. Diesel engines applied to off road vehicles can operate under higher loads for extended times, producing higher exhaust temperatures and engine out NOx emissions. New European Stage V emission regulations will mandate diesel particulate filter (DPF) adoption because of particulate number and more stringent particulate mass requirements. Three aftertreatment architecture choices with diesel particulate filters (DPF) were evaluated as candidates to fulfill the Stage V emission regulations. The studied architectures were: DOC-uncatalyzed DPF-DEF-SCR, DOC-DEF-SCR on filter-SCR and DOC-DEF-uncatalyzed DPF-SCR, respectively. During steady state operations, an unexpected continuous and repeatable NOx performance degradation occurred at inlet temperatures exceeding 450 °C on systems containing either SCR on filter or uncatalyzed DPF located downstream of the DEF injection. NOx performance degradations were observed over multiple tests with different samples of DOC. Additional reference testing on two architectures, DOC-uncatalyzed DPF-DEF-SCR and DOC-DEF-SCR systems, did not exhibit NOx performance degradation when exposed to the same conditions. Additional experiments were conducted to investigate the cause of NOx performance degradations. In the case of DOC-DEF-SCR on filter architecture, when tested without a DOC upstream, performance remained stable throughout testing, and did not show degradation. In the case of a degraded DOC-DEF-uncatalyzed DPF|SCR architecture when reconfigured by relocating the uncatalyzed DPF to a position before the DEF injection, demonstrated NOx performance was fully restored, and did not exhibit further degradation. These architectural studies helped isolate the cause of degradation to the filter downstream of the DEF injection system. NOx performance changes of SCR on filter due to thermal aging and ash loading were also evaluated. Significant NOx performance loss was observed at exhaust temperatures above 450 °C after thermal aging, while expected levels of NOx performance losses were observed after ash loading. Chemical analyses of several SCR on filter and uncatalyzed DPF's samples from this study revealed measurable amounts of platinum (Pt), providing a strong hypothesis linking the NOx performance degradation to increased parasitic NH3 oxidation by O2, for both DOC-DEF-SCR on filter-SCR and DOC-DEF-uncatalyzed DPF-SCR architectures. © 2019 SAE International.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of propane flaming approach in the control of perennial invasive and native Mediterranean broadleaf and grass weeds. The invasive weeds, Cyperus rotundus, Sorghum halepense, and Ecballium elaterium, were treated multiple times with a single propane dose (2.5 kg propane km −1 ), using the broadcast technique. The local annual weeds, Sinapis arvensis, Lavatera trimestris, and Avena sativa, were treated once at five propane doses (0–2.5 kg propane km −1 ), using the cross-row technique. Dose-response analysis was performed. Three applications provided effective control (up to &gt;90%) for all tested perennials, and affected seed and flower production in Sorghum halepense and Ecballium elaterium, respectively. However, the timing of the sequential application had a significant impact on the degree of control, in terms of dry weight reduction and seed production. Weed density had an impact on control efficacy but was only a significant determinant for Ecballium elaterium. Cross-row application was effective during early growth stages of broadleaf weeds (ED 50 &lt; 1.2 kg propane km −1 ), but was less effective during later growth stages (ED 50 &gt; 2.6 kg propane km −1 ). For grass weeds, both early and late application were ineffective (ED 50 &gt; 4.1 kg propane km −1 ). More research is needed to optimize this weed control tactic for various cropping systems and weed species. Implementation of this novel approach into integrated weed management programs will increase the control efficacy of invasive weed under the projected climate changes and reduce the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds. © 2019 by the authors.","Broadcast; Broadleaf; Climate change; Cross-row; Grasses; Growth-stage; Perennial weeds",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064695844

Although the low-affinity canonical methanotrophs with cultured representatives have been detected along with the high-affinity ones, their role as a methane sink in upland soils remains enigmatic. Here, we show that canonical methanotrophs can contribute to (circum-)atmospheric methane uptake in agricultural soils. We performed a stable-isotope 13C–CH4 labelling incubation in the presence and absence of bio-based residues that were added to the soil to track the flow of methane. Residue amendment transiently stimulated methane uptake rate (&lt;50 days). Soil methane uptake was sustained throughout the incubation (130 days), concomitant to the enrichment of 13C–CO2. The 13C-enriched phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were distinct in both soils, irrespective of amendments, and were unambiguously assigned almost exclusively to canonical alphaproteobacterial methanotrophs with cultured representatives. 16S rRNA and pmoA gene sequence analyses revealed that the as-yet-uncultured high-affinity methanotrophs were virtually absent in these soils. The stable-isotope labelling approach allowed to attribute soil methane uptake to canonical methanotrophs, whereas these were not expected to consume (circum-)atmospheric methane. Our findings thus revealed an overlooked reservoir of high-affinity methane-oxidizers represented by the canonical methanotrophs in agriculture-impacted upland soils. Given that upland agricultural soils have been thought to marginally or do not contribute to atmospheric methane consumption due to the vulnerability of the high-affinity methanotrophs, our findings suggest a thorough revisiting of the contribution of agricultural soils, and the role of agricultural management to mitigation of climate change. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","13C labelling; High-affinity methane oxidation; Methylocystaceae; PLFA analysis/ land-use change; pmoA","Agriculture; Atmospheric chemistry; Climate change; Fatty acids; Isotopes; Land use; Landforms; Methane; Phospholipids; RNA; Agricultural management; Atmospheric concentration; Gene sequence analysis; Land-use change; Methane oxidation; Methylocystaceae; Phospholipid fatty acids; pmoA; Soils; agricultural soil; climate change; concentration (composition); fatty acid; land use change; methane; oxic conditions; oxidation; soil amendment; stable isotope; upland region; Methylocystaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059194626

Current projections are for the stock of scrap iron and steel products to increase in the future. Being already in the reduced state, such scrap can be regenerated to steel with lower CO2 emissions than iron ore. The “Packed bed type Partial Smelting Reduction process” (PSR), which concurrently smelts scrap and reduces iron ore, is a promising method to utilize scrap iron. This work evaluates the feasibility of combining PSR with top gas recycling, a process commonly called the ‘SMART steelmaking system’. In the SMART system, CO2 derived from the PSR gas is reduced into CO or CH4 and recycled to the furnace as a reducing agent. The integrated whole process including shaft furnace, CO2 electrolysis, pressure swing adsorption, and other conventional auxiliary systems was modelled in Aspen Plus, and CO2 emissions reduction and exergy analysis of the system adaptive for flexible operating conditions was performed. Increasing the scrap ratio by 5% consistently lead to a 4% reduction in CO2 emissions. Similarly, increasing the CO input rate by 100 kg/THM consistently resulted in a reduction of CO2 emissions of approximately 3%.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of green roofs in the reduction of the urban heat island (UHI) effect and CO2 emissions. These effects consider decreased energy consumption for space cooling, and the amount of water needed for evapotranspiration on the green roofs. A coupled urban canopy/building energy model (CM-BEM) was utilized to simulate the effectiveness of green roofs. The amount of water needed for evapotranspiration was calculated by using latent heat flux, which was derived from the results of roof surface heat balance calculations. The effect of green roofs on CO2 emissions was determined based on their effectiveness to reduce the energy demand for space cooling, calculated by air-conditioning load simulation. We calculated the CO2 emissions from powering the pumps and the use of tap water, when the necessary amount of water was supplied by watering. Finally, the relationships between amount of water, UHI mitigation, and CO2 emissions were determined. © 2019 by the authors.","CO2 emission; Evapotranspiration; Green roof; Meteorological simulation; Urban heat island; Watering","building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cooling; energy use; evapotranspiration; heat island; office location; roof; urban area; water availability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064123513

However, these assessments have predominantly been based on modeling approaches (regression analysis). The current study uses a multiyear temporal climate-analog approach to reassess the impact of climate change on visitation to Pinery Provincial Park in southwestern Ontario based on the observed effects of historical climatic anomalies on park visitation from 2000 to 2016. Consideration was also given to major events such as the North American terror attacks on 11 September 2001 and the confounding effect that events such as this may have had on the results. There were no statistically significant relationships (at the 95% confidence level) between seasonal climatic anomalies and park visitation in Ontario during the winter or spring seasons. There was a weak statistical relationship between anomalously warm summer seasons and park visitation, when compared to summer seasons with climatically normal temperatures; however, the presence of nonclimatic variables may have confounded these results, producing a false positive. Autumn-season park visitation was most sensitive to climatic anomalies, with the warmest temperatures causing visitation to increase by 37%, the wettest conditions causing visitation to decrease by 11%, and the driest conditions resulting in a 24% increase. These observed seasonal temperature anomalies represent temporal climate analogs for projected climate change across the span of the twenty-first century. Thus, the results of this study suggest that previous assessments may have overestimated the positive impacts of projected climate change on park visitation in this region. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.",,"autumn; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; confidence interval; environmental impact assessment; environmental modeling; nature-society relations; park management; perception; seasonal variation; temporal analysis; twenty first century; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Pinery Provincial Park",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063100871

Specifically, we introduce the HYSPLIT average dispersion model, HyADS, which combines the HYSPLIT trajectory dispersion model with modern advances in parallel computing to estimate ZIP code level exposure to emissions from individual coal-powered electricity generating units in the United States. Importantly, the method is not designed to reproduce ambient concentrations of any particular air pollutant; rather, the primary goal is to characterize each ZIP code's exposure to these coal power plants specifically. We show adequate performance towards this goal against observed annual average air pollutant concentrations (nationwide Pearson correlations of 0.88 and 0.73 with SO42− and PM2.5, respectively) and coal-combustion impacts simulated with a full-scale chemical transport model and adjusted to observations using a hybrid direct sensitivities approach (correlation of 0.90).

Drained peat soils used for agriculture can be large greenhouse gas sources. By restoring subsided peat soils to managed, impounded wetlands, significant agricultural emissions are avoided, and soil carbon can be sequestered and protected. Here, we synthesize 36 site-years of continuous carbon dioxide and methane flux data from a mesonetwork of eddy covariance towers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California, USA to compute carbon and greenhouse gas budgets for drained agricultural land uses and compare these to restored deltaic wetlands. We found that restored wetlands effectively sequestered carbon and halted soil carbon loss associated with drained agricultural land uses. Depending on the age and disturbance regime of the restored wetland, many land use conversions from agriculture to restored wetland resulted in emission reductions over a 100-year timescale. With a simple model of radiative forcing and atmospheric lifetimes, we showed that restored wetlands do not begin to accrue greenhouse gas benefits until nearly a half century, and become net sinks from the atmosphere after a century. Due to substantial interannual variability and uncertainty about the multi-decadal successional trajectory of managed, restored wetlands, ongoing ecosystem flux measurements are critical for understanding the long-term impacts of wetland restoration for climate change mitigation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gas; Methane; Peat soil; Sequestration; Wetland restoration","agricultural land; carbon emission; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem dynamics; eddy covariance; environmental assessment; environmental degradation; environmental restoration; greenhouse gas; land use change; methane; peat soil; radiative forcing; source-sink dynamics; wetland management; California; Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060334667

Observations from NASA's July 2011 DISCOVER-AQ (D-AQ) campaign in the Baltimore-Washington region are used to quantify OPE, which is compared to output from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The baseline model run of CMAQ (CB05-TUCL mechanism; mobile NOx emissions from the National Emissions Inventory; biogenic emissions from BEIS model v3.61) underestimates observed OPE by 34 ± 20%. The payload of D-AQ lacked direct observations of HO2 and RO2, so we infer the rate at which these peroxy radicals react with NO (termed inROx) from observations of NO, NO2, O3, and j(NO2). The baseline run of CMAQ underestimates inROx by 35 ± 19%. A modified run of CMAQ with a factor of 10 reduction in the lifetime of organic nitrates, a factor of 2 reduction in mobile NOx emissions, an update to the thermal dissociation rate of PAN and PANX to the IUPAC 2014 value, and a correction for the rate constant for OH + PANX results in better overall model performance based on a number of comparisons to data that include column NO2 measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, a value of OPE that is 21 ± 13% less than observed, and inROx that is low by 30 ± 19%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the peroxy radical discrepancy involves either emission of VOCs other than isoprene or HCHO, or a problem with the model production of HO2 and RO2. Our analysis suggests surface O3 may exhibit stronger declines to further reductions of NOx than is indicated by baseline runs of CMAQ.

However, the agricultural sector is still an important N source to the environment, and projections indicate relatively small emission reductions in the coming years. The four Nordic countries have different priorities and strategies regarding agricultural N flows and mitigation measures, and therefore they are facing different challenges and barriers. In Norway farm subsidies are used to encourage measures, but these are mainly focused on phosphorus (P). In contrast, Denmark targets N and uses control regulations to reduce losses. In Sweden and Finland, both voluntary actions combined with subsidies help to mitigate both N and P. The aim of this study was to compare the present situation pertaining to agricultural N in the Nordic countries as well as to provide recommendations for policy instruments to achieve cost effective abatement of reactive N from agriculture in the Nordic countries, and to provide guidance to other countries. To further reduce N losses from agriculture, the four countries will have to continue to take different routes. In particular, some countries will need new actions if 2020 and 2030 National Emissions Ceilings Directive (NECD) targets are to be met. Many options are possible, including voluntary action, regulation, taxation and subsidies, but the difficulty is finding the right balance between these policy options for each country. The governments in the Nordic countries should put more attention to the NECD and consult with relevant stakeholders, researchers and farmer's associations on which measures to prioritize to achieve these goals on time. It is important to pick remaining low hanging fruits through use of the most cost effective mitigation measures. We suggest that N application rate and its timing should be in accordance with the crop need and carrying capacity of environmental recipients. Also, the choice of application technology can further reduce the risk of N losses into air and waters. This may require more region-specific solutions and knowledge-based support with tailored information in combination with further targeted subsidies or regulations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ammonia emissions; Nitrogen management; Nitrogen policy; Nitrogen surplus; Nordic countries; Reactive nitrogen","ammonia; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; phosphorus; air; ammonia; aquatic environment; emission; emission control; leaching; nitrogen; phosphorus; policy approach; prioritization; runoff; agricultural land; agriculture; aquatic environment; Article; bovine; cost effectiveness analysis; Denmark; Finland; fruit; government; manure; nitrate leaching; nitrogen deposition; Norway; poultry; sheep; Sweden; Denmark; Finland; Norway; Sweden; Agriculture; Denmark; Finland; Norway; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061641182

In parallel, global warming causes hydrological changes which will affect freshwater supply for human use in many regions. This study estimates the exposure of future population to severe hydrological changes relevant from a freshwater resource perspective at different levels of global mean temperature rise above pre-industrial level (ΔTglob). The analysis is complemented by an assessment of water scarcity that would occur without additional climate change due to population change alone; this is done to identify the population groups that are faced with particularly high adaptation challenges. The results are analysed in the context of success and failure of implementing the Paris Agreement to evaluate how climate mitigation can reduce the future number of people exposed to severe hydrological change. The results show that without climate mitigation efforts, in the year 2100 about 4.9 billion people in the SSP2 population scenario would more likely than not be exposed to severe hydrological change, and about 2.1 billion of them would be faced with particularly high adaptation challenges due to already prevailing water scarcity. Limiting warming to 2 °C by a successful implementation of the Paris Agreement would strongly reduce these numbers to 615 million and 290 million, respectively.

Methane consumption by soil microbiota in alpine wet meadows serves as a biofilter for the methane produced in the waterlogged soil below. Altered pH regimes change microbial community composition and structure by exerting selection pressure on soil microorganisms with different ecological strategies and thus affect greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the metabolic activity of soil microorganisms. However, responses of prokaryotic communities to artificial pH shift under elevated methane concentration remain unclear. In this study, we assessed diversity and relative abundance of soil prokaryotes in an alpine meadow under elevated methane concentration along an artificial pH gradient using laboratory incubation experiments. We established an incubation experiment treated with artificial pH gradient (pH 4.5–8.5). After 3 months of incubation, 300 ml of methane at a concentration of 20,000 ppm was added to stimulate potential methanothrophs in topsoil. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene indicated increasing of relative abundances of Crenarchaeota, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes in soil after addition of methane, while the relative abundances of Actinobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes did not significant change before and after methane treatment. Results of phylogenetic relatedness of soil prokaryotes showed that microbial community is mostly shaped by deterministic factors. Species indicator analysis revealed distinct OTUs among various pH and methane treatments. Network analysis revealed distinct co-occurrence patterns of soil prokaryotic community before and after methane addition, and different correlation patterns among various prokaryotic taxa. Linear regression model revealed significant decrease of methane oxidation along elevated pH gradient. Soil pH constituted a strong environmental filter in species assembly of soil prokaryotic community. Methane oxidation rates decreased significantly with elevated pH. The interactive effects of elevated methane concentration and pH are therefore promising topic for future research. © 2019, Università degli studi di Milano.","Elevated methane oxidation; Methanotrophs; pH gradient; Soil prokaryotes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059683613

Many understorey wildflowers in deciduous forests leaf out and flower in the spring when light availability is the highest before overstorey canopy closure. Therefore, different phenological responses by understorey and overstorey species to increased spring temperature could have significant ecological implications. Pairing contemporary data with historical observations initiated by Henry David Thoreau (1850s), we found that overstorey tree leaf out is more responsive to increased spring temperature than understorey wildflower phenology, resulting in shorter periods of high light in the understorey before wildflowers are shaded by tree canopies. Because of this overstorey–understorey mismatch, we estimate that wildflower spring carbon budgets in the northeastern United States were 12–26% larger during Thoreau's era and project a 10–48% reduction during this century. This underappreciated phenomenon may have already reduced wildflower fitness and could lead to future population declines in these ecologically important species. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","carbon gain; climate change; forest understorey; herbaceous layer; light environment; phenology; spring wildflowers; Thoreau","carbon; forest; plant leaf; season; tree; Carbon; Forests; Plant Leaves; Seasons; Trees",Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061007676

The current literature have studied on choosing energy efficiency retrofit measures in single building, relatively little attention has been paid to the retrofit investment decision-making in multiple buildings. In addition, the existing studies almost put the retrofit cost as an objective that need to be minimized, and the retrofit capital budget is not taken into consideration. This paper proposes a decision-making optimization framework for energy efficiency retrofit investment in numerous buildings under financing budgetary restraint. A multi-objective optimization model with the economic goals being the net present value and time of return, and the environmental goals being the energy saving and emission reduction is presented, and then the intelligent optimization method combing particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm is designed to search the retrofit investment strategy. The obtained investment strategy could determine which of the buildings should be invested to retrofit, and the combination of retrofitting measures for every investable building.

A better understanding of the factors affecting farmers’ energy-efficient appliance use behavior can help policymakers design more effective policies. This paper explores the effect of farmers’ risk preferences and loss aversion on their energy-efficient appliance use behavior in rural China. Using unique data from a survey and a paired lottery experiment completed by 235 rural household heads in the Dazu District of China, this study finds that the farmers’ risk preferences and loss aversion have significant effects on their energy-efficient appliance use behavior. The more risk-averse farmers are less likely to buy or use energy-efficient appliances. The farmers who are more loss averse are more willing to purchase and more likely to use durable energy-efficient appliances. In addition, the farmers’ demographic factors (age, gender, education, and family location), their perceptions of climate change adaptation and their trust attitudes have significant effects on their energy-efficient appliance use behavior.

To investigate their real-world gaseous emissions, we applied portable emissions measurement systems (PEMSs) to test 44 gasoline and 24 bi-fuel taxis in seven cities. Our real-world measurement results indicated that a major part of the tested China 3 and China 4 gasoline taxis, especially the samples with high mileage (&gt;300,000 km), far exceeded the corresponding emission limits of NOX, THC and CO. Only the newest China 5 gasoline taxis with relatively lower mileage had effective emission controls and the gaseous emissions were below the limits. Illegal tampering, malfunction and deterioration of three-way catalytic converters (TWC) are major reasons for high emissions from high-mileage taxis. First, China 4 gasoline taxis without TWC (purposely removed by drivers) increased their gaseous emissions than TWC-equipped counterparts by more than one order of magnitude. Second, bi-fuel taxis when using compress natural gas (CNG) had much higher NOX and THC emissions than those when using gasoline, which might be probably attributed to unsophisticated engine calibration and unfavorable TWC working conditions. Furthermore, TWC renewal could bring immediate and substantial emission reductions (up to 70%) for high-mileage taxis. However, such benefits from TWC renewal would become less significant as the mileage levels further increase. We also found a good correlation between CO and THC emissions for gasoline taxis, whose cold start effects were both significant. This study poses significant concerns regarding real-world emissions of high-mileage taxi fleets in China, which could consist of many gross emitters in the urban areas. Stringent in-use compliance programs and in particular frequent TWC renewals for high-mileage taxis should be implemented by policy makers in China. © 2018","Compressed natural gas (CNG); Portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS); Real driving emissions (RDE); Taxi; Three-way catalyst (TWC)","Air pollution; Catalytic converters; Compressed natural gas; Deterioration; Emission control; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Taxicabs; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS); Real drivings; Taxi; Three way catalysts; Air pollution control equipment; fuel; gasoline; natural gas; nitric oxide; tetrahydrocannabinol; carbon monoxide; emission control; emission inventory; natural gas; nitrogen oxides; policy implementation; pollution policy; traffic emission; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; calibration; China; concentration (parameters); correlational study; environmental factor; mileage; priority journal; taxi fleet; traffic and transport; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059125131

Exploring the determinants of PM 2.5 concentration is critical for improving air quality. The influencing mechanism of smog pollution is a comprehensive and systematic process affected by multiple driving factors. In this research, we collected PM 2.5 monitoring data from 292 cities across China in 2015 and employed multilevel regression models constructed using three levels to detect the physical and socioeconomic driving forces behind the PM 2.5 concentration at monthly, seasonal and spatial scales, which captured random effects both varied by season and region. The results indicated significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the PM 2.5 distribution, with the pollution core located in central China and northern China. The most severely haze episodes occurred in winter. Multilevel models showed that 46.40% of the variance was derived from the seasonal and spatial levels, and the models could explain a maximum of 90.7% of the PM 2.5 concentration variance. The multilevel model identified more determinant influences varying by time and region. The outcomes suggested that the impacts of temperature and relative humidity on PM 2.5 were of significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity due to the influencing mechanism differing from season and station. The variation of anthropogenic activities led to the socioeconomic influences featured a significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity.

Model predictions considering interfacial thermal resistance between the CNT and SMP, agglomerated state of CNTs into the SMP matrix and CNT non-straight shape are in reasonable agreement with the experiment reported in the literature. It is found that the CNT agglomeration must be removed to obtain a maximum level of thermal conductivities of SMP nanocomposites. The effects of volume fraction, diameter, cross-section shape, arrangement type and waviness factors of CNTs as well as interfacial thermal resistance on the axial and transverse thermal conductivities of aligned CNT-reinforced SMP nanocomposites are extensively investigated. The results show that the alignment of CNTs into the SMP nanocomposites along the thermal loading can be an efficient way to dissipate the heat. When the CNT waviness increases, a nonlinear decrease in the axial thermal conductivity is occurred, however, the nanocomposite thermal conductivity along the transverse direction quickly rises. It is observed that the interfacial thermal resistance, cross-section shape and arrangement type of CNTs do not affect the axial thermal conductivity of CNT-SMP nanocomposites. But, the interfacial thermal resistance can play a key role in the transverse nanocomposite thermal conductivity. The present fundamental study is very important for understanding the thermal conducting behavior of CNT-SMP nanocomposites which may have a wide range of applications in temperature sensing elements and biological micro-electro-mechanical systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Micro-mechanics; Nano-structures; Smart materials; Thermal properties","Agglomeration; Carbon nanotubes; Intelligent materials; MEMS; Nanocomposites; Shape memory effect; Thermodynamic properties; Yarn; Conducting behavior; Effective thermal conductivity; Interfacial thermal resistance; Micro electro mechanical system; Micromechanical approach; Shape memory polymers; Temperature sensing; Transverse thermal conductivity; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055982995

Among these, abiotic stress is the most detrimental; one that is responsible for nearly 50% of crop yield reduction and appears to be a potential threat to global food security in coming decades. Plant growth and development reduces drastically due to adverse effects of abiotic stresses. It has been estimated that crop can exhibit only 30% of their genetic potentiality under abiotic stress condition. So, this is a fundamental need to understand the stress responses to facilitate breeders to develop stress resistant and stress tolerant cultivars along with good management practices to withstand abiotic stresses. Also, a holistic approach to understanding the molecular and biochemical interactions of plants is important to implement the knowledge of resistance mechanisms under abiotic stresses. Agronomic practices like selecting cultivars that is tolerant to wide range of climatic condition, planting date, irrigation scheduling, fertilizer management could be some of the effective short-term adaptive tools to fight against abiotic stresses. In addition, ""system biology"" and ""omics approaches"" in recent studies offer a long-term opportunity at the molecular level in dealing with abiotic stresses. The genetic approach, for example, selection and identification of major conditioning genes by linkage mapping and quantitative trait loci (QTL), production of mutant genes and transgenic introduction of novel genes, has imparted some tolerant characteristics in crop varieties from their wild ancestors. Recently research has revealed the interactions between micro-RNAs (miRNAs) and plant stress responses exposed to salinity, freezing stress and dehydration. Accordingly transgenic approaches to generate stress-tolerant plant are one of the most interesting researches to date. This book presents the recent development of agronomic and molecular approaches in conferring plant abiotic stress tolerance in an organized way. The present volume will be of great interest among research students and teaching community, and can also be used as reference material by professional researchers. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019, corrected publication 2019.

But most local governments, particularly small- and medium-sized cities in the global South, lack the knowledge and capacity to do so. This paper presents the findings from a project that engaged local governments and other key stakeholders to develop a participatory planning process for climate resilient and inclusive urban development. The project took place in three small- to medium-sized Latin American cities: Dosquebradas, Colombia; Santa Ana, El Salvador; and Santo Tomé, Argentina. By engaging government officials and politicians, academics, technical specialists, and representatives of civil society organizations in interviews, workshops and focus group discussions, this project sought to identify a range of feasible options for climate resilient and inclusive urban development. In each city, this process provided rich, context-specific details to identify strategies and plan projects with the buy-in of city government and other key actors. The overall goal was to bring in a resilience lens to assess current and planned urban development projects in each city and reach a consensus on feasible and inclusive resilience options for development. © 2019 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).","Argentina; climate resilience; Colombia; disaster risk reduction; El Salvador; inclusive urban development; Latin America; participatory planning","disaster management; local government; participatory approach; planning process; stakeholder; urban climate; urban development; Argentina; Colombia; El Salvador [Central America]; Santa Ana [El Salvador]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062475044

The prepared materials retained the anatase structure and contained a mixture of Ag0 and AgI species. Samples exhibited extended light absorption to the visible region. The effect of Ag loading on TiO2 is studied for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4 in a gas-solid process under high-purity conditions. It is remarkable that the reference TiO2 used in this work is entirely inactive in this reaction, but it allows for studying the effect of Ag on the photocatalytic process in more detail. Only in the case of 2% Ag/TiO2 was the formation of CH4 from CO2 observed. Using different light sources, an influence of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of Ag is verified. A sample in which all Ag has been reduced to the metallic state was less active than the respective sample containing both Ag0 and Ag+, indicating that a mixed oxidation state is beneficial for photocatalytic performance.

In science context, Global warming is primarily a problem of too much carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, which acts as a blanket, trapping heat and warming the planet. As we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas for energy, carbon accumulates and overloads our atmosphere. The carbon dioxide emission is closely related to the electric-charging sector due to the electricity-purging process as a result of combustion of coal, natural gas, oil and uranium. All these combustion processes will release carbon dioxide gas causing carbon dioxide gas to be the major contributor to global warming. Based on electricity generation in Malaysia, most processes involve combustion of fuel sources which is turn carbon dioxide emission into the air where the pollution occurs. The increases the demand for energy, the higher index of pollution causes of carbon dioxide emissions. Awareness among the community is needed to reduce energy consumption for the next generation. Therefore, this study is to know the uses of energy consumption of students in Kolej Kediaman Pelajar UTHM Pagoh (KKP) based on the daily average of electricity used. Subsequently the uses of the energy consumption will be exchanged in the form of the amount of carbon dioxide emission and it determined based on the energy used. Through the study, we are unconsciously exposed for how much energy that we spend and our contribution to air pollution based on energy consumption. In addition, if individuals are concern about their energy consumption, it also can reduce the rate of air pollution where carbon dioxide gas is released during power generation through charcoal combustion. © BEIESP.","Carbon Dioxide; Energy Consumption; Global Greenhouse Emissions; Global Warming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066627238

Using a conditional nonparametric frontier analysis to a sample of 73 economies over the time period 1980–2014, empirical evidence of the examined relationship is provided both under full and partial frontiers in the constant and variable returns to scale (VRS) models. Specifically, the newly proposed time-dependent conditional nonparametric frontier estimators have been applied. In our case the time-dependent conditional efficiency estimators allow us to model directly the effects of growth and time on economies’ estimated performance without requiring any specification of the production functional form and without assuming the separability condition between time, economic growth and the support of inputs and outputs. The overall results reveal that the efficiency results of full and partial frontiers tend to lead to the same results, except in the cases of full VRS models where energy use and carbon dioxide emissions are incorporated as an additional input and output, respectively. The results demonstrate that countries with a higher environmental efficiency are those that have signed the first agreement between nations (Kyoto Protocol) to mandate country-by-country reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions, while countries that have not signed are relatively inefficient. Ultimately, the empirical findings also suggest that the effect of economic growth is determined by economies’ development stage and geographical region. © 2018, Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Conditional nonparametric frontier; Data envelopment analysis; Economic growth; Environmental degradation; Technological catch-up; Technological change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058148096

However, our results support the evidence of two club convergence of total emission, emission from gas and petroleum consumption, while three clubs are noticed in case of per capita carbon dioxide emission from coal use. This invalidates the equality rule of participation of each country in climate change policy. Further, similar results emerge in case of total emission and petroleum where club 1 consists of mostly developed countries while club 2 has a large number of developing countries.

Here we document—within a similar climate—how contrasting regional plant communities correlate with distinct underlying lithology and reveal how differences in water storage capacity in the critical zone (CZ) explain this relationship. We present observations of subsurface CZ structure and groundwater dynamics from deep boreholes and quantify catchment-wide dynamic water storage in two Franciscan rock types of the Northern California Coast Ranges. Our field sites have a Mediterranean climate, where rains are out of phase with solar energy, amplifying the importance of subsurface water storage for periods of peak ecosystem productivity in the dry season. In the deeply weathered (~30 m at ridge) Coastal Belt argillite and sandstone, ample, seasonally replenished rock moisture supports an evergreen forest and groundwater drainage sustains baseflow throughout the summer. In the Central Belt argillite-matrix mélange, a thin CZ (~3 m at ridge) limits total dynamic water storage capacity (100–200 mm) and rapidly sheds winter rainfall via shallow storm and saturation overland flow, resulting in low plant-available water (inferred from predawn tree water potential) and negligible groundwater storage that can drain to streams in summer. This storage limitation mechanism explains the presence of an oak savanna-woodland bounded by seasonally ephemeral streams, despite >1,800 mm of average precipitation. Through hydrologic monitoring and subsurface characterization, we reveal a mechanism by which differences in rock type result in distinct regionally extensive plant communities under a similar climate. ©2019.

In the Nordic countries, the road dust problem is enhanced by use of studded tyres, causing increased road wear and winter road maintenance including gritting. Efforts to reduce road dust emissions requires knowledge on temporal and spatial road dust load dynamics. The city of Stockholm, Sweden, has therefore financed seasonal (October to May) road dust sampling to be able to optimize their winter and spring time street operation measures for reduced road dust emissions. This work describes the outcome of six seasons (2011/2012–2016/2017) of road dust sampling in five central streets using the VTI wet dust sampler (WDS).The results show that road dust load, expressed as DL180 (dust load smaller than 180 μm) has a seasonal variation with the highest loads (up to 200 g/m2) in late winter and early spring and a minimum (down to about 15 g/m2) in early autumn and late spring. The dust load varies between streets and is depending on pavement surface properties. On a smaller scale the dust load has a high variability across streets due to differences in rates of suspension from different parts of the road surface, with low amounts in wheel tracks and higher in-between and outside the tracks. Between 2 and 30% of the DL180 is smaller than 10 μm and could directly contribute to PM10 emissions. In general, higher road surface texture leads to higher dust loads, but the condition of the pavement (e.g. cracks, aggregate loss) might also have an effect. A new, wear resistant pavement accumulated markedly higher road dust amounts than a several years old pavement. This paper closes with a discussion on the complex relation between road dust load and PM10 concentrations and a discussion on the challenges and comparability of road dust sampling techniques and measures. © 2019 The Authors","Macro texture; Non-exhaust; PM10; sampling; Spatial variation; Temporal variation","Dust; Particulate emissions; Pavements; Sampling; Textures; Wear of materials; Macrotextures; Non-exhaust; PM10; Spatial variations; Temporal variation; Air pollution; asphalt; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); dust; maintenance; pavement; road; sampling; seasonal variation; spatial variation; temporal variation; winter; Article; autumn; dust; dynamics; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; spring; summer; surface property; suspension; Sweden; winter; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061003909

This will help to predict the weather and increase in pollution. Once the major cause of pollution is known then proper action can be taken to control the pollution. Every citizen will know about the pollution in their respective city so that they will be aware to it. This system will help to know about traffic on the different route in the city. If some the accident happens on the road, then this information will be distributed in the entire city and about the traffic on that route. It will help to find out the vehicles which releases more carbon dioxide (e.g. old Car, Bike, Bus etc.) after this type vehicle will be removed by the government authority which may leads to reduce in the pollution. © BEIESP.","Access point; Atmosphere; C ontroller; Dust; Internet of things; Pollutants; Pollution; Sensor; Server; Tempareture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066626672

A key claim is that CE remains a largely ungoverned space, with shared norms, institutional arrangements, and formal rules to regulate CE not yet present. In contrast, here it is argued that de facto governance of CE is underway, discernible in an ordering of this nascent field of inquiry by unacknowledged sources of steering. One key source of de facto governance is analyzed: high-level ‘authoritative assessments’ of CE. The focus is on how these assessments are constructing CE as an object of governance through demarcating and categorizing this emerging field of inquiry, and how this contributes to normalizing and institutionalizing CE research (and CE research communities). Scrutinizing the distinct nature and political implications of de facto governance, particularly of novel and speculative technological trajectories not yet subject to formal steering, remains a key task for governance scholars. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Each year, the amount of wasted food accounts for an estimated one third of annual food production globally. This large amount of food waste has caused serious land, water, and air pollution. In the past, most research on food waste was focused solely on food waste disposal processing. Only a few studies analysed the flow of materials in food waste treatment processes. Therefore, this paper focused on the process of food waste anaerobic treatment in Beijing and investigated the treatment. According to a life cycle theory, the food waste treatment process is divided into three processes: “collection and transportation, disposal, and resource utilization.” This paper analysed the input and output of food waste treatment in different processes and evaluated the economic and environmental costs and benefits of food waste treatment. The study found that 200 t of food waste anaerobic treatment can obtain benefits 66,888 Chinese yuan, generate electricity energy 43,350 kW⋅h, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions 16,087 kg. Generally, the economic and environmental benefits of the food waste anaerobic treatment project are considerable. However, the economic benefits are mainly from government subsidies. There are many impurities in food waste, which indicates some problems in food waste treatment. Thus, the proposals to strengthen waste classification, optimize the layout of garbage collection and transportation, and accelerate the development of waste treatment plants have been put forward. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Anaerobic treatment; Economic benefits; Environmental benefits; Food waste; Input and output; Life cycle","anaerobic digestion; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; environmental impact assessment; food waste; input-output analysis; life cycle analysis; state role; subsidy system; waste disposal; waste treatment; Beijing [China]; China; air pollution; anaerobic growth; China; economics; food; procedures; traffic and transport; waste disposal; waste management; Air Pollution; Anaerobiosis; Beijing; Food; Refuse Disposal; Transportation; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061566566

To reveal the effect of high demand-side electrification rates on the transmission grid and electricity supply-side a case-study analysis for the German market is performed. A reference scenario with low demand-side electrification and low grid congestion is compared to high demand-side electrification scenarios with two different shares of renewable electricity production of total electrical load: “Elec61” and “Elec75.” The analysis shows that an increase of the electrical load from ~500 TWh to ~760 TWh leads to heightened stress for the transmission grid and therefore more curtailment in both electrification scenarios. In Elec61, which exhibits the same share of renewable electricity production as the reference scenario, the integration of 19 TWh of flexible power-to-heat in district heating networks reduces the market driven curtailment of renewable feed-in, highlighting the value of flexible electrical loads for the integration of variable renewable energy sources. Although a drastic increase of installed renewable electricity production capacity occurs in Elec61 (+109 GW) and Elec75 (+178 GW) compared to the reference scenario, fossil fueled power plants are still being dispatched frequently in times of high electrical load and low renewable energy feed. In the examined scenarios, deep decarbonization through electrification was not possible because the decrease of the CO 2 -coefficient of power generation resulting from an increase in the installed capacity of variable renewable energy sources was insufficient.

This article looks systematically at the political economy of the diffusion of ETS designs and explores the implications for carbon-market linking. Contrary to expectations of convergence–as has been observed in many areas where economic policy diffuses across markets–we found substantial divergence in the design and implementation of ETS across the nine systems examined. The architects of these different systems are aware of other designs, but they have purposely adjusted designs to reflect local political and administrative goals. Divergence has sobering implications for visions of ubiquitous linkages and the emergence of a global carbon market that, to date, have been predicated on the assumption that designs would converge. More such ‘real world’ political economy analysis is needed to understand how political forces, mainly within countries, act as strong intervening variables that affect instrument design, implementation and effectiveness. Key policy insights Our finding of design divergence indicates that policy efforts aimed at achieving integrated international markets are unlikely to be successful. Visions of carbon market linkage will need to confront the reality that there are well-organized political coalitions, anchored in the status quo, that prefer divergence. In linking ETS, policy-makers should devote more attention to preventing excessive capital flows that can undermine political support for linkage, while also creating incentives for convergence in trading rules over time. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This study investigated the long-term variation trend in satellite-derived PM2.5 concentrations and how it was related to pollutant emissions and meteorological parameters over EC and seven regions of interest (ROIs) during 1998–2016. Over EC, the annual mean PM2.5 increased before 2006 due to the enhanced emissions of primary PM2.5, NOx and SO2, but decreased with the reduced SO2 emissions after 2006 evidently in response to China's clean air policies. In addition, results from statistical analyses indicated that in the North China Plain (NCP), Northeast China (NEC), Sichuan Basin (SCB) and Central China (CC) planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) was the dominant meteorological driver for the PM2.5 decadal changes, and in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) wind speed is the leading factor. Overall, the variation in meteorological parameters accounted for 48% of the variances in PM2.5 concentrations over EC. The population-weighted PM2.5 over EC increased from 36.4 μg/m3 in 1998–2004 (P1) to 49.4 μg/m3 in 2005–2010 (P2) then decreased to 46.5 μg/m3 in 2011–2016 (P3). In the NCP and NEC, the percentages of the population living above the World Health Organization (WHO) Interim Target-1 (IT-1, 35 μg/m3) have risen steadily over the past 20 yr, reaching maxima of 97.3% and 78.8% in P3, respectively, but decreases of ∼30% from P2 to P3 were found for the SCB and PRD. The joint effect of emissions and meteorological determined the decadal trend in PM2.5. The decadal variation in meteorological parameters accounted for 48% of the variances in PM2.5 concentrations over Eastern China.

The analysis is performed with a multi-regional version of the multi-factor energy input–output model. The results show that NAFTA has not built a single integrated energy system, though it has helped reduce energy-related CO2 emissions.

In particular, the fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a complex air pollutant which is composed of the particles beneath the aerodynamic diameters of 2.5 μm, very possibly causes severe diseases since it is easy to intrude into the lungs. To that end, in this paper, we design a new picture-based predictor of PM2.5 concentration (PPPC), which employs the pictures acquired using mobile phones or cameras to make a real-Time estimation of PM2.5 concentration. First, using a large body of pictures which were captured under the good weather conditions, i.e., very low PM2.5 concentration, naturalness statistics (NS) models are built upon entropy features in spatial and transform domains. Second, for a novel picture, we measure its deviation degree from the above-mentioned NS models, considering the fact that the naturalness of a picture tends to reduce with the PM2.5 concentration increased. Third, a simple nonlinear function is introduced to map the deviation degree to the PM2.5 concentration. In comparison to existing relevant state-of-The-Art predictors, sufficient experimental results manifest the superiority of the proposed PPPC model in terms of prediction accuracy and implementation efficiency. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Naturalness statistics (NS); nonlinear mapping; particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration; pictures; predictor","Air pollution; Functions; Aerodynamic diameters; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Nonlinear mappings; pictures; PM2.5 concentration; Prediction accuracy; predictor; Real-time estimation; Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048005564

Each implementation level reduces logging emissions by a consistent proportion below the business-as-usual emissions baseline, which varies with harvest intensity. Level 1 reflects the best recorded emissions performance for each type of practice. Level 2 is more ambitious but feasible based on workshop feedback from concession managers and forestry experts, and confirmed by a recent demonstration. At Level 1 emissions can be reduced by 33%, avoiding emissions of 64.9 ± 22.2 MgCO 2 per ha harvested, on average. At Level 2 emissions can be reduced by 46%, avoiding 88.6 ± 22.7 MgCO 2 ha −1 . The greatest emissions reductions derive from (i) not felling trees that will be left in the forest due to commercial defects, and (ii) use of long-line cable winching to avoid bulldozer impacts. We also quantify the potential to avoid logging steep slopes and riparian habitats, while holding to our RIL-C accounting assumption that timber yields are maintained to avoid problems of leakage and product substitution. Logging damage to riparian areas &lt;50 m from perennial streams could be avoided by re-locating harvests to less sensitive areas that currently are not accessed due to lack of spatial planning. In all but the steepest concessions, all slopes &gt;40% could similarly be avoided. The combined areas of these sensitive habitats (steep slopes and riparian buffers) represented 16% of each cutting block on average. Implementation of RIL-C practices would deliver 8% (Level 1) and 11% (Level 2) of Indonesia's pledged reductions to their forest reference emissions level as a nationally determined contribution to the Paris Climate Agreement. In concert with RIL-C practices, 30% of logging concession areas could be permanently protected from logging and conversion to minimize impacts on biodiversity, soils, and water quality, thereby expanding Indonesia's protected areas by one third and achieving 93% of Indonesia's Aichi Target 11 (the effective conservation of at least 17% of lands). Both these Paris Climate Agreement and Aichi outcomes could be delivered with no reductions in timber yields and substantial improvements in worker safety and sustainability of the natural forest timber sector. © 2019","Carbon emissions; Climate change mitigation; Forest degradation; Paris Climate Agreement; Tropical forestry","Biodiversity; Carbon; Climate change; Ecosystems; Harvesting; Magnesium compounds; Nitrogen compounds; Phosphorus compounds; Soil conservation; Sulfur compounds; Timber; Uranium compounds; Water quality; Carbon emissions; Climate agreement; Climate change mitigation; Emissions performance; Forest degradation; Product substitutions; Reduced-impact logging; Reference emissions levels; Logging (forestry); carbon emission; climate change; degradation; emission control; forestry; international agreement; logging (timber); spatial planning; timber; tropical region; yield; Biodiversity; Carbon; Ecosystems; Harvesting; Magnesium Compounds; Nitrogen Compounds; Borneo; Indonesia; Indonesia; Kalimantan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061823396

In this research, soil moisture drought trends are assessed for Europe using the Soil Moisture Index (SMI) estimated on Joint UK Land Environment Simulator simulations under two Representative Concentration Pathways, the RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0 scenarios. Results show that SMI drought conditions are expected to exacerbate in Europe with substantial differences among regions. Eastern Europe and Mediterranean regions are found to be the most affected. Spatially and temporally contiguous regions that exhibit SMI of Severe and Extreme index categories are identified as distinct drought events and are assessed for their characteristics. It is shown that even under strong emissions mitigation, these events are expected to increase in occurrence (22% to 123%), while their characteristics will become more unfavorable. Results indicate increase in their spatial extend (between 23% and 46%) and their duration (between 16% and 48%) depending on the period and the scenario. Additional analysis was performed for the exceptionally wide-area (over 10 6 km 2 ) severe and extreme soil moisture drought events that are expected to drastically increase comparing to the recent past. Projections show that those events are expected to happen between 11 and 28 times more frequently depending on the scenario and the period with a 59% to 246% larger duration.

In this paper, we present four annually resolved, multi-centennial tree-ring isotope series from the southeastern Tibetan plateau. The investigation site, where juniper and spruce trees jointly occur, is one of the highest known tree-stands in the world. Tree ring cellulose oxygen (δ 18 O) and carbon (δ 13 C) isotopes were analyzed for a common period of 1685–2007 AD to investigate climate–isotope relationships. Therefore, various climate parameters from a local meteorological station and from the CRU 4.02 dataset were used. Tree-ring δ 18 O of both species revealed highly significant sensitivities with a high degree of coherence to hydroclimate variables during the growing season. The obtained δ 18 O–climate relationships can even be retained using a species mean. In contrast, the individual δ13C series indicated a weaker and non-uniform response to the tested variables. Underlying species-specific responses and adaptations to the long-term trend in atmospheric CO 2 bias even after a trend correction identified dominant environmental factors triggering the tree-ring δ 13 C at our site. However, analysis of individual intrinsic water-use efficiency in juniper and spruce trees indicated a species-specific adaptation strategy to climate change. © 2019 by the authors.

In fact, its energy and environmental outcomes are deeply uncertain. The promise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is greater safety and mobility. The question is: How do we achieve that promise while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and saving energy? Future AV scenarios range widely, from dramatically higher to dramatically lower GHG emissions. Fortunately, the best case for the environment is also the best case for business, for the economy, and for safe and affordable mobility: autonomous Taxi fleets that operate clean vehicles, encourage ridesharing, and are integrated with other public and private transportation modes. Governments, businesses, drivers and riders make decisions that can increase or decrease the likelihood of the best-case scenario. The stakes are very high, as the transportation sector is now the largest source of U.S. GHG emissions. Emissions are equal to (1) emissions per-vehicle-mile, multiplied by (2) vehicle-miles traveled (VMT). This paper explores the business, technology and behavioral decisions with respect to automation that have the greatest impact along these two dimensions. It then identifies policy interventions that could influence these key decisions to achieve the best GHG outcomes.

The overall objective of the DBO is to provide for the detection and consistent monitoring of the biophysical responses to major reductions in seasonal sea ice and concomitant increases in seawater temperatures observed across the region. A key uncertainty is how the PAR marine ecosystem is responding to these shifts in the timing of spring sea-ice retreat and/or delays in fall sea-ice formation. Variations in upper ocean hydrography, stratification, light penetration, planktonic production, pelagic-benthic coupling, and sediment carbon cycling are all influenced by sea ice and temperature changes. Observations of reduced sea ice extent/duration and seawater warming are linked to shifts in species composition and abundance, as well as northward range expansions in some upper trophic predators (e.g. humpback whales and commercially harvested fish), generally with negative impacts on ice-dependent species such as ice-associated seals and walruses. Some distributional shifts may be driven by changes in lower trophic level productivity that directly cascade into upper trophic levels. This special issue is a result of the international effort by participating scientists to implement a coordinated DBO that will meet these needs to understand the ecosystem responses to changing sea ice and thermal regimes. The key geographical focus is on the biologically productive waters in the PAR that are influenced by the inflow of North Pacific water through Bering Strait. Papers in this volume are based upon selected biological measurements at multiple trophic levels, together with appropriate hydrographic surveys and satellite observations. The DBO is developing into a significant national and international change detection resource for the identification and consistent monitoring of marine biophysical responses to climate change, with ongoing plans to expand into a pan-Arctic biological observing network. © 2019",,"Megaptera; Odobenidae",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067799109

As it has multiple applications and uses, mainly in the manufacturing of plastic and resin products, increasing amounts are being released into the environment with resulting enhanced exposure pathways. Since negative effects have been demonstrated even at low doses, it has been increasingly studied. However, these investigations have focused on BPA leaching from food cans, drinks and other consumer products as the oral exposure route is believed to be the most important. Consequently, the potential hazards of dermal or inhalation exposure resulting from the current levels of BPA in the atmosphere are poorly understand. Of the few studies reporting BPA occurrence in air, none of these were carried out in South American countries. Thus, the aim the present investigation was to assess BPA current levels in particulate matter in an urban environment (Córdoba, Argentina) and to analyze its spatial-temporal trends and the influence of meteorological parameters using a medium volume air sampler. Our results suggested a spatial trend that decreased according to the distance to emission sources in the order: Industrial area > City Centre > University campus, whose levels were comparable to other urban cities and with the temporal trend showing a higher prevalence of the compound in the colder months. Wind speed (WS), temperature (T), atmospheric pressure (AP) and relative humidity (RL) were the most influenced variables. However daily values are unpredictable and depend mainly on the emission sources and punctual events that release BPA into the atmosphere. No risk factor could be quantified since there is no reference value for this exposure route; Nevertheless, this study represents the first approach and provides data about this emergent pollutant in and Argentinean city, thus contributing to global BPA studies. © 2019","Atmospheric science; Environmental science; Health sciences",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063960866

However, a significant amount of energy is required to enable biological breakdown of ammonia present in the liquor. This biological processing also results in the emission of damaging quantities of greenhouse gases, making diversion of liquor and recovery of ammonia a noteworthy option for improving the sustainability of wastewater treatment. This study presents a novel process which combines ammonia recovery from diverted digestate liquor for use (alongside biomethane) in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system for implementation at WWTPs. Aspen Plus V.8.8 and numerical steady state models have been developed, using data from a WWTP in West Yorkshire (UK) as a reference facility (750,000p.e.). Aspen Plus simulations demonstrate an ability to recover 82% of ammoniacal nitrogen present in digestate liquor produced at the WWTP. The recovery process uses a series of stripping, absorption and flash separation units where water is recovered alongside ammonia. This facilitates effective internal steam methane reforming in the fuel cell with a molar steam:CH4 ratio of 2.5. The installation of the process at the WWTP used as a case of study has the potential to make significant impacts energetically and environmentally; findings suggest the treatment facility could transform from a net consumer of electricity to a net producer. The SOFC has been demonstrated to run at an electrical efficiency of 48%, with NH3 contributing 4.6% of its power output. It has also been demonstrated that 3.5 kg CO2e per person served by the WWTP could be mitigated a year due to a combination of emissions savings by diversion of ammonia from biological processing and lifecycle emissions associated with the lack of reliance on grid electricity. © 2019","Ammonia recovery; Fuel Cell; Greenhouse gases; Process modelling; Wastewater treatment","Ammonia; Anaerobic digestion; Biological water treatment; Computer software; Fuel cells; Greenhouse gases; Molar ratio; Molecular biology; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage treatment plants; Sludge digestion; Steam reforming; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water absorption; Water recycling; Water treatment plants; Ammoniacal nitrogen; Biological processing; Electrical efficiency; Life cycle emissions; Process modelling; Standard practices; Steady-state models; Wastewater treatment plants; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); absorption; ammonia; anaerobic digestion; fuel cell; greenhouse gas; installation; methane; oxide; recovery; recycling; sludge; wastewater treatment; England; United Kingdom; West Yorkshire",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061800525

We have previously shown, in a mouse model, that gestational exposure to diesel exhaust (DE) results in increased cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and susceptibility to heart failure in the adult offspring following transverse aortic constriction. Results: In this study, we have analyzed gene expression in neonatal cardiomyocytes after gestational exposure by RNA-sequencing and have identified 300 genes that are dysregulated, including many involved in cardiac metabolism. We subsequently determined that these cardiomyocytes exhibit reduced metabolic activity as measured by Seahorse extracellular flux analysis. We also surveyed for modifications in DNA methylation at global regulatory regions using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and found hypomethylation of DNA in neonatal cardiomyocytes isolated from in utero DE exposed neonates. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that in utero exposure to diesel exhaust alters the neonatal cardiomyocyte transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes, as well as the metabolic capability of these cells. Understanding how exposure alters the developing heart through dysregulation of gene expression, metabolism and DNA methylation is vital for identifying therapeutic interventions for air pollution-related heart failure. © 2019 The Author(s).","Diesel; DNA methylation; Metabolism; PM 2.5; Transcription","adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; cardiac muscle cell; cell isolation; controlled study; DNA methylation; DNA modification; DNA transcription; epigenetics; exhaust gas; female; gene expression; gene identification; gestational age; heart muscle metabolism; male; microarray analysis; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; prenatal exposure; priority journal; RNA sequence; signal transduction; adverse event; animal; C57BL mouse; cardiac muscle cell; DNA methylation; drug effect; exhaust gas; exposure; genetics; maternal exposure; metabolism; metabolome; particulate matter; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; toxicity; transcriptome; Animals; Animals, Newborn; DNA Methylation; Female; Inhalation Exposure; Maternal Exposure; Metabolome; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Myocytes, Cardiac; Particulate Matter; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Transcriptome; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064213625

Such efforts can be improved by employing high-resolution geographically explicit methods for quantifying human health impacts of emissions of PM2.5 and its precursors. Here, we provide a detailed examination of the health and economic impacts of PM2.5 pollution in the United States by linking emission sources with resulting pollution concentrations. We estimate that anthropogenic PM2.5 was responsible for 107,000 premature deaths in 2011, at a cost to society of $886 billion. Of these deaths, 57% were associated with pollution caused by energy consumption [e.g., transportation (28%) and electricity generation (14%)]; another 15% with pollution caused by agricultural activities. A small fraction of emissions, concentrated in or near densely populated areas, plays an outsized role in damaging human health with the most damaging 10% of total emissions accounting for 40% of total damages. We find that 33% of damages occur within 8 km of emission sources, but 25% occur more than 256 km away, emphasizing the importance of tracking both local and long-range impacts. Our paper highlights the importance of a fine-scale approach as marginal damages can vary by over an order of magnitude within a single county. Information presented here can assist mitigation efforts by identifying those sources with the greatest health effects. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

This study uses Kaya identity to decompose carbon emission and construct simultaneous equations model to empirically examine the factor market distortion and the carbon emission scale effect of two-way FDI. The results show that the inward foreign direct investment (IFDI) increase regional carbon emission through scale effect and also exacerbates factor market distortion in China, whereas the outward FDI trends reduce carbon emission and reduces factor market distortions in China. The study also shows that human capital, research and development (R&D), trade openness, and capital accumulation are important determinants of two-way FDI. Therefore, the study proposes that IFDI policies should focus on acquiring green technologies.

These campaigns were aimed at understanding the microscale spatio-temporal variation of ambient concentration levels in areas with high pollution values to obtain data to validate models on the effect of urban trees on particulate matter concentrations. Two different measuring approaches have been used. The first one was static, with instruments continuously characterizing the meteorological variables and the particulate matter concentration outside and inside the park. During the summer campaign, the particulate matter concentration was clearly influenced by a Saharan dust outbreak during the period 23 June to 10 July 2016, when most of the particulate matter was in the fraction PM2.5-10. During the winter campaign, the mass concentrations were related to the meteorological conditions and the high atmospheric stability. The second approach was a dynamic case with mobile measurements by portable instruments. During the summer campaign, a DustTrak instrument was used to measure PM10 and PM2.5 in different transects close to and inside the park at different distances from the traffic lane. It was observed a decrease in the concentrations up to 25% at 20 m and 50% at 200 m. High PM10 values were linked to dust resuspension caused by recreational activities and to a Saharan dust outbreak. The highest PM values were measured at the Independencia square, an area with many bus stops and high traffic density. During the winter campaign, three microaethalometers were used for Black Carbon measurement. Both pollutants also showed a reduction in their concentrations when moving towards inside the park. For PM10 and PM2.5, reductions up to 50% were observed, while for BC this reduction was smaller, about 20%. © 2019 Elsevier LtdA positive impact of vegetation on particle air pollution has been observed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; PMx; Urban aerosols","Air quality; Dust; Forestry; Particulate emissions; Trees (mathematics); Vegetation; Ambient concentrations; Atmospheric stability; Experimental campaign; Meteorological condition; Meteorological variables; Recreational activities; Spatio-temporal variation; Urban aerosols; Atmospheric aerosols; black carbon; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; concentration (composition); experimental study; particulate matter; traffic emission; urban area; vegetation; air pollution; Article; controlled study; meteorology; particulate matter; pollutant; seasonal variation; Spain; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic; urban area; vegetation; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; city; dust; environmental monitoring; particle size; season; statistics and numerical data; Madrid [Madrid (ADS/PRV)]; Madrid [Spain]; Spain; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060944853

Nowadays, research and development efforts are mainly focusing on advanced technologies to separate H2 and CO2 from a synthesis gas of a gasification-based power generation system. In this regard, membrane separation processes are attracting an increasing attention, due to their potential for a more cost-effective and environmental friendly CO2 capture compared to well-established solvent-based processes. A conceptual design and techno-economic analysis is presented of a pre-combustion CO2 capture process based on H2-selective polymeric membranes in an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant, including the water-gas-shift (WGS) system. The design approach is based on the selection of the most effective membrane separation process and economic optimization of operating conditions. The capture process is based on a three-stage membrane separation system, producing a hydrogen stream feeding the power generation unit and a liquid CO2 stream, ready for transport and geological storage. Considering a state-of-the-art polymeric membrane with a H2 to CO2 selectivity of 15 and H2 permeance of 300 GPU, the IGCC efficiency penalty states at around 5% pts when the separation process is operated with a pressure on membrane feed side of 70 bar, corresponding to an estimated cost of CO2 capture of 16.6 €/t CO2. A sensitivity analysis of operating pressure and membrane properties revealed that the cost of CO2 capture can be reduced to less than 15 €/t CO2 by moderately increasing the H2 to CO2 selectivity and adjusting the designed process accordingly. Additionally, a decrease in the feed-side pressure slightly disfavours the economic performance of CO2 capture for H2 permeances greater than 300 GPU. The membrane-based capture process compared most favourably in cost-effectiveness with the well-established solvent based Selexol process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","IGCC power plant; Membrane H2 separation; Pre-combustion CO2 capture; Process economics; Process optimization","Carbon dioxide; Combined cycle power plants; Conceptual design; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Economic analysis; Gas generators; Gasification; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Optimization; Petroleum prospecting; Polymeric membranes; Polymers; Precombustion; Sensitivity analysis; Separation; Water gas shift; CO2 capture; Environmental pollutions; Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle power plants; Membrane separation process; Power generation systems; Process economics; Research and development; Techno-Economic analysis; Coal combustion; carbon dioxide; coal; hydrogen; Article; combustion; desulfurization; electric power plant; energy recovery; gasification; membrane; membrane permeability; partial pressure; pressure; priority journal; process optimization; Carbon Dioxide; Cost Effectiveness; Economic Analysis; Gas Generators; Gasification; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060237827

The main objectives of the optimized design of renewable energy system are: (1) decrease the CO2 emissions, (2) reduce the energy consumption from the grid by adding more renewable resources such as solar, and (3) fresh water production for irrigation using underground or sea water reverse osmosis water treatment/desalination system. The goal is to integrate sustainable power and water systems to meet the challenges of climate change and water shortages especially in desert regions. Modeling and simulation for the optimized design of renewable energy system for the agriculture farm was used in this study. The results show that the grid-tied solar PV energy system has the best performance compared to the grid and standalone renewable power system. The solar energy system connected to the grid is a good option for the agriculture farm with respect to the cost (85/MWh), renewable fraction (67%), and greenhouse gas emissions (208 kg of carbon dioxide per MWh of energy produced). © 2019 IEEE.","Agriculture farm; Control strategies; Modeling simulation; Optimization; Reverse Osmosis; Solar Photovoltaics; Water Treatment","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Optimization; Reverse osmosis; Seawater; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Control strategies; Fresh water production; Model and simulation; Model simulation; Renewable energy systems; Renewable power systems; Solar photovoltaics; Solar PV energy systems; Water treatment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075018674

Projected changes in indices characterizing precipitation extremes of the 1.5 °C and 2 °C global warming levels (GWLs) exceeding pre-industrial conditions are analyzed, comparing the reference period (1976-2005) with an ensemble of CORDEX simulations. The results show that projected changes in precipitation extreme indices are significantly amplified over the Indochina Peninsula and the Maritime Continent at both GWLs. The increases of precipitation extremes are essentially affected by enhanced convective precipitation. The number of wet and extremely wet days is increasing more abruptly than both the total and daily average precipitation of all wet days, emphasizing the critical risks linked with extreme precipitation. Additionally, significant changes can also be observed between the GWLs of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, especially over the Maritime Continent, suggesting the high sensitivity of precipitation extremes to the additional 0.5 °C GWL increase. The present study reveals the potential influence of both 1.5 °C and 2 °C GWLs on regional precipitation over SEA, highlights the importance of restricting mean global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial conditions and provides essential information on manageable climate adaptation and mitigation strategies for the developing countries in SEA. © 2019 The Author(s).

We assess the water resources in an understudied country, Haiti, to estimate the geomorphological (8 variables), hydrological (7), and climatological (7) behaviors of the main (26) watersheds. This generated almost exhaustive knowledge of the surface and sub-surface components of the CWC. In this paper, we intend to integrate these components into a synthetic and coherent view of the environment by looking for relationships between each other. We explore the correlations between several variables (including daily rainfall, river discharge, and river network metrics) of the pre-mentioned water components using robust and rigorous statistical analyses. We found a significant yet weak (spatiotemporal) correlation between the geomorphologic and climatologic components (RV test comparing two datasets with permutations, p-value ¼ 103). Some partial, weak, and contingent relationships between specific geomorphologic, hydrologic, and climatologic behaviors were apparent too. The final comparison between atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere in Haiti consists in the definition of four watershed categories showing strongly differentiated water cycle behaviors in the country, thus suggesting developing integrated mechanistic models for a multidisciplinary management of the CWC. © IWA Publishing 2019.","Channel network; Multiscale behavior; Rainfall regime; Regionalization; River discharge; Watershed","Rain; Rivers; Watersheds; Channel network; Multiscale behavior; Rainfall regime; Regionalization; River discharge; Geomorphology; climate effect; correlation; fluvial geomorphology; hydrological modeling; knowledge; landform; precipitation intensity; regionalization; river discharge; watershed; Haiti; Hispaniola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064192752

Today, it is the first European cereal producer, with cereal crops accounting for 40% of the agricultural surface area used, and is also a major country for livestock breeding with 25% of the European cattle livestock. This major socioecological transition, with rapid intensification and specialisation in an open global market, has been accompanied by deep environmental changes. To explore the changes in agricultural GHG emissions over the long term (1852–2014), we analysed the emission factors of N 2 O from field experiments covering major land uses, in a gradient of fertilisation and within a range of temperature and rainfall, and used CH 4 emission coefficients for livestock categories, in terms of enteric and manure management, considering the historical changes in animal excretion rates. We also estimated indirect CO 2 emissions, rarely accounted for in agricultural emissions, using coefficients found in the literature for the dominant energy consumption items (fertiliser production, field work and machinery, and feed import). From GHG emissions of ~30,000 ktons CO 2 Eq yr −1 in 1852, reaching 54,000 ktons CO 2 Eq yr −1 in 1955, emissions more than doubled during the ‘Glorious thirties’ (1950–1980), and peaked around 120,000 ktons CO 2 Eq yr −1 in the early 2000s. For the 2010–2014 period, French agriculture GHG emissions stabilised at ~114,000 ktons CO 2 Eq yr −1 , distributed into 49% methane (CH 4 ), 22% carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and 29% nitrous oxide (N 2 O). A regional approach through 33 regions in France shows a diversity of agriculture reflecting the hydro-ecoregion distribution and the agricultural specialisation of local areas. Exploring contrasting scenarios at the 2040 horizon suggests that only deep changes in the structure of the agro-food system would double the reduction of GHG emissions by the agricultural sector. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","French agriculture; GHG emissions; Historical reconstruction; Scenario analysis; Spatial distribution","Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Land use; Machinery; Nitrogen oxides; Spatial distribution; Agricultural emissions; Agricultural sector; Emission coefficient; Environmental change; GHG emission; Historical reconstruction; Rapid intensification; Scenario analysis; Agriculture; carbon dioxide; fertilizer; methane; nitrous oxide; carbon dioxide; methane; rain; carbon emission; greenhouse gas; intensive agriculture; livestock farming; long-term change; methane; nitrous oxide; reconstruction; scenario analysis; spatial distribution; traditional agriculture; agriculture; Article; biodiversity; carbon footprint; controlled study; energy consumption; environmental change; environmental management; feeding; field experiment; field work; France; land use; livestock; machine; nonhuman; priority journal; temperature; agriculture; analysis; animal; food grain; greenhouse gas; pollution; procedures; France; Animalia; Bos; Agriculture; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Edible Grain; Environmental Pollution; Fertilizers; France; Greenhouse Gases; Livestock; Methane; Rain; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060110791

These changes will likely exacerbate ongoing challenges in the governance of small-scale fisheries, which play a significant role in supporting livelihoods and food security throughout the world. Among fishers in Mexico, the perceived impacts of climate change on coastal fisheries are increasingly salient. The purpose of this paper is to examine how the realities of climate change and other socio-environmental phenomena are discursively co-produced by fishers and government actors in a distinct type of political arena: the general assemblies of federated fishing cooperatives. Fishing cooperatives in Mexico organize into regional-level federations, which in turn form national-level confederations. Confederations are therefore multi-level, nested organizations for collective action and political representation. Here, we examine the interactions between fishers and federal government officials in the 2016 general assembly of one confederation, which represents 25 federations with 338 cooperatives. The general assembly of the confederation serves as a political space for open democratic participation among members and, in this case, discussions between fishers and government representatives. The discourses employed by fishers and government actors reveal tensions about the role of the state, the purpose of scientific knowledge in resource management, and the nature of the cooperative small-scale fishing sector. Insights from this case are used to advance discussions about the value of examining discursive practices to gain insights about fisheries policy, through a critical discussion of the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework. We theorize discursive practices as part of politicized performances that coalitions of actors use to express policy preferences and weave together governance narratives, which are useful for understanding positions and broader debates at the national level. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Discourse; Narrative analysis; Policy processes; Small-scale fisheries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065922347

However, their occurrence in hydrocarbon-polluted environments is less investigated, although specific communities may be present with possible interest for remediation strategies. Here, we investigated the AMF community composition associated with the roots of diverse plant species naturally recolonizing a weathered crude oil pond in the Amazon region of Ecuador. Next generation 454 GS-Junior sequencing of an 800 bp LSU rRNA gene PCR amplicon was used. PCR amplicons were affiliated to a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree computed from 1.5 kb AMF reference sequences. A high throughput phylogenetic annotation approach, using an evolutionary placement algorithm (EPA) allowed the characterization of sequences to the species level. Fifteen species were detected. Acaulospora species were identified as dominant colonizers, with 73% of relative read abundance, Archaeospora (19.6%) and several genera from the Glomeraceae (Rhizophagus, Glomus macrocarpum-like, Sclerocystis, Dominikia and Kamienskia) were also detected. Although, a diverse community belonging to Glomeraceae was revealed, they represented <10% of the relative abundance in the Pond. Seventy five % of the species could not be identified, suggesting possible new species associated with roots of plants under highly hydrocarbon-polluted conditions. © 2018 The Authors.

Previously, pure ethanol (E100) was selected as the preliminary test fuel in a single injection compression-ignition engine, and was shown to have good potential for low engine-out NOx emissions under low and medium load conditions due to its inverted ignition sequence. Under high load, however, the near-stoichiometric and non-homogeneous fuel/air distribution removes the effectiveness of the inverted φ-sensitivity. Therefore, it is desirable to recover the combustion sequence in the chamber such that the leaner region is burned before the near-stoichiometric region. When the combustion in near-stoichiometric region is inhibited, the temperature rise of that region is hindered and the formation of NOx is suppressed. To achieve the goal of homogenizing the mixture before combustion, thus switching ignition mode and lowering emissions when fueling with the target fuel, multiple direct-injection strategies are applied to this study. 3-D engine CFD simulations are conducted with different multiple injection strategies under high-load operations in a compression-ignition engine. The injection characteristics of optimized cases are examined in KIAV-3V coupled with a Genetic Algorithm(GA). An objective function is used to qualify the realization of optimized cases with minimized engine-out NOx, carbon monoxide (CO), soot and unburned hydrocarbon (UHC), while preserving engine performance. It is found that with multiply direct-injection strategies, the desired inverted φ-sensitivity dominated ignition can be regained under high-load engine operation conditions, uniform fuel-air mixture before combustion can be retrieved, and lower in-cylinder temperature and pressure are possible.

In the context of climate warming, the climate-based boundaries of multiple cropping systems are moving northward, and the potential crop yield is projected to increase due to continuous cropping that will be possible with increased light and heat resources. However, increasing demands for crop water have further aggravated the severity of water shortages in Northern China. In this study, we determine the impacts of climate change on the double cropping system (DCS) in Northern China using the annual accumulated temperature above 0 °C. The northern climate-based boundaries of the DCS have moved significantly northward and westward in Liaoning, Hebei, Gansu, Shaanxi and Shanxi Provinces. At the same time, the annual crop water requirement has increased by 198–403 mm in the planting areas sensitive to climate change [areas where the cropping system can potentially be transformed from a single cropping system (SCS) to a DCS]. The highest probability of water deficit exceedance was found during the winter wheat growing season. In addition, the difference in crop yields between the two planting patterns was analyzed using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model. The annual output per arable land unit in the potential DCS region, which benefited from the increase in winter crops, increased by 11.6–86.2% under different irrigation scenarios. The increase in crop production is related to irrigation. In the water-saving irrigation scenarios of Irrigation-Wheat (180 mm for winter wheat critical growth periods) and Irrigation-Wheat & Maize (180 mm for winter wheat critical growth periods and 50 mm for maize sowing), the annual output reached approximately 74–80% of the potential high yield in the Full Irrigation scenario. Our research provides suggestions for adjusting planting patterns under climate change. In the future, it will be necessary to develop multiple cropping practices that include innovative water-saving techniques and breeding technologies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Crop water requirement; Crop yield; Multiple cropping systems; Northern China","agricultural modeling; agrometeorology; arable land; climate change; climate effect; continuous cropping; crop production; crop yield; double cropping; growing season; water use efficiency; wheat; China; Gansu; Hebei; Liaoning; Shaanxi; Shanxi; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060259405

In this study, a bottom-up approach is used to build the inventory of air pollutants in China's steel industry. We analyzed the temporal and spatial characteristics of the atmospheric emission inventory of China's steel industry. The results show that: (1) In 2015, the total amount of SO2, NOx, PM, PM2.5, PM10 and PCDD/Fs emissions from Chinese steel industry were 1697.58kt, 1017.24kt, 4028.01kt, 849.02kt, 1330.53kt and 1216.83g I-TEQ, respectively. SO2, NOx, PM, PM10 and PCDD/Fs emissions mainly came from the sintering process, and PM2.5 came from the converter process. (2) NOx emissions show an “upward” trend, while SO2 emissions depict a “slowdown” trend. PM, PM2.5, PM10 and PCDD/Fs emissions present inverse U-shape trends. (3) The air pollutant inventory of Chinese steel industry indicates obviously spatial characteristics. Taking SO2 emissions in 2015 as an example, SO2 emissions from steel industry in North China and East China reached 1006.63kt, accounting for 65.2% of the total emissions. Hebei, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces where locate intensive traditional steel enterprises with majority of steel products generated SO2 emissions of approximately 404.04kt, 171.83kt and 156.28kt respectively, accounting for 23.80%, 10.12% and 9.20% total emissions of China's steel industry. (4) The simulation model of air pollutants (SO2, PM) was established taking adjusted production capacity and layout of steel industry into consideration, the simulation suggests that SO2 and PM emissions are projected to decrease by 1Mt, 2 Mt, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollutants; Emission inventory; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Steel industry","Air pollution; Emission control; Energy conservation; Hazardous materials; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Sintering; Steelmaking; Air pollutant emission; Air pollutants; Atmospheric emission inventory; Chinese steel industry; Emission inventories; Energy saving and emission reductions; Spatial characteristics; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Iron and steel industry; nitrogen oxide; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; bottom-up approach; emission inventory; iron and steel industry; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollutant; air pollution control; Article; China; energy conservation; furnace; industrial production; iron and steel industry; particulate matter; simulation; spatiotemporal analysis; trend study; China; Hebei; Jiangsu; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059528519

In this work thermal stimulation technique has been deepened for replacing CH4 with CO2. Using a lab-scale reactor, eight experimental tests were carried out, characterized by two phases. The first one consists in the methane hydrates formation and is the same for all experiments. The second one consists in the replacement process and has been conducted with two different methods. In the first four tests CO2 was first introduced to reach a solid phase of methane hydrates and a gaseous phase composed of both CH4 and CO2; subsequently the temperature was increased. In the other four tests, the first step consisted in increasing temperature and then introducing CO2. In this case, the temperature required to move the thermodynamic conditions from a region suitable for the formation of both CH4 and CO2 hydrate to a region where the formation process can only involve CO2, was achieved without additional thermal energy; in fact, when the CO2 hydrates began to form, an immediate and massive release of heat took place. The results show that the methane yield and the amount of CO2 that can be stored do not differ between the two types of tests, but the thermal energy required to complete the process is much lower in the tests conducted with the second method. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 replacement; Lab-scale reactor; Natural gas hydrates; Thermal energy saving; Thermal stimulation strategies","Carbon dioxide; Energy conservation; Hydration; Methane; Natural gas; Temperature; Testing; Thermal energy; CO2 replacement; Experimental test; Formation process; Increasing temperatures; Lab-scale reactor; Methane hydrates; Thermal stimulation; Thermodynamic conditions; Gas hydrates; carbon dioxide; comparative study; energy conservation; equipment; experimental study; gas hydrate; natural gas; replacement; simulation; temperature effect; thermal power; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061309325

Complete source profiles are required to be assessed for implementation of proper mitigation measures over the NCR. In this study, emission sources of PM2.5 are reported for the NCR of India for samples collected during December 2016 to December 2017 at three sampling sites in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Organic constituents (n-alkanes, isoprenoid hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalates, levoglucosan and n-alkanoic acids) in PM2.5 were measured to apportion the sources over the study area. Source apportionment of PM2.5 was performed using organic constituents by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Health risk associated with organic pollutants [PAHs and carcinogen BEHP bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate] demonstrated the threat of PM2.5 exposure via inhalation. Transport pathways of air masses were evaluated using 3-day backward trajectories and observed that some air masses originated from local sources along with long-range transport which influenced the PAHs concentration during most of the study period over the NCR. PMF and PCA resulted in the five major emission sources [vehicular emissions (32.2%), biomass burning (30%), cooking emissions (16.8%), plastic burning (13.4%), mixed sources (7.6%) including biogenic and industrial emissions] for PM2.5 over the sampling sites.

C4F7N is one of the most remarkable replacements for SF6 owing to its good insulating performance, low global warming potential and non-toxicity. The decomposition mechanism of C4F7N is important in evaluating the insulation performance but it is still not clear. Therefore, the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) method in conjunction with transition state theory is used to study the decomposition mechanism of C4F7N. Sixteen reactions are found in the decomposition pathways of C4F7N. The optimized configurations and harmonic vibrational frequencies of selected species are very consistent with experimental data to verify the method adopted in this paper. The potential energy surface of these reactions are obtained and the reaction mechanisms are analyzed. The rate constants over 300 K-3500 K relevant to the insulation breakdown temperature are computed based on the above quantum chemistry calculations and dominant reactions in different temperature regions are selected. For example, reaction R5 (C4F7N → TS2 → FCN + CF2CFCF3) is the most important reaction leading to the dissociation of C4F7N below 600 K, while reaction R2 (C4F7N → C2F4CN + CF3) takes the place of reaction R5 over 600 K to 3300 K and reaction R3 (C4F7N → TS1 → CF2CFCN + CF4) becomes dominant above 700 K; reaction R15 (CF2CFCNCF3 → CF2CFCN + CF3) plays the major role in the generation of CF3 with the overwhelming contribution rate. The results obtained here are expected to construct a relatively complete C4F7N decomposition scheme, including the main byproduct formation processes and to lay a theoretical basis for the investigation of its insulation performance. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","C4F7N; decomposition mechanism; decomposition products; rate constant, density functional theory","Density functional theory; Electric circuit breakers; Global warming; Insulation; Potential energy; Quantum chemistry; Rate constants; SF6 insulation; Sulfur hexafluoride; Surface reactions; C4F7N; Decomposition mechanism; Decomposition products; Global warming potential; Harmonic vibrational frequencies; Optimized configuration; Quantum chemistry calculations; Transition state theories; Decomposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063446614

Given their proximity to the land, they are also vulnerable to excessive nutrient inputs, which can lead to eutrophication and hypoxia. Water column hypoxia can dramatically alter sediment biogeochemistry, yet the response of specific processes varies widely. Predicting whether sediments are sources or sinks of ecologically and climatologically relevant nutrients and gases remains elusive, particularly for shallow coastal regions. In this study, we conducted experiments with sediments collected from Waquoit Bay (Massachusetts, United States) and measured dissolved nutrient and gas fluxes across the sediment-water interface to investigate the impact of water column hypoxia (defined here as dissolved oxygen ≤3 mg/L) on three important ecosystem functions: nutrient regeneration, removal of reactive nitrogen, and the regulation of greenhouse gases. Under hypoxia we observed variable responses in sediment biogeochemical cycling, including little to no change in important nitrogen cycling processes such as ammonium efflux and nitrogen removal through denitrification. As expected, low oxygen conditions stimulated sediment phosphate efflux. This caused nutrient ratios for both nitrogen to phosphorus and silica to phosphorus in the overlying water to decrease by 50%. Such changes can alter both the composition of water column primary producers as well as the rate of primary production. Hypoxia led to an almost 60% decrease in sediment nitrous oxide consumption but had little impact on sediment methane emissions. Taken together, these experimental results suggest sediment biogeochemical cycling has variable and dynamic responses to hypoxia. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

Thus, in this paper, a PV/wind source with various backups including battery/grid/diesel generator for an educational load with 35kW peak in Tehran city are proposed in order to reach the minimum lifecycle cost (NPC) by HOMER. The results show that grid-connected 150kW PV-110kW converter system is the most economical option among all 36 feasible systems due to supportive policies and subsidizing for renewable retailers in Iran. Not only could this system make the emissions produced by educational load equal to zero, but also it reduces other loads' emissions by helping the grid to meet surrounding loads. The other results of this paper show that in grid-battery and diesel-battery backup systems, Cycle Charging (CC) dispatch strategy has more economical result than Load following (LF) dispatch strategy. Furthermore, wind turbines in Tehran region is not economical, but if they were used, it would be better to implement small 1kW XL.1 wind turbine rather than a 10kW XLS one.

The well-documented process of forest recovery in Puerto Rico offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the potential of second-growth tropical forests for forestry. Here, we combined 10 years of forest inventory data with ethnobotanical information to determine trends in forest cover, stand structure, and timber volume, as well as the suitability of useful tree species for timber and non-timber forest products. We observed a period of stability in the process of forest recovery. Even though the forests are still too young for extensive forestry, they are rich in useful species and contain high densities of trees suited for timber and several non-timber forest products. These results suggest that Puerto Rico’s forests have substantial capability for forestry and research on silvicultural practices. Today, numerous government programs encourage reforestation in private forests.

Although their potential to mitigate biodiversity loss is recognised, this ecological function has not been investigated, in particular with respect to insect diversity. Over two summers, we used light trapping to sample Lepidoptera (moths) and Coleoptera (beetles) in multiple-species plantings in two distinct locations in Victoria (plantings of four ages per location) as well as in nearby remnant forest and in pasture. At both locations, we found that plantings had a greater abundance of Lepidoptera than remnants but that the abundance in plantings was comparable to the abundance in pasture. The species richness of Lepidoptera in plantings did not differ significantly from that in remnants but was significantly greater than that in pasture. The abundance and species richness of Coleoptera in plantings was lower than in remnant forests but higher than in pasture. The community composition of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera in plantings was intermediate between that of remnant forest and pasture, i.e. possibly transitional between the two vegetation types. Dissimilarity between all vegetation types was nevertheless high, reflecting that the abundance of individual taxa reflects the influence of temporally and spatially dependent factors, e.g. host plant size and suitability. Greater abundances of grass-feeding Lepidoptera in plantings explained much of the dissimilarity between plantings and remnant forests. Proximity to remnant forest was an important determinant of the community composition of Lepidoptera but not of Coleoptera. Moth forewing length (relevant to vagility which is an indicator of dispersal capacity) appeared less important to proximity relationships than larval host plant specificity, i.e. whether grass or dicot-feeding. The location of sequestration plantings relative to remnant forest as well as their composition (including the persistence of pasture grasses) will determine the attractiveness of the resources provided to insect herbivores and hence the rate at which they are colonised. Plantings near remnant native forest benefit insect diversity but adoption of novel silvicultural practices could hasten the rate at which they become functional mimics of native forests and support more comparable communities of insect. Potential trade-offs between increased establishment costs and more complex carbon accounting might need to be investigated to cost biodiversity credits associated with dual accreditation schemes. © 2019, © 2019 Institute of Foresters of Australia (IFA).","biodiversity; conservation biology; ecosystem services; restoration ecology","Carbon dioxide; Conservation; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Location; Reforestation; Vegetation; Agricultural landscapes; Carbon accounting; Community composition; Conservation biology; Ecological functions; Ecosystem services; Restoration ecology; Silvicultural practices; Biodiversity; Biodiversity; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation; Ecosystems; Plants; Reforestation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067700001

Quantitative basin-scale biogeochemical budgets are still scarce despite the current need of establishing baselines of knowledge in a changing ocean. The physico-chemical data from the eight repetitions of the OVIDE section (2002–2016) are an unique opportunity to develop a novel evaluation of biogeochemical budgets in the eSPNA by combining robust and well established decadal mean mass transports with carbon variables, oxygen and inorganic nutrients in a full-depth inverse box model. The net balance between the carbon fixation and the respiration throughout the whole water column shows that the eSPNA is an important dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) sink area where 119 ± 43 kmol·s −1 and 49 ± 31 kmol·s −1 of organic and inorganic carbon, respectively, are currently exported. The uptake due to mixed layer depth oxygenation of 807 ± 114 kmol·s −1 of oxygen from the atmosphere and its subsequent southward export are responsible for deep Atlantic Ocean oxygenation. Deep water formation processes connect the northward upper limb with the southward lower limb of the AMOC leading to tracer export to the deep ocean. With regard to the net macronutrient budgets, all element consumptions are balanced within uncertainties. The results presented here for carbon export and oxygen uptake are in agreement with the upper range of previous observations based on different methods. The findings of this integrated budget driven by circulation in the highly dynamic region of the eSPNA can be taken as a reference in future biogeochemical evaluations of the North Atlantic. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biogeochemical cycles; Carbon cycle; Carbon sinks; Nutrient cycles; Oceanic transports; Oxygenation; Subpolar North Atlantic","Biogeochemistry; Budget control; Carbon; Ecology; Inverse problems; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Oxygen; Oxygenation; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Biogeochemical cycle; Carbon cycles; Carbon sink; Nutrient cycle; Oceanic transports; Subpolar North Atlantic; Oceanography; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; carbon fixation; carbon sink; deep water formation; dissolved inorganic carbon; long-term change; meridional circulation; mixed layer; oceanic circulation; overturn; oxygenation; quantitative analysis; transport process; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061809242

The results indicate that planetary CO2 budgets ranging from ≈3 orders of magnitude lower than Earth's to ≈1 order of magnitude larger, along with radiogenic heating budgets as large or larger than Earth's, allow for habitable climates lasting 1-5 Gyr. The ability of stagnant lid planets to recover from potential snowball states is also explored; recovery is found to depend on whether atmosphere-ocean chemical exchange is possible. For a ""hard"" snowball with no exchange, recovery is unlikely, as most CO2 outgassing takes place via metamorphic decarbonation of the crust, which occurs below the ice layer. However, for a ""soft"" snowball where there is exchange between atmosphere and ocean, planets can readily recover. For both hard and soft snowball states, there is a minimum CO2 budget needed for recovery; below this limit, any snowball state would be permanent. Thus, there is the possibility for hysteresis in stagnant lid planet climate evolution, where planets with low CO2 budgets that start off in a snowball climate will be permanently stuck in this state, while otherwise identical planets that start with a temperate climate will be capable of maintaining this climate for 1 Gyr or more. Finally, the model results have important implications for future exoplanet missions, as they can guide observations to planets most likely to possess habitable climates. © 2019.

CO exposure was measured during four field surveys on State Route #82 (El Camino Real) on the San Francisco Peninsula in 1980–1981, 1991–1992, 2001–2002, and 2010–2011. Each field survey took at least 12 months. Fifty trips from each survey—for a total of 200 trips—were matched by date, day of the week, and starting time of the day to facilitate comparisons over three decades. The mean net CO concentration of each trip was obtained by subtracting the background CO level from the average CO concentration for the entire trip. The mean net CO concentration (0.5 ppm) for 2010–2011 was only 5.2% of that (9.7 ppm) for 1980–1981. For the 50 trips, the average travel time for the 1980–1981 period (39.6 min) was only 8.3% higher than during the 2010–2011 period (36.3 min). The estimated round-trip distance on the highway was held constant at 11.8 miles. The reduction in the mean net CO concentration was attributed to more stringent CO emission standards on new vehicles sold in California since 1980. The state’s cold-temperature CO standard implemented in 1996 appeared to reduce high CO concentrations that were observed during the late fall and winter of 1980–1981. In addition, the observed standard deviation in concentration fell from 3.1 ppm in 1980–1981 to 0.2 ppm in 2010–2011, and the range of the 50 mean net CO concentrations narrowed from 14.9 ppm in 1980–1981 to 1.1 ppm in 2010–2011, but the relative variability, as indicated by the geometric standard deviation, remained the same. These results have important scientific implications for regulatory policies designed to control air pollution from motor vehicles. Implications: Many developing countries launched or expanded their mobile source emission control programs in the 1990s, yet many of them do not have adequate inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs. The El Camino Real study shows the long-term public health benefits of more stringent motor vehicle emission standards for carbon monoxide (CO) on new cars and of an I/M program (Smog Check) on the existing fleet in California. The study provides a protocol for conducting standardized field surveys of in-vehicle exposure on a periodic basis. Such surveys would enable developing countries to assess the progress of their mobile source emission control programs. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.",,"Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Developing countries; Emission control; Fleet operations; Mobile power plants; Statistics; Surveys; Travel time; Average travel time; Geometric standard deviations; Inspection and maintenance; Longitudinal study; Mobile source emissions; Motor vehicle emissions; Regulatory policies; Standard deviation; Vehicles; carbon monoxide; air pollutant; air pollution; California; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; human; longitudinal study; season; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon Monoxide; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; San Francisco; Seasons; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059913115

A 2015 US Department of Energy study maps an ambitious roadmap for offshore wind power to be capable of meeting substantial US electric-generating capacity by 2050. Our study addresses the neodymium material requirements that would be needed. We find that regional differences in deployment schedules will result in complex patterns of new capacity additions occurring concomitantly with turbine retirements and replacement needs. These demands would total over 15.5 Gg (15.5 kt) of neodymium by 2050, of which 20% could potentially be avoided by circular usage from decommissioned turbines but only if recycling technologies are developed or, better still, magnets are designed for reuse.

This paper presents a first attempt in proposing an integrated evaluation of the actual benefits expected from bioethanol in the transport sector, by applying the Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) to the prospective realization of a local system of bio-refinery in Campania Region (Southern Italy). MuSIASEM is a multi-criteria analysis enabling to deal with the complexity of a territorial energy system. Since the unavoidable intrinsic uncertainty, the study does not focus on predictions, but adopts a strategy of Quantitative Story-Telling about some relevant results underlying the limits and critical issues about the energy converter fabric, the economic profitability, environmental constraints and the questionable concept of marginal land. The findings suggest concluding toward falsification of key points in the current narrative: (i) the system is not an efficient solar energy converter; (ii) it fails to realize many of the expectations for a renewable energy carrier producer; (iii) the contribution to decarbonization strategies is not as high as desired and other environmental impacts could not be neglected; (iv) the very large land requirement is hardly compatible with conversion of truly marginal land in Campania region; (v) compared to alternate land uses it does not seem an actually promising strategy to regain value from rural economy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Economic profit; Energy converter; Marginal lands; MuSIASEM; Second generation bioethanol","Environmental impact; Ethanol; Land use; Profitability; Solar energy; Economic profit; Energy converters; Marginal lands; MuSIASEM; Second generation bioethanol; Bioethanol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060761132

In addition, the rapidity of the ignition via hot jet makes this technology appropriate for deflagrative pressure-gain combustors using a wave rotor, which have high-frequency operation and fast-burn requirements. In order to improve the controllability of the ignition process, the thermofluidic and chemical mechanisms by which the ignition is promoted need to be rigorously elaborated. In the present work, the chemical thermofluid dynamics of a transient turbulent hot jet in a reactive environment is studied via large eddy simulation (LES) with detailed kinetic chemistry. Computational model of the reacting and non-reacting jets are presented, analyzed and compared to the available experimental data. Various mesh sizes in conjunction with adaptive mesh refinement were tested to ensure the insensitivity of the solution to the grid. To quantify the effect of main chamber fuel reactivity on the ignition process, two different blends of methane-hydrogen under the same equivalence ratios are tested and the effective thermo-chemical mechanisms of ignition are investigated. It is understood that the ignition kernels emerge at the regions with minimal scalar dissipation rate, mainly at the trailing shear layer of the jet, and are partially transported to or formed at the head vortex. The temporal variation of the heat release rate and formaldehyde distribution at the fuel mixture with lower hydrogen content suggests that auto-ignition is responsible for the subsequent flame formation. However, for higher hydrogen content, it is observed that auto-ignition is not as prolonged beyond the initial kernels, while the propagating premixed flame that emanates from the shear layer mostly comprises the overall heat release. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Auto-ignition; Hot jet ignition; LES","Hydrogen; Large eddy simulation; Mesh generation; Mixtures; Shear flow; Adaptive mesh refinement; Auto-ignition; Computational model; Heat Release Rate (HRR); High frequency operation; Ignition technology; Scalar dissipation rate; Thermo-fluid dynamics; Ignition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063203837

These challenges continue and can be hard to overcome at all levels. This paper investigates this problem at regional level by measuring public acceptance towards development of climate-friendly technologies in order to provide required feedbacks to policy-makers of the government for ushering changes in their policies already made or in their executing mechanism, possibly deducting future risks such as public opposition from their end and improving the level of acceptance. This study uses a mixed-methods analytical approach for quantitatively taking that level, including creativity techniques and fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs). FCMs could directly map out policy-makers’ cognitions on the problem. This study provides the mathematical formulation of the problem with its conceptual interpretation to import policy-makers’ knowledge into FCMs when the knowledge is gained explicitly with creativity techniques.

Extreme events such as this have immediate and knock-on effects on water availability for household, agricultural and industrial use. Groundwater resources can provide a buffer in times of drought, but may themselves be stressed by reduced recharge and increased usage, posing significant challenges to groundwater resource management. In the context of East Africa, groundwater management is also hampered by a lack of information on aquifer characteristics. With the aim of addressing this knowledge gap, this study shows the hydrogeological behaviour before and during La Niña 2016/17 drought in southern coastal Kenya on a groundwater system which sits within a geological structure which is representative of an important portion of the East African coast. Diverse hydrochemical and isotopic campaigns, as well as groundwater head variation measurements, were carried out to study the groundwater hydrodynamics and thus characterize the aquifer system under climatic conditions before and during the La Niña event. This information is complemented with an estimation of changes in local recharge since 2012 using local data sets. The main consequence of the drought was a 69% reduction of recharge compared to an average climatic year. There was reduced recharge during the first rainy season (April–June) and no recharge during the second wet season (October–December). There was a concurrent increase in seawater intrusion even during the wet season. © 2019","Aquifer; Hydrochemistry; Isotopes; Kenya; Recharge; Saline intrusion","Aquifers; Atmospheric pressure; Drought; Groundwater geochemistry; Hydrochemistry; Hydrodynamics; Isotopes; Recharging (underground waters); Salt water intrusion; Water management; Aquifer characteristics; Groundwater hydrodynamics; Groundwater management; Groundwater resource management; Kenya; Recharge; Saline intrusion; Variation measurements; Groundwater resources; ground water; sea water; climate effect; coastal aquifer; drought; groundwater flow; hydrochemistry; hydrodynamics; hydrological response; isotopic composition; recharge; saline intrusion; aquifer; Article; chemical analysis; climate; coastal waters; drought; El Nino; geology; geometry; hydrodynamics; informatician; Kenya; priority journal; seashore; season; East Africa; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060238082

Forest streams, with their large aquatic–terrestrial interface and strong dependence on terrestrially derived organic matter, are highly sensitive to forest changes. Fast-wood plantations can be particularly threatening if they markedly differ from native forests. Eucalyptus plantations, in particular, cover large areas worldwide (> 20 million ha, mostly from 35°S to 35°N), but their effects on stream functioning have been addressed mostly in the Iberian Peninsula, which limits generalization to other regions. We assessed the effect of eucalyptus plantations on total (microbial decomposers and macroinvertebrates; in coarse mesh bags) and microbial-driven (in fine mesh bags) leaf litter decomposition by comparing streams flowing through native forests and eucalyptus plantations in seven regions in the Iberian Peninsula, Central Africa and South America. We found an overall significant inhibition of total litter decomposition by 23%. The effect did not significantly differ across regions, although a significant inhibition was found for Spain (− 41%), South Brazil (− 31%) and Uruguay (− 36%) (Portugal had a marginally nonsignificant inhibition by 50%) but not for other regions, suggesting that the effects of plantations in temperate climates are mediated through effects on macroinvertebrate communities. Contrarily, the overall effect for microbial-driven litter decomposition was non-significant, but it significantly differed across regions with a significant stimulation in Central Brazil (110%) and Uruguay (32%), and nonsignificant effects for other regions (Kenya had a marginally nonsignificant inhibition by 48%), suggesting that functional redundancy among microbial communities is not general and effects can occur if plantations induce changes in nutrient availability, solar irradiation or litter characteristics. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","effect size; forest change; leaf litter decomposition; mesh bags; meta-analysis; response ratio; stream functioning","decomposition; ecosystem function; evergreen tree; forest ecosystem; global perspective; leaf litter; macroinvertebrate; meta-analysis; native species; plantation forestry; stream channel; Iberian Peninsula; Kenya; Portugal; Uruguay; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052584723

A firm, representative of the productive sector of a country, aims at maximizing its profits by expanding its production. Assuming that the output of production is proportional to the level of pollutants’ emissions, the firm increases the level of pollution. The government of the country aims at minimizing the social costs due to the pollution, and introduces regulatory constraints on the emissions’ level, which then effectively cap the output of production. Supposing that the firm and the government face both proportional and fixed costs in order to adopt their policies, we model the previous problem as a stochastic impulse two-person nonzero-sum game. The state variable of the game is the level of the output of production which evolves as a general linearly controlled one-dimensional Itô-diffusion. Following an educated guess, we first construct a pair of candidate equilibrium policies and of corresponding equilibrium values, and we then provide a set of sufficient conditions under which they indeed realize an equilibrium. Our results are complemented by a numerical study when the (uncontrolled) output of production evolves as a geometric Brownian motion, and the firm’s operating profit and the government’s running cost functions are of power type. An analysis of the dependency of the equilibrium policies and values on the model parameters yields interesting new behaviors that we explain as a consequence of the strategic interaction between the firm and the government. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Diffusions; Pollution; Stochastic impulse nonzero-sum game; Verification theorem",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048583751

The measurement sites were divided into three regions representing southwestern, southeastern and northern Sweden. The three regions clearly differ in deposition amount while the temporal variations were similar between the regions. Non-sea-salt sulphate (nss-SO42-) wet deposition reached a maximum around 1970 and ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3−) in the mid-1980s. There was a reasonable agreement between the decreasing wet deposition trends of NH4+ and nss-SO42-, during 1990–2016 and the estimated decrease in the emissions in Sweden and Europe. The decreasing wet deposition trend of NO3− was, however, weaker than the corresponding estimated reduction in emissions of NOx. The wet depositions of NH4+ and NO3− were similar in magnitude during the whole measurement period and distributed in a similar manner between the three regions despite that these pollutants are transported over long distances and that the sources and atmospheric chemistry for NHx and NOx are different. © 2019","Ammonium; Inter-annual variations; Long-term time trends; Nitrate; Non-sea-salt sulphate; Precipitation chemistry; Spatial distribution","Atmospheric chemistry; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Spatial distribution; Sulfur compounds; Ammonium; Interannual variation; Precipitation chemistry; Sulphates; Time trends; Deposition; ammonia; nitrate; nitrogen oxide; sodium chloride; sulfate; ammonium; ammonium compound; annual variation; atmospheric chemistry; database; emission control; long-term change; nitrate; pollutant transport; precipitation (chemistry); sea salt; spatial distribution; sulfate; temporal variation; trend analysis; wet deposition; acidification; Article; atmosphere; data base; Europe; forest; lake; precipitation; priority journal; Sweden; wet deposition; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061624653

The objectives of the study were to assess the usefulness of the biochemical markers in the screening of wheat cultivars having differential level of sensitivity to O 3 and different release time (modern and old cultivars). Ozone exposure led to an upsurge of ascorbic acid, thiols as well as their ratio greatly in the tolerant group followed by the intermediately sensitive group while least in sensitive one. Both ascorbic acid and thiol contents offered more resistance to early released cultivars compared to modern ones. Ascorbic acid served to be the most influential parameter for determining varietal response under elevated O 3 stress and directly linked with O 3 tolerance. Overall, the sensitive group suffered maximum yield losses while the minimum was observed in the tolerant group due to the differential enhancement of tolerance offered by antioxidants. Higher concentrations of antioxidants at early growth stages were highly correlated with final yield responses suggesting the role of antioxidants as a determinant of final yield. Findings of this study will help in the identification of O 3 tolerant and sensitive wheat cultivars for future screening programs using ascorbic acid and thiols as important markers of O 3 tolerance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ascorbic acid; Ozone; Thiols; Tolerance; Wheat; Yield","ascorbic acid; ozone; thiol derivative; ascorbic acid; biological marker; ozone; thiol derivative; ascorbic acid; biomarker; ozone; pollution tolerance; thiol; wheat; yield response; Article; controlled study; cultivar; environmental exposure; nonhuman; ozone depletion; physical sensitivity; physical tolerance; plant growth; plant metabolism; plant stress; plant yield; wheat; air pollutant; drug effect; environmental monitoring; food grain; metabolism; physiology; plant leaf; toxicity; wheat; India; Triticum aestivum; Air Pollutants; Ascorbic Acid; Biomarkers; Edible Grain; Environmental Monitoring; Ozone; Plant Leaves; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Triticum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059964115

Although stomatal conductance (gs) and assimilation rate (A) are often highly correlated, studies have demonstrated an uncoupling between A and gs that can result in sub-optimal physiological processes in dynamic light environments. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is exposed to changes in irradiance due to leaf self-shading, moving clouds and shifting sun angle to which both A and gs respond. However, stomatal responses are generally an order of magnitude slower than photosynthetic responses, leading to non-synchronized A and gs responses that impact CO2 uptake and water use efficiency (iWUE). Here we phenotyped a panel of eight wheat cultivars (estimated to capture 80% of the single nucleotide polymorphism variation in North–West European bread wheat) for differences in the speed of stomatal responses (to changes in light intensity) and photosynthetic performance at different stages of development. The impact of water stress and elevated [CO2] on stomatal kinetics was also examined in a selected cultivar. Significant genotypic variation was reported for the time constant for stomatal opening (Ki, P = 0.038) and the time to reach 95% steady state A (P = 0.045). Slow gs opening responses limited A by ∼10% and slow closure reduced iWUE, with these impacts found to be greatest in cultivars Soissons, Alchemy and Xi19. A decrease in stomatal rapidity (and thus an increase in the limitation of photosynthesis) (P &lt; 0.001) was found during the post-anthesis stage compared to the early booting stage. Reduced water availability triggered stomatal closure and asymmetric stomatal opening and closing responses, while elevated atmospheric [CO2] conditions reduced the time for stomatal opening during a low to high light transition, thus suggesting a major environmental effect on dynamic stomatal kinetics. We discuss these findings in terms of exploiting various traits to develop ideotypes for specific environments, and suggest that intraspecific variation in the rapidity of stomatal responses could provide a potential unexploited breeding target to optimize the physiological responses of wheat to dynamic field conditions. © 2019 Faralli, Cockram, Ober, Wall, Galle, Van Rie, Raines and Lawson.","Elevated [CO2]; Photosynthesis; Stomatal conductance; Stomatal rapidity; Triticum aestivumL; Water stress; Water-use efficiency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067337318

Tehran, Kish Island, and Binalood are the chosen cities in Iran with distinctive geographic and climatic conditions. In order to determine the optimal design and operational planning of the HPS, the hourly electricity demand data is required to be over 8760 hs during a 1-yr study. The required hourly data was calculated by employing Carrier (HAP4.5) software. The economic analysis is performed based on net present cost (NPC), cost of energy (COE), diesel consumption, and renewable fraction for all cases by applying HOMER software. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are carried out to specify the impact of fuel cost on the system by considering two different diesel fuel systems.

The combination of two fuel injection systems has an impact on the combustion emission composition as well as the consistency of control strategy and emissions. Understanding the impact of these changes is essential for fuel and fuel additive companies, automotive companies, and aftertreatment developers.

The chemical mass closures illustrate that the dominant fraction in coarse (2.5 μm &lt; D p &lt; 10 μm) PM was dust, while organic matter made up a substantial portion of both fine (0.1 &lt; D p &lt; 2.5 μm) and ultra-fine (D p &lt; 0.10 μm) PM fractions. The size distribution of most PM components varied substantially. PM, NO 3 − , K + , Cl − , Na + and most of the transition/redox metals displayed bimodal size distributions with the dominant peak at 0.32–0.56 μm plus a small peak at 1.8–3.2 μm. In contrast, unimodal size distributions were found for the rest of the species, such as water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), NH 4 + , and SO 4 2− and the majority of oxyanion metals with a single peak at 0.32–0.56 μm, and Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , and dust tracer elements which mainly accumulated in coarse particles. Based on the crustal enrichment factor (CEF) analysis, Cd, Zn, Sb, Sn, As, Pb, Mo, Cu, and Cr primarily originated from anthropogenic activities, while Ti in all size fractions and Sr, Mg, Na, and Fe in fine and ultra-fine particles were mainly emitted from natural sources. The potential health risk assessment of trace metals was performed using the hazard quotient (HQ) and excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) indices. Although the adverse health effects of most metals were limited, significant potential carcinogenic risks were found for As and Cr in both fine and coarse particle size fractions, which contributed more than 95% of total ELCR. Therefore, considering that these two elements were mainly emitted from industrial processes, improvements in air quality and health risks in the PRD region can be largely achieved by reducing the emissions of local industrial sources. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Crustal enrichment factors; ELCR; HQ; Mass size distribution; MOUDI","air quality; carcinogen; chemical composition; correlation; dust; hazard assessment; health risk; organic carbon; particulate inorganic matter; particulate matter; public health; size structure; solubility; China; Guangdong; Heshan [Guangdong]; Zhujiang Delta; metal; trace element; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; China; dust; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; industry; particle size; particulate matter; risk assessment; river; statistics and numerical data; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Dust; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Industry; Metals; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Risk Assessment; Rivers; Trace Elements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062766897

Therefore, ultra-lean burn may be one method to deal with increasingly stringent fuel consumption and emission regulations in the approaching future. To achieve high efficiency and clean combustion, innovative combustion modes have been applied on research engines including homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), spark-assisted compression ignition (SACI), and gasoline direct-injection compression ignition (GDCI), etc. Compared to HCCI, SACI can extend the load range and more easily control combustion phase while it is constrained by the limit of flame propagation. For SACI with ultra-lean burn in engines, equivalence ratio (φ), rich-fuel mixture around spark plug, and supercharging are three essentials for combustion stability. In order to investigate the effect of flame propagation and thermodynamic conditions on ultra-lean combustion, SACI experiments using lean iso-octane mixture were carried out in a rapid compression machine (RCM) together with high-speed photography to capture flame propagation and reaction front, which indicate combustion modes under various thermodynamic conditions. Knocking intensity (KI) was used to evaluate heat release degree and distinguish non-knock/conventional knock/super-knock regions. Test results show that flame propagation could enhance knock intensity in intermediate temperatures from 800 K to 1000 K due to flame compression. While volumetric ignition becomes dominant over 1000 K due to short ignition delay. Non-knock region occurs under 30 bar mainly due to influence of negative temperature coefficient (NTC). Detonation and supersonic reaction front occur under ultra-lean conditions at effective temperatures from 850 K to 900 K and effective pressures more than 20 bar, which should be suppressed for lean-burn engine application. © 2019 SAE International.

Many oxidoreductases, including components of membrane-bound electron-transfer chains in living organisms, are extremely active when directly attached to an electrode, at which they display their inherent catalytic activity as electrical current. Electrocatalytic voltammograms, which show the rate of electron flow at steady-state, provide direct information on enzyme efficiency with regard to optimising use of available energy, a factor that would have driven early evolution. Oxidoreductases have evolved to minimise energy wastage ('overpotential requirement') across electron-transport chains where rate and power must be maximised for a given change in Gibbs energy, in order to perform work such as proton pumping. At the elementary level (uncoupled from work output), redox catalysis by many enzymes operates close to the thermodynamically reversible limit. Examples include efficient and selective electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO or formate-reactions that are very challenging at the chemistry level, yet appear almost reversible when catalysed by enzymes. Experiments also reveal the fleeting existence of reversible four-electron O2 reduction and water oxidation by 'blue' Cu oxidases, another reaction of great importance in realising a future based on renewable energy. Being aware that such enzymes have evolved to approach perfection, chemists are interested to know the minimal active site structure they would need to synthesise in order to mimic their performance. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063753523

After an LCA study, it was determined that the construction of the hot mix asphalt (HMA) layer generates a carbon footprint of 65.8 kg of CO2e per km of road. In addition, it was evident that HMA production generates the greatest environmental impact, among all the considered LCA production and construction stages, with a GHG contribution of 38% to 39% from bitumen only. Consequently, special attention to HMA production is required in order to minimize GHG emissions. © 2019 by the authors.","Asphalt mixtures; Carbon footprint; Emissions; GHG; Life cycle analysis; Road","asphalt; carbon footprint; climate change; emission control; environmental impact assessment; estimation method; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; policy implementation; road construction; Costa Rica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066843152

Additionally, forests are important for biodiversity conservation and could be used in climate change mitigation. The opinions of stakeholders towards acceptable forest use deserve consideration. This study examined relations between environmental problem awareness, forest beliefs and environmental management attitudes (biodiversity conservation and carbon substitution) among stakeholders in Sweden, and explored the effect of a local biodiversity versus global climate change frame on attitudes. Stakeholders were recruited from ownership and environmental/recreational interest groups (owner and nature group, respectively) (membership sample) and among students (student sample). Whereas the owner group was more positive towards carbon substitution in forestry, the nature group was more positive towards biodiversity conservation and carbon storage. In the membership sample, awareness of biodiversity loss and eco-social forest beliefs influenced attitudes towards biodiversity conservation. In contrast, positive attitudes towards carbon substitution stemmed from lower awareness of biodiversity loss, less emphasis on openness towards new methods in forestry and greater emphasis on production in forestry. While framing did not influence attitudes, the cognitive hierarchy was useful in providing a nuanced understanding of stakeholders, valuable for policy and practice. © Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2019.

Because of the serious issue of climate change, coupled with a scarcity of conventional energy sources and a high demand for better indoor environments, advancements in the design of buildings so that they are environmentally friendly and occupant-friendly houses are indispensable. The application of new building technologies intended for tropical climates is especially needed. Outdoor environmental considerations of available on-site and off-site renewable energy sources must be taken into account when designing buildings. An evaluation of comfortable and healthy indoor environments is also important factors. The optimized utilization of available energy sources is necessary for hybrid building operation. Increasing the energy efficiency of buildings makes operating the building significantly cheaper by lowering the energy consumption which could be sourced on-site. When a building is designed to take advantage of alternative energy sources, the building is energy independent from grid-connected electricity and, thus, is not prone to power failure. Such a building can rely on different energy sources to make the building work as an energy generator. Having energy-efficient and renewable energy-supported building in hot and humid climates reduces the conventional energy consumption of the area in which these buildings are located. It also lowers the energy required from the grid line, thus minimizing grid line stress. From this, greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute significantly to climate change, can be minimized. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

Each of these resource systems is linked to different Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); we also explore related SDG interactions. A municipality in Sweden with the ambition of phasing out fossil fuels by year 2030 is used as illustrative case example. The local energy system is modelled in detail and indirect water and land requirements are quantified for three stylised decarbonisation scenarios of pathways to meeting climate and energy requirements (related to SDG13 and SDG7, respectively). Total local, national and global implications are addressed for the use of water and land resources, which relate to SDG6 for water, and SDG2 and SDG15 for land use. We find that the magnitude and location of water and land impacts are largely pathway-dependent. Some scenarios of low carbon energy may impede progress on SDG15, while others may compromise SDG6. Data for the studied resource uses are incoherently reported and have important gaps. As a consequence, the study results are indicative and subject to uncertainty. Still, they highlight the need to recognise that resource use changes targeting one SDG in one locality have local and non-local impacts that may compromise progress other SDGs locally and/or elsewhere in the world. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate-land-water-energy nexus; Cross-scale SDG interactions; Decarbonisation pathways; Local climate policy","carbon emission; climate conditions; climate effect; emission control; energy policy; environmental policy; fossil fuel; global perspective; land management; national planning; resource use; sustainable development; uncertainty analysis; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064055285

If carried out without proper planning and reduced-impact logging (RIL) practices, forest disturbances and carbon emissions from these harvests can be substantial. To assess variation in logging-induced emissions and to estimate potential reductions in those emissions, we estimated carbon impacts from damage to trees &gt; 5 cm DBH in the annual cutting areas of ten forest-managing ejidos. Baselines were developed for emissions from felling, skidding and transport of timber and then ejidos were compared with respect to whether they were Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified, size of annual cutting area, logging intensity, and implementation of RIL practices, particularly directional felling, skid trail planning, and the use of small modified agricultural tractors instead of large forestry skidders. The carbon impacts of enrichment planting in multiple-tree felling gaps (400–1800 m 2 ) were also evaluated. Carbon emissions from selective logging averaged 1.52 Mg m −3 but ranged 1.19–2.55 Mg m −3 among the 10 ejidos. Most emissions were from the remnants of trees felled for their timber (73%), followed by skidding (11%), transport infrastructure (i.e. logging roads and landings; 8%), and collateral damage from felling (7%). Our analyses indicate that FSC certification was not associated with any difference in carbon emissions from selective logging but that employment of RIL practices resulted in fewer damaged trees and lower carbon emissions even in ejidos with high logging intensities. Use of modified agricultural tractors for log yarding (i.e., skidding) reduced C emissions by 0.15 Mg m −3 or 5 Mg km −1 of skid trail. Greater collateral damage was found in multiple felling gaps but the increased emissions were offset by reductions in the remnants of harvest trees. Adoption of RIL-C practices by all community forestry ejidos in the region would contribute substantially to the Mexican forest sector's efforts to mitigate climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; Logging damage; Selective logging; Tropical forest","Carbon; Climate change; Deforestation; Directional logging; International trade; Magnesium; Skidding; Timber; Tractors (agricultural); Carbon emissions; Forest stewardship councils; International markets; Logging damage; Reduced-impact logging; Selective logging; Transport infrastructure; Tropical forest; Logging (forestry); carbon emission; climate change; community forestry; deforestation; disturbance; selective logging; timber; tropical forest; Carbon; Deforestation; Foreign Trade; Magnesium; Selective Cutting; Skidding; Mexico [North America]; Yucatan Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061086636

The current schedule calls for a launch from the Kennedy Space Center no earlier than April 2019 via a Space-X Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule. The instrument will be installed as an external payload on the Japanese Experimental Module Exposed Facility (JEM-EF) of the International Space Station (ISS) with a nominal mission lifetime of 3 years. The precessing orbit of the ISS will allow for viewing of the Earth at all latitudes less than approximately 52 with a ground repeat cycle that is much more complicated than the polar-orbiting satellites that so far have carried all of the instruments capable of measuring carbon dioxide from space. The grating spectrometer at the core of OCO-3 is a direct copy of the OCO-2 spectrometer, which was launched into a polar orbit in July 2014. As such, OCO-3 is expected to have similar instrument sensitivity and performance characteristics to OCO-2, which provides measurements of XCO2 with precision better than 1 ppm at 3 Hz, with each viewing frame containing eight footprints approximately 1.6 km by 2.2 km in size. However, the physical configuration of the instrument aboard the ISS, as well as the use of a new pointing mirror assembly (PMA), will alter some of the characteristics of the OCO-3 data compared to OCO-2. Specifically, there will be significant differences from day to day in the sampling locations and time of day. In addition, the flexible PMA system allows for a much more dynamic observation-mode schedule. This paper outlines the science objectives of the OCO-3 mission and, using a simulation of 1 year of global observations, characterizes the spatial sampling, time-of-day coverage, and anticipated data quality of the simulated L1b. After application of cloud and aerosol prescreening, the L1b radiances are run through the operational L2 full physics retrieval algorithm, as well as post-retrieval filtering and bias correction, to examine the expected coverage and quality of the retrieved XCO2 and to show how the measurement objectives are met. In addition, results of the SIF from the IMAP-DOAS algorithm are analyzed. This paper focuses only on the nominal nadir-land and glint-water observation modes, although on-orbit measurements will also be made in transition and target modes, similar to OCO-2, as well as the new snapshot area mapping (SAM) mode. © 2019 Author(s).",,"aerosol; algorithm; carbon dioxide; cloud; data quality; fluorescence; instrumentation; OCO; performance assessment; satellite; simulation; spectrometer; Florida [United States]; Kennedy Space Center; United States; Falconidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064387987

Both plants and substrate are very important components in green roof design, it is essential to determine the proper substrates and plants in green roof systems for domestic green roof design. Two types of growing substrates: a commercial substrate consisting of crushed brick and clay (45%), pumice (45%), and organic matter (10%), and a recycled substrate including 90% coarse pumice (10-20 mm) and municipal compost (10%), were tested in three depths of 4, 7 and 10 cm. Tested plant species included Achillea millefolium, Armeria maritima, Sedum acre and Sedum album. Overall, the commercial substrate performed better than the recycled pumice. In addition, deeper substrates promoted greater survival and growth for nearly all species tested. Either A. maritima or A. millefolium survived in the recycled pumice at any depth, whereas they did survive when grown in the commercial substrate in greater than 7 cm and 10 cm, respectively. They both likely would require supplemental irrigation to be acceptable for green roofs in Istanbul or locations with a similar climate. Both Sedum species survived in all substrate types and depths.

This study uses SOA in a statistical downscaling model of monthly streamflow, with a focus on the influence of dependence in the uncertainty of multiple atmospheric variables. Uncertainty is quantified using the square root error variance concept with a new extension that allows the inter-dependence terms among the atmospheric variable uncertainty to be specified. Applying the model to selected point locations in Australia, it is noted that the downscaling results differ considerably from downscaling that ignores uncertainty.

In most cases, climate model output is used to assess the impact of climate change on soil erosion; however, there is little knowledge of the implications of bias correction methods and climate model ensembles on projected soil erosion rates. Using a soil erosion model, we evaluated the implications of three bias correction methods (delta change, quantile mapping and scaled distribution mapping) and climate model selection on regional soil erosion projections in two contrasting Mediterranean catchments. Depending on the bias correction method, soil erosion is projected to decrease or increase. Scaled distribution mapping best projects the changes in extreme precipitation. While an increase in extreme precipitation does not always result in increased soil loss, it is an important soil erosion indicator. We suggest first establishing the deviation of the bias-corrected climate signal with respect to the raw climate signal, in particular for extreme precipitation. Furthermore, individual climate models may project opposite changes with respect to the ensemble average; hence climate model ensembles are essential in soil erosion impact assessments to account for climate model uncertainty. We conclude that the impact of climate change on soil erosion can only accurately be assessed with a bias correction method that best reproduces the projected climate change signal, in combination with a representative ensemble of climate models. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","bias correction; climate change; extreme precipitation; impact assessment; soil erosion","Catchments; Climate models; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Erosion; Mapping; Precipitation (meteorology); Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Bias correction; Bias-correction methods; Extreme precipitation; Impact assessments; Mediterranean catchment; Model uncertainties; Soil erosion; Soil erosion modeling; Climate change; catchment; climate change; climate modeling; correction; ensemble forecasting; extreme event; precipitation (climatology); soil erosion; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061601156

To answer this question, a spatial approach is suggested, namely an approach that considers geography as a factor in measuring the success of such policy. A geographical approach can be used to pinpoint “hotspots” in order to determine an appropriate distribution of funds. To implement such an approach to the distribution of EU funding, a Spatial Fuzzy Partitioning Around Medoids (SFPAM) analysis is advocated. The contribution of this research is that it combines a temporal dimension within an explicitly spatial approach. It achieves this by using a dataset that includes both geographical and economic factors such as farm sizes, their management, the number of organic farms involved, the agriculture area invested by the AEM and the size of the workforce involved. Its strategy is the identification of medoids which are represented by a specific municipality.

Supercapacitor exhibiting high power density has emerged out as the most promising potential for facilitating the major developments in energy storage. In recent years, the advent of different organic and inorganic nanostructured materials like nano carbons, metal oxides, nanosheets of graphene, and conducting polymers has enabled high-performance-fabricated devices. A review of different carbon-based materials used in the fabrication of electrodes for electrochemical capacitors is presented in this paper. Along with materials used, a brief overview of different types of supercapacitors depending on charge storage mechanism is also been discussed. Materials summary including applications have been provided through the exhaustive analysis of the literature. Keeping nano-architecture electrodes in view, a summary of different technologies considering the integration of metal oxide into carbon nanofibers, carbon fiber papers, graphene/reduced graphene oxide, and SWCNTs/MWCNTS has been presented in this work. The specific capacitance in the range of 40–300 F/g had been reported in the literature for the EDLC (electric double-layer capacitors) supercapacitors. In contrast to this, carbon nanomaterials-based metal-oxides supercapacitors (CNMO-SC) have emerged as the new promising candidate which possess large specific capacitance (> 100 F/g), high energy density, and cost effectiveness.

Dental-associated travel affects air quality, releasing over 443 tonnes of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 22 tonnes of particulate matter (PM2.5) annually. This reduction in air quality reduces over 325 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) per year. Wider health impacts associated with noise and traffic incidents doubles the impact on health in QALYs. Dental procedures that require shorter appointment times have disproportionately higher emissions due to patient travel. The dental team can reduce appointment times by combining visits for family members or combining operative procedures, or reducing appointment frequency based on patient risk. Community oral health programmes and preventive programmes reduce travel emissions. The number of physical dental appointments can be reduced using information technology such as global positioning systems (GPS), telemedicine and teleconferencing. The mode of travel is important, with the air and carbon emissions generated by active travel negligent compared to a private car. Travel plans can help encourage active travel, as can flexible working hours, cycle to work schemes, cycle racks and shower facilities. Practices should consider purchasing locally sourced or sustainably transported goods and, ideally, use local dental laboratories. © 2019, British Dental Association.",,"air pollution; exhaust gas; human; particulate matter; telemedicine; travel; Air Pollution; Humans; Particulate Matter; Telemedicine; Travel; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064338441

To quantify the synergetic influence of sailing speed, displacement, trim, and weather and sea conditions on ship fuel efficiency, we first develop a tailored method to build two artificial neural network models using ship voyage report data. We proceed to address the ship sailing speed and trim optimization problem by putting forward three viable countermeasures within an effective two-phase optimal solution framework: sailing speeds of the ship are optimized in an on-shore planning phase, whereas trim optimization is conducted dynamically by the captain in real time when she/he observes the actual weather and sea conditions at sea. In the on-shore speed optimization problem, simultaneous optimization of sailing speeds and trim settings is beneficial in suggesting more informed sailing speeds because both factors influence a ship's fuel efficiency. In the countermeasure 3 proposed by this study, we address speed and trim optimization simultaneously by proposing a two-step global optimization algorithm that combines dynamic programming and a state-of-the-art simulation-based optimization technique. Numerical experiments with two 9000-TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) containerships show that (a) the proposed countermeasure 1 saves 4.96% and 5.83% of bunker fuel for the two ships, respectively, compared to the real situation; (b) the proposed countermeasure 2 increases the bunker fuel savings to 7.63% and 7.57%, respectively; and (c) the bunker fuel savings with Countermeasure 3 attain 8.25% on average.

The tunnel ventilation system is widely applied for large-scale poultry buildings in China but only limited scientific researches regarding the flow pattern, temperature distribution and design criteria are available in the literature. Thanks to the fast development of computer technology, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques were used in present study to investigate the indoor air movement, air temperature and relatively humidity. A three-dimensional CFD model was built according to the real dimensions of a laying hen house and the model was validated by comparing the simulation results with the field measurements at 30 positions. Meanwhile, statistical analysis was performed to determine the differences between different boundary conditions regarding the agreement between measured and CFD simulated results. Optimization of air inlet configurations was performed by using the validated CFD model and it was found that the uniformity of indoor air movement could prevent excessive local convective heat losses and reduce the temperature at the end of the house. Furthermore, the air inlets placed at the middle of the side wall could significantly reduce the high temperature expected at the end of the building without using extra energy, which is especially important for large-scale poultry farms with long buildings. The performance of side-wall windows was also examined and preliminary guidance was provided to effectively regulate the indoor climate by using these windows with the help of environmental monitoring systems.

One of the systems proposed to mitigate urban air pollution is urban forestry. This study quantified the spatial associations between concentrations of CO, NO₂ SO₂ and PM₁₀ and urban forestry, whilst correcting for anthropogenic sources and sinks, thus explicitly testing the hypothesis that urban forestry is spatially associated with reduced air pollution on a city scale. A Land Use Regression (LUR) model was constructed by combining air pollutant concentrations with environmental variables, such as land cover type and use, to develop predictive models for air pollutant concentrations. Traffic density and industrial air pollutant emissions were added to the model as covariables to permit testing of the main effects after correcting for these air pollutant sources. It was found that the concentrations of all air pollutants were negatively correlated with tree canopy cover and positively correlated with dwelling density, population density and traffic count. The LUR models enabled the establishment of a statistically significant spatial relationship between urban forestry and air pollution mitigation. These findings further demonstrate the spatial relationships between urban forestry and reduced air pollution on a city-wide scale, and could be of value in developing planning policies focused on urban greening. © 2019 Elsevier LtdThe results obtained from this multi-faceted approach to understanding the association between land use and air pollutants provides evidence that urban forestry may have a positive effect on mitigating city air pollution. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Green space; Land use regression; Particulate matter; Urban vegetation; Vehicular traffic","Airport vehicular traffic; Forestry; Industrial emissions; Land use; Motor transportation; Pollution control; Population statistics; Timber; Urban planning; Air pollutant concentrations; Air pollutant emission; Environmental variables; Green spaces; Land use regression; Methodological approach; Particulate Matter; Urban vegetation; Air pollution; algorithm; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; greenspace; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; sulfur compound; traffic emission; urban forestry; urban pollution; vegetation; air pollutant; article; canopy; forestry; human; land use; particulate matter; population density; quantitative analysis; traffic; vegetation; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; city; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; statistics and numerical data; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Forestry; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060945189

Anthropogenic stressors including elevated nutrients and contaminants from urban pollution and elevated salinity from saltwater intrusion have the potential to alter greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in tidal wetlands that experience these stressors simultaneously. We designed a laboratory soil core experiment to disentangle the separate and combined effects of saltwater intrusion (elevated salinity versus elevated sulfate) and urban pollution (elevated nitrogen versus elevated copper) on carbon and nitrogen cycling in wetland soils. We collected 45 intact soil cores from a brackish tidal wetland and applied chemical treatments for seven weeks in the laboratory. We measured greenhouse gas soil-to-atmosphere fluxes (CO 2 , CH 4 , N 2 O) and porewater chemistry weekly. Soils were harvested at the end of the experiment to analyze soil chemistry and microbial carbon and nitrogen processing rates. Compared to the freshwater control, we found that elevated copper and sulfate (without elevated salinity) decreased CH 4 fluxes. Treatments with elevated salinity, sulfate, or both also reduced CO 2 fluxes. Likewise, carbon mineralization at the end of the experiment was lower for all treatments with elevated copper, sulfate, or salinity. In contrast, elevated salinity enhanced N 2 O fluxes but did not affect potential denitrification rates at the end of the experiment. Combined urban pollution and sea salt enrichment suppressed carbon gas fluxes but enhanced N 2 O emissions. Decreased carbon gas fluxes offset increased N 2 O fluxes such that the saltwater, urban, and combined treatments reduced the total global warming potential by 6.9×, 2.6×, and 3.6×, respectively, relative to the freshwater control. Thus our laboratory experiment suggests in the short-term, saltwater intrusion could reduce global warming potential of coastal wetland soils in Southern New England with typical levels of urban pollution. Future research that addresses the response of coastal wetland ecosystems to combined effects of urban pollution and saltwater intrusion will be critical for predicting long-term coastal wetland function under future land use and climatic conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gas emissions; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Saltwater intrusion; Tidal wetlands","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Chemical analysis; Copper compounds; Denitrification; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Methane; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution control; Salt water intrusion; Soils; Sulfur compounds; Water; Anthropogenic stressors; Carbon mineralization; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas fluxes; Laboratory experiments; Nitrous oxide; Potential denitrification; Tidal wetlands; Wetlands; carbon dioxide; coastal wetland; experiment; flux measurement; global warming; greenhouse gas; intertidal environment; methane; nitrous oxide; porewater; saline intrusion; urban pollution; water chemistry; New England; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059557885

Key information necessary is how different forest user groups perceive and prioritize different ecosystem services based on their local setting. We assessed the socio-cultural values of ecosystem services of high-altitude oak forests in Western Bhutan using participatory approaches with two important forest users: local communities and forest experts. We found that these forests serve as a pool of 22 ecosystem services under four MEA categories of provisioning (9), regulating (8), supporting (2), and cultural (3) services. Fresh water was unanimously identified as the most valuable service, as well as the most vulnerable, by both the groups. The priorities of local communities inclined towards provisioning and cultural services due to their dependence on these services for their livelihood and wellbeing. Forest experts' priorities were more evenly spread over three categories of services: provisioning, regulating, and supporting services, reflecting their broader interest in resource management, biodiversity conservation, and climate change mitigation. Several regulating and supporting services were not easily identified by many villagers, suggesting that bridging the priorities of local interests with broader national forestry goals may require public partnerships and integrated decision-making about the entire suite of ecosystem services.

Yet, the spatiotemporal patterns of vulnerability to both short-term extreme events and gradual environmental changes are quite uncertain across the species’ limits of tolerance to dryness. Such information is fundamental for defining ecologically relevant upper limits of species tolerance to drought and, hence, to predict the risk of increased forest mortality and shifts in species composition. We investigate here to what extent the impact of short- and long-term environmental changes determines vulnerability to climate change of three evergreen conifers (Scots pine, silver fir, Norway spruce) and two deciduous hardwoods (European beech, sessile oak) tree species at their southernmost limits of distribution in the Mediterranean Basin. Finally, we simulated future forest growth under RCP 2.6 and 8.5 emission scenarios using a multispecies generalized linear mixed model. Our analysis provides four key insights into the patterns of species’ vulnerability to climate change. First, site climatic marginality was significantly linked to the growth trends: increasing growth was related to less climatically limited sites. Second, estimated species-specific vulnerability did not match their a priori rank in drought tolerance: Scots pine and beech seem to be the most vulnerable species among those studied despite their contrasting physiologies. Third, adaptation to site conditions prevails over species-specific determinism in forest response to climate change. And fourth, regional differences in forests vulnerability to climate change across the Mediterranean Basin are linked to the influence of summer atmospheric circulation patterns, which are not correctly represented in global climate models. Thus, projections of forest performance should reconsider the traditional classification of tree species in functional types and critically evaluate the fine-scale limitations of the climate data generated by global climate models. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; drought; Mediterranean Basin; rear-edge forests; tolerance indices; tree growth","acclimation; adaptation; climate change; drought; environmental change; global climate; growth rate; tolerance; tree; vulnerability; Mediterranean Sea; Abies; Coniferophyta; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica; Picea abies; Pinus sylvestris; Quercus petraea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060857147

In this review, we discuss how changes in starch metabolism can facilitate adaptive changes in source-sink carbon allocation for protection against environmental stresses. The stress-related roles of starch are described, and published mechanisms by which starch metabolism responds to short- or long-term water deficit, salinity, or extreme temperatures are discussed. Numerous examples of starch metabolism as a stress response are also provided, focusing on studies where carbohydrates and cognate enzymes were assayed in source, sink, or both. We develop a model that integrates these findings with the theoretical and known roles of sugars and starch in various species, tissues, and developmental stages. In this model, localized starch degradation into sugars is vital to the plant cold stress response, with the sugars produced providing osmoprotection. In contrast, high starch accumulation is prominent under salinity stress, and is associated with higher assimilate allocation from source to sink. Our model explains how starch-sugar interconversion can be a convergent point for regulating carbon use in stress tolerance at the whole-plant level. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Drought; Extreme temperatures; Salinity; Source-sink relations; Starch metabolism; T6P/SnRK","carbon; starch; adaptation; carbohydrate metabolism; metabolism; physiological stress; plant; signal transduction; Adaptation, Physiological; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carbon; Plants; Signal Transduction; Starch; Stress, Physiological",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060335449

Long-term fertilization and tilling permanently alter soil bacterial and fungal communities, requiring microbe-targeted restoration methods to improve belowground ecosystem services and carbon storage in newly restored prairies. These techniques are particularly important when restoring for climate-ready ecosystems, adapted to altered temperature regimes. To approach these issues, we conducted a multi-factorial greenhouse experiment to test the effects of plant species richness, soil amendment and elevated temperature on soil microbial diversity, growth, and function. Treatments consisted of three seedlings of one plant species (Andropogon gerardii) or one seedling each of three plant species (A. gerardii, Echinacea pallida, Coreopsis lanceolata). Soil amendments included cellulose addition, inoculation with a microbial community collected from an undisturbed remnant prairie, and a control. We assessed microbial communities using extracellular enzyme assays, Illumina sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, predicted bacterial metabolic pathways from sequence data and phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), which includes both bacterial and fungal lipid abundances. Our results indicate that addition of cellulose selects for slow-growing bacterial taxa (Verrucomicrobia) and fungi at ambient temperature. However, at elevated temperature, selection for slow-growing bacterial taxa is enhanced, while selection for fungi is lost, indicating temperature sensitivity among fungi. Cellulose addition was a more effective means of altering soil community composition than addition of microbial communities harvested from a remnant prairie. Soil water content was typically higher in the A. gerardii treatment alone, regardless of temperature, but at ambient temperature only, predicted metagenomics pathways for bacterial carbon metabolism were more abundant with A. gerardii. In summary, these results from a mesocosm test case indicate that adding cellulose to newly restored soil and increasing the abundance of C4 grasses, such as A. gerardii, can select for microbial communities adapted for slow growth and carbon storage. Further testing is required to determine if these approaches yield the same results in a field-level experiment. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","bacteria; climate; fungi; microbe; prairie; restoration; soil; temperature","abundance; bacterium; carbon sequestration; climate change; community composition; fungus; grass; growth; microbial activity; microbial community; prairie; restoration ecology; soil microorganism; soil temperature; soil water; species diversity; terrestrial ecosystem; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Lanceolata; Poaceae; Verrucomicrobia; RNA 16S; climate; ecosystem; grassland; microbiology; soil; Climate; Ecosystem; Grassland; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063687655

Lane-change maneuver is one of the most important conventional parts of automated driving. We address the problem of optimally CAVs to accomplish an automated lane-change and eliminate potential collision during the lane-change process on a curved road. Drivers' safety, comfort, convenience, and fuel economy are also engaged in trajectory planning. We assume that the centripetal motion displacement and the rotational angular displacement meet the requirement of odd-order polynomial constrains. Then, the polynomial coefficient of the trajectory can be reduced and the mathematical model of virtual trajectory for lane-change can be designed based on the models of centripetal displacement and angular displacement by applying the above constrains and boundary conditions. The planning problem are converted into a constrained optimization problem using the lane-change time, distance and desired state of vehicle at the start and end of the lane-change maneuver. Moreover, we update the optimization trajectory to avoid the collision until the lane-change is completed. The simulations results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the designed method for automated lane-change. © 2019 SAE International.

However, changes in the structure and composition of vegetation due to disturbance can modify their capacity to regulate climate through carbon sequestration. We estimated aboveground carbon stocks in W National Park, and related carbon density to structure, species diversity and specific functional traits. We measured 3193 stems belonging to 89 woody species that included 63 genera and 32 families. Aboveground biomass was estimated from diameter at breast height in combination with total height and wood density, and converted to carbon. We detected structural differences among four vegetation types (gallery forest, savanna woodland, shrub savanna and tree savanna) in W National park. Carbon density varied between the different vegetation types, ranging from an average of 2.9 ± 0.4 Mg ha −1 in shrub savanna to 57.7 ± 3.9 Mg ha −1 in gallery forest. Much of the carbon (∼70%) is held in few large-diameter trees that make up 8% of the population. Species richness (β = 1.28; p &lt; 0.001) and average tree size (β = 1.139; p = 0.012) were the main factors influencing plot level carbon density. The relative contribution of woody species to carbon storage in tree savanna and woodland was not proportional to their relative abundance. Shannon diversity index ranged from H’ = 1.31 in gallery forest to H’ = 1.76 in tree savanna. Functional richness explained 31% of the variance in carbon density. Community weighted mean of maximum plant height and wood density had a significant effect on carbon density, explaining 27% of the variation in functional dominance.

Household air pollution is one of the leading causes of premature death and disease in these settlements. Regulatory frameworks and government budgets for household air pollution do not exist and humanitarian organisations remain largely inattentive and inactive on this issue. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of potential indoor-air related policies, as identified together with various stakeholders, in lowering household air pollution in Nairobi's slums. Applying a novel approach in this context, we used participatory system dynamics within a series of stakeholder workshops in Nairobi, to map and model the complex dynamics surrounding household air pollution and draw up possible policy options. Workshop participants included community members, local and national policy-makers, representatives from parastatals, NGOs and academics. Simulation modelling demonstrates that under business-as-usual, the current trend of slowly improving indoor air quality will soon come to a halt. If we aim to continue to substantially reduce household PM 2.5 levels, a drastic acceleration in the uptake of clean stoves is needed. We identified the potentially high impact of redirecting investment towards household air quality monitoring and health impact assessment studies, therefore raising the public's and the government's awareness and concern about this issue and its health consequences. Such investments, due to their self-reinforcing nature, can entail high returns on investment, but are likely to give ‘worse-before-better’ results due to the time lags involved. We also discuss the usefulness of the participatory process within similar multi-stakeholder contexts.

Estimates of C-emissions from groundwater pumping for irrigation in central Punjab indicated that during the last 15 years (1998–2013), the groundwater levels had fallen by 8.89 m; pump set density (per 1000 ha) increased by 45%; groundwater use increased by 140 Mm3; energy requirements increased by 4845.1 MkWh (90%), all this resulted into an increase in C-emissions by 984.1 kiloton (30%). The relationship between carbon emissions and groundwater depth showed that for each meter fall of groundwater level in central Punjab, C emissions will increase by 2.67 g/m³. The present level of groundwater exploitation in Bhawanigarh, Dharmkot, Dhuri, Malerkotla I, Malerkotla II, Nabha, Nakodar, Sangrur, Samana, Sherpur and Sunam is considered as threat to the environment and should be targeted to reduce C-emissions. © 2018","C emissions; Energy requirement; Groundwater levels; Groundwater pumping; Groundwater use; Pumpset density","Carbon; Groundwater; Pumps; C emissions; Carbon emissions; Energy requirements; Ground water depths; Ground water table; Groundwater exploitation; Groundwater pumping; Groundwater use; Groundwater resources; carbon emission; emission control; exploitation; groundwater abstraction; irrigation; pollution monitoring; targeting; water depth; water table; India; Punjab [India]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057608731

Carbonation leads to uniform reduction in the cross sectional area of steel reinforcement. In general, Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs) can increase durability of concrete. The current study evaluates the influence of three SCMs such as Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (Slag), Class F fly ash and Class C fly ash on the carbonation of concrete, assessed by both macroscopic and micro-analytica investigations. The macroscopic behaviour of concrete was assessed using accelerated carbonation and natura carbonation tests. The micro-analytical studies were conducted to understand the alteration in the micro structure of concrete with SCMs under carbonation exposure. These tests include Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X - Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Thermo Gravimetric / Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TG/ DSC). The results showed that depth of carbonation is more for concretes with SCMs. However, at lower replacement levels, the difference as compared to OPC is not much significant in the case of Slag and Class C fly ash. A relationship between natural carbonation and accelerated carbonation depth was proposed based on CO2 concentration and climatic influence (tropical regions). The microstructural modifications of the paste matrix due to carbonation are explained in terms of calcite formation, decalcification of CSH and change in porosity level. © 2019 Associated Cement Companies Ltd..

These 40-minute observations represent one of the most comprehensive records of this trace gas carried out anywhere in the world. Hydrogen mixing ratios in northern hemisphere baseline air masses had a mean value of 508.81 ppb and exhibited a highly statistically significant upwards trend of +0.44 +0.16 -0.28 ppb year-1. Trends were strongest during the months of January, February and November and weakest during the months of May - July, inclusive. Monthly mean baseline mixing ratios exhibited a seasonal cycle with a spring maximum and an autumn minimum, the latter being relatively unusual at this baseline station. The transport of European regionally-polluted air masses to Mace Head historically brought elevated levels of hydrogen above baseline. Over the years of this study, these elevated levels have declined to the extent that the hydrogen levels in European regional pollution events are now almost indistinguishable from baseline levels. Photochemical Trajectory Model studies have confirmed that the decline in European excess hydrogen levels accurately reflects the widespread fitting of three-way catalysts and evaporative cannisters to petrol-engined motor vehicles across Europe and the reductions in emissions of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds that they have brought about. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Baseline levels; European pollution events; Hydrogen; Long-term trends; Seasonal cycles","Carbon monoxide; Climatology; Mixing; Pollution; Volatile organic compounds; Atmospheric research; Baseline levels; European pollution events; Hydrogen mixing ratio; In-situ observations; Long-term trend; Northern Hemispheres; Seasonal cycle; Hydrogen; carbon monoxide; hydrogen; nitrogen oxide; volatile organic compound; air mass; carbon monoxide; emission control; hydrogen; in situ measurement; long-term change; nitrogen oxides; Northern Hemisphere; observational method; seasonal variation; trace gas; volatile organic compound; air pollution; Article; autumn; catalyst; exhaust gas; Ireland; motor vehicle; Northern Hemisphere; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); seasonal variation; spring; Atlantic Ocean; Connacht; Connacht; Europe; Galway [(CNT) Connacht]; Ireland; Mace Head",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061085341

To meet the future emission standards, application of advanced diesel exhaust aftertreatment systems (EATS), such as Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC), Lean NOX Trap (LNT), Selective Catalytic Reduction coatings on Soot Filters (SCRF) and underfloor SCR, is required. Effective customized thermal management strategies are essential to ensure fast light-off of the EATS after engine cold start, and to avoid significant cooldown during part load operation. The authors describes the investigation of different exhaust gas heating measures, such as intake throttling, late fuel injection, exhaust throttling, advanced exhaust cam phasing, retarded intake cam phasing, cylinder deactivation, full turbine bypass, electric catalyst heating and electrically heated intake manifold strategies. For those investigations, a steady-state GT-Power simulation model of a state-of-the-art EU6c 2.0 L diesel engine, equipped with high and low pressure exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and 2-stage boosting, was used. The results were then transferred to FEV's complete powertrain simulation platform. As representative vehicles, a C segment car, a compact SUV and a light duty van have been selected, and have been investigated using the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) and extended Real Driving Emissions (RDE) cycles.

Although density may influence movement patterns, the occurrence and nature of density-dependence in animal movements are still unclear, particularly whether it may vary among populations of a species, or across time within a population. Here, we evaluate the occurrence and nature of density-dependence in the movements of a Neotropical marsupial, the Grey four-eyed opossum Philander frenatus (Didelphidae, Didelphimorphia). We quantified fine-scale path tortuosity of individuals inhabiting continuous forest areas and forest fragments, in different climatic seasons (humid vs. super-humid). We also determined the relative importance of population size compared to sex and body mass on movements, using a model-selection approach. In forest fragments, path tortuosity increased with population size in the super-humid season, but decreased in the humid season. In the continuous forest, path tortuosity was affected only by sex and body mass, being slightly higher in males and negatively related to body mass. The occurrence of density-dependence on movements only in forest fragments is likely to reflect the higher overall density of P. frenatus in small forest fragments. The variation in the nature of density-dependence between climatic seasons is likely to reflect a trade off between foraging over large areas (humid season, low resource availability) versus avoiding agonistic encounters (super-humid season, high resource availability). Our results show that (i) density-dependence in movements may be context-dependent occurring only in areas of relatively high overall population density; and (ii) density may affect movements in different ways at different climatic seasons. © 2018 Ecological Society of Australia","abundance; Atlantic forest; fractals; locomotion; small mammals","abundance; body mass; climate change; density dependence; locomotion; marsupial; movement; Neotropical Region; population density; population size; small mammal; trade-off; Atlantic Forest; Animalia; Didelphidae; Didelphimorphia; Mammalia; Metatheria; Philander",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053672644

We used soils from a tropical dry forest (FOR) and two intercropping and two monoculture systems. The first intercrop was maize and beans (CORNCOWP), and the second intercrop was cassava, pigeon peas and beans (CASPIGPCOWP). The first monoculture was beans, and the second was passion fruit. The intercropping soils showed a higher capacity to suppress black root rot in cassava than the monoculture because such soils were able to reduce disease severity by about 50%. Bean soil in the monoculture showed less microbial biomass carbon than in the intercrop, with means of 10.05 and 38.2 mg/kg, respectively. The higher density of bacteria and fungal populations, microbial biomass, urease and arylsulphatase activities correlated with a decrease in disease severity. Soils from the intercrops produced changes in soil quality, primarily in the population and density of microorganisms, enzymatic activities, total organic carbon and nutrients, reducing disease severity in cassava plants. These effects were validated by multivariate principal component analysis and showed three distinct groups: one FOR, one intercropping and one monocropping.

To set the target for air quality levels and avoid negative impacts for human and ecosystems health, the National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD, 2016/2284/EU) sets objectives for emission reduction for SO2, NOx, NMVOCs, NH3 and PM2.5 for each Member State as percentages of reduction to be reached in 2020 and 2030 compared to the emission levels into 2005. One of the innovations of NECD is Article 9, that mentions the issue of “monitoring air pollution impacts” on ecosystems. We provide a clear picture of what is available in term of monitoring network for air pollution impacts on Italian ecosystems, summarizing what has been done to control air pollution and its effects on different ecosystems in Italy. We provide an overview of the impacts of air pollution on health of the Italian population and evaluate opportunities and implementation of Article 9 in the Italian context, as a case study beneficial for all Member States. The results showed that SO42− deposition strongly decreased in all monitoring sites in Italy over the period 1999–2017, while NO3− and NH4+ decreased more slightly. As a consequence, most of the acid-sensitive sites which underwent acidification in the 1980s partially recovered. The O3 concentration at forest sites showed a decreasing trend. Consequently, AOT40 (the metric identified to protect vegetation from ozone pollution) showed a decrease, even if values were still above the limit for forest protection (5000 ppb h−1), while PODy (flux-based metric under discussion as new European legislative standard for forest protection) showed an increase. National scale studies pointed out that PM10 and NO2 induced about 58,000 premature deaths (year 2005), due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The network identified for Italy contains a good number of monitoring sites (6 for terrestrial ecosystem monitoring, 4 for water bodies monitoring and 11 for ozone impact monitoring) distributed over the territory and will produce a high number of monitored parameters for the implementation of the NECD. © 2019","Air pollution impacts; Climate change; Freshwater ecosystem; Human health; National Emission Ceilings Directive; Terrestrial ecosystem","Air quality; Ammonia; Ceilings; Climate change; Dysprosium compounds; Emission control; Forestry; Health; Monitoring; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Pollution detection; Air pollution impact; Freshwater ecosystem; Human health; National Emission Ceilings Directive; Terrestrial ecosystems; Ecosystems; ammonia; nitrogen oxide; non methane volatile organic compound; ozone; sulfur dioxide; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); ecosystem health; European Union; freshwater ecosystem; health impact; particulate matter; pollution effect; pollution monitoring; terrestrial ecosystem; acidification; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; atmospheric deposition; cardiovascular disease; controlled study; environmental health; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; environmental protection; forest protection; health care planning; human; international law; Italy; National Emission Ceilings Directive; national health organization; organization; ozone impact monitoring; ozone pollution; particulate matter; pollution; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; terrestrial surface waters; vegetation; water body monitoring; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; ecosystem; procedures; Italy; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061087388

In the European Union (EU), cities are expanding their urban green infrastructure (UGI)to reduce the effects of climate change and enhance resilience and sustainability. However, there exist few articles showing local case studies in intermediate cities of Europe. The aim of this study is to analyse the climate change mitigation potential of a set of urban forests and agriculture actions implemented within the EU LIFE Program, in the northern Spain city of Lugo. First, the amount of CO2 reduced by the UGI was calculated, also considering the emissions released from their implementation and management (I&amp;M). In addition, the ecological balance was estimated, as an indicator to determine the sustainability of the UGI actions. Both biocapacity and quantity of emissions during I&amp;M were found to be significantly different between the urban agriculture and urban forestry actions, showing that the type of UGI selected and its management has a great influence on the final carbon uptake. The global ecological balance was equal to 1.85 Global hectares, indicating that the evaluated UGI actions are effective at contributing to the climate change mitigation, in addition to other great co-benefits. Nonetheless, carbon uptake was 0.26 t C ha-1 per year, which is in the lower range compared to other cities in Europe. The quantification of benefits of this individual city experience is important to increase the attention of policies and management plans on UGI. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Biocapacity; Carbon dioxide reduction; Ecological footprint; Sustainable urban development","carbon dioxide; climate change; ecological footprint; ecosystem resilience; emission control; European Union; greenspace; infrastructure; sustainable development; urban agriculture; urban development; urban forestry; Galicia [Spain]; Lugo [Galicia]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053853630

However, most efforts focus on abiotic drivers of plant biomass change, with little consideration for functional roles performed by animals, particularly at landscape scales. We combined repeat airborne Light Detection and Ranging with measurements of elephant densities, abiotic factors, and exclusion experiments to determine the relative importance of drivers of change in aboveground woody vegetation carbon stocks in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Despite a growing elephant population, aboveground carbon density (ACD) increased across most of the landscape over the 6-year study period, but at fine scales, bull elephant density was the most important factor determining carbon stock change, with ACD losses recorded only where bull densities exceeded 0.5 bulls/km 2 . Effects of bull elephants were, however, spatially restricted and landscape dependent, being especially pronounced along rivers, at mid-elevations, and on steeper slopes. In contrast, elephant herds and abiotic drivers had a comparatively small influence on the direction or magnitude of carbon stock change. Our findings demonstrate that animals can have a substantive influence on regional-scale carbon dynamics and warrant consideration in carbon cycling models and policy formulation aimed at carbon management and climate change mitigation. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aboveground carbon density; carbon cycling; Carnegie Airborne Observatory; herbivory; Kruger National Park; LiDAR; megaherbivore; South Africa; woody encroachment","abiotic factor; aboveground biomass; aboveground production; airborne survey; carbon cycle; climate change; elephant; herbivory; lidar; mitigation; savanna; Kruger National Park; South Africa; Animalia; Elephantidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061978075

They play a vital role in the global carbon cycle by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, there has been a large reduction in the global BC ecosystems due to their conversion to agriculture and aquaculture, overexploitation, and removal for human settlements. Effectively monitoring BC ecosystems at large scales remains a challenge owing to practical difficulties in monitoring and the time-consuming field measurement approaches used. As a result, sensible policies and actions for the sustainability and conservation of BC ecosystems can be hard to implement. In this context, remote sensing provides a useful tool for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems faster and at larger scales. Numerous studies have been carried out on various sensors based on optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), aerial photographs (APs), and multispectral data. Remote sensing-based approaches have been proven effective for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems by a large number of studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on the applications of remote sensing techniques for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. The main goal of this review is to provide an overview and summary of the key studies undertaken from 2010 onwards on remote sensing applications for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. Our review showed that optical imagery, such as multispectral and hyper-spectral data, is the most common for mapping BC ecosystems, while the Landsat time-series are the most widely-used data for monitoring their changes on larger scales. We investigate the limitations of current studies and suggest several key aspects for future applications of remote sensing combined with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for mapping coastal vegetation and monitoring their extents and changes. © 2019 by the authors.

Thus, reduction of CO2 emissions/concentration in the atmosphere is an important goal for various industrial and environmental sectors. In this research work, we study CO2 capture by its absorption in mixtures of water and piperazine (PZ). Experimental techniques to obtain the equilibrium data are usually costly and time consuming. Thermodynamic modeling by Equations of State (EOSs) and connectionist tools leads to more reliable and accurate results, compared to the empirical models and analytical modeling strategies. This research work utilizes Genetic Programming (GP) and Genetic Algorithm-Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (GA-ANFIS) to estimate the solubility of CO2 in mixtures of water and piperazine (PZ). In both methods, the input parameters are temperature, partial pressure of CO2, and concentration of PZ in the solution. A total number of 390 data points is collected from the literature and used to develop GP and GA-ANFIS models. Assessing the models by the statistical methods, both models are found to acceptably predict the CO2 solubility in water/PZ mixtures. However, the GP exhibits a superior performance, compared to GA-ANFIS; the values of Average Absolute Relative Error (AARD) are 5.3213% and 9.7143% for the GP and GA-ANFIS models, respectively. Such reliable predictive tools can assist engineers and researchers to effectively determine the key thermodynamic properties (e.g., solubility, vapor pressure, and compressibility factor) which are central to design and operation of the carbon capture processes in a variety of chemical plants such as power plants and refineries. © 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Accuracy; CO2 absorption; Deterministic tools; Environmental implication; Piperazine; Solubility","Carbon dioxide; Chemical plants; Equations of state; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Inference engines; Mixtures; Solubility; Water absorption; Accuracy; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; CO2 absorption; Compressibility factor; Energy and environment; Environmental implications; Experimental techniques; Piperazine; Fuzzy inference",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063257362

With an estimated 30.6 Pg of carbon stored in these peatlands, there are now questions about whether these carbon stocks are under threat and, if so, what can be done to protect them. Here, we analyse the potential threats to Congo Basin peat carbon stocks and identify knowledge gaps in relation to these threats, and to how the peatland systems might respond. Climate change emerges as a particularly pressing concern, given its potential to destabilise carbon stocks across the whole area. Socio-economic developments are increasing across central Africa and, whilst much of the peatland area is protected on paper by some form of conservation designation, the potential exists for hydrocarbon exploration, logging, plantations and other forms of disturbance to significantly damage the peatland ecosystems. The low level of human intervention at present suggests that the opportunity still exists to protect the peatlands in a largely intact state, possibly drawing on climate change mitigation funding, which can be used not only to protect the peat carbon pool but also to improve the livelihoods of people living in and around these peatlands. © 2018, The Author(s).","Carbon; Congo; Conservation; Peat; Threats","carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation; disturbance; peat; peatland; terrestrial ecosystem; Central Africa; Congo Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041829215

Today's technology shows the best balance between filtration efficiency and back-pressure in the engine exhaust pipe. During the accumulation phase the pressure drop across the filter increases, thus requiring periodic regeneration of the DPF through after and post fuel injection strategies. This paper deals with the development of a control oriented model of a catalytic silicon carbide (SiC) wall flow DPFs with CuFe2O4 loading for automotive Diesel engines. The model is intended to be used for the real-time management of the regeneration process, depending on back-pressure and thermal state. In order to ensure suitable computational demand and to realize emissions control and fuel economy objectives, the 0-D model has been developed with the aim of investigating the essential behavior of the system, such as the chemical kinetic of filtered soot oxidation, the thermal and backpressure dynamics along accumulation and regeneration processes. Parameters identification and model validation have been performed vs. experimental data measured on the engine test bench at the exhaust of a EURO 5 light-duty Diesel engine, in different operating conditions. During the accumulation process, engine speed, load and rail pressure are controlled to ensure several levels of trapped soot; on the other hand, the injections pattern, which directly affects the DPF inlet temperature, is handled during regeneration tests. The results show that the model simulates the thermal dynamics and the pressure drop across the filter with good accuracy. © 2019 SAE International.

With the end of oil availability perspectives and the world energy crisis, technological solutions are needed from the scientific community to promote the reduction of fossil fuel consumption, the maximization of fuel conversion efficiency and the reduction of emission levels in internal combustion engines. Aiming at reaching these needs, the use of a pre-chamber ignition system in spark-ignition (SI) engines is a potential alternative enabling such engines to operate with lean mixtures and with a wide variety of fuels. In this study, a methodology was developed to design and characterize experimentally a homogeneous charge pre-chamber torch ignition system fuelled with hydrous ethanol (with 6–7% in mass of water content) and using lean burn mixtures (excess air ratio (λ) > 1.0). The methodology, which has not been reported previously in other works, consisted of a one-dimensional mathematical model, that allowed for the definition of pre-chamber geometrical parameters. The device was manufactured and adapted to an SI engine, requiring no additional work to the cylinder head, as the pre-chamber was mounted in the original spark-plug screw thread. The prototype was experimentally characterized on an active dynamometer, and performance, combustion, emission and combustion visualization were studied. The pre-chamber ignition engine expanded the flammability limit in comparison with the baseline engine. For λ = 1.4, engine fuel conversion efficiency was increased by 5.4%, specific fuel consumption decreased by 22% and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions reduced by 52%, but total hydrocarbons (THC) emissions increased. Improvements achieved were due to the faster burn rates characterized by the reduced MBF 0–10%, combustion duration and combustion instability, and also the increased thermodynamic efficiency and the lower combustion temperatures achieved with lean burn technology. From the conclusions obtained in this research, the homogeneous pre-chamber torch ignition system developed for hydrous ethanol has potential for application and marketability integration, as an alternative technology able to help meet energy demands in a sustainable manner. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Hydrous ethanol; Pre-chamber torch ignition system; SI engine","Combustion; Conversion efficiency; Energy policy; Ethanol; Fossil fuels; Geometry; Ignition systems; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Screw threads; Alternative technologies; Combustion instabilities; Combustion temperatures; Combustion visualization; Fuel conversion efficiencies; SI Engines; Specific fuel consumption; Thermodynamic efficiency; Cylinder heads",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061828540

Through matching the relationship between land use types and carbon emissions, based on land use and socio-economic data, this paper uses the emission factor method proposed by IPCC to investigate carbon sources and sinks, as well as validation through land use/cover changes analysis in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH)urban agglomeration region from 1990 to 2015. Our results demonstrated that carbon sources have increased by almost threefold (23983.7 × 104t)from 1990 to 2015 while carbon sinks have declined rapidly to one-eighth of the original amount (84 × 104t)since 1995. Meanwhile, the built-up areas accounted for 88% of the total carbon emission. In the BTH region for 2015, the average carbon source intensity was 79 times greater than the average carbon sink intensity, indicating that the BTH region had serious carbon deficit and requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions. Furthermore, net carbon emissions in the BTH region increased by about 173% during the past 26 years, representing a 3.9% average annual increase. Our findings demonstrate the response of land use types to carbon balance in the BTH region are comparable at the national and regional level. In addition, they provide guidelines for land-use management, especially in terms of the synergetic development of the BTH region. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration region; Carbon sinks; Carbon sources; Land use/cover changes","Agglomeration; Carbon; Economics; Global warming; Health risks; Carbon sink; Carbon source; Ecological security; Land use/cover change; Socio-economic data; Spatial and temporal analysis; Synergetic development; Urban agglomerations; Land use; agglomeration; atmospheric chemistry; carbon emission; carbon sink; concentration (composition); land cover; land use change; spatiotemporal analysis; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054883410

This study analyzed six life-cycle stages and calculated the life-cycle CO 2 emissions of the construction sector in 30 Chinese provincial jurisdictions to understand the disparity among them. Results show that building materials production was the key stage for carbon reduction in the construction sector, followed by the building operation stage. External variables, e.g., economic growth, industrial structure, urbanization, price fluctuation, and marketization, were significantly correlated with the emission intensity of the construction sector. Specifically, economic growth exhibited an inverted U-shaped relation with CO 2 emissions per capita and per area during the period examined. Secondary industry and land urbanization were negatively correlated with CO 2 emission intensity indicators from the construction sector, whereas tertiary industry and urbanization were positively correlated. Price indices and marketization had negative effects on CO 2 emission intensity. The policy implications of our findings are that cleaner technologies should be encouraged for cement providers, and green purchasing rules for the construction sector should also be established.

We focus on particulate matter (PM) concentrations because of the relative importance of PM2:5 emissions in populated areas and the well-documented cumulative negative effects on human health. We estimate that in 2010, depending on the region, annual averaged anthropogenic PM2:5 concentrations varied between ca. 1 and 40 μgm-3, with the highest concentrations observed in China and India, and lower concentrations in Europe and North America. The relative contribution of anthropogenic emission sources to PM2:5 concentrations varies between the regions. European PM pollution is mainly influenced by the agricultural and residential sectors, while the major contributing sectors to PM pollution in Asia and the emerging economies are the power generation, industrial and residential sectors. We also evaluate the emission sectors and emission regions in which pollution reduction measures would lead to the largest improvement on the overall air quality. We show that air quality improvements would require regional policies, in addition to localand urban-scale measures, due to the transboundary features of PM pollution. We investigate emission inventory uncertainties and their propagation to PM2:5 concentrations, in order to identify the most effective strategies to be implemented at sector and regional level to improve emission inventories, knowledge and air quality modelling. We show that the uncertainty of PM concentrations depends not only on the uncertainty of local emission inventories, but also on that of the surrounding regions. Countries with high emission uncertainties are often impacted by the uncertainty of pollution coming from surrounding regions, highlighting the need for effective efforts in improving emissions not only within a region but also from extra-regional sources. Finally, we propagate emission inventory uncertainty to PM concentrations and health impacts.We estimate 2.1 million premature deaths per year with an uncertainty of more than 1 million premature deaths per year due to the uncertainty associated only with the emissions. © Author(s) 2019.",,"air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission inventory; health impact; particulate matter; pollution control; regional policy; uncertainty analysis; China; Europe; India; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064630038

Rain-on-snow (ROS) events can accelerate and modify the snowpack discharge process. The interplay of these processes can cause microscale flow heterogeneity and preferential flow pathways (PFP). Previous experimental work has examined PFP and ion elution processes in snowpacks, but their combined effect on the spatial and temporal characteristics of snowmelt ion elution remains uncertain. In this research, two controlled laboratory experiments were performed to investigate the role of PFP and ROS in controlling snow ion release to runoff. These involved the high frequency monitoring of flow and meltwater concentrations during snowmelt induced by radiation-convection (RC) processes and rain-on-snow (ROS). Results without ROS show that PFP was responsible for the transport of 68–75%, 73–75%, and 55% of the total NO 3 , PO 4 and SO 4 load discharged during the experiment. Lateral flow caused the contact zones to extend beyond the leading edges of the PFP, increasing meltwater concentrations particularly in the RC experiment where the snow microscale flow channels were better connected in early snowmelt. The results suggest that preferential elution in early melt resulting from snow ion exclusion may be more pronounced than previously thought, with the first 1.5% of melt transporting more than 20% of the total snowpack NO 3 and PO 4 load. The expected increase in the frequency of ROS events with climate change will likely reduce the magnitude of early ionic pulses in snowmelt runoff, but also make their occurrence more frequent. © 2019","Acid snow; Cold regions hydrology; Ion exclusion; Ion preferential elution; Nutrient exports; Snow hydrochemistry","Climate change; Groundwater flow; Ions; Nutrients; Rain; Runoff; Snow melting systems; Biogeochemical cycling; Cold regions; Controlled laboratories; High-frequency monitoring; Ion exclusion; Nutrient export; Physical and chemical properties; Temporal characteristics; Snow; nitrate; phosphate; sulfate; acid rain; cold region; hydrochemistry; hydrology; ion exchange; meltwater; nutrient cycling; seasonal variation; snowpack; spatiotemporal analysis; Article; biogeochemical cycle; climate change; dispersity; elution; flow kinetics; fractionation; ion exclusion chromatography; melting point; nutrient uptake; physical chemistry; priority journal; runoff; snow cover; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060473507

The PACRAIN database is a searchable repository of in situ rainfall observations initiated and maintained by the University of Oklahoma and supported by a research grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Climate Program Office/Ocean Observing and Monitoring. The gridding algorithm employs ordinary kriging, a standard geostatistical technique, and selects for nonnegative estimates and for local estimation neighborhoods yielding minimum kriging variance. This methodology facilitates the selection of fixed-size neighborhoods from available stations beyond simply choosing the closest stations, as it accounts for dependence between estimator stations. The number of stations used for estimation is based on bias and standard error exhibited under cross estimation. A cross validation is conducted, comparing estimated and observed rains, as well as theoretical and observed standard errors for the ordinary kriging estimator. The conditional bias of the kriging estimator and the predictive value of kriging standard errors, with respect to observed standard errors, are discussed.

Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) devices and particularly Thermo-Electric Generators (TEG) using Seebeck effect have often been seen as levers to improve those conflicting objectives, but yet are so far limited to niche market due to the use of expensive, scarce or toxic thermoelectric (TE) elements (Bi, Pb, Te). Within the European project INTEGRAL, a consortium of 13 companies and research organizations tackling with upscaling the production of the next generation TE materials, a TEG dedicated to heavy-duty trucks using half-Heusler TE material is being developed. First, a TEG system integration model has been developed and iterated in steady-state to provide TE Module (TEM) specifications. In this approach, typical truck operating points have been used, along with specific TEG impacts on both engine and vehicle, like additional weight and pressure drops, while aiming at a return of investment for the truck operator. Then, the TEMs were assembled and tested on a dedicated performance test bench. The measured TEM outputs including idle voltage, internal resistance, heat transfer and Peltier effect were compared to previous predictions. A root cause analysis was then conducted to explain the mismatches. The first step was to track and eliminate the errors in the test setup itself. The second step was to investigate local losses in the TEM, including layer-by-layer thermal contact and thermal by-pass of the TE material through conduction, convection and radiation. Lastly, the improved TEG model was used in a transient simulation platform to take into account the TEG thermal masses on the electric output. Finally, vehicle simulations were performed to update the fuel economy with TEG installed on a hybrid electric powertrain. © 2019 SAE International.

However, traditional energy planning approaches are limited because they tend to focus on technology substitution. We argue that a more ambitious and holistic urban energy planning approach is desirable. This paper proposes a novel method to integrated Energy and Urban Planning solutions assessment by modelling and quantifying urban energy planning strategies impact in terms of energy savings, greenhouse gases emission reduction and in increasing cities renewable distributed and local energy generation. We apply the approach to São Paulo megacity using the LEAP_SP urban energy simulation model (from 2014 to 2030) through four scenarios. Results showed that by using a traditional energy planning approach, it is possible to reach 2% energy savings from the current situation, 18% greenhouse gas emission reduction and a three-fold increase in renewables deployment. When applying only urban planning strategies these benefits are of 10% energy savings, 8% greenhouse gas emission reduction and one-fold increase in renewables deployment. If a more holistic urban energy approach is adopted by integrating both energy and urban planning policies, gains increase to 12% energy savings, 30% greenhouse gases emission reductions, and a four-fold increase in renewable distributed and local electricity generation from the current city status. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","LEAP_SP simulation model; Megacity; São Paulo urban energy system; Urban energy planning","Electric power generation; Emission control; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Greenhouse gases emissions; Megacities; Renewable electricity production; Simulation model; Urban energy planning; Urban energy systems; Urban Planning Strategies; Urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060327787

Ecological monitoring data are scarce in the Cameron Hills, and absent prior to the onset of oil and gas development in the 1960s. Consequently, the potential impacts of industrial activities on freshwater ecosystems in the Cameron Hills are unknown. Identifying ecosystem responses to industrial activities is further confounded by the effects of climate change, as this region has undergone substantial warming since ~1900. To address this important knowledge gap, we used an integrated spatial and temporal approach to investigate how climate warming and industrial activities may have altered water quality in the region. Water samples and sediment cores were collected from lakes with varying degrees of catchment disturbance related to oil and gas activities. Comparison of catchment characteristics and modern water chemistry data suggest that catchment disturbance may be increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export to lakes. Additionally, lakes in close proximity to the central battery exhibit lower pH than more distant lakes, which may be due to inputs of organic acids. Changes in diatom assemblages preserved in a dated sediment core from a lake with a disturbed catchment are consistent with modern water chemistry, indicating a trend toward increasing DOC and decreasing pH. Despite evidence of localized impacts related to oil and gas activities, changes in diatom assemblages suggest that regionally climate warming is currently the dominant driver of changes in lakes in the Cameron Hills. © 2019 E.

This paper describes resilience of ports to emergent conditions in three areas: Energy and fuels, controls and automation, and logistics transformation. First, the sustainability of energy and fuels have become a priority for ports due to growing concerns of carbon emissions. Liquified natural gas (LNG) is both a cost-effective and safe alternative fuel for reducing emissions of container ships. The feasibility and several strategies for adopting LNG bunkering at ports are described. Second, ports must leverage technological development to drive greater efficiency and operative resiliency. Recent developments in industrial automation and electrification are described. Lastly, the impact of corporate development to the region of the port is discussed. An analysis of enterprise capacity expansion includes both risks and benefits to increase competitiveness. This paper uses methodology of systems and data analysis, mathematical simulation, and risk cost-benefit optimization. The key results include identifying operational and security risks for container ports and providing strategies for risk mitigation and resilience.

We evaluated the population health implications of changing to more sustainable diets in the UK, France, Finland, Italy and Sweden. Subjects/Methods: We developed a life table model to simulate mortality and morbidity from diet-related diseases over the lifetime of the current population. Populating the model with locally available data for each country, we simulated the impact of country-specific dietary scenarios that had been optimised to meet dietary recommendations and reduce GHG emissions. Outcome measures included a change in disease-specific deaths, life expectancy and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Results: Diets that meet nutritional recommendations lead to substantial improvements in population health, ranging from 0.19 (95% uncertainty interval: 0.18–0.21) DALYs per person in Italy up to 0.89 (0.80–0.98) DALYs per person in Finland. Simultaneously reducing GHG emissions does not reduce the size of this impact, and in some cases produces additional health benefits. If sustainable diets can be maintained throughout adulthood, life expectancy would increase by between 2.3 (1.6–3.2) and 6.8 (5.5–8.5) months by country. However, results are sensitive to assumptions about how quickly changes in diet can influence disease, and future trends in disease. Conclusions: Modelling the health impact of diets that are both nutritional and low in GHG emissions shows the potential for significant co-benefits in health and sustainability from dietary changes. Future work is needed to find effective interventions to deliver healthy sustainable diets. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; death; diet; disability-adjusted life year; Finland; France; Italy; life expectancy; life table method; morbidity; mortality; population health; sustainable diet; Sweden; United Kingdom; feeding behavior; greenhouse effect; human; prevention and control; procedures; sustainable development; theoretical model; Diet, Healthy; Feeding Behavior; Finland; France; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Italy; Models, Theoretical; Sustainable Development; Sweden; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061491216

To evaluate the efficacy of ablative fractional CO2 laser intervention early in the acute treatment of panfacial burn injury. A 39-year-old Asian male with 60% TBSA flame burns including panfacial involvement was developing microstomia and upper and lower eyelid ectropion early proceeding epithelialization. At 6-weeks postinjury, ablative fractional CO2 laser treatment was commenced while still in the intensive care unit, and subsequently delivered at regular intervals. Nonsurgical scar contracture management was provided concurrently as per site specific standard protocols. Measurements and photographic data relative to deficits in eye and mouth competence were obtained at rest, as well as maximal opening at baseline and routinely until scar stabilization was reached. The outcomes were subsequently compared with facial burn patient historical data within our facility. No significant difference was identified in the functional ROM for mouth and eye regions; treatment duration was, however, shorter and aesthetic outcomes were considered superior to their surgical reconstruction counterparts in the historical cohort. This case report reveals that early ablative fractional CO2 resurfacing treatment, coalesced with nonsurgical scar management is an efficacious interventional approach to abate contractures to the face, accelerates and enhances scar maturation processes and may alleviate the need for surgical scar reconstructions.

Starting from the basic parameters of a 1.6 MW diesel-electric locomotive currently found in the national railway company locomotive fleet, the quasi-static model of the locomotive is derived and validated. The conventional locomotive model is then converted to its hybrid counterpart by adding a battery energy storage system in parallel to the generator and equipping it with an adequate optimized energy management control strategy. The hybrid locomotive powertrain components are also appropriately re-sized in order to meet comparable traction force and power performance. Both the conventional and hybridized locomotive models are then used for the purpose of comparative analysis of main vehicle characteristics for the mountainous railway route driving scenario, which includes realistic slope and speed limitations. The obtained simulation results are used to gain insights about the possible advantages of the proposed conversion/drivetrain hybridization in terms of feasible reduction of fuel consumption and related CO2 emissions, while also considering additional hybridization costs and return-of-investment period. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced transportation technologies; Emissions; Hybrid electric locomotive; Hybridization costs; Mountain rail route; Return-of-investment","Costs; Diesel locomotives; Electric locomotives; Emission control; Energy storage; Fuel economy; Investments; Particulate emissions; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Rails; Transportation routes; Battery energy storage systems; Emission reduction potentials; Optimized energy managements; Powertrain components; Rail routes; Return of investments; Transportation technology; Vehicle characteristics; Secondary batteries; advanced technology; assessment method; control system; cost analysis; diesel; electric vehicle; emission; emission control; energy storage; fuel cell; hypothesis testing; investment; model validation; mountain region; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062150159

Though the gamma distribution is usually employed for this purpose, some other distribution may be used, particularly in regions where zero precipitation amounts are recorded frequently. In this study, two distributions are considered alongside with the gamma distribution: the compound Poisson exponential distribution (CPE) and the square root normal distribution (SRN). They are fitted to monthly precipitation amounts measured at 24 stations in Croatia in the 55-year-long period (1961–2015). At five stations, long-term series (1901–2015) are available and they have been used for a more detailed investigation. The accommodation of the theoretical distributions to empirical ones is tested by comparison of the corresponding empirical and theoretical ratios of the skewness and the coefficient of variation. Furthermore, following the common approach to precipitation monitoring (CLIMAT reports), the comparison of the empirical and theoretical quintiles in the two periods (1961–1990 and 1991–2015) is examined. The results from the present study reveal that it would be more appropriate to implement theoretical distributions in such climate reports, since they provide better evaluation for monitoring purposes than the current empirical distribution. Nevertheless, deciding on an optimal theoretical distribution for different climate regimes and for different time periods is not easy to accomplish. With regard to Croatian stations (covering different climate regimes), the CPE or SRN distribution could also be the right choice in the climatological practice, in addition to the gamma distribution. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climatology; drought; meteorology; monitoring; precipitation (climatology); statistical distribution; Croatia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045740566

The Three-North Shelterbelt Program (TNSP), a pioneer for China's large-scale ecological construction, has promoted massive afforestation and forest dynamics since 1978. Quantitative analysis of carbon sequestration and its economic value of sub-type forest landscapes in the TNSP region is crucial for better understanding the capacity of forest carbon sequestration and providing reasonable forest management. Therefore, we assess the forest carbon sequestration in the TNSP region using the InVEST model based on spatial datasets during 1990–2015. Our results showed that forests in the TNSP region had strong carbon sequestration capacity. Total carbon sequestration fluctuated and overall showed a decreasing trend, with a reduction rate of 1.92% during the period of 1990–2015. The carbon sequestration of each carbon pool (namely aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil, and dead organic matter) also decreased slightly and the changes mainly happened in the north of northeastern China and along the southeast of central north China. Additionally, in monetary terms, the economic value of carbon sequestration reflected that the TNSP was worth implementing, with a small amount of investment in exchange for large carbon sequestration benefits. This work provides an up-to-date attempt to calculate carbon sequestration of forest more accurately, quantify economic values of carbon sequestration for forest ecosystems, which will give a baseline reference for related studies in the TNSP region, as well as other similar reforestation area. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon pools; Economic value; Forest carbon sequestration; InVEST model; Three-North Shelterbelt Program region","Economics; Ecosystems; Reforestation; Above ground biomass; Carbon pool; Carbon sequestration; Ecological construction; Economic values; Forest carbon sequestration; Terrestrial ecosystems; Three-North Shelterbelt Program region; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060334051

Heavy industries, which consume almost 50% of total energy produced, there is a strong need to implement energy efficiency measures. The electric motor driven systems (EMDS) such as fans, blowers, ventilators, pumps, and compressors are widely used in industries and consume 80% of total industrial electricity. A huge electrical energy saving potential exists with these applications since they frequently come under partial load condition. The optimal flux operation of motors provides significant savings in such conditions, especially in the steady-state. There are two methods, namely, loss model control (LMC) and search control (SC) used for finding an optimal flux value. In this paper, a case study has been performed to analyze the efficiency improvement of motors of an industrial unit by utilizing superior features of LMC and SC techniques together in a novel way. A total of 65 EMDS are being considered as energy-efficiency load points for the detailed investigation of a typical integrated cement-manufacturing unit, located at Durg district, C.G., India. The efficiency improvement validation has been carried out on the MATLAB platform. Significant savings of $2.19 million per annum in energy expenditures, 48,899 tons less per annum of combusted coal and nearly 50,366 tons less greenhouse emissions are estimated at 1 yr.

Here, the focus is on regional climate, anthropogenic emissions and long-range transport. Two major subdomains are explored-the European region and the Mediterranean Basin-with both areas showing high sensitivity to climate change. The Mediterranean area is explored in the context of the ChArMEx (the Chemistry Aerosol Mediterranean Experiment) project, which examines the current and future meteorological and chemical conditions of the Mediterranean area. This climate impact study covers the period from 2031 to 2100 and considers possible future scenarios in comparison with 1976 to 2005 historic simulations using three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). A detailed analysis of total PM10 (particulate matter with a diameter smaller that 10 μm) concentrations is carried out, including the evolution of PM10 and changes to its composition. The individual effects of meteorological conditions on PM10 components are explored in these scenarios in an effort to pinpoint the meteorological parameter(s) governing each component. The anthropogenic emission impact study covers the period from 2046 to 2055 using current legislation (CLE) and maximum feasible reduction (MFR) anthropogenic emissions for the year 2050 compared with historic simulations covering the period from 1996 to 2005 and utilizing CLE2010 emissions data. Longrange transport is explored by changing the boundary conditions in the chemistry transport model over the same period as the emission impact studies. Finally, a cumulative effect analysis of these drivers is performed, and the impact of each driver on PM10 and its components is estimated. The results show that regional climate change causes a decrease in the PM10 concentrations in our scenarios (in both the European and Mediterranean subdomains), as a result of a decrease in nitrate, sulfate, ammonium and dust atmospheric concentrations in most scenarios. On the contrary, BSOA (biogenic secondary organic aerosol) displays an important increase in all scenarios, showing more pronounced concentrations for the European subdomain compared with the Mediterranean region. Regarding the relationship of different meteorological parameters to concentrations of different species, nitrate and BSOA show a strong temperature dependence, whereas sulfate is most strongly correlated with relative humidity. The temperature-dependent behavior of BSOA changes when looking at the Mediterranean subdomain, where it displays more dependence on wind speed, due to the transported nature of BSOA existing in this subdomain. A cumulative look at all drivers shows that anthropogenic emission changes overshadow changes caused by climate and long-range transport for both of the subdomains explored, with the exception of dust particles for which longrange transport changes are more influential, especially in the Mediterranean Basin. For certain species (such as sulfates and BSOA), in most of the subdomains explored, the changes caused by anthropogenic emissions are (to a certain extent) reduced by the boundary conditions and regional climate changes. © 2019 Author(s).

Quantitative understanding of PM2.5 source attribution is thus crucial for developing efficient air quality mitigation strategies. Here we use a suite of extensive observations of PM2.5 and its precursors concentrations during the international KORea-US cooperative Air Quality field study in Korea (KORUS-AQ) in May–June 2016 to investigate source contributions to PM2.5 in South Korea under various meteorological conditions. For the quantitative analysis, we updated a 3-D chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem, and its adjoint with the latest regional emission inventory and other recent findings. The updated model is evaluated by comparing against observed daily PM2.5 and its component concentrations from six ground sites (Bangnyung, Bulkwang, Olympic park, Gwangju, Ulsan, and Jeju). Overall, simulated concentrations of daily PM2.5 and its components are in a good agreement with observations over the peninsula. We conduct an adjoint sensitivity analysis for simulated surface level PM2.5 concentrations at five ground sites (except for Bangnyung because of its small population) under four different meteorological conditions: dynamic weather, stagnant, extreme pollution, and blocking periods.

Chinese contribution accounts for almost 68% of PM2.5 in surface air in South Korea during the extreme pollution period of the campaign, whereas an enhanced contribution from domestic sources (57%) occurs for the blocking period.

Recent experimental techniques have been developed for operando identification of reaction intermediates using surface infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy. However, large noises in the experimental spectrum pose great challenges in resolving the atomistic structures of reactive intermediates. To provide an interpretation of these experimental studies and target for additional studies, we report the results from quantum mechanics molecular dynamics (QM-MD) with explicit consideration of solvent, electrode–electrolyte interface, and applied potential at 298 K, which conceptually resemble the operando experimental condition, leading to a prototype of operando QM-MD (o-QM-MD). With o-QM-MD, we characterize 22 possible reactive intermediates in carbon dioxide reduction reactions (CO 2 RRs). Furthermore, we report the vibrational density of states (v-DoSs) of these intermediates from two-phase thermodynamic (2PT) analysis. Accordingly, we identify important intermediates such as chemisorbed CO 2 (b-CO 2 ), *HOC-COH, *C-CH, and *C-COH in our o-QM-MD likely to explain the experimental spectrum. Indeed, we assign the experimental peak at 1,191 cm − 1 to the mode of C-O stretch in *HOC-COH predicted at 1,189 cm − 1 and the experimental peak at 1,584 cm − 1 to the mode of C-C stretch in *C-COD predicted at 1,581 cm − 1 . Interestingly, we find that surface ketene (*C=C=O), arising from *HOC-COH dehydration, also shows signals at around 1,584 cm − 1 , which indicates a nonelectrochemical pathway of hydrocarbon formation at low overpotential and high pH conditions. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

In the present study, we reviewed up-to-date information on the abundance, distribution, and modes of occurrence of Cd in Chinese coals, as well as its environmental effects. With the 3110 sets of data rearranged, the arithmetic and weighted mean of Cd concentration in Chinese coals were calculated. Using coal reserves in individual province and coal-forming ages as weighting factors, the estimated average Cd abundances in Chinese coals are 0.25 mg/kg and 0.42 mg/kg, respectively. Variations in Cd coal abundances in different geographical locations, coal-forming ages, and coal ranks are taken into account. The Cd abundances in northern Chinese coals are significantly lower than those in the southern Chinese coals. Sulfides, especially sphalerite, are the most common Cd carriers in coals. As a semi-volatile element, Cd can be partially transformed into a volatilized form during highly thermal process, which could enrich surrounding fly ash. The combination of electrostatic precipitator and flue gas desulphurization is proved to be a better effective method for reducing emissions of Cd. Heavy loadings of Cd in environmental compartments due to anthropogenic activities have posed a great challenge to atmosphere–land–ocean systems. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","cadmium; Chinese coal; distribution; environmental impact; modes of occurrence",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067599316

Environmental monitoring in CCS sites is critical for ensuring that any CO2 leakage and its effect on biota, especially vegetation, is detectable. It also plays an important role in creating a social license to operate and assuring the general public that the mechanisms for leak detection and remediation are in place. This review overviews current remote sensing technologies for vegetation monitoring of CCS sites/regions (with a focus on rangelands and pastures), including medium-to-high resolution satellite, aerial (both manned and unmanned aircrafts) and in situ sensors and methods. Our literature survey has pointed out that remote sensing, particularly hyperspectral sensors, can accurately detect CO2 leakage derived effects on vegetation. It can compensate the two main drawbacks of operational systems for detecting these effects over large areas. One is the areas affected tend to be relatively small (1–15 m); and the other is symptoms in vegetation tissues tend to be similar to other stresses, such as nutrient or water deficiency. With this in mind, we have recommend that a comprehensive system should be put in place. It integrates continuous monitoring with ad-hoc detection to assess vegetation conditions in a planned CCS site. Site-based pheonocams and area-based medium-resolution satellite remote sensing sources can be used to compare any given point in time (e.g. the injection point) with the condition at the same location in the past. Before an injection commences, a baseline assessment should be conducted using the combination of high-resolution aerial hyperspectral imaging and medium-resolution long-term data from Landsat sensors. Further acquisition of high-resolution aerial imagery (ideally hyperspectral) is particularly useful following specific detected CO2 leaking events. Aiming at bridging the gaps between research, development and implementation of CCS, this review will contribute to environmental and social impacts of sustainable energy policies, including climate change mitigation and environmental pollution reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CCS; CO2 emission; Hyperspectral imaging; Leakage effects; Stress detection; Vegetation condition","Aerial photography; Antennas; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Digital storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hyperspectral imaging; Leak detection; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Vegetation; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); CO2 emissions; High resolution aerial imagery; High resolution satellites; Leakage effects; Remote sensing technology; Stress detection; Vegetation condition; Carbon capture; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; climate change; detection method; energy policy; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; Landsat; multispectral image; pollution control; remote sensing; vegetation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061575335

This work analyzed PM2.5 samples collected in Yangzhou, China, during 2016. Ionic species, organic matter (OM), elemental carbon (EC), and trace metals were determined, and an Aerodyne soot-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS) was introduced to determine the OM mass, rather than only organic carbon mass. We found that inorganic ionic species was dominant (~52%), organics occupied about 1/4, while trace metals (~1%) and EC (~2.1%) contributed insignificantly to the total PM2.5 mass. Water-soluble OM appeared to link closely with secondary OM, while water-insoluble OM correlated well with primary OM. The PM2.5 concentrations were relatively low during summertime, while its compositions varied little among different months. Seasonal variations of water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) concentrations were not significant, while the mass contributions of WSON to total nitrogen were remarkably high during summer and autumn. WSON was found to associate better with secondary sources based on both correlation analyses and principle component analyses. Analyses of potential source contributions to WSON showed that regional emissions were dominant during autumn and winter, while the ocean became relatively important during spring and summer. © 2019 by the authors.","Aerosol mass spectrometry; Organic aerosol; Organic nitrogen; PM2.5; Water-soluble ions","Aerosols; Ions; Mass spectrometry; Nitrogen; Principal component analysis; Trace elements; Aerosol mass spectrometry; Organic aerosol; Organic nitrogen; PM2.5; Water-soluble ions; Organic carbon; aerosol; air sampling; atmospheric chemistry; correlation; ion; mass spectrometry; organic nitrogen; particulate matter; principal component analysis; China; Jiangsu; Yangzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064075011

Tests on the exhaust gas composition were conducted before and after changing the EGR ratio. The fuel used in the study (B2 diesel) was a mixture of 2% biodiesel and 98% diesel. The main focus was on the emission factors for the organic toxic pollutants in the exhaust gas after EGR ratios of 0% and 5% were applied. At an EGR ratio of 5%, the total mass emission factors for the PAHs and PCBs increased by 9.1 times and 14.4 times, respectively, while the toxicity equivalent factors increased by 4.0 times and 4.8 times, respectively. A significant increase in pollutants with a higher molecular weight, particularly for the PAHs, was observed after applying an EGR ratio of 5%, implying incomplete combustion. The emission factors of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitric oxides (NOx) decreased by 2.5% and 54.4%, respectively, when the EGR ratio was increased from 0% to 5%, but those of PM and carbon monoxide (CO) increased by 60.5% and 66%, respectively.

In this study, we use the STIRPAT model and various panel regression techniques to explore the impact of urbanization on rural residential energy consumption and CO2 emission by using data from Southwest China. The results show that a higher urbanization level contributes to higher total residential energy intensity. Increases in net income per capita can decrease the intensities of traditional biomass energy and non-biomass energy, while industrialization has a negative effect only on non-biomass energy intensity. Land use change driven by urbanization can also lower the intensities of total residential energy, traditional biomass energy and non-biomass energy. Moreover, the impact of total residential energy intensity on emissions is positive. Particularly, traditional biomass energy accounts for most of CO2 emissions derived from the use of residential energy. As urbanization is expected to increase in the developing world and lead to more CO2 emissions from rural areas, policies which intend to reduce the intensity of traditional biomass energy, promote biogas and industrialization, and raise net income of rural residents can be used as effective mitigation strategies. © 2019 by the authors.","CO2 emissions; Economic modernization; Land use change; Population concentration; Residential energy intensity in rural area; STIRPAT model","biogas; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); developing world; economic planning; energy intensity; industrialization; land use change; residential energy; rural area; sustainable development; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066927545

Surface measurements of NOx, CO, NMHC, O3, SO2, and PM10 from 13 air quality-monitoring stations of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA) in the Taipei metropolitan area during holiday and non-holiday periods of 1994–2012 were used. All six pollutants were proven to exhibit holiday effects between Chinese New Year (CNY) and non-Chinese New Year (NCNY) periods. However, almost all pollutants exhibited holiday effects for the two other holidays; the exceptions were O3 between Tomb Sweeping Day (TSD) and non-Tomb Sweeping Day (NTSD) periods and CO and PM10 between Mid-Autumn Day (MAD) and non-Mid-Autumn Day (NMAD) periods. Air pollutants, including NOx, CO, NMHC, SO2, and PM10, that exhibited holiday effects had consistently lower concentrations in holiday periods than in non-holiday periods, whereas O3 concentrations were higher in holiday periods than in non-holiday periods. A widespread holiday effect with consistent signs indicates a high degree of urbanization in the study area. Compared with CNY–NCNY and MAD–NMAD periods, the TSD–NTSD period had a considerably lower difference of the titration effect, lower NOx resulting in less ozone destruction, in evening traffic hours and an inconsistent holiday effect in the daytime and nighttime, leading to the lack of O3 holiday effect. Because the MAD period had more nighttime activities than the other two holiday periods did, the MAD–NMAD period lacked CO and PM10 holiday effects. The prevalently higher ratios of CO, NMHC, SO2, and PM10 relative to NOx as a proxy of mobile sources and a lower PM2.5/PM10 ratio in the MAD period than in the CNY and TSD periods indicate different pollution sources oriented from holiday activities. The air pollutants exhibited a weakening trend are all associated with a greater improvement in air quality during the non-holiday periods than the holiday periods, which implies successful air pollution control policies. Holiday effects of NOx, NMHC (p &lt; 0.05), and CO (p &lt; 0.10) are associated with mobile sources; the holiday effects for the three holidays tend to have a strong relation with the number of vacation days in a holiday, indicating that a large reduction of air pollution occurs when a holiday has a high number of vacation days, which probably encourages extensive behavioral changes. Moreover, the aforementioned conditions imply that air pollution control strategies are effective with time; pollution reduction for only 1–2 days may fail to improve ambient air quality. Holiday effects of pollutants emitted during long holiday periods have crucial implications in formulating ozone control strategies in Taiwan and in other countries with similar national or cultural holidays. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Barbecue; Chinese new year; Incense burning; Ozone control strategy; Weekend effect","Air quality; Mobile power plants; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Quality control; Surface measurement; Air quality monitoring stations; Ambient air quality; Barbecue; Chinese New Year; Ozone control; Pollution reduction; Taiwan environmental protection administrations; Weekend effects; Air pollution control; ozone; burning; carbon monoxide; chemical pollutant; metropolitan area; nitrous oxide; ozone; particulate matter; pollution control; urban pollution; urbanization; air monitoring; air particle control; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; ambient air; Article; autumn; circadian rhythm; control strategy; environmental protection; leisure; limit of detection; ozone depletion; ozone layer; priority journal; spring; summer; surface property; Taiwan; titrimetry; troposphere; urbanization; winter; Taipei; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061723889

Numerous studies using regional or global climate models have demonstrated the cooling effects of irrigation on mean and extreme temperature, especially over regions where irrigation is extensive. However, these model-based results have not been well validated due to the limitations of observational data sets. In this study, multiple satellite-based products, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data sets, are used to isolate and quantify the local impacts of irrigation on surface climate over irrigated regions, which are derived from the Global Map of Irrigation Areas (GMIA). The relationships among soil moisture, albedo, evapotranspiration, and surface temperature are explored. Strong evaporative cooling by irrigation lowers daytime surface temperature over arid and semi-arid regions, such as California's Central Valley, the Great Plains, central Asia, and northwestern India. However, the cooling effects are less evident in areas of eastern China and the Lower Mississippi River Basin despite extensive irrigation over these regions. Results are also compared with irrigation experiments using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to assess the model's ability to represent land–atmosphere interactions in regards to irrigation. CESM greatly underestimates the surface temperature response to irrigation. The comparison between the offline and coupled simulations suggests that the irrigation-induced cooling can be regulated by the interactions between land surface and atmosphere, and amplified signals are found over the “hot spot” regions. Meanwhile, model resolution can also influence the magnitude of the local cooling by irrigation. © 2018 Royal Meteorological Society","CESM; evaporative cooling; irrigation; land surface temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Evaporation; Evaporative cooling systems; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Radiometers; Soil moisture; Solar radiation; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Agricultural irrigation; Arid and semi-arid regions; CESM; Evaporative cooling; Mississippi River Basin; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Soil moisture active passive (SMAP); Surface temperatures; Land surface temperature; cooling; evapotranspiration; irrigation; land surface; modeling; MODIS; regional climate; semiarid region; surface temperature; California; California Valley; Central Asia; Great Plains; India; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060636361

In China—the world's largest crop residue producer—farmers burn almost one quarter of their crop residues in the field after harvest, despite the government providing financial incentives such as subsidies to retain crop residues. This study combined economic analyses with simulations of soil carbon accumulation and carbon emission reduction associated with different residue management practices to determine the minimum level of incentives needed for Chinese farmers to shift from burning to retaining crop residues for generating carbon benefits. Simulation results showed that [1] the density of topsoil organic carbon in China's croplands would have increased from about 21.8 t ha −1 in 2000 to 23.9 t ha −1 in 2010, and soil organic carbon sequestration would have reached 24.4 Tg C yr −1 if farmers had shifted from burning to retaining crop residues on croplands during this period; and [2] retaining crop residues would have avoided about 149.9 Tg of CO 2 emission per year. Economic analyses showed that [1] existing subsidies in all regions of China, except Northeast China, only accounted for 18–82% of the incentives required for farmers to shift from burning to crop residue retention; [2] Northeast China required the lowest incentive (287 CNY ha −1 ), while eastern China required the highest (837 CNY ha −1 ); and [3] the prevailing market prices (1.4–60.2 CNY tCO 2 e −1 ) in China's seven pilot carbon markets seem to be below the required incentives (39.6–189.1 CNY tCO 2 e −1) . Our study suggests that the Chinese government should increase subsidies or seek innovative incentive schemes to encourage farmers to change their crop residue management practices for global climate change mitigation and health benefits. © 2019","Carbon emissions; China; Crop residue management; Economic analysis; Soil carbon","Agricultural wastes; Climate change; Commerce; Economic analysis; Emission control; Forestry; Organic carbon; Soil pollution; Soils; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; China; Crop residue burning; Crop residue management; Global climate changes; Soil carbon; Soil organic carbon sequestration; Crops; organic carbon; carbon emission; crop production; crop residue; economic analysis; integrated approach; soil carbon; agricultural worker; Article; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; China; Chinese; crop residue burning; cropland; environmental economics; human; nonhuman; plant residue; priority journal; soil; waste management; agriculture; carbon sequestration; chemistry; crop; economic model; economics; environmental monitoring; fire; procedures; theoretical model; China; Agriculture; Carbon Sequestration; China; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; Fires; Models, Economic; Models, Theoretical; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060326433

Here we characterize regional-scale CO2 transport uncertainties due to uncertainties in meteorological fields using a mesoscale atmospheric model and an ensemble of simulations with flow-dependent transport errors. During a 1-month summer period over North America, transport uncertainties yield an ensemble spread in instantaneous CO2 at 100 m above ground level comparable to the CO2 uncertainties resulting from 48% relative uncertainty in 3-hourly natural CO2 fluxes. Temporal averaging reduces transport uncertainties but increases the influence of CO2 uncertainties from the lateral boundaries. The influence of CO2 background uncertainties is especially large for column-averaged CO2. These results suggest that transport errors and CO2 background errors limit regional atmospheric inversions at two distinct timescales and that the error characteristics of transport and background errors should guide the design of regional inversion systems. ©2019.

To further understand the characteristics and interactions among different urban air pollutants in the west Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, continuous measurements of low-layer atmospheric particles and trace gases have been performed at an urban site in Nanjing from September 2016 to February 2017 in this study. In the urban area of the west YRD, the mean PM<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">10</span> and span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">O3/span> concentrations are 86.3&thinsp;span classCombining double low line inline-formula>μ/span>g thinsp;mspan classCombining double low lineinline-formula>ĝ'3/span> and 37.7 ppb, respectively, with significant seasonal and diurnal variations. Particles, which are dominated by fine aerosols, are relatively scattering. And most of their optical properties have similar variations to the aerosol concentrations. Results also show that the west YRD could still suffer severe air pollution, although the seasonal mean aerosol concentrations have decreased in recent years. Even in cold seasons, span classCombining double low line inline-formula/span could exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for about 40 days during the sampling period. Most of polluted episodes are caused by local and subregional emissions. A case study for a typical span classCombining double low line inline-formula/span and PMipan classCombining double low line inline-formula2.5/span episode in December 2016 demonstrates that the episode was generally associated with regional transport and a stable weather system. Air pollutants were mostly transported from the western areas with high emissions, as well as with an anticyclone and high-pressure system in this region. Correlation analysis reveals that the interactions between span classCombining double low lineinline-formula/span and PM are complex, with a combination of inhibition and promotion under different conditions. The inhibition effect might result from the reduction of photolysis frequency near the surface due to aerosols in addition to their positive correlations with precursors, while the promotion effect is from the formation of secondary aerosols under high concentrations of oxidants and solar radiation. However, the interaction between span classCombining double low line nline-formula/span and BC shows an inhibiting effect due to its chemical stability. This also indicated a VOC-sensitive regime for photochemical production of span classCombining double low line inline-formula /span in this region. This study further improves insight into the characteristics and interactions of main pollutants and may contribute to the improvement of the simulation and prediction of aerosols and gases in the urban area of the YRD./p. © Author(s) 2019.",,"aerosol; air quality; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric transport; diurnal variation; ozone; particulate matter; photolysis; seasonal variation; trace gas; urban atmosphere; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; Yangtze Delta; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063935365

This paper divided China's 30 provinces into 4 regions based on the relationship between the average annual growth rates of CO 2 emissions and GDP, and explored the driving forces of carbon intensity in 2000 and 2015 for China's 30 provinces and 4 regions This decomposition method can provide the rankings and specific drivers of carbon intensity, including energy intensity, industrial structure and energy structure. The results show that during 2000–2015, all provinces' carbon intensity decreased except for Hainan. Ningxia, Shanxi, Guizhou, Qinghai and Xinjiang were the five top provincial drivers of the carbon intensity growth in China. Energy intensity was the most important driving factor influencing the change of carbon intensity. Industrial structure and energy structure had small effects on the change of carbon intensity. Moreover, the region III with a high CO 2 emission growth rate and a low GDP growth rate had a poor performance of carbon intensity, due to the large impact of energy intensity. Based on the results of this study, the reduction in carbon intensity could be achieved by further reducing energy intensity, optimizing energy and industrial structure, especially in the provinces with fast CO 2 growth rates and slow GDP growth rates. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon intensity; GDP; Spatial-temporal decomposition; Weighted average approach","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Industrial emissions; Average annual growth rates; Carbon intensity; Decomposition methods; Economic perspective; Industrial structures; Regional differences; Spatial temporals; Weighted averages; Growth rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060104592

A total of 218 daily PM2.5 samples were collected during one year in the urban district of Beijing, China. Analysis showed that the annual mean concentration of total PAHs (TPAHs) was 66.2 ng/m3, with benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) accounting for 12.4%. High-molecular-weight (HMW, 4–6 rings) PAHs were the dominant components. Seasonal TPAH concentrations decreased in the order of heating season (156 ng/m3) &gt; autumn (20.4 ng/m3) &gt; spring (16.0 ng/m3) &gt; summer (12.5 ng/m3) and were related to meteorological conditions and source emission intensity. The source-attributed mass contribution and source regions of three sources (i.e., (1) vehicle emissions; (2) coal combustion; and (3) petroleum volatilization, natural gas and biomass combustion) were identified by integrating the positive matrix factorization (PMF), potential source contribution function (PSCF) and conditional probability function (CPF). Vehicle emissions contributed the most mass (54.6%), followed by coal combustion (29.8%), on an annual basis. Combined with actual regional emissions, vehicle emissions were mainly derived from local sources, while coal combustion mainly came from regional transport from surrounding areas. Vehicle emissions and coal combustion have much higher mass contributions in the heating season. The source-attributed cancer risk was further evaluated based on source mass contribution and inhalation unit risk. Vehicle emissions contributed the largest risk (2.8 × 10−6, accounting for 71%) as a result of 30 years of exposure for local residents, exceeding the acceptable level (10−6). The heating season showed the most risk, especially in response to vehicle emissions and coal combustion.

Practical regional joint emission control strategies require quantitative assessments of the transport contribution among cities and regions. The Community Multiscale Air Quality model equipped with the Integrated Source Apportionment Model is used to simulate the contributions from 5 major emission sectors in 13 cities of the BTH region, and 4 surrounding provinces outside BTH for the year 2014. Annual averaged local contribution ranges from 32% to 63% for the 13 cities in the BTH region, where secondary components contributing more than primary components. Regional contribution ratio becomes larger and the transport distance longer in July and October than in January and March. For Beijing, local contributions are 62% and 69% in January and March respectively, and the regional transports are mainly from nearby cities such as Zhangjiakou, Baoding and Langfang. In July and October, local contributions in Beijing are only 33% and 38% respectively, and a large range of regions in the south have substantial contributions, where Shandong Province and Henan Province contribute 3.6–5.3 μg/m 3 . Analysis of daily contributions suggests that regional transport is stronger under higher PM 2.5 concentrations. During heavy pollution, local emissions in Beijing contribute 61%, 49%, 23% and 25% in January, march, July and October respectively, while during the clean days, the ratios are 88%, 88%, 76% and 57% respectively. Southerly regional transport during the rising phase of “saw tooth” pattern might be enhanced by weak cold high pressure and its easterly, northerly moving path. Among the major emission sectors, in winter, local domestic combustion is the most important source for Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang. In summer, transportation and domestic combustion are two important local sources for Beijing, while joint control in other cities should focus on industry. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CMAQ-ISAM; PM 2.5; Regional transport; Source apportionment; The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region","Air quality; Combustion; Emission control; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; CMAQ-ISAM; PM2.5; Regional transport; Source apportionment; Atmospheric movements; aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); particulate matter; pollutant transport; pollution control; source apportionment; urban transport; air pollution control; air quality; article; China; city; cold stress; combustion; human; joint; summer; tooth; winter; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059940338

In recent years, the increased availability of high-resolution (&lt;30m) imagery and advancements in machine learning algorithms have opened up a new opportunity to fuse multiple datasets of varying spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. Here, we present a new model, based on a deep learning architecture, that performs both classification and regression concurrently, thereby consolidating what was previously several independent tasks and models into one stream. The model, a multi-task recurrent convolutional neural network that we call the Chimera, integrates varying resolution, freely available aerial and satellite imagery, as well as relevant environmental factors (e.g., climate, terrain) to simultaneously classify five forest cover types ('conifer', 'deciduous', 'mixed', 'dead', 'none' (non-forest)) and to estimate four continuous forest structure metrics (above ground biomass, quadratic mean diameter, basal area, canopy cover). We demonstrate the performance of our approach by training an ensemble of Chimera models on 9967 georeferenced (true locations) Forest Inventory and Analysis field plots from the USDA Forest Service within California and Nevada. Classification diagnostics for the Chimera ensemble on an independent test set produces an overall average precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.92, 0.92, and 0.92. Class-wise F1-scores were high for 'none' (0.99) and 'conifer' (0.85) cover classes, and moderate for the 'mixed' (0.74) class samples. This demonstrates a strong ability to discriminate locations with and without trees. Regression diagnostics on the test set indicate very high accuracy for ensembled estimates of above ground biomass (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 37.28 Mg/ha), quadraticmean diameter (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 3.74 inches), basal area (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 25.88 ft2/ac), and canopy cover (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 8.01 percent). Comparative analysis of the Chimera ensemble versus support vector machine and random forest approaches demonstrates increased performance over both methods. Future implementations of the Chimera ensemble on a distributed computing platform could provide continuous, annual estimates of forest structure for other forested landscapes at regional or national scales. © 2019 by the authors.","Forest classification; Forest structure; High resolution imagery; Multi-task learning; NAIP; Recurrent convolutional neural networks; Remote sensing","Antennas; Classification (of information); Climate models; Convolution; Decision trees; Deep learning; Distributed computer systems; Ecosystems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Recurrent neural networks; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Convolutional neural network; Forest classification; Forest structure; High resolution imagery; Multitask learning; NAIP; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064007601

The prices of oil and its interactions with financial markets make it possible to determine the associated prices of financial derivatives, such as carbon emission prices. The approach taken in the paper is different from others in the literature; the purpose is to examine the usefulness of modeling and testing volatility spillovers in the oil and financial markets. The paper investigates co-volatility spillovers (namely, the delayed effect of a returns shock in one physical or financial asset on the subsequent volatility or co-volatility in another physical or financial asset) between the oil and financial markets. The oil industry has four major regions, namely North Sea, the USA, Middle East, and South-East Asia. Associated with these regions are two major financial centers, namely the UK and the USA. For these reasons, the data to be used are the returns on alternative crude oil markets, returns on crude oil derivatives, specifically futures, and stock index returns in the UK and the USA. Given the importance of the Chinese financial and economic systems, the paper also analyzes Chinese financial markets, where the data are more recent. The USA and China are the world’s two largest economies and the UK is the world’s sixth largest economy (and second in the existing EU) behind the USA, China, Japan, Germany, and India. Moreover, the USA and the UK are associated with WTI and Brent oil, respectively. One of the purposes of the paper is to examine how China might be different from the USA and the UK, which seems to be borne out in the empirical analysis. Based on the conditional covariances to test the co-volatility spillovers, dynamic hedging strategies will be suggested to analyze market fluctuations in crude oil prices and associated financial markets. © 2019 by the authors","Co-volatility spillovers; Crude oil; Diagonal BEKK; Financial markets; Futures; Optimal dynamic hedging; Spot","Binary alloys; Commerce; Costs; Crude oil; Dynamics; Investments; Petroleum analysis; Thallium alloys; Diagonal BEKK; Futures; Optimal dynamics; Spot; Volatility spillovers; Financial markets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065504094

Consequentially, its environmental burden is significant in terms of resource use and carbon emissions. An adaptive surrogate model based on an extended radial basis function and adaptive sampling method was used to optimize the design of a concrete mixture in order to reduce its CO2 emissions and cost. The adaptive sampling method based on the multi-island genetic algorithm was adopted in order to improve the adaptive capability and accuracy of the surrogate model by selecting the proper sample size and ensuring uniform distribution of the sample points in the designed space. Three types of concrete with different strength, that is, C70, C40 and C30, were optimized by controlling the amount of fly ash and phosphorous slag in the samples. The optimized results showed that fly ash and phosphorous slag have a significant influence on the CO2 emissions of concrete and optimized concrete's cost, while CO2 emissions were less than that of the reference samples. Therefore, the optimal mixture is with great significance to reduce the carbon emission of concrete, which also has implications for decreasing the environmental burden of concrete. In this way, we can optimize concrete of different strength to reduce carbon dioxide emission. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptive sampling method; Concrete mixture optimization; Extended radial basis function; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Surrogate model","carbon emission; concrete; cost analysis; design method; emission control; fly ash; genetic algorithm; life cycle analysis; methodology; numerical model; optimization; resource use; sampling; sapling; slag; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064060855

Air pollution is an environmental and social problem, as it leads to a number of harmful effects on human health, ecosystems, the environment and the climate. Air pollution constitutes the greatest environmental health risk in the city of Pristina. Air pollutants are emitted from anthropogenic and natural sources; they can be transported or formed over long distances and can affect large areas. Some air pollutants float in the environment for long periods and can accumulate in the environment and in the food chain, affecting humans and animals not only through air intake but through water and food intake too. Air pollution is a complex problem that poses multiple challenges in terms of management and mitigation. Effective action to reduce the impact of air pollution requires some good understanding of the sources that cause it, as well as knowledge of the daily status of air quality and its impact on humans and ecosystems. In this research paper, we carried out the monitoring of the air quality in terms of it being polluted with SO 2 in the municipality of Pristina for the months March and June 2017.

Using a 20-year experiment, where 50 non-resident (but mostly native) grassland plant species were sown into savannah plots, we ask how traits linked with invasion depend on invasion stage (establishment, spread), indicator of invasion success (occupancy, relative abundance), time, environmental conditions, propagule rain, and traits of invaders and invaded communities. Trait data for 164 taxa showed that invader occupancy was primarily associated with traits of invaders, traits of recipient communities, and invader-community interactions. Invader abundance was more strongly associated with community traits (e.g. proportion legume) and trait differences between invaders and the most similar resident species. Annuals and invaders with high-specific leaf area were only successful early in stand development, whereas invaders with conservative carbon capture strategies persisted long-term. Our results indicate that invasion is context-dependent and long-term experiments are required to comprehensively understand invasions. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve; ecosystem invasibility; functional traits; indicators of invasion; invasion stages; long-term grassland experiment; seed addition experiment; species invasiveness","ecosystem; grassland; introduced species; plant; population dynamics; Ecosystem; Grassland; Introduced Species; Plants; Population Dynamics",Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061909034

In arid and semi-arid agroecosystems, measures such as Landscape Restoration and Water Harvesting (LRWH) are implemented in order to revert land degradation and increase agricultural yields, by means of reducing runoff losses and increasing soil moisture. The present work analyses to what extent storing soil moisture, with adequate land and water management practices, can reduce temperatures in the hot months after the rainy season in a semi-arid climate. Since it is reported that Soil Moisture (SM) deficit can enhance heatwaves in diverse regions of the world because of Soil Moisture-Temperature Coupling (SMTC), it is hypothesized that increasing soil water availability, during the dry and hot periods, can mitigate hot temperatures. The analysis was carried for Enabered catchment, in Tigray Region, Ethiopia, where the rainy season runs from June to September. Here, large scale LRWH implementation ended in 2008. Using remote sensing data, the present study evaluates (1) to what extent LRWH implementation can enhance SM conservation at agroecosystem scale; (2) to what extent LRWH implementation can mitigate temperatures in the dry season at agroecosystem scale; and (3) the evidence of SMTC effects. Results show an increased capacity of the catchment to maintain SM accumulated in the rainy season and consequent reduced temperatures. Increase of SM was especially significant for September (P < 0.01), while temperature decrease was evident in October (P < 0.01) and November (P < 0.05), with decreases of Land Surface Temperatures (LST) up to 1.74 °C A simple, parsimonious linear regression model demonstrates that SMTC is evident at catchment scale and that the implementation of LRWH measures provides a climate regulation effect in the watershed. The present work can reinforce the call for an increased adoption of water harvesting, land restoration and green water management, in order to increase the resilience of agricultural ecosystem and food security in arid and semi-arid areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate feedbacks; Ethiopia; Remote sensing; Soil moisture (SM); Soil moisture temperature coupling (SMTC); Tigray region","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; catchment; dry season; food security; harvesting; land degradation; landscape; management practice; runoff; semiarid region; soil moisture; water management; Ethiopia; Tigray",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061281475

Here, we identified the ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) species linked to N 2 O emissions and evaluated the effects of urea and urea with DCD and DMPP on the nitrifying community in a 258 day field experiment under sugarcane. Using an amoA AOB amplicon sequencing approach and mining a previous dataset of 16S rRNA sequences, we characterized the most likely N 2 O-producing AOB as a Nitrosospira spp. and identified Nitrosospira (AOB), Nitrososphaera (archaeal ammonia oxidizer) and Nitrospira (nitrite-oxidizer) as the most abundant, present nitrifiers. The fertilizer treatments had no effect on the alpha and beta diversities of the AOB communities. Interestingly, we found three clusters of co-varying variables with nitrifier operational taxonomic units (OTUs): the N 2 O-producing AOB Nitrosospira with N 2 O, NO 3 − , NH 4 + , water-filled pore space (WFPS) and pH; AOA Nitrososphaera with NO 3 − , NH 4 + and pH; and AOA Nitrososphaera and NOB Nitrospira with NH 4 + , which suggests different drivers. These results support the co-occurrence of non-N 2 O-producing Nitrososphaera and Nitrospira in the unfertilized soils and the promotion of N 2 O-producing Nitrosospira under urea fertilization. Further, we suggest that DMPP is a more effective NI than DCD in tropical soil under sugarcane. © 2019 The Authors.

However, it has been difficult to control and fully understand this process, mainly due to the slow-growing nature of the AOM-mediating microorganisms. A biotrickling filter (BTF) operating at ambient pressure and temperature was used to enrich microorganisms from a deep-sea anaerobic methane-oxidizing sediment (Alpha Mound, Gulf of Cadiz). Different sulfur compounds namely, sulfate, elemental sulfur, and thiosulfate were used as electron acceptors to understand their effects on the AOM, sulfate reduction rates, and the microbial community distribution. The highest AOM and sulfate reduction rates were obtained in the BTF fed with thiosulfate as the electron acceptor (∼0.4 mmol/[L·day]). Use of thiosulfate triggered the enrichment of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in the BTF, whereas the highest number of anaerobic methanotrophs (ANME) was visualized in the sulfate-fed BTF (ANME-2 43% of the total visualized archaea), where sulfate was reduced at a maximum rate of 0.3 mmol/[L·day]. This study shows that ANME and SRB obtained from deep-sea conditions (528 m below sea level) can be enriched in a BTF at ambient pressure and temperature with a relatively short start-up time (42 days). © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.","anaerobic methanotrophs; anaerobic oxidation of methane; biotrickling filter; deep-sea sediment; sulfate reduction; sulfate-reducing bacteria","Anoxic sediments; Bacteria; Biofilters; Electrons; Methane; Passive filters; Sea level; Sulfur determination; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Bio-trickling filters; Deep sea sediment; Methanotrophs; Sulfate reducing bacteria; Sulfate reduction; Sulfur compounds; methane; RNA 16S; sea water; sulfate; sulfur; sulfur derivative; thiosulfate; anaerobic metabolism; Article; biomass; controlled study; deep sea; desulfurization; electric potential; electron transport; methanotroph; microbial community; nonhuman; publishing; reduction (chemistry); sulfate reducing bacterium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064491748

Although the GTG program has been demonstrated to affect ecosystem services in the revegetated areas, its impacts on regional climate are seldom reported and poorly understood. Therefore, our study examined the impacts of revegetation owing to the GTG program on summer climate in the Loess Plateau, by incorporating near real-time remotely sensed land use/land cover data and vegetation characteristics of 2001 and 2010 into a coupled land-atmosphere model. From 2001 to 2010, a considerable portion of croplands was converted to forests and grasslands, with vegetation fraction and LAI increasing while surface albedo decreasing throughout the Loess Plateau. Compared with those from 2001, simulation results from 2010 indicated lowered 2-m air temperature in summer, with the magnitude of reduction in nighttime minimum (as high as 0.8–1.0 ℃) greater than that in daytime maximum (generally restricted to 0.4 ℃). The concurrent decrease in summertime 2-m specific humidity further led to widespread reduction of near-surface heat content (i.e., moist enthalpy). Summer precipitation decreased in northern Shanxi province and western Loess Plateau (up to 1.0–1.4 mm/day) while increasing in southeastern Loess Plateau (between 1.0–2.0 mm/day). Our findings underscore that vegetation restoration has exerted strong influences on regional climate, and provide useful information for the sustainable implementation of the GTG program. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Afforestation; Land use/land cover; Land-atmosphere interaction; The Grain to Green program; Vegetation characteristics; WRF","afforestation; albedo; biophysics; ecosystem service; environmental policy; environmental restoration; land cover; land use; land-atmosphere interaction; regional climate; remote sensing; revegetation; vegetation; weather forecasting; China; Loess Plateau; Shanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060286793

Using the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification scheme, combined with the factors of land surface temperature (LST), building age (BA), and housing price (HP), and the normalized values of which represent heat exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability, respectively, this paper investigates a practical method for assessing the heat vulnerability of different LCZ classes in the old areas of a Chinese megacity, taking the Yuzhong district of Chongqing city as a case study. The results reveal that the distribution of LCZ classes in this study area exhibits a typical circle-layer distribution pattern from the city center to the suburbs. Heavy industry areas are the most vulnerable, with the highest exposure to heat waves, the oldest building age and the lowest housing price. Compact class areas (compact high-rise, compact mid-rise and compact low-rise) are usually more vulnerable than open class areas (open high-rise, open mid-rise, and open low-rise) and low-rise buildings are always more susceptible to heat waves than mid-rise and high-rise buildings.

In the process manufacturing industry and building industry, a large number of energy performance certifications have been applied worldwide with remarkable results achieved in energy saving and emissions mitigation. Mechanical manufacturing industry, which is characterised as a typical discrete manufacturing having a wide distribution in operations with large consumption of energy and low efficiency, has a considerable potential of benefiting from energy saving and emissions mitigation. The objective of this paper is to perform a review and analysis of energy performance certification in the mechanical manufacturing industry for evaluating its potentials and applicability for performance enhancement. We begin with analyzing energy performance certification and research gaps to develop an operational definition of energy performance certification. The scope of energy performance certification and the method for data acquisition are reviewed. Next, we establish the classification of energy performance certification from perspectives of the energy benchmarking, rating and labelling to lay a foundation for its implementation framework and evaluating its practicability. Through the systemic review and analysis, the current state of researching energy performance certification is provided with the methods for developing energy performance certification summarized and analyzed.

Using China as an example, this study applies a zero sum gains–data envelopment analysis (ZSG-DEA) model to translate the country's reduction target into provincial goals based on the Chinese government's 2020 reduction goal. To evaluate efficiency scores, we employ the Epsilon-based measure model that combines radial and non-radial characteristics. Different from prior studies, we emphasize the effect of industrial structure on CO 2 emissions and calculate a composite gross domestic product (GDP) index as one of the output variables. By utilizing the ZSG-DEA model and based on China's provincial CO 2 emissions allowances as the input variable, the composite GDP index, and the population as the output variable, we obtain an optimal reallocation scheme after four iterations. A comparison between the results and official reduction goals shows that the government should increase CO 2 emissions allowances appropriately for most provinces with high proportions (more than 40%) of second industry increment in GDP, thereby carrying implications for policymakers. With China as an example, these findings have global implications as regards developing a more scientific allocation scheme, especially for regions with unbalanced industrial structures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Allowance allocation; Carbon dioxide emissions; Epsilon-based model; Zero sum gains–data envelopment analysis","Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Global warming; Allowance allocation; Carbon dioxide emissions; Chinese Government; Efficient allocations; Emissions reduction; Gross domestic products; Industrial structures; Zero sums; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060175352

Most notable is their photoactivity, as exemplified by their strong luminescence. Consequently, CNDs are currently being investigated as active components in photocatalysis, sensing, and optoelectronics. Charge-transfer interactions are common to all these areas. It is therefore essential to be able to fine-tune both the electronic structure of CNDs and the electronic communication in CND-based functional materials.The complex, but not completely deciphered, structure of CNDs necessitates, however, a multifaceted strategy to investigate their fundamental electronic structure and to establish structure-property relationships. Such investigations require a combination of spectroscopic methods, such as ultrafast transient absorption and fluorescence up-conversion techniques, electrochemistry, and modeling of CNDs, both in the absence and presence of other photoactive materials. Only a sound understanding of the dynamics of charge transfer, charge shift, charge transport, etc., with and without light makes much-needed improvements in, for example, photocatalytic processes, in which CNDs are used as either photosensitizers or catalytic centers, possible.This Account addresses the structural, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of CNDs, in general, and the charge-transfer chemistry of CNDs, in particular. Pressure-synthesized CNDs (pCNDs), for which citric acid and urea are used as inexpensive and biobased precursor materials, lie at the center of attention. A simple microwave-assisted thermolytic reaction, performed in sealed vessels, yields pCNDs with a fairly homogeneous size distribution of ∼1-2 nm. The narrow and excitation-independent photoluminescence of pCNDs contrasts with that seen in CNDs synthesized by other techniques, making pCNDs optimal for in-depth physicochemical analyses. The atomistic and electronic structures of CNDs were also analyzed by quantum chemical modeling approaches that led to a range of possible structures, ranging from heavily functionalized, graphene-like structures to disordered amorphous particles containing small sp 2 domains.Both the electron-accepting and -donating performances of CNDs make the charge-transfer chemistry of CNDs rather versatile. Both covalent and noncovalent synthetic approaches have been explored, resulting in architectures of various sizes. CNDs, for example, have been combined with molecular materials ranging from electron-donating porphyrins and extended tetrathiafulvalenes to electron-accepting perylendiimides, or nanocarbon materials such as polymer-wrapped single-walled carbon nanotubes. In every case, charge-separated states formed as part of the reaction cascades initiated by photoexcitation. Charge-transfer assemblies including CNDs have also played a role in technological applications: for example, a proof-of-concept dye-sensitized solar cell was designed and tested, in which CNDs were adsorbed on the surface of mesoporous anatase TiO 2 . The wide range of reported electron-donor-acceptor systems documents the versatility of CNDs as molecular building blocks, whose electronic properties are tunable for the needs of emerging technologies. © Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064488631

Location: A bioclimatic gradient from the temperate to arid zone in South Australia. Methods: We sampled plant and ant assemblages along the gradient to establish assemblage-level responses to spatial climatic change using ordinations, and then projected assemblage responses to future climate change scenarios. Results: We recorded totals of 363 plant and 227 ant species. Alignment between plant and ant communities was high, suggesting a high degree of similarity in the structuring of plant and ant communities in relation to environmental variation. However, our modelling suggested that ant assemblages were up to 7.5 times more sensitive to projected climate change than were plant assemblages, forecasting a very substantial decoupling of these assemblages under a future climate.

In the 21st century, the world faces the novel challenge of drastically reducing emissions of greenhouse gases while simultaneously expanding energy access and economic opportunity to billions of people. We examine this challenge in the electricity sector, which has been widely identified as an early candidate for deep decarbonization. In most regions, serving the projected electricity demand in 2050 while simultaneously reducing emissions will require a mix of electrical generation assets different from the current system. Although a variety of low- or zero-carbon technologies can be employed, our analysis demonstrates the potential contribution nuclear can make as a dispatchable low-carbon technology. The least-cost portfolios in our analysis include an important share for nuclear, the magnitude of which grows significantly as its cost drops. Therefore, there are strong incentives for industry to reduce the cost of new nuclear plants, and here we identify promising approaches for achieving such cost reductions. We recommend that governments create policies that equally recognize the environmental and societal benefits of all low-carbon energy technologies. Without a balanced portfolio of dispatchable and variable energy sources, the cost and difficulty of achieving decarbonization targets increases significantly. © 2003-2012 IEEE.",,"Carbon; Cost reduction; Decarbonization; Emission control; Environmental technology; Greenhouse gases; Nuclear energy; Economic opportunities; Electrical generation; Electricity demands; Future of nuclear energy; Low-carbon energy technology; Low-carbon technologies; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Reducing emissions; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062060295

The Swiss Energy Strategy aims at generating roughly one-third of the current electricity demand through intermittent renewables by 2050. This raises the need for flexible on-demand power production capabilities to balance the fluctuating generation. Next to batteries or pumped-storage hydroelectricity, decentralized gas-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plants have fast ramp-up times and can thus be used to balance the fluctuating production. Using biogas as fuel for the CHP plants minimizes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, biomass is subject to spatio-temporal variation that can limit the available fuel. In this work, a framework of geographic information system (GIS)-based models to assess the spatio-temporal potential of domestic biogas to balance fluctuating renewable energy production is proposed. Using this framework, the spatio-temporal biogas that can be fed into the gas grid is modeled to be 18.4PJ. By comparing this potential with the spatio-temporal residential heat demand and rooftop PV potential, we identify the spatio-temporal balancing potential of decentralized CHP plants in Switzerland.

Previous studies emphasized the impact of errors in simulated winds and vertical mixing in the planetary boundary layer, whereas the potential importance of releasing emissions not only at the surface but distributing them in the vertical was largely neglected. Accounting for elevated emissions may be critical, since more than 50% of CO2 in Europe is emitted by large point sources such as power plants and industrial facilities. In this study, we conduct high-resolution atmospheric simulations of CO2 with the mesoscale Consortium for Small-scale Modeling model extended with a module for the simulation of greenhouse gases (COSMO-GHG) over a domain covering the city of Berlin and several coalfired power plants in eastern Germany, Poland and Czech Republic. By including separate tracers for anthropogenic CO2 emitted only at the surface or according to realistic, sourcedependent profiles, we find that releasing CO2 only at the surface overestimates near-surface CO2 concentrations in the afternoon on average by 14% in summer and 43% in winter over the selected model domain. Differences in columnaveraged dry air mole XCO2 fractions are smaller, between 5%in winter and 8%in summer, suggesting smaller yet nonnegligible sensitivities for inversion modeling studies assimilating satellite rather than surface observations. The results suggest that the traditional approach of emitting CO2 only at the surface is problematic and that a proper allocation of emissions in the vertical deserves as much attention as an accurate simulation of atmospheric transport. © 2019 Author(s).

Although the concept of resilience has been investigated fromdifferent perspectives, the lack of understanding of its conceptual comprehensive aspects presents strong limitations for spatial planning and for the adoption of policies and programs for its measurement and achievement. In this paper, we refer to ""territorial resilience"" as an emerging concept capable of aiding the decision-making process of identifying vulnerabilities and improving the transformation of socio-ecological and technological systems (SETSs). Here,we explore the epistemology of resilience, reviewing the origins and the evolution of this term, providing evidence on how this conceptual umbrella is used by different disciplines to tackle problem-solving that arises from disaster management and command-control practices to augment the robustness. Assuming the SETSs paradigm, the seismic and structural engineering, social sciences and history, urban planning and climatology perspectives intersects providing different analytical levels of resilience, including vulnerability and patrimony from a community and cultural perspective. We conclude that territorial resilience surpasses the analytical barriers between different disciplines, providing a useful concept related to complex problem-solving phenomena for land use planning, opening a new research question: how can territorial resilience be measured, acknowledging different units and levels of analysis aiding decision-making in spatial plans and projects? In attempting to understand a resilient system, quantitative and qualitative measurements are crucial to supporting planning decisions. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptation; Co-evolution; Interdisciplinary; Resilience; Spatial planning; Transformation","adaptive management; conceptual framework; decision making; disaster management; environmental policy; holistic approach; interdisciplinary approach; land use planning; natural disaster; project management; spatial planning; technology adoption; transformation; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066833045

When expanding generating capacity, candidate technologies can be evaluated against criteria such as these. Alternatively, it may be possible to pair technologies in such a way that the combination addresses these criteria better than either technology individually. One such approach is to pair concentrated solar power and natural gas combined cycle units. This paper analyzes how an integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC) facility could fare in the larger US electricity production market, although the results are generalizable to a wider range of technologies. Modeling results suggest that a critical consideration is the extent to which ISCC qualifies as being renewable under state-level renewable portfolio standards (RPSs). The technology would be utilized at a higher level if it fully satisfies an RPS; however, even if the technology does not satisfy an RPS, it would be market-competitive if optimistic goals for capital cost and avoided natural gas purchases are met. Furthermore, if used in parts of the country with strong solar resources, ISCC could produce as much as 14% of national electricity generation in 2050. Whether adoption of ISCC leads to reduced air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions is dependent on the technologies, it displaces. Under default assumptions, the new ISCC capacity primarily displaces renewable and natural gas facilities as opposed to facilities with higher air-pollutant emissions. Thus, the air pollution benefits of ISCC may be limited.

As this share increases, CE producers are becoming increasingly effective political actors. The traditional political privilege enjoyed by incumbent electricity producers is challenged by CE actors as they shift control over jobs, growth and energy supplies. Political struggles between competing interests are increasing. However, the nature and extent of these power shifts (e.g., different policy outputs, changing political discourse), and their consequences for political systems and their outcomes (e.g., more democratic policy processes, action on climate) are poorly understood. This paper develops and tests an approach for understanding how decentralized energy transitions are reshaping political power structures, and consequent policy outcomes. Using an approach grounded in theory on power, policy making, transitions, and institutions, the paper develops a set of power queries that help reveal how political power is changing, and constraining or enabling transitions. The framework is tested through a case of political conflict over electricity in Ontario, Canada. Findings reveal a locked-in system, but also emergent transition pathways. The framework establishes a useful tool to address pressing questions about the socioeconomic and political impacts of the changing energy landscape. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Community energy; Decentralization; Energy transition; Politics; Power",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058434902

But it is difficult to find evidence of how citizen science influences climate adaptation governance. The citizen science field lacks the assessment frameworks and empirical studies for understanding impacts on citizen scientists’ common adaptive capacities for supporting social processes of adaptation. In addressing this gap, this paper describes a citizen science initiative carried out with communities in northeast Bangladesh, and assesses how it contributed to local governance capacity for climate adaptation. In doing so, it develops and tests a novel framework that assesses citizen science's contributions a high-quality knowledge base, and to five different capital stocks. The assessment saw high increases in citizen scientists’ human capital relative to their awareness and understanding of local rainfall; learning that they applied in adaptive practices at work and at home, and local leadership. There were also high increases in social capital among citizen scientists, but more moderate increases in technological and resource capital, and in political capital. There was some evidence of the citizen science being used to support public adaptation decision-making.

We find that, coherent with increasing air temperature, there is an intensification of the hydrological cycle, evident from increases in humidity, precipitation, river discharge, glacier equilibrium line altitude and land ice wastage. Downward trends continue in sea ice thickness (and extent) and spring snow cover extent and duration, while near-surface permafrost continues to warm. Several of the climate indicators exhibit a significant statistical correlation with air temperature or precipitation, reinforcing the notion that increasing air temperatures and precipitation are drivers of major changes in various components of the Arctic system. To progress beyond a presentation of the Arctic physical climate changes, we find a correspondence between air temperature and biophysical indicators such as tundra biomass and identify numerous biophysical disruptions with cascading effects throughout the trophic levels. These include: increased delivery of organic matter and nutrients to Arctic near-coastal zones; condensed flowering and pollination plant species periods; timing mismatch between plant flowering and pollinators; increased plant vulnerability to insect disturbance; increased shrub biomass; increased ignition of wildfires; increased growing season CO2 uptake, with counterbalancing increases in shoulder season and winter CO2 emissions; increased carbon cycling, regulated by local hydrology and permafrost thaw; conversion between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; and shifting animal distribution and demographics. The Arctic biophysical system is now clearly trending away from its 20th Century state and into an unprecedented state, with implications not only within but beyond the Arctic.

We found 19,000 glaciers in 46 sites located all over the world. We analyze their recent evolution, current state, and project their mass change over the 21st century. Our results are based on a comprehensive review of the literature as well as a state-of-the-art glaciological model for computing glacier responses up to 2100. Illustrating the strong influence of CO2 emission scenarios and human actions on future ice loss magnitude, we project the wastage of 33% to 60% of the 2017 cumulative ice volume of 12,000 km3 of World Heritage glaciers by 2100. Furthermore, we expect complete glacier extinction in 8 to 21 of the investigated World Heritage sites until the end of the century, depending on the climate scenario.

Larger foraminiferal assemblages from clasts and beds record two main resedimented carbonate microfacies: a dominant Eoconuloides–Helicostegina–Eulinderina facies from the middle Eocene (Lutetian) and a subordinate Lepidocyclina tobleri panamensis–Lepidocyclina (Nephrolepidina) chaperi facies from the upper Eocene (uppermost Bartonian–Priabonian). Both facies consist of abundant shallow-marine benthic carbonate, volcaniclastic, and planktic materials that were re-deposited by gravity flows into a deeper-marine forearc basin. The accessory volcaniclastic grain assemblages are bimodal in composition, comprising differentiated rock and ejecta fragments derived from explosive arc volcanism in addition to basaltic grain contributions from the volcanic forearc basement. The source of the carbonate materials was likely the Fila de Cal carbonate platform presently located in the adjoining arc-ward region of the Fila Costeña thrust belt. Strong biostratigraphic correlations with platform carbonate and other similar forearc successions bearing resedimented limestones reveal not only a provenance from carbonate environments within the arc but they also record coeval events of resedimentation along a continuous deep-marine forearc slope. The sedimentary sequence was deformed as result of coeval basaltic activity and fault tectonics. There is no evidence of accumulation by accretionary processes in the carbonate deposits studied. The findings indicate that the basement of the Osa Peninsula and its sedimentary cover probably formed part of the Costa Rican forearc that was uplifted and deformed in response to basaltic volcanic activity and subsequent Cocos Ridge subduction. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Costa Rica; Eocene; Forearc; Larger benthic foraminifera; Osa Peninsula","benthic foraminifera; Eocene; explosive volcanism; forearc basin; limestone; sedimentation; tectonic setting; Costa Rica; Osa Peninsula; Puntarenas; Foraminifera; Lepidocyclina; Osa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060914262

Farm-oriented spending in both regions continues to be largely directed to farm income support – the farm safety net in the US and direct payments in the EU. Policy changes in the US have aimed to increase the likelihood that financial support will be provided to farmers. The EU, at least in the rhetorical justification for its legal proposal, gives greater priority to incentivising farmers to adopt practices friendlier to the environment and is more focused on climate mitigation and adaptation.

To investigate the inter-annual trends of the long-distance transport of air pollutants from China to South Korea, multi-year trend analysis was carried out for Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD, as a proxy of particulate matter), and CO (a water-insoluble air pollutant) and SO2 (a partially water-soluble air pollutant), over three regions in Northeast Asia. Air pollutants are typically long-range transported from the highly polluted parts of China to South Korea through the Yellow Sea. Taking advantage of this geographical merit, we carried out the multi-year trend analysis with a special focus on the Yellow Sea region. Decreasing trends of about 5–10%, 13–17% and 55–61% during the last decade were observed in surface CO, AOD and tropospheric SO2 columns over the North China Plain (NCP), Yellow Sea (YS), and South Korea (SK), respectively. Such decreasing trends were also found consistently during the last three, five, and seven years, indicating that the changes in pollution levels are likely in response to recent policy measures taken by the Chinese and Korean governments to improve air quality over the regions. Due to these efforts, the amounts of air pollutants transported from China to South Korea are expected to decrease in future years, to the likely rates of 1.50 ppb yr−1, 0.05 DU yr−1, and 0.56 μg m−3 yr−1 over the YS region for CO, SO2, and PM2.5, respectively. Given the ambitious plans recently announced by the Chinese government for the 21st meeting of Conference of Parties (COP21) and its co-control effects, the suggested percentage rates may even be conservative numbers. This analysis is expected to provide South Korean policymakers with valuable information to establish new air pollution policies in South Korea. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AOD; CO; COP21; North China plain; Trans-boundary transport; Yellow sea","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Cobalt; Pollution control; Aerosol optical depths; COP21; Implications for futures; Long-distance transport; North China Plain; Trans-boundary; Trans-boundary air pollutions; Yellow sea; Water pollution; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; future prospect; marine atmosphere; optical depth; policy approach; pollutant transport; pollution policy; transboundary pollution; air pollutant; air quality; article; China; government; South Korea; Yellow Sea; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; Asia; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; South Korea; statistics and numerical data; China; Pacific Ocean; South Korea; Yellow Sea; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asia; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Republic of Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060926933

Due to technological advances in electronics and bidirectional power inverters, EV is no longer viewed as just transportation tools, but in addition, could serve as electric storage units for the grid by supplying ancillary services. The concept of vehicle to grid (V2G) no longer a fiction, but rather a reality. Numerous scientific papers and research activities are addressing the V2G via plug-in cable energy transfer. However, the tedious and inconvenient aspects of cable based power transfer hinder some users and may hinder the development of the EVs, thus wireless charging is seen as a key enabling technology to increase the adoption of electric vehicles. This paper outlines the state of the arte in the wireless V2G concept, presenting its potential convenient electricity markets and the existing bidirectional wireless power transfer technology for EVs. Furthermore, it presents an outlook on some challenges to overcome for high efficiency, and faster deployment of this technology. © 2019 IEEE.","Bidirectional power transfer; EV; Lithium-ion battery; Transportation grid; Wireless charger; Wireless V2G","Cables; Electric power transmission networks; Electric tools; Embedded systems; Energy transfer; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Inductive power transmission; Intelligent systems; Lithium-ion batteries; Vehicle-to-grid; Vehicles; Electrochemical batteries; Enabling technologies; Power transfers; Research activities; Technological advances; Transportation sector; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Wireless power transfer; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067459975

Monitoring of LIB health state parameters, calculation of additional LIB operating parameters, and the fulfillment of safety requirements are provided through battery management systems. Prediction of remaining useful lifetime (RUL) of LIB and state-of-health (SoH) estimation are identified as still challenging and not completely solved tasks. In this contribution, previous works on RUL/SoH estimation, mainly relied on modeling of underlying electrochemical processes inside LIB, are compared with newly developed approach. The proposed approach utilizes acoustic emission measurements for LIB aging indicators estimation. Developed model for RUL estimation is closely related to frequency spectrum analysis of captured acoustic emission (AE) signal. Features selected from AE measurements are considered as model inputs. The novelty of this approach is the opportunity to estimate RUL/SoH of LIB without necessity to capture some intermediate variables, only indirectly related to RUL/SoH (charging/discharging currents, temperature, and similar). The proposed approach provides the possibility to obtain reliable information about current RUL/SoH without the knowledge about underlying physical processes occurred in LIB. Experimental data sets gathered from LIB aging tests are used for model establishment, training, and validation. The experimental results demonstrate the applicability of the novel approach. © 2019 by ASME.",,"Acoustic emission testing; Battery management systems; Digital storage; Frequency estimation; Hybrid vehicles; Spectrum analysis; Wind turbines; Acoustic emission measurement; Acoustic emission signal; Electrochemical process; Frequency spectrum analysis; Health state parameters; High energy densities; Operating parameters; Wind turbine systems; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059977832

Adoption of climate change adaptation strategies that increase agricultural productivity and at the same time building farmers’ resilience capacity has become a top policy priority in SSA. In this study, we investigate how maize-dependent smallholders in Ethiopia adapt to climate change. Both household and plot-level data were collected, and subsequently analysed by a multivariate probit regression model. Results show that most climate change adaptation strategies implemented by maize-dependent smallholders, are complementary. Combining conservation tillage, mixed maize-legume cropping and terracing along with the use of drought-resistant maize varieties allows farmers to increase productivity while building resilience to climate change more than a subset of these strategies. Findings indicate that the likelihood of adopting soil and water conservation practices, drought-resistant maize varieties and chemical fertilizers significantly increase among young and male-headed households as well as farmers having confidence in extension agents and membership in local organisations. Hence, policies should aim at further building agricultural extension agents’ capacity by providing effective and continuous education and training on climate change impacts and responses. Promoting family ties and household memberships in local organisations through facilitating mutual cooperation and communication among farming communities would help to foster adoption of climate change adaptation strategies. © 2018","Africa; Drought stress; Erratic rainfall; Multivariate probit model; Plot tenure security; Productivity; Resilience","Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054183542

It explores attributes of resilience from this bottom-up perspective to assess its predictors and alignment with food security, as a proxy of well-being.

Besides mitigation, adaptation is considered as an essential strategy for reducing the severity and cost of climate change impacts given the fact that additional future climate change is considered as being inevitable. In this paper, we analyze household socio-economic determinants of climate change adaptation and their policy implications. A survey of 130 farmers in four farm communities in Cameroon was conducted to capture the determinants of farmers' adaptation to climate change. We employed the binary Logistic regression model to assess the determinants of climate adaptation. Results reveal that in the midst of climate change, 78.33% of farmers have adopted rainfall-related adaptation while 63.33% have resorted to temperature-related adaptation. Based on the binary logistic regression, access to road, access to non-farm income source, and membership of farmers' groups were significant determinants for the adoption of temperature-related adaptation options. Furthermore, access to improved seeds was found to be the lone significant determinant for the adoption of rainfall-related adaptation options. All in all, much is required to strengthen farmers' adaptive capacity and increase the range of adaptation options undertaken. As such, policies geared towards building farmers' resilience should effectively capture the following tri-factors: provision of access roads linking farm communities to nearby urban centres, upscaling institutional interventions with regards to providing high quality and resistant seeds to farmers, and incentivizing farmers to create or join social groups in order to facilitate adaptation uptake. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptation strategies; Climate change; Determinants; Policy implications; Rural Cameroon","climate change; nature-society relations; paradigm shift; rainfall; rural area; rural policy; strategic approach; urban population; Cameroon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064086025

Although coal-based power generation is apparently easier for coal-rich South Africa, an increasing share of large-scale renewable energy (solar and wind) is mandated due to environmental concerns. In this work, prospect of two distributed renewable resources (farm manure and solar radiation) for a decentralized renewable energy (DRE) program targeting quality energy access for a non-electrified population, was investigated based on ground-level assessments. The potential demands of electrical and thermal energy were assessed and compared to the anticipated decentralized generation of biogas and solar photovoltaic power for all nine provinces of South Africa. In all provinces, except Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, farm manure could support the thermal energy requirements for cooking and water and space heating of non-electrified households. Further, farm manure could support the combined thermal and electrical loads of Western Cape and Free State. Similarly, decentralized solar photovoltaic power can support electrical loads in all provinces. A well-planned DRE program integrated with the development of indigenous technologies and local enterprises would benefit the economically and socially vulnerable households of South Africa, apart from fulfilling the additional energy demand and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Decentralized renewable energy; Energy access; Household energy; Informal dwelling; Non-electrified households; South Africa","Coal; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Manures; Petroleum prospecting; Photovoltaic cells; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Thermal energy; Thermography (temperature measurement); Energy access; Household energy; Informal dwelling; Non-electrified households; Renewable energies; South Africa; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059519264

The efficiency of this transfer has profound implications for the nature and scale of geochemical heterogeneities in Earth’s deep mantle and shallow crustal reservoirs, as well as Earth’s oxidation state. However, the proportions of volatiles released from the forearc and backarc are not well constrained compared to fluxes from the volcanic arc front. Here we use helium and carbon isotope data from deeply sourced springs along two cross-arc transects to show that about 91 per cent of carbon released from the slab and mantle beneath the Costa Rican forearc is sequestered within the crust by calcite deposition. Around an additional three per cent is incorporated into the biomass through microbial chemolithoautotrophy, whereby microbes assimilate inorganic carbon into biomass. We estimate that between 1.2 × 108 and 1.3 × 1010 moles of carbon dioxide per year are released from the slab beneath the forearc, and thus up to about 19 per cent less carbon is being transferred into Earth’s deep mantle than previously estimated. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon; carbon dioxide; helium; inorganic compound; carbon dioxide; backarc basin; calcite; carbon isotope; carbon sink; continental crust; convergent margin; depositional environment; forearc basin; geochemical survey; helium; inorganic carbon; mantle chemistry; oceanic crust; volatile substance; Article; biomass; carbon sink; chemical composition; chemolithoautotroph; concentration (parameter); mantle; meteorological phenomena; precipitation; priority journal; recycling; surface property; synthesis; temperature; carbon sequestration; chemistry; Costa Rica; microbiology; sediment; Costa Rica; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Isotopes; Carbon Sequestration; Costa Rica; Geologic Sediments; Helium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065290071

Matsum. & Nakai (Cucurbitales: Cucurbitaceae), is one the 5 most-consumed fresh fruits in the world. The thrips Frankliniella schultzei (Trybom) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) is an important pest of watermelon crops in tropical regions. Among the principal factors that regulate pest populations in crops are phenological stage of the host plant, weather and climate, and natural enemies. Thus, knowledge of such factors may allow the prediction of the risk of pest damage to such crops. The objective of this study was to identify factors that drive F. schultzei population densities in watermelon crops. During 2014 and 2015, we evaluated the effect of abiotic (weather) and biotic (phenological stage of leaves, and occurrence of natural enemies) factors on F. schultzei population densities on watermelon commercial crops. Frankliniella schultzei densities were higher in dry periods with more intense winds. Insect pest density was higher on younger leaves of plants in the vegetative stage. Frankliniella schultzei preferred to attack younger leaves of the plant located at the apex of the branches. The results obtained in this work suggest that the population growth of F. schultzei in watermelon crops is higher in periods of low rainfall. The population densities of F. schultzei depend on the phenological stage of plants, weather, and populations of natural enemies. Farmers should seek to preserve the populations of Chrysoperla sp. (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), which are an important natural enemy of F. schultzei. © 2019 Florida Entomological Society.

The compression moulding manufacturing process and CAE optimisation are unique and ground-breaking for this product and are designed to allow high volume manufacture of approx. 30,000 vehicles per year. The manufacturing techniques employed allow for multi-material construction within a five minute cycle time to make the process viable for volume manufacture. The complexities of the design lie in the areas of manufacturing, CAE prediction and highly specialised design methods. It is a well-known fact that the performance of a composite part is primarily determined by the way it is manufactured. The design team were able to use their extensive knowledge of material behaviour and state of the art manufacturing cells to enable a component that meets the required functional requirements. The CAE optimisation techniques developed during the project made a significant contribution to the project by bypassing a traditional approach and also reducing the amount of physical testing required. This was required to understand the failure mechanisms of the sheer number of combinations of fibre orientations that make the predictive analysis methods viable for a topology efficient design. A compression moulding manufacturing technology was developed capable of mass manufacturing the high strength, stiff and complex shaped suspension knuckle. The processing technology is fully automated, achieving a cycle time below 5 minutes. © 2019 Ford Motor Company.

The intent of our opinion piece is to provide a perspective on how well plants and ecosystems sequester carbon. The ability of individual plants and ecosystems to mine carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as defined by rates and cumulative amounts, is limited by laws of physics and ecological principles. Consequently, the rates and amount of net carbon uptake are slow and low compared to the rates and amounts of carbon dioxide we release by fossil fuels combustion. Managing ecosystems to sequester carbon can also cause unintended consequences to arise. In this paper, we articulate a series of key take-home points. First, the potential amount of carbon an ecosystem can assimilate on an annual basis scales with absorbed sunlight, which varies with latitude, leaf area index and available water. Second, efforts to improve photosynthesis will come with the cost of more respiration. Third, the rates and amount of net carbon uptake are relatively slow and low, compared to the rates and amounts and rates of carbon dioxide we release by fossil fuels combustion. Fourth, huge amounts of land area for ecosystems will be needed to be an effective carbon sink to mitigate anthropogenic carbon emissions. Fifth, the effectiveness of using this land as a carbon sink will depend on its ability to remain as a permanent carbon sink.

Given the different types of power customers (e.g., residential, commercial and industrial), this work develops a systematic and straightforward framework for the optimal planning of urban solar/wind/biomass (/natural gas) systems at neighbourhood scale using the actual real-time hourly electric loads. In achieving this objective, we defined three power scenarios (i) 100% natural gas; (ii) natural gas and renewables; (iii) 100% renewables (e.g., solar/wind/biomass) and identified the hybrid systems with the least NPC for each of the three power scenarios. Our results indicate that providing per kilowatt-hour renewable electricity to the industrial sector (0.385 USD/kWh) costs 4% less than the commercial (0.399 USD/kWh) and about 5% less than the residential sector (0.418 USD/kWh) at neighbourhood scales. The more significant cost of electricity (COE) of the residential system is primarily due to the greater batteries to solar PV fractions. Also, COE of solar/wind/biomass plant showed to be three times less than the equivalent solar/wind power system. Likewise, by integrating a low-emission natural gas (NG) generator to the hybrid solar/wind/biomass plant, the system's COE reduced by 30% while resulting in close to three order-of-magnitude higher annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To address the model accuracy concerning the uncertainty and variations associated with input variables, we further conducted the sensitivity analysis of the systems’ COE address the model accuracy concerning the uncertainty and variations associated with input variables by changes in the discount rate and capital cost of the PV panels and batteries. As a result, systems’ COE was detected to be more sensitive to the capital cost of batteries than solar panels. This study can help decision-makers in developing more effective policies and mechanisms to support the urban hybrid renewable energy systems. © 2019","City of Victoria; Hybrid renewable power system; Load patterns; Neighborhood scales; Urban electrification","Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Decision making; Electric batteries; Electric utilities; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Hybrid systems; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Photovoltaic cells; Real time systems; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; City of Victoria; Load patterns; Neighborhood scales; Renewable power systems; Urban electrification; Electric power system planning; alternative energy; electrical power; electricity industry; electrification; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; natural gas; neighborhood; strategic approach; urban area; Australia; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061344315

Obviously, membrane oxidation is expected to be critically dependent on the distribution and concentration of oxygen in the membrane. Here, we combined theoretical and experimental methods to investigate oxygen partition and distribution in lipid membranes of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) in a temperature range between 298 and 323 K, specifically focusing on the changes caused by the lipid phase and phase transition. Even though oxygen is known to be more concentrated in the center of fluid phase membranes than on the headgroup regions, the distribution profile of oxygen inside gel-phase bilayers remained to be determined. Molecular dynamics simulations now show that the distribution of oxygen inside DPPC bilayers dramatically changes upon crossing the main transition temperature, with oxygen being nearly depleted halfway from the headgroups to the membrane center below the transition temperature. In a parallel approach, singlet oxygen luminescence emission measurements employing the photosensitizer Pheophorbide-a (Pheo) confirmed the differences in oxygen distribution and concentration profiles between gel- and fluid-phase membranes, revealing changes in the microenvironment of the embedded photosensitizer. Our results also reveal that excited triplet state lifetime, as it can be determined from the singlet oxygen luminescence kinetics, is a useful probe to assess oxygen distribution in lipid membranes with distinct lipid compositions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Excited triplet state; Lipid membrane phase; Oxygen; Photosensitization; Singlet oxygen","dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine; oxygen; pheophorbide; singlet oxygen; 1,2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine; oxygen; phosphatidylcholine; Article; controlled study; lipid analysis; lipid bilayer; lipid composition; lipid membrane; microenvironment; molecular dynamics; oxygen concentration; phase transition; photosensitization; physical chemistry; priority journal; chemical model; chemistry; kinetics; molecular dynamics; Kinetics; Lipid Bilayers; Models, Chemical; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Oxygen; Phosphatidylcholines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061213436

In this study, the injection of CO2 in “huff-n-puff” (HnP) mode and its potential advantages of removing accumulated gas-condensates are thoroughly investigated. A compositional simulator was used to capture the near wellbore fluid flow physics causing the condensate dropout under various wellbore/field operational conditions. The severity of condensate blockage was evaluated using detailed sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of various key static and dynamic influencing parameters such as porosity, permeability, fluid composition, boundary flux, and flowing bottomhole pressure. Under various scenarios of condensate blockage, studies related to effectiveness and optimization of CO2 slug-size, soaking-time, and flowback rate are conducted. As a proof of concept, it is observed that miscibility of CO2 in condensates, and near wellbore re-vaporization of accumulated liquids, are two of the main mechanisms of removing the condensate blockage. Because of these two mechanisms an improvement in effective permeability to gas can be expected. It is also concluded that CO2 is relatively more effective in removing near wellbore condensates as compared to far-field regions. Finally, based on various optimization analyses, a viable approach to adopt HnP CO2 injection scheme is suggested. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 injection; Condensate blockage; Condensate removal; Gas-condensate; Huff-n-Puff; Miscible process","Boreholes; Bottom hole pressure; Carbon dioxide; Flow of fluids; Gas permeability; Gases; Oil field equipment; Petroleum reservoirs; Uncertainty analysis; Compositional simulators; Condensate blockages; Condensate removal; Effective permeability; Huff-n-Puff; Influencing parameters; Operational conditions; Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis; Gas condensates; carbon dioxide; condensate; gas production; gas well; hydrocarbon reservoir; permeability; porosity; simulation; Neptunia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060104845

The tailoring of these novel more conjugated and polarized molecules was based on the Donor-Acceptor (D-A) approach. The three new designed binary molecular hybrids were obtained by direct oxidative electrocopolymerization with the well-known electron-donating (D) EDOT (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and the electron-acceptor unit (A) ThCO-NHAr. This bis-functionalized molecular block was synthesized between the β-carboxythiophene (ThCO) with electron-donating and fluorescent aromatic amines (naphthylamine (NFT), aminofluorene (FLU) and aminodibenzofuran (DBF)). These monomers were submitted to copolymerization and three novel copolymers – PEDOT-co-2NFT, PEDOT-co-FLU and PEDOT-co-DBF – were prepared and a system block with the general structure [(EDOT) n -(ThCO-NHAr) m ] can be proposed.

These anthropogenic (human made) clouds, known as condensation trails or ""contrails,"" provide a net global warming effect. Although they block approximately 23% of the incoming shortwave radiation, they also reflect back to Earth approximately 33% of outgoing longwave radiation. Although the contrails generate only 2% of total anthropogenic radiative forcing they affect global warming immediately (unlike CO2 that affects global warning in 20-40 years). In this way contrails could be used to reduce global warming now to buy-time for CO2 mitigation initiatives to take effect. For this reason it is necessary to inventory contrails in the National Airspace System (NAS).This paper provides an inventory of contrails for the U.S. NAS for 2015. The analysis is based on publicly available weather data, flight surveillance track data, models of contrail formation and persistence, and models of net radiative forcing. During this period an average flight schedule of 24,095 flights in 365 historic weather days generated a daily average of 83.7K nautical miles of contrails. The contrails resulted in an estimated daily net radiative forcing of +7.08 mW/m2. The diurnal effect was minimal, but the seasonal effect was significant: 63% of the total Contrail Along Track Distance was generated from June to September. Furthermore, less than 25% of the flights generated contrails on a given day and the most of the contrails are generated in the south-eastern United States. The implications of these results for contrail mitigation are discussed. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Atmospheric radiation; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Monitoring; Contrail formation; Flight schedules; Global warnings; National airspace system; Outgoing longwave radiation; Radiative forcings; Seasonal effects; Short-wave radiation; Exhaust gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068075935

The self‐asserting move of cities on the global level has been accompanied by a rhetoric according to which States would have failed to live up to their responsibilities with respect to the fight against climate change. Instead, cities would be well‐positioned to fill this governance gap, in particular through global networks such as ICLEI and C40. This contribution discusses how this narrative is affected by the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on climate change. This was seen as a milestone for the global climate change regime. The Paris Agreement and the decision adopting it are also evidence for a cautious embrace of the importance of cities and other subnational authorities in this field. Yet, new questions arise after the announcement by the United States of their intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. This has generated more attention than ever for what cities and other subnational authorities can do in this field. At the same time, the struggle between the US federal executive and US cities is emblematic for a wider debate on the future of the international (legal) order: how will the balance between States as central actors of the international system on the one hand and an increasingly assertive league of cities and subnational authorities be struck?. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, 9600 Garsington Road, Oxford OX4 2DQ, UK and 350 Main Street, Malden, MA 02148, USA.",,"climate change; environmental legislation; global change; governance approach; international agreement; international law; state role; urban area; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057059865

This study evaluates the economic and environmental feasibility of a farm-scale anaerobic digestion (AD) combined heat and power (CHP) plant co-located with a cattle feedlot. The study evaluates two different scenarios with six cases – Biomass Only (BO) scenario and Biomass and Glycerin (BG) scenario, targeting a power capacity of 950 kW e using combinations of manure, biomass, and crude glycerin. Beef cattle manure with approximately 10.15 wt% of biomass and 10 wt% of glycerin is added into the system. The internal rate of return (IRR) and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) were calculated for six cases. The IRR ranges between 3.51% and 5.57%, and the GHG emissions range between −82.6 and 498.52 g CO 2 e/kWh. Glycerin reduces the operating cost by 32%. These results indicate that AD CHP could be profitable at the farm-scale depending on various parameters. Sensitivity analysis indicates that power efficiency, operating capacity and waste generation per cattle have the strongest impact on the IRR, affecting it by over 40%, while glycerin and manure emission factors are the most important for GHG emissions affecting it by over 15%.

It solubilizes soil inaccessible organic P to readily available Pi, thus, constitutes an indirect source of phosphate for plant growth under P limitation. In exchange, P. indica derives photosynthates (carbon) from host plant cell that is necessary for its metabolic processes and survival. This fungus modifies both biosynthetic and signaling pathways of phytohormones to regulate plant growth and local/systemic immune responses. However, detailed mechanisms describing how P. indica adjusts phytohormones homeostasis to promote mutual benefits during its association with plants remain to be clarified. In addition, P. indica amends tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress factors in a wide spectrum of plant species. Although several research output has been reported to elicit the agronomic importance of P.indica, the molecular mechanisms underlying P. indica growth promoting potential remain complex and poorly defined. Thus, this review focuses on recent advances trying to unravel the molecular mechanisms responsible for the ability of P. indica to significantly promote growth, and confer stress acclimation capacity to plants grown in natural ecosystems.

There are 15 million premature births (PTB) worldwide. Air pollution in cities, primarily the result of urban traffic, greatly impacts PTBs, though there are few studies carried out on this topic at the country level. The objective of this study is to quantify the relative risks (RR) and the population attributable risk (PAR) of concentrations of contaminants on PTBs in Spain, and to analyze the most susceptible trimesters. Methods: For each province average weekly PTBs were calculated (ICD-10: P07.2-P07.3) during the period 2001–2009 as well as weekly average concentrations of PM 10 , NO 2 and O 3 . Estimations were made of RR and PAR using generalized linear models with link Poisson, controlling for the trend, seasonality, the autoregressive nature of the series and the influence of temperature in periods of heat and/or cold waves. A meta-analysis was carried out to estimate RR and PAR at the global level based on the RR obtained for each of the provinces. Results: For all of Spain, the global RR of PTB due to the impact of PM 10 was 1.071 (1.049, 1.093) and 1.150 (1.084, 1.220) for NO 2 , with no detected association for O 3 . Therefore, with decreases of 10 μg/m 3 in the concentrations of PM 10 and NO 2 , around 12.5% and 4.5% of PTBs could have been avoided respectively. Conclusions: Around 1.35% of PTBs that occurred in Spain during the study period can be attributed to air pollution. The adoption of structural measures to reduce these air pollutants should result in a decrease in the number of PTBs in Spain. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Premature births; Time series","Air pollution; Nitrogen oxides; Time series; Air pollutants; Attributable risks; Auto-regressive; Average concentration; Generalized linear model; Premature births; Relative risks; Structural measures; Time series analysis; nitric oxide; ozone; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); measurement method; meta-analysis; particulate matter; time series analysis; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; attributable risk; cold; concentration (parameter); environmental temperature; female; gestational age; heat; human; meta analysis (topic); particulate matter; population attributable risk; prematurity; prevalence; priority journal; risk assessment; seasonal variation; Spain; statistical model; time series analysis; trend study; air pollution; chemically induced; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; meta analysis; prematurity; risk; season; Spain; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Premature Birth; Prevalence; Risk; Seasons; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059625986

It is known that air pollution from road traffic (PM10, NO2) and O3 have an important impact on low birth weight (LBW), but there are few studies of this topic in Spain. The objective of this study is to determine the possible exposure windows in the gestational period in which there is greater susceptibility to urban air pollution and to quantify the relative risks (RR) and population attributable risks (PAR) of low birth weight associated with pollutant concentrations in Spain. Methods: We calculated the weekly average births with low birth weight (ICD-10: P07.0-P07.1) for each Spanish province for the period 2001–2009, using the average weekly concentrations of PM10, NO2 and O3, measured in the capital cities of the provinces. The estimation of RR and PAR were carried out using generalized linear models with link Poisson, controlling for the trend, seasonality and auto-regressive character of the series and for the influence of temperature during periods of heat waves and/or cold. Finally, a meta-analysis was used to estimate the global RR and PAR based on the RR obtained for each of the provinces. Results: The RR for the whole of Spain is 1.104 (CI95%: 1.072, 1.138) for the association between LBW and PM10, and 1.091 (CI95%: 1.059, 1.124) for the association between NO2 and LBW. Our results suggest that 5% of low birth weight births in the case of PM10 and 8% in the case of NO2 could have been avoided with a reduction of 10 μg/m3 in the concentrations of these pollutants. Conclusions: The impact of the results obtained- with 6105 cases attributable to PM10 and up to 9385 cases attributable to NO2 in a period of 9 study years- suggest the need to design structural and awareness public health measures to reduce air pollution in Spain. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Low birth weight; Times series","nitrogen dioxide; ozone; atmospheric pollution; child health; concentration (composition); health survey; national strategy; particle size; particulate matter; pollution exposure; pregnancy; time series analysis; traffic emission; weight; World Health Organization; air pollution; Article; attributable risk; gestation period; low birth weight; particulate matter; priority journal; risk factor; seasonal variation; Spain; temperature; air pollutant; air pollution; birth weight; city; environmental exposure; human; low birth weight; newborn; physiology; Spain; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Birth Weight; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060059158

To help target limited resources, municipalities have begun to conduct climate change vulnerability assessments. Many of these assessments take a holistic approach that combines both physical hazard exposure and the underlying socio-economic conditions that predispose populations to harm (i.e., social vulnerability). Given the increasing use of socio-economic conditions in climate change vulnerability analyses, this paper seeks to explore two key research questions: 1) can the spatial distribution of relative social vulnerability be estimated in six mostly urban South African municipalities, and if so, 2) how sensitive are the results to a range of subjective methodological choices often required when implementing this type of analysis. Here, social vulnerability is estimated using socio-economic and demographic data from the 2001 and 2011 South African censuses. In all six municipalities, social vulnerability varies spatially, driven primarily by differences in income, assets, wealth, employment and education, and secondarily by differences in access to services and demographics. Even though social vulnerability is estimated from a wide array of population characteristics, the spatial distribution is surprising similar to that of the percent of working-age individuals making less than 800 rand per month. Areas with high percentages of previously disadvantaged, extended family, and informal households tend to display relatively higher levels of social vulnerability. In fact, demographics (e.g., race, language, age) are often highly correlated with other characteristics that have direct ties to social vulnerability (e.g., income, employment, education). The spatial patterns of relative social vulnerability are similar in 2001 and 2011. However, there is some evidence social vulnerability is relatively lower in 2011. While the choice of input data and aggregation method can affect the spatial distribution of social vulnerability, the general spatial patterns appear to be fairly robust across a number of subjective choices related to methodological and aggregation approach, spatial resolution, and input data. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Mapping; Social vulnerability; South Africa; Urban municipalities","climate change; mapping; socioeconomic conditions; spatial distribution; urban area; vulnerability; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062353852

A main contributor to recent and future improvement of the internal combustion engine is the gas exchange process. By utilizing the exhaust energy in the turbine stage of an exhaust turbocharger, the pumping work can be improved resulting in significant gains of engine system efficiency. Two main aspects can be identified with regards to the turbine design that are crucial: The level of exhaust pulse separation and turbine efficiency at high pressure ratios. For a pulse-turbocharged engine both aspects need to be considered in order to gain full benefit of the exhaust energy utilization process. In this study, a novel axial turbine stage concept with divided inlets is presented. The turbine stage is part of a prototype turbocharger for a performance-optimized Scania 13 liter heavy-duty diesel engine with focus on exhaust energy utilization. The concept design makes it possible to combine both high efficiency levels and pulse separation. At ""on-engine"" operation, the turbine stage will operate at varying conditions, alternating between different states of admission. Key to the success of the concept is the turbine performance as a function of admission ratio. By extensive numerical 3D CFD simulations, overall turbine parameters, performance and detailed flow visualizations have been evaluated. As a final step, the turbine ""on-engine"" operation and performance was studied using unsteady time-dependent boundary conditions from engine simulations. The study provides key insight into to the complex nature of the flow in the turbine stage, operating state as well as quantifying the turbine performance.

RCCI engines use direct injection (DI) to introduce a high reactivity fuel into the cylinder while a lower reactivity fuel is port fuel injected (PFI). A large reactivity difference between high reactive (diesel) and low reactive (natural gas) fuels provides a strong control variable for phasing and shaping combustion heat release in RCCI engines. Two diesel fuels, a High Reactive Diesel (HRD) fuel with a cetane number (CN) of 85 and a U.S. Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) fuel with a cetane number of 49 were selected for this study. The effects of these two diesel fuels with methane as the low reactivity premixed fuel were compared in RCCI combustion mode and in Conventional Diesel Combustion (CDC) mode. The hypothesis is that using a HRD fuel in RCCI applications, with a double injection strategy, increases the reactivity of the mixture in the squish region, promoting combustion and consequently reducing unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. These emissions are generally difficult to control in RCCI combustion at high Blend Ratio (BR). In addition, a larger reactivity difference between the two fuels in RCCI applications, extends the combustion duration and reduces the Maximum Pressure Rise Rate (MPRR) and in-cylinder peak pressure. The reduction in MPRR in RCCI combustion mode makes it possible to operate the engine at higher engine loads without exceeding the MPRR mechanical constraint. The experiments were performed on a 1.9L inline 4 cylinder turbocharged compression ignition (CI) engine modified for dual fuel operation at an engine speed of 1500 RPM and 8 bar IMEP. A full factorial Design of Experiment (DOE) test program and analysis was conducted with four input variables including the diesel fuel reactivity, BR, Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) and Direct Injection (DI) strategy and at two levels of interest. This analysis was used to quantify the impact of the independent input variables on engine out emissions, performance, and MPRR mechanical constraint. Following the DOE testing and analysis the optimum injection strategy to maximize the Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) was found for both fuels by sweeping the main Start of Injection timing (SOImain). The results of the DOE analysis showed that the cetane number is the most significant factor that effects HC and CO emissions. The experimental results showed that HRD fuel provides a 2% improvement in brake-thermal efficiency, a 14 g/kW.hr reduction in HC emissions, and 0.5% lower Coefficient of Variation (COV) of Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP) compared to the baseline diesel-NG RCCI combustion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cetane number; Dual fuel engines; High reactive diesel; Natural gas; RCCI","Antiknock rating; Brakes; Carbon monoxide; Design of experiments; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Dual fuel engines; Efficiency; Engine cylinders; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fuel purification; Gas fuel analysis; Ignition; Natural gas; Software testing; Compression ignition engine; Compression-ignition engines; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Experimental investigations; High reactive diesel; Indicated mean effective pressure; RCCI; Ultra low sulfur diesel fuels; Direct injection; carbon monoxide; combustion; compression; diesel engine; efficiency measurement; emission; experimental design; experimental study; methane; natural gas; operations technology; performance assessment; pressure effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061176872

It can lead to emissions reduction and it contributes to increasing methane production. Incentive policies favour its development and for this reason, the objective of this paper is to investigate the economic performance of biomethane plants and their process monitoring by electronic systems. Mathematical modeling is here presented to study the financial feasibility of biomethane plants in function of the size (100 m3/h, 250 m3/h, 500 m3/h, 1000 m3/h), the feedstock used (organic fraction of municipal solid waste and a mixture of 30% maize and 70% manure residues on a weight basic) and the destination for final use (fed into the grid, destined for cogeneration or sold as vehicle fuel). From an economic point of view the plant performance is studied by economic tools as Net Present Value and Discounted Payback Time and the uncertainty analysis is implemented using Monte Carlo method. Moreover, from a technical point of view, process monitoring is analyzed to understand what happens in a biomethane plant and help to maintain a stable process. The results show that the profitability of biomethane plants is verified in several scenarios presenting losses only if subsidies were removed. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,"Automobile electronic equipment; Biogas; Cogeneration plants; Emission control; Fertilizers; Fuels; Functions; Monte Carlo methods; Municipal solid waste; Process control; Process monitoring; Stability criteria; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Economic performance; Electronic systems; Emissions reduction; Incentive policies; Methane production; Net present value; Organic fraction of municipal solid wastes; Plant performance; Economic analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065065257

Specific homologs of the MLO gene family are PM susceptibility factors, as their loss-of function results in durable PM resistance (mlo resistance) in several plant species. The role of MLO susceptibility genes in plant-pathogen interactions is still elusive, however it is known that they are strongly upregulated following PM infection. Results: In this study, we investigated the structure of 414 Putative Promoter Regions (PPRs) of MLO genes and highlighted motif and regulatory element patterns related to genomic relationships among species and phylogenetic distance among homologs. A TC box-like motif and a thymine-rich motif were found to be overrepresented in MLO genes transcriptionally upregulated upon infection with PM fungi. As proof of concept, we showed that the expression of a melon (Cucumis melo L.) gene enriched for the motifs above mentioned was strongly upregulated upon infection with the PM fungus Podosphaera xanthii. Conclusion: While identifying a candidate MLO susceptibility gene in melon, this study provides insight on the transcriptional control of MLO genes and indicates diagnostic features useful to identify MLO susceptibility genes across species affected by the PM disease. © 2019 The Author(s).","Cis-acting regulatory element; MLO; Motif; Powdery mildew resistance; Transcription","messenger RNA; Ascomycetes; biology; conserved sequence; Cucurbitaceae; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; molecular evolution; nucleotide motif; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; physiology; plant disease; plant gene; promoter region; upregulation; Ascomycota; Base Sequence; Computational Biology; Conserved Sequence; Cucurbitaceae; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Nucleotide Motifs; Phylogeny; Plant Diseases; Promoter Regions, Genetic; RNA, Messenger; Transcription, Genetic; Up-Regulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064406140

Climate change is caused by the rapid emission of greenhouse gases. Energy production industry is facing the challenge of providing the energy require by the rapidly expanding need of urbanized societies while reducing their emission. Clean and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy can gradually replace the energy sources with high emission. Smart cities can provide a major part of their energy requirements using these clean energy sources. The energy sector should be able to make decisions about the best scenarios for deployment and placement of clean energy production devices such as solar panels and wind turbines. In this paper,3D modelling of the urban environment is used for efficient placement of solar panels in the urban environment for optimum electricity production. Furthermore, a model for prediction of the speed of the wind using deep neural networks is proposed. The proposed solar panel placement framework is simulated on a part of the city of Tehran, Iran. The proposed wind energy production framework is simulated on 16 wind energy production stations in Iran. The experimental results show that the combined use of the solar and wind energy sources in the smart city environment can help the energy companies to be able to answer the energy demands of the cities while reducing their cost and emission. © 2019 IEEE.","3D modelling; Computer simulation; Deep learning; Renewable energy; Smart city","Computer simulation; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Energy policy; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent systems; Smart city; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Urban planning; Wind power; Wind turbines; 3D modelling; Clean energy sources; Electricity production; Energy requirements; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Solar and wind energies; Wind energy production; 3D modeling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065065181

Hydropower development in the transboundary Koshi river basin in the Himalayan region presents an intervention that can support the SDGs whilst meeting the regional commitments to the Paris agreement. This study aims to quantify the benefits of proposed water resource development projects in the transboundary basin (4 storage and 7 run-of-the-river hydropower dams) in terms of hydroelectric power generation, crop production and flood damage reduction. A hydro-economic model is constructed by soft coupling hydrological and crop growth simulation models to an economic optimization model. The model assesses the potential of the interventions to break the vicious cycle of poverty and water, food, and energy insecurity. Unlike previous studies, the model (a) incorporates the possibility of using hydropower to pump groundwater for irrigation as well as flood regulation and (b) quantifies the resilience of the estimated benefits under future climate scenarios from downscaled general circulation models affecting both river flows and crop growth. The results show significant potential economic benefits generated from electricity production, increased agricultural production, and flood damage control at the transboundary basin scale. The estimated annual benefits are around USD 2.3 billion under the baseline scenario and USD 2.4 billion under a future (RCP 4.5) climate scenario, compared to an estimated annual investment cost of USD 0.7 billion. The robustness of the estimated benefits illustrates the climate resilience of the water resource development projects. Contrary to the commonly held view that the benefits of these proposed projects are limited to hydropower, the irrigation and flood regulation benefits account for 40 percent of the total benefits. The simulated scenarios also show substantial irrigation gains from the construction of the ROR schemes, provided the generated power is also used for groundwater irrigation. The integrated modelling framework and results provide useful policy insights for evidence-based decision-making in transboundary river basins around the globe facing the challenges posed by the water-food-energy nexus. © 2019 The Authors","Climate change; Hydro-economic modelling; Koshi river basin; Water-food-energy nexus","Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Decision making; Economics; Flood damage; Groundwater; Hydroelectric power; Investments; Irrigation; Rivers; Watersheds; Agricultural productions; Electricity production; Evidence- based decisions; Future climate scenarios; General circulation model; Hydro-economic modelling; Hydro-power development; River basins; River basin projects; crop production; economic analysis; flood damage; hazard management; hydroelectric power; hydroelectric power plant; integrated approach; international agreement; Millenium Development Goal; optimization; power generation; sustainable development; transboundary cooperation; Himalayas; Kosi Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060932911

Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the socioeconomic contribution of dry forests and forest products to climate change adaptation in the Liben Woreda, Southern Oromia region of Ethiopia. Methods: For this study, an integrated qualitative and quantitative approach was used. A total of 74 households from villages in the Bulbul, Boba, and Melka-Guba kebeles were randomly selected for the household survey. Results: Results showed that 75% of the respondents in the area indicated that climate change has become their major sources of vulnerability, where drought has been manifested in the form of crops failure and massive death of livestock particularly cattle species. The main income strategies of the study households include livestock, crop, forests such as gum and resins, firewood and charcoal and non-farm activities such as in the form of petty trade, wage and aid. The average total household income was ETB 11,209.7. Out of this, dry forest income constituted 15% of the total income. In addition to using dry forests as rangeland for livestock, the communities collect wood for construction, fodder, traditional medicine, and forest food both for subsistence and for sale. On the other hand, dry forest products could be considered as less vulnerable, rather resilient livelihood strategies to climate- and environment-related risks compared to livestock and crop production such as in the face of drought periods. More than 48.6% of the households argued that the income generated from dry forests increased substantially due to increment in the level of engagement of family members in forest based income activities. On the other hand, 35.8% of the households responded that livestock production, particularly camels and goats, have been making the livelihood strategies of the respondents more resilient indicating the shift made from grazers browsers to livestock. In general trends show that, the trends of livelihood dependency on dry forest were highly increasing indicating the importance of dry forest income in responsse to frequent droughts. Conclusions: Dry forest income has been becoming crucial livelihood staretgy in response to frequent droughts in the study area and hence, it is important to improve the management of dry forests for livelihood enhancement, while also securing their long-term ecological functions. © 2019 The Author(s).","Drought; Dry forests; Livelihood strategies; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063946938

With regard to these problems, isobutanol is a higher chain alcohol with four carbons which can be derived from biomass resources and it is potential to become an alternative fuel source besides the biodiesel for a diesel engine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of isobutanol with Calophyllum inophyllum methyl ester and diesel as the ternary blend on physicochemical properties, engine performance, and emission characteristics. Five different fuel blends containing Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel and isobutanol were tested on a single-cylinder direct injection diesel engine at different engine load of brake mean effective pressure. The physicochemical properties of the fuel blends were measured and then compared with neat diesel. The results indicate that the blend containing isobutanol and CIME gives a slight increase in BSEC and EGT and a minimal drop in BTE as compared to that of neat diesel. Besides that, the tested blends show a reduction of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions. Meanwhile, all the fuel blends show a minimal increase in carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions, compared to that of neat diesel.

Composting the agricultural waste can reduce emissions and provide ‘compost’ as an organic fertilizer and soil amendment; yet, it has not been implemented at the national level. To develop a local marketing strategy for compost, this study views a need to identify farmers’ perceptions and willingness of compost production and use in agriculture and examine various socioeconomic, agricultural, and individual factors shaping them. The case of Wadi al-Far’a watershed (WFW) is investigated, where farmers practice inappropriate waste disposal and overuse of agrochemicals. A semi-structured questionnaire is administered to 409 farmers through face-to-face interviews. Descriptive statistics, bivariate analyses, Chi-square test, and binary logistic regression are used for data analysis. High acceptance level (84%) is disclosed among farmers in WFW for the hypothetical idea of producing and using compost. Farmers also have high, yet lower, willingness level (63.6%) of the more salient option of producing compost themselves and using it in agriculture.

We reconcile seemingly contradictory data—high relative taxonomic abundance of pigs and climatic conditions characterized by a general aridification trend and rainfall instability—by considering zooarchaeological assemblages from nearby sites in the context of their hydrological settings. On the basis of geoarchaeological evidence from Hartuv, we conclude that the effects of variable rainfall were mitigated by a locally marshy environment and an anthropogenic landscape feature, which may have been used to store water. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Geoarchaeology; Pigs; Southern Levant; Zooarchaeology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063300482

Recently, it has been argued that this increase in anthropogenic aerosols can be linked to a decrease in wet removal associated with reduced precipitation 2 , but the mechanisms remain uncertain. Here, using a state-of-the-art climate model (the Community Atmosphere Model version 5), we expand on this notion to demonstrate that the enhanced aerosol burden and hydrological changes are related to a robust climate change phenomenon—the land–sea warming contrast 3,4 . Enhanced land warming is associated with continental reductions in lower-tropospheric humidity that drive decreases in low clouds—particularly large scale (stratus) clouds—which, in turn, lead to reduced large-scale precipitation and aerosol wet removal. Idealized model simulations further show that muting the land–sea warming contrast weakens these hydrological changes, thereby suppressing the aerosol increase. Moreover, idealized simulations that only feature land warming yield enhanced continental aridity and an increase in aerosol burden. Thus, unless anthropogenic emission reductions occur, our results add confidence that a warmer world will be associated with enhanced aerosol pollution. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061184639

Research has not conclusively verified whether or not transportation dependence on EVs achieves the suggested sustainability goals at the rate required by climate policy and science. In this study, we conduct a life cycle assessment to measure the impact of different regional energy mixes and climates temperatures, for both the electric and conventional vehicles. Specifically, we modeled the case of Los Angeles, California vs. Detroit, Michigan for current energy mixes for both cities in 2017, as well as the projected ones for 2020 and 2030 plans. Also, we compared the difference in GHG emissions produced in the two cities to value the impact of the variations in both the weather and generation portfolios. We used GREET, a full life cycle assessment model released by the Argonne National Laboratory of the Department of Energy. The results show that the geographical differences greatly influence the level of GHG emitted from the utilization of the EVs. Specifically, for the same level of driving (considering the same car model), the EVs in Los Angeles have lower GHG emissions than in Detroit. Furthermore, Detroit's lower ambient temperature for most of the year will result in higher levels in both GHG emission intensities and battery-charging inefficiencies. Additionally, the modeled energy grid mix for Michigan in all case scenarios (2017, 2020 and 2030) contains high percentage of coal as a fuel, compared to no coal at all in California's energy grid, making the EVs charging process in Detroit lead to more GHG emissions than in Los Angeles. © 2019 IEEE.","climate change; electric vehicles (EVs); energy grid mix; greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs); life cycle assessment (LCA); Renewable Energy Portfolio Standards (RPS)","Artificial life; Charging (batteries); Climate change; Electric automobiles; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Model automobiles; Secondary batteries; Vehicle-to-grid; Argonne National Laboratory; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy grids; Generation portfolios; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle assessment model; Renewable energies; Temperature differences; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082381172

In the past, various studies have shown that owing to a lack of awareness and connectivity, end customers cannot fully exploit the benefits of DERs. However, with the tremendous progress in communication technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data (BD), machine learning, and deep learning, the potential benefits of DERs can be fully achieved, although a significant issue in forecasting the generated renewable energy is the intermittent nature of these energy resources. The machine learning and deep learning models can be trained using BD gathered over a long period of time to solve this problem. The trained models can be used to predict the generated energy through green energy resources by accurately forecasting the wind speed and solar irradiance. Methods: We propose an efficient approach for microgrid-level energy management in a smart community based on the integration of DERs and the forecasting wind speed and solar irradiance using a deep learning model. A smart community that consists of several smart homes and a microgrid is considered. In addition to the possibility of obtaining energy from the main grid, the microgrid is equipped with DERs in the form of wind turbines and photovoltaic (PV) cells. In this work, we consider several machine learning models as well as persistence and smart persistence models for forecasting of the short-term wind speed and solar irradiance. We then choose the best model as a baseline and compare its performance with our proposed multiheaded convolutional neural network model. Results: Using the data of San Francisco, New York, and Los Vegas from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) as a case study, the results show that our proposed model performed significantly better than the baseline model in forecasting the wind speed and solar irradiance. The results show that for the wind speed prediction, we obtained 44.94%, 46.12%, and 2.25% error reductions in root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE), respectively. In the case of solar irradiance prediction, we obtained 7.68%, 54.29%, and 0.14% error reductions in RMSE, mean bias error (MBE), and sMAPE, respectively. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model on different time horizons and different climates. The results indicate that for wind speed forecast, different climates do not have a significant impact on the performance of the proposed model. However, for solar irradiance forecast, we obtained different error reductions for different climates. This discrepancy is certainly due to the cloud formation processes, which are very different for different sites with different climates. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the generation estimation and electricity bill reduction indicates that the proposed framework will help the smart community to achieve an annual reduction of up to 38% in electricity bills by integrating DERs into the microgrid. Conclusions: The simulation results indicate that our proposed framework is appropriate for approximating the energy generated through DERs and for reducing the electricity bills of a smart community. The proposed framework is not only suitable for different time horizons (up to 4 h ahead) but for different climates. © 2019 by the authors.","Deep learning; Distributed energy resources; Energy management; Microgrid","Automation; Deep learning; Electric power generation; Energy management; Energy policy; Energy resources; Errors; Forecasting; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Machine learning; Mean square error; Neural networks; Smart city; Solar radiation; Speed; Wind; Wind turbines; Communication technologies; Convolutional neural network; Distributed Energy Resources; Machine learning models; Mean absolute percentage error; Micro grid; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Root mean square errors; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065712073

In recent decades, governmental institutions limit the maximum acceptable hazardous emissions of diesel engines by stringent international regulations, which enforces engine manufacturers to find a solution for reducing the emissions while keeping the power requirements. A reliable model of the diesel engine combustion process can be quite useful to search for the best engine operating conditions. In this study, nonlinear modeling of a heavy-duty diesel engine NOx emission formation is presented. As a new experiment design, air-path and fuel-path input channels were excited by chirp signals where the frequency profile of each channel is different in terms of the number and the direction of the sweeps. This method is proposed as an alternative to the steady-state experiment design based modeling approach to substantially reduce testing time and improve modeling accuracy in transient operating conditions. Sigmoid based nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) model is employed to predict NOx emissions with given input set under both steady-state and transient cycles. Models for different values of parameters are generated to analyze the sensitivity to parameter changes and a parameter selection method using an easy-to-interpret map is proposed to find the best modeling parameters. Experimental results show that the steady-state and the transient validation accuracies for the majority of the obtained models are higher than 80% and 70%, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Combustion process; Diesel engine; Experiment design; NOx emissions; Sigmoid NARX model","Combustion; Conversion efficiency; Nitrogen oxides; Combustion pro-cess; Engine operating conditions; Experiment design; NARX modeling; Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous input models; NOx emissions; Steady state and transients; Transient operating condition; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060855356

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used to assess the environmental performance of bioenergy systems, yet subject to the limitations of static approaches. In classical LCA, no temporal differentiation is undertaken: all inventoried instant to long-term greenhouse gases emissions (GHG) are aggregated and characterised in the same way, over a fixed time horizon, by means of fixed characterisation factors. Positive and negative impact contributions of dynamic biogenic carbon (Cbio) sum up to zero, yielding the same result as carbon neutral estimates. Climate mitigation results are biased without the temporal consideration of these flows. The purpose of the study is to highlight the time-sensitive potential climatic consequences of policy-driven transport strategies for metropolitan France, in the specific context of the dynamic LCA framework and climate change mitigation. We therefore propose a dynamic approach coupling a partial-equilibrium model (PEM) with dynamic Cbio models. The PEM analyses in detail the techno-economic performance of the metropolitan French energy-transport sector. It explores prospective optimization options (supply-demand equilibrium) of emerging commodity and energy process pathways in response to a policy in question. The Cbio model generates dynamic inventories of the Cbio embedded in the primary renewable biomass outputs of the PEM. It captures the dynamic Cbio exchange flows between the atmosphere and the technosphere over time: negative emissions from fixation (sequestration) and positive emissions from release (e.g. combustion or decay). A dynamic impact method is applied to evaluate the mitigation effects of Cbio from forest wood residues by comparing the climate change impacts from complete carbon (fossil + biogenic) with carbon neutral inventories across scenarios. Two sets of results are computed concerning the overall transport (all emissions) and bioethanol (wood-to-fuel emissions) systems. The mitigation effect from long-term historic sequestration allocated to bioethanol (462%) is significantly larger than for transport (3%), expressed as the difference with carbon neutral estimates. The fossil-sourced emissions from bioethanol production represents only 5.4%. In contrast, a comparison with an alternative reference scenario involving wood decay demonstrated higher impacts (i.e. an increase of 316%) than carbon neutral estimates. The representation of the actual climatic consequences depends on the chosen fixed end-year of the dynamic impact assessment. Moreover, the mitigation effect is proven sensitive to the rotation length of forestry wood: the shorter the length the lower the mitigation from using renewable forest resources. Other energy-policy scenarios, Cbio modelling approaches and consequences of indirect effects should be further studied and contrasted. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biogenic carbon; Climate change mitigation; Partial-equilibrium model; Time-dynamic LCA; Transport sector","Bioethanol; Biomass; Carbon; Climate models; Decay (organic); Environmental management; Ethanol; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Plants (botany); Wood; Bio-ethanol production; Climate change mitigation; Environmental performance; Greenhouse gases emissions; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Partial equilibrium model; Time dynamic; Transport sectors; Climate change; bioenergy; biogenic emission; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; differentiation; emission inventory; forest resource; life cycle analysis; metropolitan area; model; policy approach; strategic approach; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060886658

A variety of modified design cases that met the minimum requirements for code compliance in residential buildings for four Gulf Cooperation Council countries were developed and subsequently simulated. Then, an economic analysis was performed.

The plant incorporates many innovative technologies including being the largest single kiln and a preheater tower with dual-sting 'hybrid' low-NOx and CO inline calciner. Commissioned with coal firing, the plant later switched to firing a blend of coal and petcoke in the kiln. The calciner has a seven-second residence time and is capable to burn several types of alternative fuels including bigger and denser fuels such as tire chips and/or solid recovered fuels.Prior to calciner installation, a detailed mathematical modeling exercise using mineral interactive computational fluid dynamics (MI-CFD) was carried out. The simulated results showed higher level of coal burnout in seven seconds' gas residence time with about 95% meal calcination levels. The CO and NOx emissions were found to be extremely low. The predicted values were later found to be reasonably close to plant data.Plant analysis for the last ten years of operation are presented. The lower NOx emissions enabled the plant to use no or very little SNCR allowing for savings of between 1-2 M per year, as compared with other plants. Some data and simulated results are presented to highlight calciner performance and, where possible, results are compared with other state of the art calciners. The achieved success from the plant can be replicated to other plants through creating similar combustion and process conditions. © 2019 IEEE.","Aerodynamics; cement industry; chemical processes; computational modeling; computer simulation; firing; fluid dynamics; fuel economy; industrial pollution; production engineering","Aerodynamics; Alternative fuels; Blending; Calcination; Cements; Coal; Coal combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Fluid dynamics; Fuel economy; Kilns; Nitrogen oxides; Production; Production engineering; Chemical process; Computational model; firing; Gas residence time; Industrial pollution; Innovative technology; Process condition; Simulated results; Cement industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067922986

One of the most prominent concerns in this regard is the increasing amounts of animal waste produced as a natural consequence of stock population growth. For decades, composting, including that of manure and animal mortalities, has been utilized to manage animal waste. Recently, in an effort to enhance the composting process, biochar has been proposed for use as a compost amendment, and over the last few years, an increasing number of papers on composting with biochar have been published. However, although there have been a few review papers that have summarized the literature regarding biochar use in composting, none of these has focused on animal waste composting. Accordingly, the purpose of this review is to critically analyze the role of biochar in livestock and poultry waste composting, identify gaps in our current knowledge, and propose future research directions. On the basis of the studies analyzed, biochar has the potential to improve animal waste composting processes at application rates of 5–10%. Biochar can extend the thermophilic phase of the composting process, lower the pH of compost material, prevent leachate formation, and reduce ammonia, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions. Given that the feedstock used to produce biochar and the pyrolysis conditions employed in its production affect the performance of biochar, it is important to report the physicochemical properties of the biochars used to enable comparison of the results of different studies. Moreover, there is a need for further research to gain a better understanding of the impact of biochar regarding the elimination of antibiotic-resistant genes and animal mortality composting. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; Composting; Livestock; Manure; Mortality; Poultry","Agriculture; Ammonia; Animals; Composting; Fertilizers; Manures; Nitrogen oxides; Physicochemical properties; Population statistics; Poultry; Animal waste composting; Antibiotic-resistant genes; Bio chars; Future research directions; Livestock; Mortality; Natural consequences; Nitrous oxide emissions; Waste treatment; ammonia; charcoal; methane; nitrous oxide; organic matter; biochar; charcoal; nitrogen; antibiotic resistance; biochar; composting; livestock; manure; mortality; poultry; waste; carbonization; combustion; composting; gasification; greenhouse gas; human; leaching; livestock; nitrification; nonhuman; poultry manure; priority journal; pyrolysis; Review; swine manure; systematic review; wood chip; animal; manure; soil; Animalia; Animals; Charcoal; Composting; Manure; Nitrogen; Soil",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063581635

In this paper, the authors reason that improving energy efficiency is only one route to produce more cost-effective potable water with fewer emissions. In fact, the grade of energy that is used to desalinate water plays an equally important role in its economic viability and overall emission reduction. This paper provides a critical review of desalination strategies with emphasis on means of using low-grade energy rather than solely focusing on reaching the thermodynamic energy limit. Herein, it is argued that large-scale commercial desalination technologies have by-and-large reached their engineering potential. They are now mostly limited by the fundamental process design rather than process optimization, which has very limited room for improvement without foundational change to the process itself. The conventional approach toward more energy effcient water desalination is to shift from thermal technologies to reverse osmosis (RO). However, RO suffers from three fundamental issues: (1) it is very sensitive to high-salinity water, (2) it is not suitable for zero liquid discharge and is therefore environmentally challenging, and (3) it is not compatible with low-grade energy. From extensive research and review of existing commercial and lab-scale technologies, the authors propose that a fundamental shift is needed to make water desalination more affordable and economical. Future directions may include novel ideas such as taking advantage of energy localization, surficial/interfacial evaporation, and capillary action. Here, some emerging technologies are discussed along with the viability of incorporating low-grade energy and its economic consequences. Finally, a new process is discussed and characterized for water desalination driven by capillary action. The latter has great significance for using low-grade energy and its substantial potential to generate salinity/blue energy. © 2019 by the authors.","Capillary-driven desalination; Emerging technologies; Energy grade; Viable desalination","Cost effectiveness; Desalination; Emission control; Optimization; Potable water; Water filtration; Conventional approach; Desalination technologies; Economic consequences; Emerging technologies; Energy grades; Thermal technologies; Thermodynamic energy; Zero liquid discharges; Energy efficiency; desalination; drinking water; optimization; reverse osmosis; technological change; thermodynamics; water treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065042958

It also encompasses many significant contributions such as eliminating electricity shortages by diversifying energy supply, improving reliability with power quality, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and providing energy independence, which is the most crucial aspect for both developed and developing countries power sector. The extraction of such benefits in the best manner can be achieved by considering storage and control devices, aiding well-configured electricity networks through competitive optimisation techniques. By taking such points into consideration, optimal multi-configuration and allocation of step-voltage regulators (SVRs), capacitor banks, and energy storage system along with centralised wind-power generation integrating to distribution network are investigated and applied, using a novel and Pareto based epsilon multiobjective genetic algorithm.

In this study, drought risk is assessed at a national level across Africa, and the impacts of climate change, population growth, and socioeconomic vulnerabilities on drought risk are investigated. A rigorous framework is implemented to quantify drought vulnerability considering various sectors including economy, energy and infrastructure, health, land use, society, and water resources. Multi-model and multi-scenario analyses are employed to quantify drought hazard using an ensemble of 10 regional climate models and a multi-scalar drought index. Drought risk is then assessed in each country for 2 climate emission pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), 3 population scenarios, and 3 vulnerability scenarios during three future periods between 2010 and 2100. Drought risk ratio is quantified, and the role of each component (i.e. hazard, vulnerability, and exposure) is identified, and the associated uncertainties are also characterized. Results show that drought risk is expected to increase in future across Africa with varied rates for different models and scenarios. Although northern African countries indicate aggravating drought hazard, drought risk ratio is found to be highest in central African countries as a consequent of vulnerability and population rise in that region. Results indicate that if no climate change adaptation is implemented, unprecedented drought hazard and risk will occur decades earlier. In addition, controlling population growth is found to be imperative for mitigating drought risk in Africa (even more effective than climate change mitigation), as it improves socioeconomic vulnerability and reduces potential exposure to drought. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Africa; Climate change; Drought; Population growth; Risk; Vulnerability","Climate models; Drought; Economics; Hazards; Land use; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risks; Water resources; Africa; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Population growth; Potential exposure; Regional climate models; Socio-economic vulnerability; Vulnerability; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; drought; population growth; risk assessment; vulnerability; Africa; article; climate change; drought; economic aspect; human; land use; population growth; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; uncertainty; water availability; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060557292

Understanding of geographically-specific determinants of GHG emissions is crucial to devise low-carbon sustainable development strategies. However, previous studies on transport patterns have been limited to socio-economic context in linear and stationary settings, and with limited spatial scope. Here, we use a machine learning tool to develop a nested typology that categorizes all 640 Indian districts according to the econometrically identified drivers of their commuting emissions. Results reveal that per capita commuting emissions significantly vary over space, after controlling for socioeconomic characteristics, and are strongly influenced by built environment (e.g. urbanization, and road density), and mobility-related variables (e.g. travel distance and travel modes). The commuting emissions of districts are characterized by unique, place-specific combinations of drivers. We find that income and urbanization are dominant classifiers of commuting emissions, while we explain more fine-grained patterns with mode choice and travel distance. Surprisingly the most urbanized areas with highest population density are also associated with the highest transport GHG emissions, a result that is explained by high car ownership. This result contrasts with insights from OECD countries, where commuting emissions are associated with low-density urban sprawl. Our findings demonstrate that low-carbon commuting in India is best advanced with spatially differentiated strategies. © 2019 The Author(s).

The study aims for applying geo-spatial technology towards visualizing various land, soil, climate and topographical data to reveal trends and interrelationships and to find a nutrient availability and agroforestry suitability map. FAO based land suitability criteria was adopted to generate agroforestry suitability maps based upon scientifically evaluated weight factors at GIS platform by integrating layers of LULC, NDVI, wetness factor, elevation, slope percent, drainage, watershed, rainfall, organic carbon, pH and nutrient status. About 6% of land is under cultivation of pure agriculture whereas the study area has agroforestry suitability of 32.8% of total area. Block wise agroforestry suitability reveals highly suitable percentage for Rahe, Bundu and Namkum blocks as 79.1, 56.5 and 1.1%, respectively. Based on high suitability percentage Rahe block among all should be prioritized. Therefore, if there is scientific planning with adequate technical inputs, the area can achieve tremendous scope for tribal and rural people in generating their livelihood.

The aim of this work was to develop and test a methodology based on SfM from UAV to generate high quality Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) on teak plantations (Tectona grandis Linn. F.) situated in the Coastal Region of Ecuador (dry tropical forest). UAV overlapping images were collected using a DJI Phantom 4 Advanced© quadcopter during the dry season (leaf-off phenological stage) over 58 teak square plots of 36 m side belonging to three different plantations located in the province of Guayas (Ecuador). A workflow consisting of SfM absolute image alignment based on field surveyed ground control points, very dense point cloud generation, ground points filtering and outlier removal, and DTM interpolation from labeled ground points, was accomplished. A very accurate Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) derived ground points were employed as ground reference to estimate the UAV-SfM DTM vertical error in each reference plot. The plot-level obtained DTMs presented low vertical bias and random error (−3.1 cm and 11.9 cm on average, respectively), showing statistically significant greater error in those reference plots with basal area and estimated vegetation coverage above 15 m2/ha and 60%, respectively. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study aimed at monitoring of teak plantations located in dry tropical forests from UAV images.

The associated fires and peat oxidation result in smoke and large carbon emissions. In the medium term, peatlands should be used for production systems that do not require (or require much less) drainage. In this context, this study aims to explore scenarios for the withdrawal of oil palm plantations from peatlands in Jambi province and the associated carbon emissions in the coming decades. We first analyzed past land-use change trends in Jambi peatlands. Then, we analyzed three scenarios for the future: (1) a baseline scenario, assuming further expansions by smallholders, but not by companies, (2) a scenario assuming withdrawal from peat by companies only, and (3) a scenario assuming withdrawal from peat by companies and smallholders. In both scenarios 1 and 2, it is assumed smallholders keep on expanding oil palm plantations in peatlands up to 2020 but not thereafter. To accommodate economic interests of growers, withdrawal of oil palm plantations is assumed to only take place when the palm trees are 25 years old and their productivity starts declining. Our study shows that there has been a rapid expansion of oil palm plantations in peatlands of Jambi from 30,000 ha in 1987 to 483,000 ha in 2014. In our baseline scenario, involving commitments from companies but not from smallholders, the area of oil palm further increases by 20% between 2014 and 2040; this implies that by 2040, almost all peatlands, including those in the buffer zone of Berbak National Park, will have been converted to plantations. The corresponding greenhouse gas emissions are 53 Mt CO 2 -equivalent per year (from both peat decomposition and fires). In the scenario assuming withdrawal of company plantations from peatlands, the plantation area will be reduced to half that in the baseline scenario in 2040. This would decrease CO 2 -equivalent emissions in 2040 to below 2010 levels (27.9 Mt per year). Our study shows that a substantial decrease in emissions is only possible in scenario 3 with an almost full withdrawal of plantations from peatlands by 2040. This reduces CO 2 -equivalent emissions to the level of 2000 (4.3 Mt per year) and leads to safeguarding the remaining pristine peat swamp forest in Berbak National Park. © 2019, The Author(s).","Carbon emission; Mitigation; Oil palm; Peatlands; Restore; Withdrawal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062591090

In particular, the mortar binder requires a purification treatment in order to separate it from other sources of carbon, which could change the 14C signature of the binder invalidating the dating process. Here, we present the application of the Cryo2Sonic method to 14C dating of the ancient building structures unearthed during excavation at the Padua Cathedral complex. The dated samples were pretreated by using Cryo2Sonic method and the improved Cryo2Sonic version 2.0, recently developed by introducing additional steps such as centrifugation of the mortar suspension and gravimetric sedimentation of the binder fractions. The Cryo2Sonic version 2.0 relies heavily on the characterization of the mortar and of the purified binder fractions, allowing the isolation of a reliable 14C datable mortar fraction. Through this new method, the 14C dating of different ancient structures excavated next to the Padua Cathedral allow to identify the first religious complex of the city of Padua (3rd-4th centuries AD). © 2019 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona.","14C mortar dating; Cryo2Sonic; Cryo2Sonic version 2.0; Padua Cathedral; radiocarbon mortar reliability","charcoal; chemical binding; excavation; mortar; purification; radiocarbon dating; sedimentation; shell; software; Italy; Padova; Padua; Veneto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062861428

Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) is a major component and common proxy of TRAP. In this study, we estimated the annual global number of new paediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure at a resolution sufficient to resolve intra-urban exposure gradients. Methods: We obtained 2015 country-specific and age-group-specific asthma incidence rates from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation for 194 countries and 2015 population counts at a spatial resolution of 250 × 250 m from the Global Human Settlement population grid. We used 2010–12 annual average surface NO 2 concentrations derived from land-use regression at a resolution of 100 × 100 m, and we derived concentration-response functions from relative risk estimates reported in a multinational meta-analysis. We then estimated the NO 2 -attributable burden of asthma incidence in children aged 1–18 years in 194 countries and 125 major cities at a resolution of 250 × 250 m. Findings: Globally, we estimated that 4·0 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1·8–5·2) new paediatric asthma cases could be attributable to NO 2 pollution annually; 64% of these occur in urban centres. This burden accounts for 13% (6–16) of global incidence. Regionally, the greatest burdens of new asthma cases associated with NO 2 exposure per 100 000 children were estimated for Andean Latin America (340 cases per year, 95% UI 150–440), high-income North America (310, 140–400), and high-income Asia Pacific (300, 140–370). Within cities, the greatest burdens of new asthma cases associated with NO 2 exposure per 100 000 children were estimated for Lima, Peru (690 cases per year, 95% UI 330–870); Shanghai, China (650, 340–770); and Bogota, Colombia (580, 270–730). Among 125 major cities, the percentage of new asthma cases attributable to NO 2 pollution ranged from 5·6% (95% UI 2·4–7·4) in Orlu, Nigeria, to 48% (25–57) in Shanghai, China. This contribution exceeded 20% of new asthma cases in 92 cities. We estimated that about 92% of paediatric asthma incidence attributable to NO 2 exposure occurred in areas with annual average NO 2 concentrations lower than the WHO guideline of 21 parts per billion. Interpretation: Efforts to reduce NO 2 exposure could help prevent a substantial portion of new paediatric asthma cases in both developed and developing countries, and especially in urban areas. Traffic emissions should be a target for exposure-mitigation strategies. The adequacy of the WHO guideline for ambient NO 2 concentrations might need to be revisited.

Here, we quantify the air quality and mortality impacts of a 12% summertime (June, July, and August) reduction in baseload electricity demand. We use the AVoided Emissions and geneRation Tool (AVERT) to simulate plant-level generation and emissions, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to simulate air quality, and the Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) to quantify mortality impacts. We find EE reduces emissions of NOx by 13.2%, SO2 by 12.6%, and CO2 by 11.6%. On a nationwide, summer average basis, ambient PM2.5 is reduced 0.55% and O3 is reduced 0.45%. Reduced exposure to PM2.5 avoids 300 premature deaths annually (95% CI: 60 to 580) valued at $2.8 billion ($0.13 billion to $9.3 billion), and reduced exposure to O3 averts 175 deaths (101 to 244) valued at $1.6 billion ($0.15 billion to $4.5 billion). This translates into a health savings rate of $0.049/kWh ($0.031/kWh for PM2.5 and $0.018/kWh for O3). These results illustrate the importance of capturing the health benefits of EE and its potential as a strategy to achieve air standards. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Health; Avoided emissions; Community multi-scale air qualities; Electricity demands; Environmental benefits; Generation tools; Health benefits; Health impact; Premature death; Energy efficiency; carbon dioxide; nitrate; sulfate; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric chemistry; health expenditure; health risk; industrial emission; mortality; pollution exposure; public health; air quality; ambient air; Article; coal power; death; electric power plant; electricity; energy; particulate matter; premature mortality; summer; United States; air pollutant; air pollution; productivity; public health; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Efficiency; Particulate Matter; Public Health; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063887849

Then, daily temperature data for two future periods (2041–2070 and 2071–2099) were simulated by using the statistical downscaling model of SDSM based on HadCM3 SRES A2, B2. After checking the simulation accuracy, 95th percentile threshold was used to identify the heat wave occurrences in the warm seasons of the year. Therefore, it is considered as a heat wave if the daily maximum temperature is higher than the 95th percentile threshold with at least three or more consecutive days. The results showed that the seasonal averages of heat waves intensity are expected to increase and the seasonal numbers of heat waves frequency are expected to decrease according to the output of all scenarios in coming decades. While the future duration of heat waves does not follow from stable patterns, however, long-lasting heat waves are more expected to happen in northern inland than southern coasts. Also, the lowland regions of southern coast are expected to have the lowest increasing changes in the heat waves frequency than northern highlands. While the southern coasts which experienced the strongest heat waves of the last decades are expected to have the worst conditions of future heat waves owing to the more potential availability of atmospheric humidity. Overall, the future occurrences of heat waves are expected to happen stronger and longer lasting along with lower frequencies in northern than southern latitudes. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change effects; Heat wave changes; Iran; Statistical downscaling model","accuracy assessment; atmospheric dynamics; climate change; downscaling; heat wave; humidity; midlatitude environment; seasonal variation; simulation; statistical analysis; threshold; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032480832

Mercury in the liquid state is known to be an active metallic component to selectively convert CO2 to formate ions, but it is not scalable to use as an electrode in electrochemical CO2 reduction. Therefore, scalable amalgam electrodes with different base metals are tested to produce formate by an electrochemical CO2 reduction. The amalgam electrodes are prepared by the electrodeposition of Hg on the pre-electrodeposited Pd, Au, Pt and Cu nanoparticles on the glassy carbon. The formate faradaic efficiency with the Pd, Au, Pt and Cu is lower than 25%, while the one with the respective metal amalgams is higher than 50%. Pd amalgam among the tested samples shows the highest formate faradic efficiency and current density. The formate faradaic efficiency is recorded 85% at-2.1 V vs SCE and the formate current density is -6.9 mA cm-2. It is concluded that Pd2Hg5 alloy on the Pd amalgam electrode is an active phase for formate production in the electrochemical CO2 reduction. © 2019 by the authors.
