Because these commitments involve diverse actors carrying out diverse activities in diverse settings, they provide unprecedented opportunities for experimentation and learning. Yet voluntary commitment systems (VCS) rarely promote experimentation and provide few systematic learning mechanisms. Based on work with Duncan Snidal, an argument is made for a more strongly experimental approach. First, VCS should encourage designed, controlled policy experiments consistent with scientific standards. Second, even where formal experiments are infeasible, VCS should treat commitments as informal experiments, orchestrating them to promote innovation, comparability, analysis and systematic learning. Collaborative initiatives and other governance organizations can act as orchestrators, encouraging and supporting formal and informal experimentation through persuasion, technical and material assistance, recognition, third-party assistance and other incentives. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate governance; experimentalist governance; experimentation; global environmental governance; non-state actors; orchestration; voluntary commitments","climate change; environmental management; governance approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017587896

Traffic signal timing optimization is achieved using a Nash Bargaining game-theoretic framework, where each phase is modeled as a player in a game in which the players cooperate to reach a mutual agreement. The Nash bargaining solution is applied to obtain the optimal control strategy, considering a flexible phasing sequence and free cycle length. The system is implemented and evaluated in the INTEGRATION microscopic traffic assignment and simulation software. The proposed control approach is compared to the operation of an optimum fixed-time coordinated plan, a centralized adaptive phase split controller, a decentralized phase split and cycle length controller, and a fully coordinated adaptive phase split, cycle length, and offset optimization controller to evaluate the performance of the proposed decentralized controller. The simulation results were tested on an arterial network located in the heart of downtown Blacksburg, Virginia, USA. The simulation results show significant reductions in the average travel time ranging from 7% to 21%, a reduction in the total delay ranging from 36% to 67%, and a reduction in the emission levels ranging from 6% to 13%. Analysis of variance, Tukey, and pairwise comparison tests were conducted, to examine the statistically significant difference of the proposed controller. The results demonstrate that the proposed decentralized controller produces major improvements over other state-of-the-art centralized and de-centralized control approaches. © 2017 IEEE.","Arterial traffic signal control; game theory; INTEGRATION software; Nash bargaining","Computer software; Controllers; Decentralized control; Game theory; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Optimal control systems; Traffic control; Transportation; Travel time; Arterial traffics; Decentralized controller; Integration software; Nash bargaining; Nash bargaining solution; Optimal control strategy; Statistically significant difference; Traffic signal controllers; Traffic signals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030257437

F. Gaertn., commonly known as shea tree or Vitellaria, is ranked the most important tree species of the savannah regions in the most African countries due to its ecological and economic importance for livelihoods and national economies. However, the savannah regions are the most vulnerable areas to the global climate change. Moreover, the Vitellaria populations on farmlands are threatened by the dominance of old trees with low or lack of regeneration. In this study both morphological and genetic diversity were assessed using several phenotypic traits and 10 microsatellite markers, respectively, to assess the impact of land use and agro-ecozone types on Vitellaria in Ghana. The land use types were forests and farmlands, and the agro-ecozone types included the Transitional, Guinea, and Sudan savannah zones. The mean values of morphological traits, such as diameter at breast height (DBH) and canopy diameter (CD), were statistically different between forest (DBH = 22.20, CD = 5.37) and farmland (DBH = 39.85 CD = 7.49) populations (P &lt; 0.00001). The Sudan savannah zone with mean petiole length of 4.96 cm showed significant difference from the other zones, likely as a result of adaptation to drier climate conditions. Genetic data analysis was based on 10 microsatellite markers and revealed high genetic diversity of Vitellaria in Ghana: mean expected heterozygosity, He was 0.667, and allelic richness, measured as number of effective alleles Ae, was 4.066. Both farmlands and forests were very diverse indicating lack of negative influence of farmer’s selection on genetic diversity. Fixation index was positive for all populations (mean FIS = 0.136) with farmlands recording relatively higher values than forests in all ecological zone types studied, probably indicating less gene flow in the farmlands. Moderate differentiation (F′ST = 0.113) was comparable to other similar tree species. Both land use and ecological zone types influenced genetic differentiation of Vitellaria at varying levels. The species was spatially structured across three ecozones and following climatic gradient. The forest reserves are used in situ conservation for Vitellaria in Ghana. High diversity observed in the most arid zones provides opportunity to find and use appropriate plant materials for breeding climate change resilient trees. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Fixation index; Genetic diversity; Heterozygosity; Microsatellite; Savannah; Vitellaria paradoxa","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; allele; climate change; commercial species; conservation genetics; deciduous tree; gene flow; genetic analysis; genetic marker; genetic variation; heterozygosity; index method; morphology; savanna; species conservation; transition zone; Ghana; Guinea; Sudan; Vitellaria; Vitellaria paradoxa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986268015

A systematic sampling method was used to identify each sampling point through the Global Positioning System. A total of 63 plots measuring 20 × 20 m were employed to collect tree species and soil data. Losses on ignition and the Walkley–Black method were used to estimate biomass and soil carbon stock, respectively. The carbon stock of trees was estimated using an allometric equation. The results revealed that the total carbon stock of the forest was 639.87 t/ha whereas trees store 406.47 t/ha, litter, herbs, and grasses (LHGs) 2.58 t/ha and soil 230.82 t/ha (up to 30 cm depth). The carbon pools’ carbon stock variation with altitude and slope gradients were not significant (p &gt; 0.05) which was similar to other previous studies. The Banja Forest is a reservoir of high carbon and thus acts as a great sink of the atmospheric carbon. It can be concluded that the Forest plays a role in climate change mitigation. Hence, it should be integrated with reduced emission from deforestation and degradation (REDD+) and the clean development mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol to catch monetary benefits. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Banja forest; carbon sequestration; carbon stock; climate change; Ethiopia","Carbon; Deforestation; Emission control; Soils; Allometric equations; Banja forest; Carbon sequestration; Carbon stocks; Clean Development Mechanism; Climate change mitigation; Dry afromontane forests; Ethiopia; Climate change; allometry; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; clean development mechanism; climate change; forest; GPS; mitigation; Carbon; Chelation; Forests; Amhara; Ethiopia; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021636235

The nanocrystal surfaces provide sensitivity specks that can turn into metallic silver, forming an invisible latent image, upon exposure to light. The photographic processing implies that the AgX nanoparticles possess unique properties. First, pristine AgX nanoparticles absorb light only at low efficiency to convert surface AgX into tiny clusters of silver atoms. Second, AgX nanoparticles represent an excellent class of materials to capture electrons efficiently. Third, small metallic silver clusters can catalyze the reduction of AgX nanoparticles to Ag nanoparticles in the presence of mild reducing reagents, known as self-catalytic reduction. These properties indicate that AgX nanoparticles can be partially converted to metallic silver with high precision, leading to the formation of hybrid AgX/Ag nanoparticles. The nanosized metallic Ag usually exhibit intense absorption bands in the visible spectral region due to their strong surface plasmon resonances, which make the AgX/Ag nanoparticles a class of promising visible-light-driven photocatalysts for environmental remediation and CO2 reduction. Despite the less attention paid to their ability of capturing electrons, AgX nanoparticles might be a class of ideal electron shuttle materials to bridge light absorbers and catalysts on which electrons can drive chemical transformations.In this Account, we focus on ternary silver halide alloy (TSHA) nanoparticles, containing two types of halide ions, which increase the composition complexity of the silver halide nanoparticles. Interdiffusion of halide ions between two types of AgX at elevated temperatures has been developed for fabricating ternary silver halide alloy crystals, such as silver chlorobromide optical fibers for infrared communications. This solid state process is not feasible for synthesizing TSHA nanoparticles since it is hard to form two different types of AgX nanoparticles in direct contact. In contrast, coprecipitation of silver ions with different halide ions via colloidal chemistry represents the most promising strategy to synthesize TSHA nanoparticles. Forming uniform and phase-pure ternary silver halide nanocrystals requires that the rate ratio for precipitating both halide ions remains constant throughout the synthesis. However, the significant difference in solubility among different AgX usually leads to a nonuniform compositional distribution in the resulting nanoparticles because the halide ions corresponding to the less soluble AgX precipitate faster at the early reaction stage. This Account summarizes the methods recently developed for the successful synthesis of phase-pure TSHA nanoparticles with uniform sizes and morphologies, which involve precise control over the balanced diffusion of different halide ions to react with silver ions. Typical methods include the use of microemulsion capsules and high-viscosity solvents to lower and even the diffusion coefficients of various halide ions, thus maintaining the precipitation rates of both AgX in single nanoparticles at a constant ratio. The availability of high-quality TSHA nanoparticles provides promising opportunities to explore their new properties and applications. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025107927

Two Ricardian models are estimated: (1) a traditional Ricardian model of the impact of climate change on annual farm NR and (2) a structural Ricardian model that first estimates the number of growing seasons and then the net revenue per season. The traditional model reveals annual NR is sensitive to autumn and summer climate variables. The seasonal effects offset each other so that uniform marginal effects are insignificant. Future climate scenarios likely harm Sri Lanka but could either benefit or harm Indonesia depending on the climate scenario. The structural Ricardian model suggests climate change will reduce the net revenue of three-season farms and increase the revenue of one-season farms causing farmers to switch from three-season farming to one-season farming.

In response, humans must adapt to altered climatic and environmental conditions. While climate change adaptation is a pressing issue in many sectors and regions, the adaptation of environmental management strategies is particularly urgent because of the severity and extent of risks associated with projected impacts. Robust adaptation of environmental management requires effective spatial and temporal implementation of interventions, with explicit consideration of trade-offs between different socio-economic and environmental objectives. We investigate the critical interface between regional governance systems and spatial planning for climate adaptation by exploring the case of Australia's Natural Resource Management (NRM) bodies. Australia's NRM bodies provide an ideal case study for two reasons. First, Australia faces significant threats from current and future climate changes. Second, Australian NRM bodies have recently undertaken a major program of spatial planning and research to explicitly address the need for climate adaptation. We explore the interface between regional governance systems and spatial planning by: 1) reviewing the historical development of institutional arrangements in relation to spatial planning by Australia's regional NRM bodies; 2) documenting current planning processes with regard to climate adaptation and more generally; and 3) identifying strengths and weaknesses of the existing governance system at various scales with respect to its ability to foster effective spatial planning.

This study tests whether biogas intervention is associated with higher forest biomass and forest regeneration in degraded forests in Chikkaballapur district in Southern India. Using propensity score matching, we find that forest plots in proximity to villages with biogas interventions (treatment) had greater forest biomass than comparable plots around villages without biogas (control). We also found significantly higher sapling abundance and diversity in treatment than control plots despite no significant difference in seedling abundances and diversity in treatment forests, suggesting that plants have a higher probability of reaching sapling stage. These results indicate the potential for alternative energy sources that reduce dependence on fuelwood to promote regeneration of degraded forests.

Methods to predict and control unstable modes inside combustion chambers have been developed in the last decades but, in some cases, they are computationally expensive. Sensitivity analysis aided by adjoint methods provides valuable sensitivity information at a low computational cost. This paper introduces adjoint methods and their application in wave-based low order network models, which are used as industrial tools, to predict and control thermoacoustic oscillations. Two thermoacoustic models of interest are analyzed. First, in the zero Mach number limit, a nonlinear eigenvalue problem is derived, and continuous and discrete adjoint methods are used to obtain the sensitivities of the system to small modifications. Sensitivities to base-state modification and feedback devices are presented. Second, a more general case with non-zero Mach number, a moving flame front and choked outlet, is presented.

Studies carried out in universities usually refer to the academic buildings, yet, reports of waste characterisation from student housing and the associated greenhouse gas emissions are scarce. The goal of this work was to present a study case where both equivalent carbon dioxide (CO2eq) emissions and waste reductions were successfully attained in student housing after implementation of a solid waste management strategy. Two waste characterisation studies were carried out, before and after a waste management program was implemented to reduce waste generation. The waste generation per capita (GPC) per day was estimated at 1.5 kg for the first study (2014) and 1.1 kg for the second (2015); in addition, 87% of the waste stream was diverted from the landfill through vermicomposting and recycling. The percentage of food waste used for vermicomposting was 2.83%. The CO2 eq emissions in 2014 were estimated at 12,624 kg CO2eq (0.43 kg/capita/day) and 761 kg for 2015 (0.03 kg/capita/day). Appropriate solid waste management was revealed to have a fundamental role in cutting indirect CO2 eq emissions. © 2017 by the authors.

This study evaluated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, net energy intensity (NEI), and land use of confined dairy systems with increasing levels of pasture in the diet. A Wisconsin farm was modeled to represent practices adopted by dairy operations in a humid continental climate typical in the Great Lakes region and other climates that have large differences in seasonal temperatures. Five grazing scenarios (all of which contained some portion of confinement) were modeled based on different concentrations of dry matter intake from pasture and feed supplementation from corn grain, corn silage, and soybean meal. Scenarios that incorporate grazing consisted of 5 mo of pasture feeding from May to September and 7 mo of confined feeding from October to April. Environmental impacts were compared within the 5 scenarios that incorporate grazing and across 2 entirely confined scenarios with and without on-farm electricity production through anaerobic digestion (AD). To conduct a fair comparison, all scenarios were evaluated based on the same total amount of milk produced per day where resource inputs were adjusted according to the characteristics of each scenario. A cradle-to-farm gate life cycle assessment evaluated the environmental burdens that were partitioned by allocation between milk and meat and by system expansion when biogas-based electricity was produced. Overall, results for all scenarios were comparable. Enteric methane was the greatest contributor to GHG emissions, and the production of crops was the most energy-intense process. For the confined scenario without AD, GHG emissions were 0.87 kg of CO2 equivalents, NEI was 1.59 MJ, and land use was 1.59 m2/kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). Anaerobic digestion significantly reduced emissions to 0.28 kg of CO2 equivalents/kg of FPCM and reduced NEI to −1.26 MJ/kg of FPCM, indicating a net energy producing system and highlighting the potential of AD to improve the sustainability of confined systems. For scenarios that combined confinement and grazing, GHG emissions ranged from 0.84 to 0.92 kg of CO2 equivalents, NEI ranged from 1.42 to 1.59 MJ, and land use ranged from 1.19 to 1.26 m2/kg of FPCM. All environmental impacts were minimized in scenarios that supplemented enough feed to increase milk yield but maintained dry matter intake from pasture at a level high enough to reduce material and energy use. © 2017 American Dairy Science Association","energy intensity; grazing; greenhouse gas emission; life cycle assessment","animal; animal food; bovine; dairying; diet; greenhouse effect; manure; milk; Poaceae; procedures; United States; veterinary; Wisconsin; Animal Feed; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Cattle; Dairying; Diet; Great Lakes Region; Greenhouse Effect; Manure; Milk; Poaceae; Wisconsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020247349

The influence of the different water treatment steps on the mutagenicity of some drinking water samples were evaluated using the Ames test. Method: Four different types of samples were collected from four water treatment factories within Port Harcourt metropolis: raw water from borehole (1), water after sand and granular activated carbon filtration (2), water after reverse osmosis (3), and water after Ozone and UV treatment (4). These samples were subjected to mutagenicity test using two mutant strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA 100 and TA 98) without S9 activation enzyme. Result: The mutagenic analysis results revealed that raw water samples from Kent and Rivoli table water products showed mutagenic potential with TA100 and TA 98, respectively. But Kent table water showed more mutagenic potential than Rivoli and Fressi table water samples. Fressi table water is predominantly cytotoxic with all the treatment processes except for UV treatment with TA 98 strain. The finished products (water after ozone and UV treatment) of Kent table water and Rivoli table water also showed mutagenic potentials higher than those treated with TA100 and TA98 without S9 mix, respectively. Only the samples treated with activated carbon showed highly reduced mutagenic potential. Conclusion: This study highlights the mutagenic effects of water treatment as another quality assessment option for assessing the portability of water samples. Water treatment with activated carbon can be reintroduced after disinfection with ozone/ultraviolet to eliminate possible mutagenic by-product in the finished product. © 2017 Agwa et al.","Drinking water samples; Finished products; Mutagenicity analysis; Potable water; Quality assessment; Water treatment processes","activated carbon; drinking water; ground water; ozone; polyethylene terephthalate; Ames test; Article; bacterial strain; cell division; cytotoxicity; disinfection; filtration; human; mutagen testing; mutagenesis; mutagenic activity; nonhuman; priority journal; quality control; reverse osmosis; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; scoring system; spontaneous mutation; ultraviolet radiation; water treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030750680

Despite the limited adaptation options often used and the largely subsistence agriculture practiced, studies have shown that smallholders have accumulated local knowledge about changes in climatic conditions. Farmers with field experience and an extensive stay in three sites in Palapye, eastern Botswana, were interviewed. This study related farmers' perceptions of changes in climate with results from analysis of climate data. Major changes perceived are a reduction in rainfall amount, rising temperature, and increasing frequency of drought conditions. Perceived reduction in rainfall amount is confirmed by analysis results as variability in rainfall amount is high throughout the series. Rainfall was poorly distributed and below average at the beginning of the cropping seasons for four years between 2013 and 2017. For 1990, 2003, and 2012, the standardized precipitation index (SPI) was 21.77 (severe drought), 21.37 (moderate drought), and 22.32 (extreme drought), respectively. To minimize impacts on crop production, farmers simultaneously planted different crops based on the perception that climatic impacts on different crops vary and favored crops perceived as drought resistant. Livestock farmers supplemented with livestock feeds, reduced herd size, and moved livestock to areas with better forage. Off-farm incomes from selling products harvested from the wild are important to farmers as a coping strategy, particularly when rain fails. Some female farmers brewed and sold alcohol made locally from sorghum. That local knowledge and perceptions exist and are used by smallholder farmers to adapt to climate change and variability is suggested. Engaging with local knowledge systems is an imperative for climate change policy making. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.",,"agricultural economics; climate change; climate variation; crop production; drought stress; farmers knowledge; livestock farming; precipitation assessment; questionnaire survey; semiarid region; smallholder; Botswana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020791042

This study examines the impact of modifications in orientation of buildings with respect to heat load. Heat load calculation is a mathematical process to determine the best capacity, application and style of HVAC system. The purpose is to ensure energy efficiency while also maximizing comfort inside the building. This study of load calculation is essential for a building because it helps to pick the best orientation and focuses to find an orientation that will reduce energy due to direct solar radiation. One of the factors affecting this assessment is the latitude of the location. The heat gain is effective through walls and fenestration. Improper management through ineffective orientation of the building's natural heat gain leads to excessive consumption of energy in the form of CL. The total heat gain for the above factors is calculated with the equations and assumptions as per ASHRAE code. After the calculation of heat load for different orientations, the best suited orientation of the building is found. By altering the building to suitable orientation, the dependence on electrical equipment can be minimized and thereby helps in energy conservation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Buildings; Climate control; Energy efficiency; Solar radiation; Thermal load; Adaptation strategies; Consumption of energy; Direct solar radiation; Electrical equipment; Heat load calculations; Political process; Residential building; Thermal Performance; Historic preservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028046856

The aim was to quantify the efficiencies and the production ranges to support local transition to a circular economy based on biomass usage. The products considered are biomethane (standalone) and hydrogen/biomethane and sustainable town gas (centralized drop-in and distributed drop-in). The analysis is based on a flow-sheet simulation of different process designs at the 100 MWbiomass scale and includes the following aspects: advanced drying systems, the coproduction of ethanol, and power-to-gas conversion by direct heating or water electrolysis. For the standalone plant, the chemical efficiency was in the range of 78–82.8 % LHVa.r.50 % (lower heating value of the as-received biomass with 50 % wet basis moisture), with a maximum production of 72 MWCH4, and for the centralized drop-in and distributed drop-in plants, the chemical efficiency was in the range of 82.8–98.5 % LHVa.r.50 % with maximum production levels of 85.6 MWSTG and 22.5 MWH2 /51 MWCH4, respectively. It is concluded that standalone plants offer no substantial advantages over distributed drop-in or centralized drop-in plants unless methane is the desired product. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This study report the effects of 18 years of ambient and experimental warming on lichens and vascular plant cover in two alpine plant communities, a dry heath with sparse canopy cover (54 %) and a mesic meadow with a more developed (67 %) canopy cover, in sub-arctic Sweden. Methods The effects of long-term passive experimental warming using open top chambers (OTCs) on lichens and total vascular plant cover, and the impact of plant cover on lichen community parameters, were analysed. Key Results Between 1993 and 2013, mean annual temperature increased about 2 °C. Both site and experimental warming had a significant effect on cover, species richness, effective number of species evenness of lichens, and total plant canopy cover. Lichen cover increased in the heath under ambient conditions, and remained more stable under experimental warming. The negative effect on species richness and effective number of species was driven by a decrease in lichens under experimental warming in the meadow. Lichen cover, species richness, effective number of species evenness were negatively correlated with plant canopy cover. There was a significant negative impact on one species and a non-significant tendency of lower abundance of the most common species in response to experimental warming. Conclusions The results from the long-term warming study imply that arctic and high alpine lichen communities are likely to be negatively affected by climate change and an increase in plant canopy cover. Both biotic and abiotic factors are thus important for future impacts of climate change on lichens. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Annals of Botany Company.

In this paper, we use a simple climate-vegetation energy-balance model to study the climate of the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets and the climate dependence on various factors: the global albedo, the fraction of vegetation that could cover their surfaces, and the different greenhouse conditions. The model allows us to investigate whether liquid water could be maintained on the planetary surfaces (i.e., by defining a ""surface water zone (SWZ)"") in different planetary conditions, with or without the presence of a greenhouse effect. It is shown that planet TRAPPIST-1d seems to be the most stable from an Earth-like perspective, since it resides in the SWZ for a wide range of reasonable values of the model parameters. Moreover, according to the model, outer planets (f, g, and h) cannot host liquid water on their surfaces, even with Earth-like conditions, entering a snowball state. Although very simple, the model allows us to extract the main features of the TRAPPIST-1 planetary climates. © 2017. The American Astronomical Society.

Altogether 420 genera (191 extinct and 229 extant) from 78 families are listed from these three Lagerstätten (as of 7 March 2017). The listed beetles were analyzed zoogeographically and distributional maps for 72 genera were compiled. One-quarter (56) of the genera that have survived since the Eocene have cosmopolitan ranges at present; 35 extant genera have been extripated from the Palaearctic since the Eocene. Approximately 40% of beetle genera from the middle-upper Eocene Eu-ropean ambers can be encountered in the wild in present-day Europe, while 5 of these genera are supposed to be European relict endemics originating in Fennosarmatia. The general similarity of the Baltic amber (s.l.) beetle assemblage to modern south Palaearctic fauna is the strongest, the Nearctic elements are more numerous in the middle-upper Eocene European ambers than the Oriental taxa. The simplified Mutual Climatic Range (MCR) method was used for palaeoclimate recon-struction based on fossil beetles. The coleopteran assemblage of Baltic amber is interpreted as indicative of warm temper-ate, humid, equable climate with reduced thermal seasonality [annual average temperatures range from +10-20°C; mean of the coldest month temperatures around +10°C; mean of the hottest month temperature around +20-24°C; annual pre-cipitation around 750-1500 mm].

A distinction was made between coping and adaptation strategies, respectively, as short-term and longer term measures. The study surveyed 200 farm households in three districts, and three focus group discussions and three key informant interviews were conducted in each district. All the surveyed farmers perceived at least one aspect of change in the local climate. Their perception of an increasing trend of temperature was supported by meteorological records, while their perception of declining annual rainfall was not supported by actual records in two of the three districts, where positive trends in rainfall were observed. Farmers identified changes in rainfall and drought as their major climate change-related risks. In response, farmers used different strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and variability. The most widely used coping strategy was selling livestock (85% of the respondents), followed by changing consumption pattern (76% of the respondents). Changing crop planting dates was the most preferred adaptation option (89% of the respondents), while irrigation as an adaptation strategy was used only by 10% of the surveyed farmers. Shortage of water for irrigation (83% of the respondents) and shortage of money to buy necessary inputs (77% of the respondents) were the major barriers to effective adaptation frequently cited in the study area. We conclude that adaptation policy should build on existing coping and adaptation strategies and focus on addressing barriers to the adoption of coping and adaptation measures at different scales. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; Climate change; coping; Ethiopia; North Shewa","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; coping strategy; drought; rainfall; smallholder; strategic approach; Ethiopian Highlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012295545

Numerous metrics have been used to model decay processes at large regional-to-global scales. However, their use at smaller landscape scales might not be practical or feasible. Aridity, generally defined as the balance between long term annual precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET), is a metric that synthesizes the major climatic drivers regulating ecosystem processes including the activity of microbes and invertebrates on the forest floor. Thus, aridity indices (AIs) can theoretically represent suitable predictors of decomposition and comminution processes at landscape scale. We investigated our hypothesis in a sclerophyll forest in south-east Australia, where decomposition and comminution rates of Eucalyptus globulus leaf litter were measured in eight sites positioned along an aridity gradient caused by variable exposure to solar radiation. Four sites were also instrumented to continuously monitor air, litter and soil microclimatic variables. We found that AIs were strongly related to above- and below-ground microbial decomposition rates, as well as above-ground comminution rates. Some microclimatic variables, such as shortwave radiation, air relative humidity and litter temperature were also significantly related to above-ground processes, but not below-ground decomposition. Among the AIs tested, the index calculated using the Priestley-Taylor equation for PET had consistently higher coefficients of determination with decomposition and comminution rates. Our case study suggests that AIs can represent robust predictors of both decomposition and comminution processes at landscape scale and useful surrogates for more expensive microclimatic predictors collected at site level. AIs could also be used across spatial scales (from local to continental) to improve biogeochemical and hydrological models by incorporating a spatially-explicit representation of decay processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Above/below-ground; Invertebrates; Litter; Microbes; Microclimate","Animals; Bacteria; Biogeochemistry; Climate change; Forestry; Microorganisms; Above/below-ground; Invertebrates; Litter; Microbes; Microclimate; Comminution; aboveground biomass; aridity; belowground biomass; comminution; decomposition; evapotranspiration; evergreen tree; forest floor; hydrological modeling; invertebrate; landscape change; leaf litter; microbial activity; microclimate; microorganism; organic matter; particulate organic matter; precipitation (climatology); shortwave radiation; solar radiation; water availability; Australia; Eucalyptus globulus; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016449527

In spite of this, they are among the most threatened ecosystems in the world. This study integrates three ecological approaches generally studied separately: climate change scenery, ecological niche and population dynamics of Oreomunnea mexicana (an endangered and relict species), to understand how environmental change affects the population structure in the cloud forest that will allow its conservation. Potential distribution under future climatic scenarios of the species at national and regional levels was generated from the Maxent algorithm. Also, the current abundance, distribution and the ecological niche of the species were analyzed at the regional level. Changes in potential distribution under two climatic models suggest a habitat reduction from 36% to 55% nationally, and 2% to 9% at a regional level, for 2050 and 2070, respectively. The current distribution of the species is fragmented and consists of subpopulations that have spatial structures of aggregated populations and a size structure in reversed ""J"" form. The ecological niche of the species is highly specialized and sensitive to environmental changes. O. mexicana is a flagship species of biological and cultural importance to the region's inhabitants and could be fundamental to the conservation of tropical montane cloud forests. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Distribution; Ecological niche; Population structure","Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Population distribution; Current distribution; Distribution; Ecological approaches; Ecological niche; Environmental change; Population structures; Potential distributions; Tropical montane cloud forest; Climate change; abundance; biodiversity; climate change; cloud forest; environmental change; niche; population distribution; population dynamics; population structure; species occurrence; Biological Populations; Climates; Distribution; Juglandaceae; Oreomunnea mexicana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026400139

Stakeholders from government and non‐government agencies were interviewed to gain perspectives on the threat of climate change, the inclusion of climate change in WaSH planning and the barriers preventing mainstreaming. Despite awareness of climate change, adaptation measures have not been considered, and the immediate WaSH needs remain the priority. Overall, stakeholders felt the adaptive capacity of the Municipality was low and that mainstreaming has not yet occurred.

Influence of climatic parameters on modules efficiencies, net energy production per unit area and plant performance ratio with PV modules made from crystalline silicon-based and thin film technologies-based is assessed on hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly basis respectively. The PV modules technologies used are the monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film with cell types of cadmium telluride (CdTe) and CdS/CdTe semiconductor. These technologies are assessed based on their manufacturer provided characteristics and an average of 20 years hourly climatic data of the ambient air-dry temperatures, horizontal solar radiation, and average wind speed for the state of Kuwait. The result show that compared with monocrystalline as a base of minimum required modules area, it is found that: the polycrystalline technology plant requires an additional area of 19.33%, thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) plant needs extra area of 8.39% and thin-film cadmium sulphide (CdS)/cadmium telluride (CdTe) (CdS/CdTe) plant needs extra area of 39.76%, respectively.

P. hysterophorus secretes allelochemicals to suppress the growth of neighboring plants. However, some crops have the ability to suppress the growth of numerous weeds. For this purpose field experiments were conducted at two different locations having variable climatic conditions to manage P. hysterophorus through some suppressive plants. The study revealed that sorghum, buffel grass, millet and maize showed good suppressive ability of P. hysterophorus weed biomass as compared to control which produced higher biomass at both field sites. However, at lower altitude site i.e Swabi, the highest P. hysterophorus dry biomass (340.45 g m-2) was recorded in moth bean plots, while at high altitude site (Haripur), the maximum P. hysterophorus dry biomass (384.80 g m-2) was found in mung bean plots. Moreover, at both sites, the sorghum, buffel grass, millet and maize plants reduced the P. hysterophorus growth up to 84.0%, 79.0%, 70.2% and 67.5%, respectively. Whereas mung bean and moth bean were found poor suppressive plants to reduce the growth of P. hysterophorus.

While it is not claimed that NGO advocacy was sufficient to produce the outcome, pathways by which issue framing can support increased NGO influence via persuasion and coercion are illustrated. First, the justice frame garnered additional media attention and raised the stakes should states fail to include the issue in the Paris Agreement.

These external nutrient load reductions interact with retention and removal processes (ecosystem services) in coastal and marine waters. Beside sedimentation, denitrification is the most important regulation ecosystem service provided by the sea, because it removes nitrogen (N) to the atmosphere and controls eutrophication. Denitrification is a spatially and temporally highly variable process and largely depends on temperature and N concentrations in the water. Climate change will have strong effects on denitrification. Increasing temperatures favour denitrification and changes in precipitation and discharge will alter the availability of N, with strong differences between river basins. We combine a 3D–ecosystem model of the Baltic Sea with economic marginal cost functions for three major Baltic river basins: Odra, Vistula and Neva. Objective is to calculate the monetary consequences of climate change (scenario A1B) for the implementation of water quality objectives, taking into account both, spatial changes in N loads and denitrification. In all regions over 90% of the entering N loads are subject to denitrification mainly in coastal waters. For the climate change scenario (A1B), our approach suggests reduced riverine N-loads of 7690 t/a (Odra), 6410 t/a (Vistula) and increased loads of 3200 t/a for the Neva. At the same time our model results suggest an increased denitrification of N-loads by 9.1% (Odra) and 9.9% (Neva) and minor changes with respect to the Vistula loads. In combination, in all three regions climate change helps to reach policy targets (lower N concentrations in the sea) at lower costs. The monetary benefit of load reduction measures that do not have to be implemented because of climate change are 11,270 million €/a (Odra), 2000 million €/a (Vistula) and 92 million €/a (Neva). The valuations strongly depend on the assumed climate change scenario and the economic approach, but indicate that climate change effects differ much between river basins and should be taken into account in nutrient load reduction management plans. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Baltic Sea; Ecosystem services; Neva; Odra; Szczecin lagoon; Vistula; Water framework Directive","abatement cost; climate change; coastal zone; denitrification; ecosystem service; environmental economics; nitrogen; river basin; water quality; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Leningrad; Neva River; Oder Basin; Poland [Central Europe]; Russian Federation; Szczecin Lagoon; Vistula Basin; Zachodniopomorskie",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021891001

In this work, we assess the effects of different soil management practices (conventional tillage, CT, reduced tillage, RT, reduced tillage plus green manure, RTG, and no tillage, NT) on soil CO2 flux dynamics and carbon sequestration in two organic rainfed almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.) orchards under semiarid conditions. Soil CO2 flux, temperature, and moisture were measured monthly over two-three years, and shortly after tillage operations. The soil aggregation distribution (including micro-aggregates occluded within macro-aggregates) and associated organic carbon content were measured after four years of implementation. No significant differences in CO2 emissions among the soils subjected to the distinct management practices were observed at either site. On the one hand, shifting from CT to RT or RTG increased the OC content by 56% on average in all aggregate sizes. On the other hand, suppressing tillage only increased the OC content (by 24%) in the macro-aggregates. Moreover, improved soil management practices modulated the response of soil CO2 flux to temperature and moisture in these semiarid Mediterranean agroecosystems. According to our results, soil CO2 flux under the conventional tillage treatment was more sensitive to temperature increments than with the reduced tillage treatments, indicating that bare soils will be more vulnerable to organic carbon mineralization with ongoing global warming. On the contrary, the incorporation of plant residues under the reduced tillage treatments promoted soil aggregation and organic carbon preservation, making soils more resilient to abrupt changes in temperature and moisture under these treatments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Almond orchards; Carbon sequestration; Cover crop mulches; Improved soil management; Occluded micro-aggregates; Soil CO2 emissions","agricultural ecosystem; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; climate change; cover crop; Mediterranean environment; mulch; orchard; plant residue; semiarid region; soil aggregate; soil emission; soil moisture; soil organic matter; tillage; Prunus dulcis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020759564

We investigated how an explicit consideration of plant-pollinator interactions influences our view of plant diversity. We studied three plant species-rich communities located in different biodiversity hotspot regions: two soil-specific plant communities with Mediterranean-climate, sandy dolomite outcrops in Andalusia (Spain) and serpentine seeps in California (USA), and a third community in the sub-tropical dry scrublands in Yucatan (Mexico). Sampling at three spatial scales (region, site, plot) and rarefaction analyses were used to characterize and compare spatial and temporal variation of entomophilous plant diversity based on species presence (“static plant diversity”), flower display sizes along the season (“dynamic flower diversity”), and pollinator visitation (“interaction-effective diversity”). The studied communities differed in the static diversity of plants, with sub-tropical dry scrublands being less diverse than the two Mediterranean communities. Reduction of static diversity at local scale was stronger in the richest Mediterranean communities and, thus, static diversity was similar among regions when considering finer (site-level) spatial scales. In addition, the two Mediterranean communities displayed more seasonal variation, thus reducing differences in dynamic diversity among regions, i.e. when considering finer temporal scales. These results suggested that, at finer spatio-temporal scales expected to be relevant for interactions with pollinators, plant communities are not necessarily as diverse as the region where they occur. Accordingly, interaction-effective diversity based on pollinator visitation was in all cases lower than expected relative to the diversity of flowers. Thus, diversity of visited flowers does not perfectly track diversity of flowering species but instead reaches asymptotes at much lower values than expected in the richest communities. Regional species diversity may support the functionality of interactions at broader spatial and temporal scales than they actually occur. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH","Community phenology; Hotspot regions; Mediterranean climate; Plant community structure; Plant–pollinator interactions; Rarefaction; Subtropical dry scrublands","biodiversity; climate change; diurnal variation; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; functional change; Mediterranean environment; phenology; plant community; plant-pollinator interaction; pollinator; scrub; species diversity; Andalucia; California; Mexico [North America]; Spain; United States; Yucatan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008882783

Of particular need for decision makers is the availability of spatial and temporal variability of runoff projections. Here, with the aid of a spatially explicit hydrological model forced with precipitation and temperature projections from 25 global climate models (GCMs) under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios, we explore the variability in modeled runoff in the near future (2016-2035) and mid-century (2046-2065). We find that total runoff from the CRB is projected to increase by 5ĝ€% [ĝ'9ĝ€%; 20ĝ€%] (mean-min and max-across model ensembles) over the next two decades and by 7ĝ€% [ĝ'12ĝ€%; 24ĝ€%] by mid-century. Projected changes in runoff from subwatersheds distributed within the CRB vary in magnitude and sign. Over the equatorial region and in parts of northern and southwestern CRB, most models project an overall increase in precipitation and, subsequently, runoff. A simulated decrease in precipitation leads to a decline in runoff from headwater regions located in the northeastern and southeastern CRB. Climate model selection plays an important role in future projections for both magnitude and direction of change. The multimodel ensemble approach reveals that precipitation and runoff changes under business-As-usual and avoided greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP8.5 vs. RCP4.5) are relatively similar in the near term but deviate in the midterm, which underscores the need for rapid action on climate change adaptation. Our assessment demonstrates the need to include uncertainties in climate model and emission scenario selection during decision-making processes related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. © Author(s) 2017.",,"Climate models; Decision making; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Runoff; Water resources; Watersheds; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Decision making process; Hydrological modeling; Multi-model ensemble; Precipitation and runoff; Spatial and temporal variability; Temperature projection; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027494162

Plastics became essential in many sectors such as construction, medical, engineering applications, automotive, aerospace, etc. In addition, economic growth and development also increased our demand and dependency on plastics which leads to its accumulation in landfills imposing risk on human health, animals and cause environmental pollution problems such as ground water contamination, sanitary related issues, etc. Hence, a sustainable and an efficient plastic waste treatment is essential to avoid such issues. Pyrolysis is a thermo-chemical plastic waste treatment technique which can solve such pollution problems, as well as, recover valuable energy and products such as oil and gas. Pyrolysis of plastic solid waste (PSW) has gained importance due to having better advantages towards environmental pollution and reduction of carbon footprint of plastic products by minimizing the emissions of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide compared to combustion and gasification. This paper presents the existing techniques of pyrolysis, the parameters which affect the products yield and selectivity and identify major research gaps in this technology.

Steam methane reforming (SMR) is commonly used by refiners for on-purpose hydrogen production. However, despite being a mature and efficient technology, SMR has a considerable carbon emissions footprint that adds to the carbon intensity of petroleum fuels. Therefore, this paper examines utilizing Ontario province electricity grid that is based mostly on CO2-free sources of electric power to generate hydrogen by electrolysis using the concept of ‘power-to-gas’. Consequently, the study evaluates the deployment of a series of 1 MW nameplate capacity polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers to produce 25 MMscfd of hydrogen for a refinery, instead of the conventional pathway based on steam methane reforming. It assesses the production costs and life cycle emissions for five production scenarios to meet the hydrogen demand of the refinery. Aspen HYSYS and mixed integer linear programming models are employed for the purpose of this study. Steam methane reforming provides a lower cost hydrogen under low natural gas prices, even with stringent carbon-pricing policy. However, the renewable electrolytic hydrogen production method shows a potential to curb significant carbon emissions from steam methane reforming level, increasing the CO2 free energy and renewable content of the gasoline and design within the life cycle production scheme. This power-to-gas hydrogen production can be compared to eliminating as many as 34,893 gasoline passenger vehicles from the road. Accordingly, supplying electrolytic hydrogen to a refinery by a grid powered from clean energy sources is considered a good venue for providing decarbonization of petroleum fuels. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Hydrogen production; Life cycle assessment; Oil refining; Power-to-Gas; Process modeling; Process optimization","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Free energy; Gas industry; Gasoline; Gasoline refining; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Integer programming; Methane; Natural gas; Optimization; Petroleum refineries; Polyelectrolytes; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Steam; Steam reforming; Efficient technology; Electrolytic hydrogen; Electrolytic hydrogen production; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mixed integer linear programming model; Oil refining; Polymer electrolyte membranes; Process Modeling; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021321839

One of the silvicultural treatments that has gained currency to lessen the impacts of climatic change is the reduction of stand density by thinning. However, we lack information on how the response of forest stands to different thinning treatments will be affected by climate change, and on the post-thinning temporal dynamics of water balance, specifically blue and green water. We adopted a modelling approach to explore the long-term effects of different thinning intensities on forest dynamics and water balance under climate change scenarios, coupling an individual-based model of forest dynamics (SORTIE-ND) with a mechanistic model of soil moisture dynamics and plant drought stress. We used as a case study three Scots pine plots across a gradient of climatic conditions, and we assessed the effect of site, three climatic scenarios and eight thinning intensities on tree growth, stand productivity, tree drought stress and blue water. The best thinning intensity in terms of stand productivity was obtained when between 20 and 40% of the basal area was removed, whereas the final stand stock rapidly decreased at higher thinning intensities. Moreover, the decrease in final basal area occurred at lower thinning intensities the drier the site conditions. Moderate and heavy thinnings (>30%) doubled basal area increment (BAI) of the following years in all the plots, although the effect vanished after 30–40 years, independently of the site and climate scenario. As expected, thinning was simulated to have an overall positive effect on the blue water yield and tree water status, which increased and also tended to last longer for higher thinning intensities. However, the magnitude of this effect on tree water status was most dependent on the site and climatic scenario, as drier conditions generally raised stronger and longer lasting reductions in drought stress for a given thinning intensity. Furthermore, our results highlight the existence of a site- and climate-dependent trade-off between the gain in stand productivity and the improvement in tree water status obtained by thinning, particularly for moderate or heavy thinning intensities. Our simulations suggest that thinning is a useful management tool to mitigate climate change but strongly argue against the application of general recipes across sites and appeals for carefully taking into consideration local climatic trajectories for management planning. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Drought; Modelling; Pinus sylvestris; Thinning; Water balance","Climate models; Drought; Dynamics; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Models; Productivity; Soil moisture; Climate change scenarios; Individual based model; Mediterranean region; Pinus sylvestris; Silvicultural treatments; Soil moisture dynamics; Thinning; Water balance; Climate change; adaptation; climate change; coniferous forest; drought stress; ecological impact; ecological modeling; environmental gradient; forest management; forestry production; individual-based model; long-term change; Mediterranean environment; silviculture; stand dynamics; thinning; trade-off; water yield; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019022177

Removal of CO2 from flue gases has become an effective way to mitigate CO2 emissions and adsorption is considered to be one of the methods. In particular, adsorption on fine and ultra-fine sorbents in a sound assisted fluidized bed has been proved to be a promising alternative, being able to maximize CO2 adsorption capacity and kinetics. However, before the design of an adsorption equipment, investigation of equilibrium and kinetics plays a decisive role. In this work, the previous research was furthered into the investigation of the mechanism (isotherm), nature/strength (thermodynamics) and rate (kinetics) of CO2 adsorption on a commercial activated carbon in a sound assisted fluidized bed. Langmuir and Freundlich equations were used to model the CO2 adsorption isotherm in the low pressure region (i.e. typical of a combustion flue gas). The results revealed that Freundlich equation was more accurate for predicting the adsorbed amount than the Langmuir one, which indicates a heterogeneous surface binding. Then, adsorption behavior was elucidated by energy function such as standard Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy, suggesting the spontaneity and feasibility of adsorption of CO2 by activated carbon, and its exothermic and physical nature. The isosteric heat of adsorption was also evaluated; its decrease with surface loading further indicated the heterogeneity of adsorption sites and also variation in adsorbate–adsorbent interactions. Finally, this study also presented a kinetic analysis of CO2 adsorption, from which CO2 binding on activated carbon was deduced to follow pseudo-first order kinetic. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 adsorption; Freundlich; Kinetics; Langmuir; Sound assisted fludization; Thermodynamics","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Binding energy; Carbon dioxide; Enzyme kinetics; Flue gases; Fluidized bed combustion; Fossil fuels; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Kinetics; Thermoacoustics; Thermodynamics; CO2 adsorption; Commercial activated carbons; Fludization; Freundlich; Isosteric heat of adsorption; Langmuir and Freundlich equations; Langmuirs; Pseudo-first order kinetics; Fluidized beds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017475730

These carbon-poor objects include the parent bodies of primitive meteorites, suggesting that at least one process responsible for solid-phase carbon depletion was active prior to the early stages of planet formation. Potential mechanisms include the erosion of carbonaceous materials by photons or atomic oxygen in the surface layers of the protoplanetary disk. Under photochemically generated favorable conditions, these reactions can deplete the near-surface abundance of carbon grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by several orders of magnitude on short timescales relative to the lifetime of the disk out to radii of ∼20-100+ au from the central star depending on the form of refractory carbon present. Due to the reliance of destruction mechanisms on a high influx of photons, the extent of refractory carbon depletion is quite sensitive to the disk's internal radiation field. Dust transport within the disk is required to affect the composition of the midplane. In our current model of a passive, constant-α disk, where α = 0.01, carbon grains can be turbulently lofted into the destructive surface layers and depleted out to radii of ∼3-10 au for 0.1-1 μm grains. Smaller grains can be cleared out of the planet-forming region completely. Destruction may be more effective in an actively accreting disk or when considering individual grain trajectories in non-idealized disks. © 2017. The American Astronomical Society.

We argue that countries with longer statehood experience around the time of colonization were better equipped to implement the legal philosophies transplanted by their colonial powers. Therefore, the implications of receiving British common law versus French civil law should be particularly important in countries with a greater accumulated history of statehood. Using a cross-section of up to 78 former colonies, our results provide support for this hypothesis. In particular, our estimates demonstrate that common law countries have weaker modern climate change policies than civil law countries and the difference is inflated by a longer statehood experience, measured by the length of state history from 1 to 1800 AD. Legal origin has no effect in areas which, by the time of colonization, had no statehood experience. Finally, we report similar results for the pattern of labor market regulations.

In theory, ICT is among the sources contributing to the increasing levels of CO2 emissions in terms of production of ICT machinery and devices, energy consumption, and recycling of electronic waste. However, ICT is also expected to reduce CO2 emissions on a global scale by developing smarter cities, transportation systems, electrical grids, industrial processes, and energy saving gains. These two effects work in opposite direction, creating an inverted-U relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions. The aim of this study is to investigate this non-linear relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions on a global scale. Given that global warming is a global issue, it is necessary to look at this relationship in countries at all levels of development. To this end, we use a panel data set consisting of 142 economies, split into 116 developing and 26 developed countries, over the period 1995–2010. The results of our empirical study confirm that the relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions is an inverted U-shaped relationship. Moreover, while for the sample of developing countries, the ICT turning point is well above the mean value, the opposite is true for the sample of developed countries. This implies that many developed countries have already attained the level of ICT development, at which CO2 emissions decreases as the level of ICT development improves further. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Developed economies; Developing economies; Environmental Kuznets curve; ICT; Panel data","Developing countries; Economics; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Machinery; Sustainable development; Developed economies; Developing economies; Environmental Kuznets curves; Environmental sustainability; Information and Communication Technologies; Non-linear relationships; Panel data; Transportation system; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010199499

First, multivariate statistical techniques (factor analysis and cluster analysis) were applied to groundwater monitoring data, to identify specific contaminations of the captured groundwater and their spatial distribution. In detail, eight typical compositions of captured groundwater and their distribution in DWS units were identified, leading to the selection of different treatment processes to be adopted in DWS units. Then, process performances were experimentally evaluated on representative groundwater samples. Heterotrophic denitrification was tested at pilotscale on groundwater contaminated by nitrate, identifying optimal operating and design parameters for complying with regulation limits. Granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption was tested at laboratory-scale for the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and pesticides, present in various ratios in groundwater samples: removal efficiencies were obtained and the occurrence of competition phenomena was highlighted.

Although a permanent increase of temperature strongly affects plant immunity, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved are still poorly characterized. In this study, we aimed to uncover the genetic bases of resistance mechanisms that are efficient at elevated temperature to the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC), one of the most harmful phytobacteria causing bacterial wilt. To start the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with natural variation of response to R. solanacearum, we adopted a genome wide association (GWA) mapping approach using 176 worldwide natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana inoculated with the R. solanacearum GMI1000 strain. Following two different procedures of root-inoculation (root apparatus cut vs. uncut), plants were grown either at 27 or 30°C, with the latter temperature mimicking a permanent increase in temperature. At 27°C, the RPS4/RRS1-R locus was the main QTL of resistance detected regardless of the method of inoculation used. This highlights the power of GWA mapping to identify functionally important loci for resistance to the GMI1000 strain. At 30°C, although most of the accessions developed wilting symptoms, we identified several QTLs that were specific to the inoculation method used. We focused on a QTL region associated with response to the GMI1000 strain in the early stages of infection and, by adopting a reverse genetic approach, we functionally validated the involvement of a strictosidine synthase-like 4 (SSL4) protein that shares structural similarities with animal proteins known to play a role in animal immunity. © 2017 Aoun, Tauleigne, Lonjon, Deslandes, Vailleau, Roux and Berthomé.","Arabidopsis thaliana; Climate warming; Genome wide association mapping; Natural diversity; Quantitative disease resistance; Ralstonia solanacearum",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029179129

The data and samples in this study were obtained during the oceanographic cruise Camadas Finas III in October 2012 along the Amazon River-Ocean Continuum (AROC). The cruise occurred during boreal autumn, when the river plume reaches its maximum eastward extent. In this study, we examine the links between physics, biogeochemistry and plankton community structure along the AROC. Hydrographic results showed very different conditions, ranging from shallow well-mixed coastal waters to offshore areas, where low salinity Amazonian waters mix with open ocean waters. Nutrients, mainly NO3- and SiO2-, were highly depleted in coastal regions, and the magnitude of primary production was greater than that of respiration (negative apparent oxygen utilization). In terms of phytoplankton groups, diatoms dominated the region from the river mouth to the edge of the area affected by the North Brazil Current (NBC) retroflection (with chlorophyll a concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 0.94 mg m-3). The North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC) region, east of retroflection, is fully oligotrophic and the most representative groups are Cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates. Additionally, in this region, blooms of cyanophyte species were associated with diatoms and Mesozooplankton (copepods). A total of 178 zooplankton taxa were observed in this area, with Copepoda being the most diverse and abundant group. Two different zooplankton communities were identified: a low-diversity, high-abundance coastal community and a high-diversity, low-abundance oceanic community offshore. The CO2 fugacity (fCO2sw), calculated from total alkalinity (1,450 &lt; TA &lt; 2,394 μmol kg-1) and dissolved inorganic carbon (1,303 &lt; DIC &lt; 2,062 μmol kg-1) measurements, confirms that the Amazon River plume is a sink of atmospheric CO2 in areas with salinities &lt;35 psu, whereas, in regions with salinities &gt;35 and higher-intensity winds, the CO2 flux is reversed. Lower fCO2sw values were observed in the NECC area. The δfCO2 in this region was less than 5 μatm (-0.3 mmol m-2 d-1), while the δfCO2 in the coastal region was approximately 50 μatm (+3.7 mmol m-2 d-1). During the cruise, heterotrophic and autotrophic processes were observed and are indicative of the influences of terrestrial material and biological activity, respectively. © 2017 Araujo, Noriega, Hounsou-gbo, Veleda, Araujo, Bruto, Feitosa, Flores-Montes, Lefèvre, Melo, Otsuka, Travassos, Schwamborn and Neumann-Leitão.","Amazon river-ocean continuum; Biogeochemistry; Camadas Finas III; Carbon cycle; Plankton communities; Tropical Atlantic","ammonia; carbon; nitrite; phosphate; alkalinity; Article; autumn; biogeochemistry; biological activity; chemical analysis; cluster analysis; density; hydrography; microbial community; molecular physics; nonhuman; nutrient; oxygen consumption; plankton; principal component analysis; river; salinity; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026626669

Bioelectrochemical CO2 conversion to (mainly) acetate has mostly been demonstrated in batch processes. Continuous reactor operation and the operational parameters associated with it have received limited attention. Here, we demonstrate that improving bioelectrochemical reactor design to a higher cathode surface to volume ratio results in an enhanced acetate titer; 5.7 ± 0.74 g L-1 (11.5 ± 6.6 g m-2 d-1) in galvanostastically controlled (-5 A m-2 cathode) batch reactors with a mixed microbial community. A long-term and stable bioproduction process could be established in which hydraulic residence time (HRT) affected the product patterns as well as the acetate production rate, up to 21 g m-2 d-1 for an HRT of 3.3d (63% coulombic efficiency) was achieved; the highest reported thus far in a continuous process. The specific energy input per kilogram of acetic acid produced during batch and continuous processes (HRT: 3.3d) was 29 ± 0.7 and 16 ± 1.3 kWhel kg-1, respectively. Butyrate and isopropanol were the other major biochemicals produced at maximum rates of 3.7 and 3.3 g m-2 d-1 (18.6% and 21.8% of the electrons, respectively) leading to titers of 0.67 and 0.82 g L-1 during the continuous process. This is the first report on the production of a secondary alcohol (isopropanol), using a mixed culture, in CO2 fed systems. The product ratios between these organics could be steered based on operational pH and HRTs. Operating reactors at an HRT of 5 d at pH 5 led to stable production of butyrate (1.9 ± 0.6 g m-2 d-1) and isopropanol (1.17 ± 0.34 g m-2 d-1). Cyclic voltammetry suggested an ""ennoblement"" of the cathode over time, shifting the onset for reductive current by more than 150 mV. Microbial community analysis revealed Acetobacterium as the main bacterial group involved in CO2 reduction to acetate, and the presence of diverse bacterial groups in response to different operational conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

But empirical evidence on the extent to which such changes affect the soil-atmosphere exchange of trace gases is still scarce, especially in Africa. We investigated the effect of LU on soil trace gas production in the Mau Forest Complex region, Kenya. Intact soil cores were taken from natural forest, commercial and smallholder tea plantations, eucalyptus plantations and grazing lands, and were incubated in the lab under different soil moisture conditions. Soil fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were quantified, and we approximated annual estimates of soil N2O and NO fluxes using soil moisture values measured in situ. Forest and eucalyptus plantations yielded annual fluxes of 0.3–1.3 kg N2O–N ha−1 a−1 and 1.5–5.2 kg NO–N ha−1 a−1. Soils of commercial tea plantations, which are highly fertilized, showed higher fluxes (0.9 kg N2O–N ha−1 a−1 and 4.3 kg NO–N ha−1 a−1) than smallholder tea plantations (0.1 kg N2O–N ha−1 a−1 and 2.1 kg NO–N ha−1 a−1) or grazing land (0.1 kg N2O–N ha−1 a−1 and 1.1 kg NO–N ha−1 a−1). High soil NO fluxes were probably the consequence of long-term N fertilization and associated soil acidification, likely promoting chemodenitrification. Our experimental approach can be implemented in understudied regions, with the potential to increase the amount of information on production and consumption of trace gases from soils. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Carbon dioxide; Land use change; Nitric oxide; Nitrous oxide; Soils; Tropical forests","acidification; air-soil interaction; biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; forest ecosystem; land use; montane forest; nitric oxide; nitrous oxide; soil moisture; trace gas; tropical forest; Kenya; Mau Forest; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020410024

Due to the extreme political upheaval wrought by the Trump administration's dismantling of federal climate change programs, many state and local governments are considering new policy approaches. Yet by ignoring crucial aspects of politics and intergovernmental relations, the adaptive governance literature provides little guidance for such substantial issues. This paper introduces the concept of strategic adaptive governance, a framework for permitting policymakers to achieve the highest rate of compliance possible under existing conditions and constraints involving state and local policy, despite political upheaval. The strategic adaptive governance model embraces politics, accounts for the role of central authorities, and emphasizes the motivations, resources, and interdependencies of affected parties. We apply the model in an analysis of California's Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32), examining the extent to which it aligns with strategic adaptive governance, and evaluating the potential for the state to utilize the model. We find that AB 32 aligns moderately with strategic adaptive governance, and discuss how the model could help protect and enhance policy gains. More broadly, strategic adaptive governance provides a generic and universal framework for policymakers interested in tactical formulation of any regulatory policy. © 2017 by the authors.

However, only 10% of the original meadows survive.  Future restoration efforts will be complicated by accelerating climate change, including physiological stressors such as a predicted mean temperature increase of 2–6°C and a 50–160% increase in CO2 concentrations. Outcomes: As the Chesapeake Bay begins to exhibit characteristics of a subtropical estuary, summer heat waves will become more frequent and severe. Warming alone would eventually eliminate eelgrass (Zostera marina) from the region. It will favor native heat-tolerant species such as widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima) while facilitating colonization by non-native seagrasses (e.g., Halodule spp.). Intensifying human activity will also fuel coastal zone acidification and the resulting high CO2/low pH conditions may benefit SAV via a “CO2 fertilization effect.” Discussion: Acidification is known to offset the effects of thermal stress and may have similar effects in estuaries, assuming water clarity is sufficient to support CO2-stimulated photosynthesis and plants are not overgrown by epiphytes. However, coastal zone acidification is variable, driven mostly by local biological processes that may or may not always counterbalance the effects of regional warming. This precarious equipoise between two forces–thermal stress and acidification–will be critically important because it may ultimately determine the fate of cool-water plants such as Zostera marina in the Chesapeake Bay. Conclusion: The combined impacts of warming, coastal zone acidification, water clarity, and overgrowth of competing algae will determine the fate of SAV communities in rapidly changing temperate estuaries. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

The sustainable usage of recycled plastic and demolition wastes as alternative construction materials has numerous environmental and economic advantages. New opportunities to recycle plastic and demolition wastes into alternative resource materials for construction industries would mitigate landfill issues and significantly reduce global carbon emissions. Infrastructure projects typically consume significant quantities of virgin quarry materials, hence the usage of plastic and demolition wastes as alternative construction materials will divert significant quantities of these wastes from landfills. In this research, three types of recycled plastic waste granules: Linear Low Density Polyethylene filled with Calcium Carbonate (LDCAL), High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) were evaluated in blends with Crushed Brick (CB) and Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP). The blends prepared were evaluated in terms of strength, stiffness and resilient moduli. Resilient moduli prediction models were proposed using Repeated Load Triaxial (RLT) tests to characterize the stiffness properties of the plastic/demolition waste blends. Polyethylene plastic granules with up to 5% content were found to be suitable as a road construction material, when blended in supplementary amounts with demolition wastes.

Two hundred cocoa farmers were interviewed in nine cocoa farming communities. Selected farms were also visited to document on-farm manifestation of climate impacts as well as innovations and strategies farmers are employing to respond to the adverse impacts of climate change on their cocoa systems. The results revealed various manifestations of climate impacts on cocoa farms which included, increased incidence of pests and diseases, wilting of cocoa leaves, high mortality of cocoa seedlings which affected expansion and farm rehabilitation, and wilting of cherelles resulting in low yield. The farmers maintained that their response to the immediate impacts of climate on cocoa was a shift to cereals due to the unpredictable climatic patterns and the shortened duration of rainfall. However, a combination of storage and supply chain challenges and low returns from cereal production, coupled with land scarcity in the Western Region, where most of them are migrant farmers accounted for their decision to return to cocoa production lately. It was observed, among other adaptive responses, that some farmers plant about three times the plantain suckers they usually plant, to provide a dense temporary shade over cocoa seedlings, and resort to planting more cocoa seedlings randomly per unit area on new farms, contrary to recommended planting approach, as a form of insurance against seedling mortality. More importantly, a community-based fire response system was identified to be a major safeguard mechanism to the threat of fire. Clearly, the farmers are not replanting cocoa in the forest-savanna agro ecological landscape because it is more productive than cereals, but they believe that a low yielding cocoa is far better than a productive cereal cropping systems that offer low returns when compared to cocoa. The study brings out the sustainable livelihood challenges of the rural farmer within the context of a changing climate for appropriate policy response. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Agro-ecological zone; Landuse; Livelihood; Smallholder; Theobroma cacao","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; cocoa; crop production; cropping practice; farmers attitude; land use; livelihood; savanna; smallholder; Ghana; Theobroma cacao",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019611423

We estimate the air quality and climate benefits of two measures applied to aircraft operations at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport – pushback control and de-rated takeoffs. We also calculate the minimum air quality and environmental impacts beyond fuel burn and CO2 minimization by optimizing gate holding and takeoff thrust hourly over the year. Pushback control (i.e. holding aircraft at their gates up to 25 min to reduce congestion) minimizes fuel burn and reduces emissions and air quality impacts from taxi operations by 35–38% relative to no gate holds. The PM2.5 and O3 costs can be further reduced beyond fuel burn minimization by 2.7% and 8.5%, respectively, by optimizing the gate holds according to time-varying atmospheric conditions. De-rated takeoffs (i.e. takeoffs at 75% thrust) reduce PM2.5 costs from takeoff operations by 18% (up to 21.6% when optimized) relative to full-thrust takeoffs, but result in 3% increased fuel burn and CO2 climate impacts. The environmental costs of takeoff operations are minimized with an average thrust setting of 81%, while total fuel combustion-related costs (i.e. the sum of environmental, fuel and maintenance costs) are minimized with 75% thrust. Our findings suggest that the pushback control strategy is effective in mitigating the environmental impacts of taxi operations at airports, and that de-rated takeoffs are effective in reducing the environmental costs of takeoff operations at an optimal level of de-rate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Climate; De-rated takeoffs; Optimization; Pushback control; Tradeoffs","Air quality; Aircraft control; Airports; Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Costs; Fighter aircraft; Fuels; Optimization; Quality control; Rating; Taxicabs; Air quality impacts; Aircraft operations; Atmospheric conditions; Climate; Control strategies; Environmental costs; Pushbacks; Tradeoffs; Environmental impact; air quality; airport; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate effect; emission control; environmental impact; optimization; trade-off; Detroit; Michigan; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020395403

The contribution of African countries to global climate negotiations determines how compatible the negotiated rules could be with the existing socioeconomic and policy circumstances of African countries. The aim of this paper is to explore the agency of Africa (African States) in the global climate change negotiations and discuss possible implications for implementing these rules using REDD+ as a case study. Drawing on document analysis and semi-structured expert interviews, our findings suggest that although African countries are extensively involved in the implementation of REDD+ interventions, the continent has a weak agency on the design of the global REDD+ architecture. This weak agency results from a number of factors including the inability of African countries to send large and diverse delegations to the negotiations as well lack of capacity to generate and transmit research evidence to the global platform. African countries also perceive themselves as victims of climate change who should be eligible for support rather than sources of technological solutions. Again, Africa’s position is fragmented across negotiation coalitions which weakens the continent's collective influence on the REDD+ agenda. This paper discusses a number of implementation deficits which could result from this weak agency. These include concerns about implementation capacity and a potential lack of coherence between REDD+ rules and existing policies in African countries. These findings call for a rethink of pathways to enhancing Africa’s strategies in engaging in multilateral climate change negotiations, especially if climate change regimes specifically targeted at developing countries are to be effective. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Actors; Africa; Agency; Implementation; REDD+ design","climate change; deforestation; developing world; emission control; environmental planning; environmental policy; expert system; forest management; global climate; institutional framework; negotiation process; policy implementation; project design; socioeconomic conditions; sustainable development; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975127254

The research aimed at seismically defining the geometries of hydrocarbon reservoirs with detailed emphasis on channels in the offshore belt of Niger Delta. The methodology involved the use of three dimensional seismic reflection data, check shot velocity data, core data and well log data in order to generate all necessary interpretations for the study. The application of seismic attributes would display superior images of the channels because multi-attribute improves imaging of geological structures and strongly defines the depositional environment. The result of the seismic facies analysis shows that the Rence Field can be distinguished into layered complexes and chaotic complexes seismic facies. The outcome of well to seismic ties show maximum and minimum amplitude reflection events for sand and shale units respectively. Rence Field is structurally defined by four regional faults and twelve minor faults comprising of antithetic and synthetic faults. One mega-channel running in transverse direction to the basin dominates the stratigrphic landscape around the field. This channel future is characterized by sinuosity of 1.3. A depositional model produced from the attribute maps signifies sub-aqueous channel environment of deposition. The attribute map also shows that there was shifting in location of barrier bars that are randomly scattered all over the area. This could be attributed to growth faults mechanism in Niger Delta. At the flanks of the sinusoidal channel there are prominent sand point bars sequences. This model shows a good shoreface environment with a sequence prograding upwards. The channel elements found within the study area are meander loop cut-off deposits, lateral accretionary channel deposits, and vertical accretionary channel deposits. These channel deposits constitute the hydrocarbon exploration target within the Rence Field of Niger Delta, Nigeria. © 2017 SEG.",,"Hydrocarbons; Image enhancement; Offshore oil well production; Petroleum prospecting; Seismic prospecting; Seismology; Well logging; Accretionary; Core datum; Data log; Hydrocarbon reservoir; Niger Delta; Nigeria; Offshores; Seismic attributes; Three-dimensional seismic reflection data; Velocities data; Deposits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065032405

Aldo–keto reductase (AKR) is a group of enzymes metabolizing aldehyde/ketone to the corresponding alcohol using NADPH as the cofactor. In this study, OsI_20197 (AKR4C15), a novel member of AKR4 subfamily C, was isolated and biochemically characterized. Kinetic studies on bacterially-expressed recombinant AKR4C15 revealed that the enzyme was capable of metabolizing a wide variety of aldehydes but clearly exhibited a preference for three carbon compounds, i.e. methylglyoxal, malondialdehyde and glyceraldehyde. In comparison with His-tagged proteins of AKR4C9 from Arabidopsis and several other rice AKR(s): OsI_04426, OsI_04428, OsI_04429, and OsI_15387, AKR4C15 was the one capable of most efficiently metabolizing MDA and had the highest value of catalytic efficiency, which was higher than the value of AKR4C9, approximately, by 30-fold; while its capability of metabolizing MG was on par with AKR4C9, OsI_04426 and OsI_04428 (AKR4C14); and was considerably higher than the activity of OsI_04429 and OsI_15387. In vivo research on transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings ectopically-expressing AKR4C15 showed that the levels of both MDA and MG were also significantly lower than the levels in wild-type seedlings under both normal and stress conditions, emphasizing the role of AKR4C15 in MG and MDA metabolism. In conclusion, AKR4C15, together with OsI_04426 and AKR4C14, may play protective roles against small reactive aldehydes and medium-chain aldehydes. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","AKR4C15; Aldo–keto reductase; Malondialdehyde; Methylglyoxal; Reactive aldehyde; Rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp.

However, within-species variability of responses may impact the stabilizing effect of growth asynchrony. We used tree ring data to investigate the diversity–stability relationship and its underlying mechanisms within the temperate and boreal mixed woods of Eastern Canada. We worked at the individual tree level to take into account the intraspecific variability of responses to environmental fluctuations. We found that species diversity stabilized growth in forest ecosystems. The asynchrony of species’ response to climatic fluctuations and to insect outbreaks explained this effect. We also found that the intraspecific variability of responses to environmental fluctuations was high, making the stabilizing effect of diversity highly variable. Synthesis. Our results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that the asynchrony of species’ response to environmental fluctuations drives the stabilizing effect of diversity. The intraspecific variability of these responses modulates the stabilizing effect of species diversity.

The inclusion of a cover crop in a corn bioenergy system could provide additional biomass, mitigating the negative effects of residue removal by adding to stable soil C pools. In a no-till continuous corn bioenergy system in the northern US Corn Belt, we used 13CO2 pulse labeling to trace plant C from a winter rye (Secale cereale) cover crop into different soil C pools for 2 years following rye cover crop termination. Corn stover left as residue (30% of total stover) contributed 66, corn roots 57, rye shoots 61, rye roots 50, and rye rhizodeposits 25 g C m−2 to soil. Five months following cover crop termination, belowground cover crop inputs were three times more likely to remain in soil C pools than were aboveground inputs, and much of the root-derived C was in mineral-associated soil fractions. After 2 years, both above- and belowground inputs had declined substantially, indicating that the majority of both root and shoot inputs are eventually mineralized. Our results underscore the importance of cover crop roots vs. shoots and the importance of cover crop rhizodeposition (33% of total belowground cover crop C inputs) as a source of soil C. However, the eventual loss of most cover crop C from these soils indicates that cover crops will likely need to be included every year in rotations to accumulate soil C. © 2017 The Authors.

A substantial fraction of protoplanetary disks form around stellar binaries. The binary system generates a time-dependent non-axisymmetric gravitational potential, inducing strong tidal forces on the circumbinary disk. This leads to a change in basic physical properties of the circumbinary disk, which should in turn result in unique structures that are potentially observable with the current generation of instruments. Aims. The goal of this study is to identify these characteristic structures, constrain the physical conditions that cause them, and evaluate the feasibility of observing them in circumbinary disks. Methods. To achieve this, first we perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations. The resulting density distributions are post-processed with a 3D radiative transfer code to generate re-emission and scattered light maps. Based on these distributions, we study the influence of various parameters, such as the mass of the stellar components, mass of the disk, and binary separation on observable features in circumbinary disks. Results. We find that the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimetre Array (ALMA) as well as the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) are capable of tracing asymmetries in the inner region of circumbinary disks, which are affected most by the binary-disk interaction. Observations at submillimetre/millimetre wavelengths allow the detection of the density waves at the inner rim of the disk and inner cavity. With the E-ELT one can partially resolve the innermost parts of the disk in the infrared wavelength range, including the disk's rim, accretion arms, and potentially the expected circumstellar disks around each of the binary components. © ESO, 2017.","Accretion, accretion disks; Binaries: general; Hydrodynamics; Radiative transfer","Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; Radiative transfer; Stars; Accretion , accretion disks; Binaries: general; Density distributions; Extremely Large Telescopes; Gravitational potential; Hydrodynamic simulation; Infrared wavelengths; Radiative transfer codes; Bins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026725971

Of these vehicles, the penetration of hybrid vehicles in the market has much potential for growth in the next few years. The adoption of these vehicles has been limited by the high cost of HEV's, which have less uptake in developing regions. Considering this point, developing countries would see the greatest benefit in adopting HEV technology. A mild hybrid system has an observable advantage in these markets due to its maximum benefit/cost ratio when compared to a full hybrid, plug-in hybrid or electric vehicles. This paper discusses the development of a mild hybrid system for such markets with a focus on improving drive performance and efficiency. To achieve this, high power density ultracapacitors are used based on their fast charging and discharging characteristics, together with intelligent drivetrain control taking advantage of the ultracapacitors' characteristics to deliver smooth torque delivery during gear change (torque-filling). A comparison and analysis is undertaken, of both conventional powertrain and an otherwise identical powertrain but for the incorporation of components required for the mild hybrid system. Software models simulated the powertrains in specific driving conditions, with observations made of the advantages of MHEV over conventional drivetrains. The model demonstrated increased fuel efficiency and performance. © 2017 IEEE.","Manual transmission; Mild HEV; Shift quality; Simulation; Torque hole; Ultracapacitor; Vehicle","Charging (batteries); Commerce; Developing countries; Efficiency; Electric batteries; Electric utilities; Emission control; Fuel economy; Hybrid systems; Hybrid vehicles; Land vehicle propulsion; Powertrains; Secondary batteries; Supercapacitor; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicles; Comparison and analysis; Discharging characteristics; Electrified vehicles; Manual transmissions; Mild HEV; Shift quality; Simulation; System analysis and modeling; Plug-in hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028582788

Due to differing periods in data availability, this study used the time period 1995-2009 for analysis, in order to maintain a common period for all the series. First, the trend of productivity, prices, and climate change was analyzed using visual plots and results indicate some level of variability in these series over time. Second, a three stage least square regression was used to simultaneously analyze the effect of climate change on productivity and prices.

On one hand, debates concerning the legitimacy and democratic deficits of international politics continue unabated. On the other, the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has progressively engaged in processes of orchestration culminating in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Scholarship on orchestration has almost exclusively focused on how to ensure effectiveness while excluding normative questions. This lacuna is addressed by arguing that orchestration should be assessed according to its democratic credentials. The promises and pitfalls of orchestration can be usefully analyzed by applying a set of democratic values: participation, deliberation, accountability, and transparency.

The main limiting factors for greenhouse cultivation in such areas are the high ambient temperatures with low humidity (sometimes with high humidity in coastal areas), typical of these regions during almost all the year, and the availability of good quality water for irrigation and eventually for cooling. Therefore, the technological options for protected cultivation in these areas are quite dependent on the average maximum temperatures along the year. If the area has average maximum temperatures not higher than 30-35°C during the autumn, winter and spring months, a lower technology approach can be used, combining the use of simple plastic covered structures, with high natural ventilation capacity (i.e. retractable roof greenhouses or similar technological approaches), selective mobile shading screens (NIR reflection) and/or evaporative cooling, provided that quality water is available or can be produced. During the summer months, cultivation could be moved to highlands, with cooler night-time temperatures, using screenhouses combined with fogging (low or high pressure, depending on the water quality). If temperatures are higher than 30-35°C during the whole year, pad and fan combined with selective shading is possibly the best option, avoiding cultivation during the summer months, but limiting the size of the greenhouses. Other more sophisticated technologies have been proposed for these regions, which involve in many cases closing the greenhouse and using highly energy dependent active cooling systems and different ways of seawater desalination. The high energy required to cool actively the greenhouses makes it essential to study carefully the possibilities of using renewable energies (wind, solar, geothermal, etc.) to cover at least, a part of large energy demand, as well as to establish resource conserving climate control strategies. In many cases and for some crops under extreme environments, food security concerns and urbanization makes reasonable to consider the possibility of indoor cultivation (plant factories) as potential economic option if they are demonstrated as resource conserving and profitable technologies and production mechanism. © 2017 ISHS.","Desalination; Evaporative cooling; Humidity; Natural ventilation; Selective shading",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029584081

However, current approach, such as microspectroscopy and attenuated total reflection spectroscopy, does not allow for high-throughput protocols. This study at hand suggests a new spectroscopic method for high-throughput characterization of pollen. Samples were measured as thin films of pollen fragments using a Bruker FTIR spectrometer with a high-throughput eXTension (HTS-XT) unit employing 384-well plates. In total, 146 pollen samples, belonging to 31 different pollen species of Fagaceae and Betulaceae and collected during three consecutive years (2012–2014) at locations in Croatia, Germany and Norway, were analysed. Critical steps in the sample preparation and measurement, such as variabilities between technical replicates, between microplates and between spectrometers, were studied. Measurement variations due to sample preparation, microplate holders and instrumentation were low, and thus allowed differentiation of samples with respect to phylogeny and biogeography. The spectral variability for a range of Fagales species (Fagus, Quercus, Betula, Corylus, Alnus and Ostrya) showed high-species-specific differences in pollen's chemical composition due to either location or year. Statistically significant inter-annual and locational differences in the pollen spectra indicate that pollen chemical composition has high phenotypic plasticity and is influenced by local climate conditions. The variations in composition are connected to lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and sporopollenins that play crucial roles in cold and desiccation tolerance, protection against UV radiation and as material and energy reserves. The results of this study demonstrate the value of high-throughput FTIR approach for the systematic collection of data on ecosystems. The novel FTIR approach offers fast, reliable and economical screening of large number of samples by semi-automated methodology. The high-throughput approach could provide crucial understanding on plant–climate interactions with respect to biochemical variation within genera, species and populations. © 2016 The Authors.

Application of silicon as a metallic agent in Al2 03 - C slide gate plate production is usual. In fact, a non-oxide bond can be generated due to the reaction between silicon and carbon under reducing atmosphere in the plate matrix. This non-oxide bond can enhance the mechanical strength and abrasion resistance. In order to improve the mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties, functional additives can be aimed to lower the sintering temperature and tailor the microstructure. For this reason, the effect of a special solid state sintering aid addition on the microstructure and thermo-mechanical properties of Al2 03 - C slide gate plates in the presence of Si as a metallic component has been investigated. Two types of specimens were pressed at 150 MPa, tempered at 200 °C and fired in coke bed at 1 400 °C, respectively. Physical (BD and AP), mechanical (CCS and MOR) and thermo-mechanical (HMOR) properties were determined; in addition, phase composition was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and microstructure of specimens was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM).

The city's poor air quality is a result of steady economic growth, and stable atmospheric conditions adverse to mixing and ventilation that favor the formation of oxidants and secondary aerosols. Identifying and quantifying the sources that contribute to the ambient levels of pollutants is key for designing adequate mitigation measures. Estimating the evolution of source contributions to ambient pollution levels is also paramount to evaluating the effectiveness of pollution reduction measures that have been implemented in recent decades. Here, we quantify the main sources that have contributed to fine particulate matter (PM2. 5) between April 1998 and August 2012 in downtown Santiago by using two different source-receptor models (PMF5.0 and UNMIX 6.0) that were applied to elemental measurements of 1243 24h filter samples of ambient PM2.5. PMF resolved six sources that contributed to ambient PM2. 5, with UNMIX producing similar results: motor vehicles (37.3±1.1%), industrial sources (18.5±1.3%), copper smelters (14.4±0.8%), wood burning (12.3±1.0%), coastal sources (9.5±0.7%) and urban dust (3.0±1.2%). Our results show that over the 15 years analyzed here, four of the resolved sources significantly decreased [95% confidence interval]: motor vehicles 21.3% [2.6, 36.5], industrial sources 39.3% [28.6, 48.4], copper smelters 81.5% [75.5, 85.9], and coastal sources 58.9% [38.5, 72.5], while wood burning did not significantly change and urban dust increased by 72% [48.9, 99.9]. These changes are consistent with emission reduction measures, such as improved vehicle emission standards, cleaner smelting technology, introduction of low-sulfur diesel for vehicles and natural gas for industrial processes, public transport improvements, etc. However, it is also apparent that the mitigation expected from the above regulations has been partially offset by the increasing amount of private vehicle use in the city, with motor vehicles becoming the dominant source of ambient PM2. 5 in recent years. Consequently, Santiago still experiences ambient PM2. 5 levels above the annual and 24h Chilean and World Health Organization standards, and further regulations are required to reach ambient air quality standards. © 2017 Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028605501

It is unknown whether systemic hypoxia, evoked by hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) has efficacy in priming the heat shock protein (Hsp) system thus reducing reperfusion stress following blood flow occlusion, in the same manner as IPC. The comparison between IPC and HPC being relevant as a preconditioning strategy prior to orthopedic surgery. In an independent group design, 18 healthy men were exposed to 40 min of (1) passive whole-body HPC (FiO2 = 0.143; no ischemia. N = 6), (2) IPC (FiO2 = 0.209; four bouts of 5 min ischemia and 5 min reperfusion. n = 6), or (3) rest (FiO2 = 0.209; no ischemia. n = 6). The interventions were administered 1 h prior to 30 min of tourniquet derived femoral blood flow occlusion and were followed by 2 h subsequent reperfusion. Systemic blood samples were taken pre- and post-intervention. Systemic blood and gastrocnemius skeletal muscle samples were obtained pre-, 15 min post- (15PoT) and 120 min (120PoT) post-tourniquet deflation. To determine the cellular stress response gastrocnemius and leukocyte Hsp72 mRNA and Hsp32 mRNA gene transcripts were determined by RT-qPCR. The plasma oxidative stress response (protein carbonyl, reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio) was measured utilizing commercially available kits. In comparison to control, at 15PoT a significant difference in gastrocnemius Hsp72 mRNA was seen in HPC (-1.93-fold; p = 0.007) and IPC (-1.97-fold; p = 0.006). No significant differences were observed in gastrocnemius Hsp32 and Hsp72 mRNA, leukocyte Hsp72 and Hsp32 mRNA, or oxidative stress markers (p &gt; 0.05) between HPC and IPC. HPC provided near identical amelioration of blood flow occlusion mediated gastrocnemius stress response (Hsp72 mRNA), compared to an established IPC protocol. This was seen independent of changes in systemic oxidative stress, which likely explains the absence of change in Hsp32 mRNA transcripts within leukocytes and the gastrocnemius. Both the established IPC and novel HPC interventions facilitate a priming of the skeletal muscle, but not leukocyte, Hsp system prior to femoral blood flow occlusion. This response demonstrates a localized tissue specific adaptation which may ameliorate reperfusion stress. © 2017 Barrington, Chrismas, Gibson, Tuttle, Pegrum, Govilkar, Kabir, Giannakakis, Rayan, Okasheh, Sanaullah, Ng Man Sun, Pearce and Taylor.","Heat shock proteins; Hypoxic preconditioning; Ischemia; Ischemic preconditioning; Knee surgery; Oxidative stress","glutathione; glutathione disulfide; heat shock protein 72; heme oxygenase 1; messenger RNA; adult; Article; blood sampling; cardiovascular function; cell stress; controlled study; femoral artery flow; gastrocnemius muscle; genetic transcription; human; human cell; human experiment; human tissue; hypoxic preconditioning; ischemia; ischemic preconditioning; leukocyte; male; muscle biopsy; normal human; oxidative stress; reperfusion; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tourniquet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026787558

Results indicated that the RCMs were more successful at capturing the seasonal spatial distribution of mean temperature than precipitation and that inaccuracies in the spatial distribution of the summer climate moisture index were likely due to the errors in precipitation distribution and amount. All RCMs performed less well in simulating summer precipitation, most likely due to continued problems with the simulation of convective precipitation. At the grid box scale, quantile–quantile (q–q) plots for temperature indicated that all RCMs showed very similar distributions to observed but with warm or cold biases, and errors in the simulation of a number of temperature-based extremes indices were related to these biases. For precipitation, q–q plots indicated that most RCMs overestimated precipitation totals, and while tending to follow the observed quantiles at smaller precipitation amounts, they diverged at larger precipitation totals. Performance in simulating the precipitation-based extremes indices depended largely on whether or not a RCM over- or under-estimated precipitation totals – with those RCMs simulating too much precipitation underestimating the number of consecutive dry days and dry day persistence, and vice versa. Despite improvements in RCM resolution and parameterisation schemes, this work indicates that the simulation of precipitation in particular is still problematic in western Canada. This implies that scenarios of climate change constructed from RCM output require some form of bias correction to be of most use in impacts studies. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society","climate change; extremes; performance; RCMs; scenarios","Climate models; Spatial distribution; Convective precipitation; Extremes; National center for environmental predictions; Performance; Precipitation distribution; RCMs; Scenarios; Spatial and temporal scale; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; extreme event; performance assessment; precipitation assessment; regional climate; spatiotemporal analysis; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014946523

Tropical rural populations, with livelihoods dependent on agriculture, are particularly vulnerable to climate variability and changes. To develop climate change social communication, plan and implement adaptation, it is necessary to understand regional/local climate process, risks and opportunities. It is also important to understand how local populations perceive such changes and adapt their livelihoods. Limited information is available on climate change perceptions in tropical Latin American rural populations. Hence, a climate study and climate change perception survey were carried out in the Manizales Municipality, in the Andean region of Colombia and one of its major coffee-growing areas. The study spanned three “thermal” levels in the tropical Andes, 1000 m a.s.l. and above, each with distinct environments and livelihoods. Climate analysis yielded significant warming trends in recent decades, particularly in temperature minima for all levels, but no significant local precipitation trends. The perception survey, carried out in a sparsely populated region, mostly with limited accessibility, included 37 households, with structured and semi-structured interviews, adapted to local culture. Interviewees had little or no previous knowledge on climate change. However, almost all had perceived significant changes in both temperature and precipitation, which impacted their livelihoods and environment. Some perceptions could result from a La Niña event prior to the survey, and other environmental destruction processes. Their responses to change were spontaneous adaptation, based on traditional practices and agricultural technical advice from state agencies and coffee grower associations. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; climate perception; Manizales Colombia; rural population","adaptive management; attitudinal survey; climate change; climate effect; livelihood; perception; policy implementation; public attitude; questionnaire survey; rural area; rural population; trend analysis; tropical region; warming; Caldas; Colombia; Latin America; Manizales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84967214948

In addition, the complexes were equipped with a terminal alkyne group, which was used for the coupling with a Keggin-type polyoxometalate (POM). In this regard, molecular triads were prepared, whereby the central RuII complex should act as a photosensitizer and the POM as an electron acceptor. Certain spectral changes were observed upon attachment of the donors and the POM framework to the RuII complexes. In particular, the emission of the RuII complex became significantly reduced with increasing donor strength, which suggested an intramolecular electron transfer by reductive emission quenching. The introduction of the POM framework revealed no further quenching of the emission and is tentatively ascribed to the minor influence of the electron acceptor on the excited states of the RuII complex. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The process-based model CABALA, an ensemble of global circulation models, and a range of scenarios on plant response to elevated CO2 (eCO2) and site conditions, were used to predict the direct effects of climate change on the productivity and mortality risks for Australia’s blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) plantation estate. The modelling showed considerable uncertainty about future outcomes across large parts of the estate, with best-case and worst-case scenarios varying from decreased to increased production. In some areas we can be confident of future outcomes. Nevertheless, it is clear that, across the whole estate, appropriate management can reduce risk and ensure that we are able to capitalise on potential beneficial aspects of climate change. Under most future scenarios, without adaptation, the drier parts of the plantation estate are at risk. However, in all but the eastern areas of Western Australia, and at the driest margins of the estate in South Australia and Victoria, adaptation options can reduce risk and ensure productivity. Other areas currently at the cold margins of the estate, notably the highlands of Victoria and across Tasmania, appear to increase in productivity under most future scenarios. Even in those areas where productivity may potentially increase, experience suggests that pests and diseases may pose a risk. If we are to benefit from any aspect of climate change, then pursuit of best-practice sustainable forest management is critical. The greatest source of uncertainty in forecasts is associated with how photosynthesis in field-grown trees will respond to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels (eCO2). Regional differences in global circulation model forecasts are important, particularly in Western Australia, where the extent of future rainfall decline significantly impacts predictions. Local site factors, exemplified in this study by soil depth, will play an important role in modulating climate change impacts, particularly through their role in constraining responses to eCO2. © 2017 Institute of Foresters of Australia (IFA).","adaptation; climate change impacts; modelling; mortality","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Forecasting; Forestry; Global warming; Models; Productivity; Risk perception; Uncertainty analysis; adaptation; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Climate change impact; Global circulation model; mortality; Process-based modeling; Regional differences; Sustainable forest management; Climate change; Carbon Dioxide; Climates; Eucalyptus Globulus; Forests",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028531981

ICTs help transportation managers deliver the most dynamic, flexible and cost effective transport options and contribute to achieve cities' climate targets by lowering energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, if the current ICT use puts forward many opportunities for developing a more sustainable mobility system, it also raises many challenges. For instance, it is difficult to measure the real effectiveness of these solutions, if not in terms of the consensus achieved by the local authorities and in budget increase of seller companies. Furthermore, ICTs need sophisticated management systems and have operating costs which seem to be not comparable with the benefits that they provide for. According to this backdrop, EU in the latest communication on ITS (EC, 2013) underlines that 'despite a high number of technical solutions and mature applications the uptake of ITS applications is fragmented and large differences between cities remain'. In this framework, the aim of the paper is to analyze how Italian cities are interpreting the topic of Smart Mobility, with particular attention to the use of new technologies in urban mobility. According to scientific literature review, a set of indicators was identified and organized into three categories representing the main aspects of Smart Mobility: ICT, Sustainability and Accessibility. This set was applied to the Italian small and medium sized provincial capitals with a population from 50.000 to 250.000 inhabitants in 2016. Lastly, a graphic and synthetic representation of the collected data has been developed, in order to give an easy overview of Italian cities regards Smart Mobility characteristics. The analysis showed that the use of ICTs mainly concerns the introduction of devices and sensors for improving performance of transport system and information to users, as well as the promotion of a more sustainable mobility. The spread of ICTs in most of the cities appears still unsatisfactory: Italian cities are oriented towards a more sustainable and accessible urban mobility model rather than a smart one. Indeed, ICT solutions for Smart Mobility seem to represent isolated initiatives, without indispensable scientific and disciplinary quality criteria. Furthermore, ICT initiatives are not included in shared and coordinated strategies integrated with the urban transformation governance, as part of a global policy framework, such as SUMPs. Therefore, to ensure that mobility can be 'smart' and sustainable in order to improve the quality of life, a more integrated approach is required in order to consider the complex trade-offs between city and mobility. Smart Mobility means not just about using ITCs, but being able to function as an integral part of a larger system that also regards participation and urban quality. © 2017 IEEE.","Italian smart mobility performance; smart city; smart mobility indicators","Budget control; Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Operating costs; Transportation; Coordinated strategies; Improving performance; Mobility characteristics; Mobility performance; Scientific literature; Sustainable mobility; Synthetic representations; Transportation managers; Smart city",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030243397

Systems that capture water for later subirrigation use have potential as a climate adaptation strategy to mitigate this increased crop water stress. Three such systems were operated in northwest Ohio from 1996 to 2008, and they exhibited substantial crop yield benefits, especially in dry growing seasons, but also to a lesser extent in near normal or wet growing seasons. The goal of this research was to estimate the increase in crop yield benefits of water capture and subirrigation systems that can be expected under projcted 2041–2070 climate conditions in northwest Ohio. Historical subirrigated field crop yield differences with fields having free drainage only, relative to growing season dryness/wetness, were used to determine future northwest Ohio subirrigated field crop yield increases, based on the modeled climate for 2041–2070. Climate records for 2041–2070 were projected using three bias corrected model combinations, CRCM + CGCM3, RCM3 + GFDL, and MM5I + HadCM3. Growing season dryness/wetness was classified based on the difference between rainfall and the crop adjusted potential evapotranspiration using the 1984–2013 climate record at the three system locations. Projected 2041–2070 growing season precipitation varied substantially between the three model combinations; however, all three indicated increased growing season dryness due to rising temperature and solar radiation. The overall subirrigated field corn yield increase rose to an estimated 27.5%–30.0% in 2041–2070 from 20.5% in 1996–2008, while the subirrigated field soybean yield increase improved from 12.2% in 1996–2008 to 19.8%–21.5% for 2041–2070. Consequently, as growing season drought becomes more frequent, the crop yield benefits with water capture and subirrigation systems will improve, and these systems therefore provide a viable climate adaptation strategy for agricultural production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate; Crop-Yield; Evapotranspiration; Subirrigation; Water–Capture","Agriculture; Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Evapotranspiration; Subirrigation; Sustainable development; Adaptation strategies; Agricultural productions; Climate; Climate change projections; Crop yield; Potential evapotranspiration; Rising temperatures; Subirrigation systems; Climate change; agricultural management; climate change; climate conditions; crop production; crop yield; evapotranspiration; future prospect; growing season; irrigation; mitigation; sustainability; water content; Ohio; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019092341

Functional strategies of tree species are coupled to specific chemical leaf traits, and thus also to litter composition, which affects mineral soil characteristics. The limited understanding on this interaction is mainly based on shorter-term common garden experiments in temperate forest, and needs to be extended to other forest types and climates if we want to understand the universality of this linkage. In particular, for highly diverse tropical forests, our understanding of this interaction remains limited. Using an old experimental plantation within the central Congo basin, we examined the relationship between leaf and litter chemical composition and topsoil properties. Canopy, litter and topsoil characteristics were measured and we determined how the community-level leaf and litter chemical composition altered the topsoil carbon, major plant nutrients and exchangeable cation concentration, acidity and pH over the last eight decades. We found that functional composition strongly affected topsoil pH. In turn, topsoil pH strongly determined the soil total carbon and available phosphorus, total nitrogen and exchangeable potassium. Our results indicate that, as observed in temperate common garden experiments, trees alter chemical topsoil properties primarily through soil acidification, differently induced by functional composition of the tree community. The strong link between this community-level composition and topsoil characteristics, on a highly representative soil type for the tropics, improves our understanding of tropical forests biogeochemistry. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","common garden; functional identity; soil carbon; tree species effects","biogeochemistry; community composition; concentration (composition); experimental study; forest garden; functional role; ion exchange; leaf litter; plant community; plantation forestry; soil-vegetation interaction; topsoil; tropical forest; Congo Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995785311

The spacecraft trajectory of ±8 RE (Earth's radius) was crossing several structures of field-aligned currents (FACs) and radiations belts on both legs of the closest approach (CA, 2.450 km altitude). As routinely revealed by several pioneering space missions, natural and forced electrostatic wave emissions called Fqs were observed over ±3 RE at around CA using a dedicated mode of the MIP instrument. These emissions are lying between consecutive harmonics of the electron-cyclotron frequency, and their wavelength is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. Provided that the Fq's wavelengths projected along the MIP antenna might be estimated, it is shown that the local value of the Larmor radius can be deduced; hence, the electron temperature component perpendicular to the magnetic field is subsequently derived. On the other hand, during the time of Fq's observations, the presence of VLF hiss emissions usually observed in these regions gives us the possibility to determine the electron temperature anisotropy associated to the electrostatic electron anisotropy instability according to the theoretical model proposed by Gary and Cairns (JGR, vol. 104, 1999).

In the energy sector, the exceptional level and pace of investments required by the transition towards the low-carbon economy have led to an almost exclusive focus on measures which could increase regulatory stability. This article argues that both the goal of regulatory stability and the means to obtain it are badly in need of clarification. A case study of renewable energy regulation in Italy shows that regulatory stability cannot be equated with a ban on retrospective regulatory intervention. Moreover, neither national nor international litigation on retrospective cuts to renewable energy supports schemes help improve the quality of regulation. What is needed is a range of procedural and substantive regulatory measures allowing states to credibly commit to a long-term strategy for renewable energy. In the European Union (EU), procedural measures hinge on the new National Energy and Climate Plans, to be adopted in the framework of EU governance, and on regional cooperation on targets and support schemes. The substantive measures include innovative financial instruments and alternative ways to manage disputes. © The Authors 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the AIPN.

Our results suggest an increase by as much as 40-50 % projected for 2100 for a number of locations in Europe, assuming the high Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 emission scenario. The new strategy was based on combining physical understandings with the limited information available, and it utilised the covariance between the mean seasonal variations in precipitation intensity and the North Atlantic saturation vapour pressure. Rather than estimating the expected values and interannual variability, we tried to estimate an ""upper bound"" for the response in the precipitation intensity based on the assumption that the seasonal variations in the precipitation intensity are caused by the seasonal variations in temperature. Return values were subsequently derived from the estimated precipitation intensity through a simple and approximate scheme that combined the 1-year 24 h precipitation return values and downscaled annual wet-day mean precipitation for a 20-year event. The latter was based on the 95th percentile of a multi-model ensemble spread of downscaled climate model results. We found geographical variations in the shape of the seasonal cycle of the wet-day mean precipitation which suggest that different rain-producing mechanisms dominate in different regions. These differences indicate that the simple method used here to estimate the response of precipitation intensity to temperature was more appropriate for convective precipitation than for orographic rainfall. © Author(s) 2017.",,"ensemble forecasting; precipitation assessment; precipitation intensity; prediction; saturation; seasonal variation; vapor pressure; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021706692

With the concept of institutional bricolage as an overarching perspective, the article engages in a discussion of what factors provide legitimacy to REDD+ at policy level in Zanzibar, and moreover, why certain elements of the REDD+ policy framework are incorporated into practice while others are discarded. The article demonstrates how actors make creative use of the resources available, but only within a spectrum that allows for reinvention of established practices and acceptable ways of doing. The article concludes that although the process of carbon accounting represents a ‘technical necessity’ of the REDD+ policy framework, it lack the legitimacy necessary to become durable.

Due to stricter regulations for fuel consumption (via the regulation of carbon dioxide), GDI engines are becoming increasingly favourable compared with PFI engines. Therefore the share of GDI engines, especially in combination with turbocharging, is increasing in most of the markets with CO2 regulations. Challenging for GDI engines is the mixture formation process due to the short time between fuel injection and the start of combustion. Thus, the injector needs to provide a fine fuel atomization in a considerably short time. The generated spray pattern thereby interacts with the in-cylinder charge motion to generate an appropriate air-fuel mixture. Because of this challenging mixture formation process, the formation of soot in local fuel-rich areas is possible. Thus GDI engines emit more particles compared with PFI engines and need special attention on the mixture formation process. To understand the reasons for the increased particle number (PN) emissions, a project concerning the cause of particle emissions was started at Institute of Internal Combustion Engines (IFKM) in Karlsruhe in 2011. During the project, different causes for PN emissions were identified. This article discusses the possible reasons for particle emissions under high engine load and low engine speed and shows some possible solutions to reduce the emission of particles. Discussed possible solutions to enhance the mixture formation process are the generation of a large-scale charge motion (tumble and swirl), the reduction of the hydraulic flow of the multi-hole, solenoid-activated injector and an increase of the rail pressure up to 50 MPa. The reduction of the hydraulic flow and the increase of the injection pressure lead to smaller average droplets and thus to a faster evaporation. An implementation of a large-scale charge motion enhances the mixture formation process and leads to a reduction of the emitted PN concentration at high engine load. This is shown for wide open throttle (WOT) as well as for boosted operation. The reduction of the hydraulic flow of the injector by reducing the bore hole diameter at constant number of holes and spray targeting of the injector leads to smaller droplets. By increasing the injection pressure, the injection duration as well as the average droplet size can be reduced and leads to a better homogenization and a further reduced PN concentration. © 2016 IMechE.","boosted operation; high injection pressure; homogeneous GDI engines; hydraulic flow","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Drops; Engines; Fuel injection; Fuels; Internal combustion engines; Mixtures; boosted operation; Gasoline direct injection; GDI engine; High injection pressures; Hydraulic flow; Injection pressures; Port fuel injections; Start of combustion; Direct injection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026677100

This ion nonthermality modifies propagation characteristics of dust acoustic waves when dust grains are charged by secondary electron emission mechanism. In case of dust charging by secondary electron emission process two stable equilibrium dust charge states exist out of which one is negative and the other is positive. Here we have considered positive equilibrium dust charge state and both adiabatic and nonadiabatic dust charge variation. Our investigation shows that characteristics of both dust acoustic soliton and dust acoustic shock depend on the strength of the ion nonthermality along with secondary electron yield.

Foc1 is known to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated localized defense responses at the site of colonization in roots. However, the effect of this localized infection on distant shoot tissues is still unknown. In the present study, the effect of Foc1 on shoot tissues of both susceptible and resistant chickpea plants was studied. Total pigment content and fluorescence of chlorophyll was measured. Occurrence of oxidative damage in shoots was confirmed by both biochemical and lipid peroxidation assays. Expression pattern of some redox responsive transcripts were also analyzed. Additionally, transcriptional accumulations of some key genes related to light reaction, carbon reduction and photosystem II (PSII) of photosynthesis were analyzed at different time points post infection. Expressional status of stress induced sugar metabolism related genes (sucrose synthase, β amylase and invertase) were also investigated. Finally, gene networks were constructed showing interconnection of the photosynthetic genes, sugar metabolism-related genes and redox responsive transcripts with other metabolic and stress related pathways. The results demonstrate that the infection in root tissues of chickpea by Foc1 dramatically increases the ROS levels in shoot tissues of susceptible plants. The oxidative outburst in shoot tissues of susceptible plants also hampers the photosynthetic stability by down-regulating the key photosynthetic genes. On the contrary, resistant chickpea lines are grossly devoid of such instances with few behavioral irregularities at later time points. © 2016, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.","Biotic stress; Cicer arietinum; Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. ciceri race 1; Oxidative burst; Photosynthetic genes; Wilt disease","biotic factor; chlorophyll; colonization; gene expression; metabolism; outburst; pathogen; photosynthesis; pigment; reactive oxygen species; sugar; wilt; Cicer arietinum; Fusarium oxysporum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997047754

For meeting these demands, fossil-fuel combustion for power generation and transportation, application of nitrogen-based fertilizers, and burning of crop residues to quickly clear the fields and begin with the next cycle of cropping are practiced. All these practices lead to emissions of reactive nitrogen (Nr) which has deleterious effects on human as well as ecosystem health and also on built structure. To contain the emissions several policies are onboard, but more needs to be done at a much faster pace. This chapter reviews the growth of various sectors that are driving the Nr emissions, preliminary estimates NOx and N2O emissions from the same, and reviews the mitigation strategies that are prevalent and can be potentially applied to reduce the emissions. Further, it also attempts to quantify the extent of emission reduction that is possible while applying the emission reduction technologies. Clearly, immense potential exists in various practices and technologies to reduce the Nr emissions. However, it is to be noted that while reducing Nr, other gaseous pollutants might increase in some cases. Hence, a comprehensive 360° balanced approach is needed to address the issues associated with reactive nitrogen. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Recovery energy is a type of secondary energy, which is generated from various sources. Since the estimation of recovery energy from some sources such as coke oven gas and other coal gas contains some uncertainties, recovery energy can be represented as an interval variable. The extant studies in the literature ignore recovery energy in the evaluation of energy efficiency or carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions efficiency. As a part of energy supply in China, recovery energy may influence regional primary energy consumption and CO 2 emissions significantly. In this context, this paper proposes an interval slacks-based measure approach to evaluate energy efficiency and CO 2 emissions efficiency in the presence of recovery energy in China. In the described approach, the indicator of CO 2 emissions is incorporated based on the weak disposability assumption, and recovery energy is modeled as a dual factor. The optimal exact data on recovery energy of each region can be obtained. Based on the proposed approach, the measures of energy saving potential and CO 2 emissions reduction potential are derived. Findings resulting from the model application show that there are great disparities in regional efficiencies, and the inefficiency of Chinese regions is largely driven by those inefficient regions in the central and western areas. Notably, the development of recovery energy can help to improve regional energy efficiency and CO 2 emissions efficiency in China. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Energy and CO 2 emissions efficiency; Interval data; Recovery energy; Slacks-based measure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944523635

The aerosol-free TOA flux obtained by establishing the linear regression between CERES SW TOA fluxes and MODIS AODs exhibits strong seasonality with peak values in monsoon and minimum in winter. Same seasonality is captured by the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model, but with difference in absolute values. SBDART code is used to extend instantaneous radiative forcing estimates into 24-h averages. AOD over the North East India region with complex terrain shows altitudinal variation with maximum value at the lowest elevation site Dhaka and minimum value at the high-altitude locations Shillong and Aizwal. In general, strong seasonality in AOD is observed with a peak in pre-monsoon (March–May) and dip in post-monsoon (October–November) at all the locations. The direct instantaneous TOA shortwave aerosol radiative forcing (SWARF) shows maximum values in pre-monsoon over all the locations except at Guwahati, Banmauk, Aizawl, and Shillong.

To investigate this issue, we integrate a crop yield reduction module and a water resources model into the MIT Integrated Global System Modeling framework, an integrated assessment model linking a global economic model to an Earth system model. We assess the effects of climate and socioeconomic changes on water availability for irrigation in the U.S. as well as subsequent impacts on crop yields by 2050, while accounting for climate change projection uncertainty. We find that climate and socioeconomic changes will increase water shortages and strongly reduce irrigated yields for specific crops (i.e., cotton and forage), or in specific regions (i.e., the Southwest) where irrigation is not sustainable. Crop modeling studies that do not represent changes in irrigation availability can thus be misleading. Yet, since the most water-stressed basins represent a relatively small share of U.S. irrigated areas, the overall reduction in U.S. crop yields is small. The response of crop yields to climate change and water stress also suggests that some level of adaptation will be feasible, like relocating croplands to regions with sustainable irrigation or switching to less irrigation intensive crops. Finally, additional simulations show that greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation can alleviate the effect of water stress on irrigated crop yields, enough to offset the reduced CO2 fertilization effect compared to an unconstrained GHG emission scenario. © 2017 The Authors.","climate change; Crop yields; irrigation; Mitigation policy","agricultural modeling; assessment method; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; environmental impact assessment; integrated approach; irrigation system; socioeconomic impact; sustainable development; water availability; water resource; water stress; United States; Gossypium hirsutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029042159

All of these samples show an almost perfect (∼94%) ordering of Co2+ and Mn4+ cations in the unit cell. Our research reveals that the magnetic ground state strongly depends on the R size. For samples with larger R (Ho and Tm), the ground state is formed by a ferromagnetic order (F type) of Co2+ and Mn4+ moments, while R either remains mainly disordered (Ho) or is coupled antiferromagnetically (Tm) to the Co/Mn sublattice. For samples with smaller R (Yb or Lu), competitive interactions lead to the formation of an E-type arrangement for the Co2+ and Mn4+ moments with a large amount of extended defects such as stacking faults. The Yb3+ is partly ordered at very low temperature. The latter samples undergo a metamagnetic transition from the E into the F type, which is coupled to a negative magnetodielectric effect. Actually, the real part of dielectric permittivity shows an anomaly at the magnetic transition for the samples exhibiting an E-type order. This anomaly is absent in samples with F-type order, and, accordingly, it vanishes coupled to the metamagnetic transition for R=Yb or Lu samples. At room temperature, the huge values of the dielectric constant reveal the presence of Maxwell-Wagner depletion layers. Pyroelectric measurements reveal a high polarization at low temperature, but the onset of pyroelectric current is neither correlated to the kind of magnetic ordering nor to the magnetic transition. Our study identified the pyroelectric current as thermally stimulated depolarization current and electric-field polarization curves show a linear behavior at low temperature. Therefore, no clear ferroelectric transition occurs in these compounds. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026387408

Participatory forest management (PFM) has been a central part of government as well as a donor focus in the forest sector since the early 1990s. Numerous studies have been carried out by Tanzanian and international researchers to assess performance and synthesise experiences of PFM in recent years. The results are well documented, including the identification of a number of key bottlenecks to implementation and up-scaling. From 2009 onwards, a series of pilot projects were launched to develop and test local-level approaches to REDD+, all of which have now come to an end, and have recently been subjected to external evaluations. A central theme of many of these projects was the application of community-based approaches to forest and woodland management, building strongly on the legal framework for PFM. When REDD+ was adopted by the Tanzanian government as a new policy, feelings among civil society regarding how REDD+ might impact hard-won forest and land tenure rights were mixed. Some observers feared that REDD+ would stifle PFM and lead to a recentralisation of forest tenure by government, while others felt that REDD+ offered new opportunities for addressing long-standing bottlenecks and governance barriers to PFM implementation. Combining PFM with the specific goal of reducing forest carbon emissions has generated important lessons, some of which have the potential to strengthen the application of PFM in Tanzania and elsewhere. In some cases, we found that orienting PFM to REDD+ goals has helped address long-standing barriers to PFM implementation. In other cases, REDD+ has highlighted new weaknesses with current approaches to PFM, while elsewhere it has created problems where none existed before. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Participatory forest management; REDD+; Tanzania",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026399087

Two selected outcrops show that seep carbonates developed at the tip of sand dykes intrude up into the Moreno Formation from deeper sandbodies. Precipitation of methane-derived cements occurred in a succession of up to 10 repeated elementary sequences, each starting with a corrosion surface followed by dendritic carbonates, botryoidal aragonite, aragonite fans, and finally laminated micrite. Each element of the sequence reflects three stages. First, a sudden methane pulse extended up into the oxic zone of the sediments, leading to aerobic oxidation of methane and carbonate dissolution. Second, after consumption of the oxygen, anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled with sulfate reduction triggered carbonate precipitation. Third, progressive diminishment of the methane seepage led to the deepening of the reaction front in the sediment and the lowering of precipitation rates. Carbonate isotopes, with δ13C as low as -51‰ Peedee belemnite, indicate a biogenic origin for the methane, whereas a one-dimensional basinmodel suggests that the Moreno Formation was in optimal thermal conditions for bacterial methane generation at the time of seep carbonate precipitation. Methane pulses are interpreted to reflect drainage by successive episodes of sand injection into the gas-generating shale of the Moreno Formation. The seep carbonates of the Panoche Hills can thus be viewed as a record ofmethane production froma biogenic source rock by multiphase hydraulic fracturing.

Here, we model for the first time the potential distribution of Betula utilis, a principal Himalayan treeline species, to provide a basis for the analysis of future range shifts. Our target species Betula utilis is widespread at alpine treelines in the Himalayan mountains, the distribution range extends across the Himalayan mountain range. Our objective is to model the potential distribution of B. utilis in relation to current climate conditions. We generated a dataset of 590 occurrence records and used 24 variables for ecological niche modelling. We calibrated Generalized Linear Models using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and evaluated model performance using threshold-independent (AUC, Area Under the Curve) and threshold-dependent (TSS, True Skill Statistics) characteristics as well as visual assessments of projected distribution maps. We found two temperature-related (Mean Temperature of the Wettest Quarter, Temperature Annual Range) and three precipitation-related variables (Precipitation of the Coldest Quarter, Average Precipitation of March, April and May and Precipitation Seasonality) to be useful for predicting the potential distribution of B. utilis. All models had high predictive power (AUC ≥ 0.98 and TSS ≥ 0.89). The projected suitable area in the Himalayan mountains varies considerably, with most extensive distribution in the western and central Himalayan region. A substantial difference between potential and real distribution in the eastern Himalaya points to decreasing competitiveness of B. utilis under more oceanic conditions in the eastern part of the mountain system. A comparison between the vegetation map of Schweinfurth (1957) and our current predictions suggests that B. utilis does not reach the upper elevational limit in vast areas of its potential distribution range due to anthropogenically caused treeline depressions. This study underlines the significance of accuracies of current environmental niche models for species distribution modelling under climate change scenarios. Analysing and understanding the environmental factors driving the current distribution of B. utilis is crucial for the prediction of future range shifts of B. utilis and other treeline species, and for deriving appropriate climate change adaptation strategies. © 2017 The Authors","Climatic space; Ecological niche modeling; Habitat; Range shift; Treeline dynamics; Treeline ecotone",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019999623

Important features of rubber closures are achieved after additives are added to the elastomeric material that compounds the rubber. Among these additives is carbon black. Because of its origin, carbon black may contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified 16 priority PAHs on the basis of concerns that they cause or might cause cancer in animals and humans. Regulatory agencies impose carbon black purity specifications based on limits for total PAHs (0.5 mg/kg) and benzo[a]pyrene (5 μg/kg) or benzo[a]pyrene only (250 μg/kg). PAHs in rubber packaging used for pharmaceutical formulations and in parenteral products stored in containers with rubber stoppers were investigated. Methods: To this end, the method proposed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health - based on high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and fluorescence detection - was adapted to determine the levels of PAHs in rubber stoppers (gray and red) and in lipid emulsions and amino acid solutions stored in bottles with rubber stoppers. Results: The rubber materials were shown to contain 12 PAHs, in concentrations ranging from 0.25-3.31 μg/g. Only 1 of 18 samples (11 amino acid solutions and 7 lipid emulsions) was uncontaminated. The most prevalent contaminants were pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene, and fluoranthene. The total PAH concentrations in the samples ranged from 0.11-5.96 μg/mL. Conclusion: Components of parenteral nutrition may be contaminated with PAHs, and rubber stoppers represent a potential source of these contaminants. © 2016 American Society.","carbon black; high-performance liquid chromatography; parenteral nutrition; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; rubber","2 bromonaphthalene; acenaphthylene; amino acid; benzo[a]pyrene; benzo[b]fluoranthene; benzo[ghi]perylene; benz[a]anthracene; fluoranthene; fluorene; indeno[1,2,3 c,d]pyrene; lipid emulsion; naphthalene; phenanthrene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrene; rubber; unclassified drug; benzo[a]pyrene; fluorene derivative; parenteral solution; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrene derivative; rubber; Article; fluorescence; fluorescence imaging system; high performance liquid chromatography; liquid chromatograph; packaging material; parenteral drug administration; priority journal; ultraviolet spectrophotometer; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; chemistry; drug contamination; government; packaging; reproducibility; United States; Benzo(a)pyrene; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Drug Contamination; Fluorenes; Parenteral Nutrition Solutions; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Product Packaging; Pyrenes; Reproducibility of Results; Rubber; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030705441

This study quantifies how the energy system and the electricity market may be affected by an increased electrification of the district heating sector. A comprehensive energy system model covering the power and heat sector is applied for the analysis of the 2030 energy system in Northern Europe. According to the model results the heat generation from electricity in district heating varies from 2 TWh/year to 75 TWh/year in the analyzed scenarios, representing 0.5% to 19% of annual electricity consumption in the region. The results show that the level of electricity taxes and grid rents are decisive factors for the use of electricity in district heating. Total wind power generation from existing and new installations range from 70 TWh/year to 90 TWh/year, depending on the magnitude of power to heat use in district heating. Sensitivity studies confirm that the biomass price are highly decisive to the use of power to heat in district heating, since new heat pumps mainly replaces wood-based biomass. As expected, carbon prices influence the share of wind power versus natural gas power, but the carbon price does not affect investment levels in power to heat significantly. © 2017 IEEE.","District heating; Electricity markets; Electricity to heat; Renewable power integration; Variable renewable energy","Commerce; Costs; District heating; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Heating; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Wind power; Annual electricity consumption; Comprehensive energy; District-heating plants; Fluctuating renewable energy sources; Renewable energy systems; Renewable Power; Sensitivity studies; Variable renewable energies; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027113304

Many air pollution monitoring systems have been proposed in the literature, among which wireless sensor networks seem to be a leading solution thanks to sensors' low cost and autonomy as well as their finegrained deployment. A careful deployment of sensors is therefore necessary to get better performances while ensuring a minimal financial cost. In this paper, we consider citywide wireless sensor networks and tackle the minimum-cost node positioning issue for air pollution monitoring. We propose an efficient approach that aims to find optimal sensors and sinks locations while ensuring air pollution coverage and network connectivity. Unlike most of the existing methods, which rely on simple and generic detection models, our approach is based on the spatial analysis of pollution data, allowing to take into account the nature of the pollution phenomenon. As proof of concept, we apply our approach on real world data, namely the Paris pollution data, which was recorded in March 2014. We also perform extensive simulations in order to study the performance of our approach in comparison to the existing methods. © 2017 IEEE.","Air pollution monitoring; Connectivity; Coverage; Deployment; Detection of threshold crossings of pollutants; Smart city; Spatial data clustering; Wireless sensor networks (WSN)","Air pollution; Clustering algorithms; Costs; Pollution; Pollution detection; Sensor nodes; Smart city; Air pollution monitoring; Connectivity; Coverage; Deployment; Spatial data; Threshold-crossing; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027416530

The direct benefits of elevated [CO2] (e[CO2]) to plant growth appear to be greater under low rainfall conditions, but there are few field (Free Air CO2 Enrichment or FACE) experimental set-ups that directly address semi-arid conditions. The objectives of this study were to investigate the following research questions: 1) What are the effects of e[CO2] on the growth and grain yield of lentil (Lens culinaris) grown under semi-arid conditions under FACE? 2) Does e[CO2] decrease grain nitrogen in lentil? and 3) Is there genotypic variability in the response to e[CO2] in lentil cultivars? Elevated [CO2] increased yields by approximately 0.5 t ha−1 (relative increase ranging from 18 to 138%) by increasing both biomass accumulation (by 32%) and the harvest index (by up to 60%). However, the relative response of grain yield to e[CO2] was not consistently greater under dry conditions and might depend on water availability post-flowering. Grain nitrogen concentration was significantly reduced by e[CO2] under the conditions of this experiment.

Biomass accumulation from flowering to maturity was considerably increased by elevated [CO2] (a 50% increase) which suggests that the indeterminate growth habit of lentils provides vegetative sinks in addition to reproductive sinks during the grain-filling period. © 2017","Climate change adaptation; Physiological pre-breeding; Source-sink relationships; Terminal drought","adaptation; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; concentration (composition); cultivar; drought; flowering; genetic variation; growth response; legume; maturation; nitrogen; plant breeding; seed; semiarid region; yield response; Lens culinaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019937315

Extending existing research, this research builds on variables such as tourism, industrialization, urbanization, globalization, economic growth, and environment in a multivariate format. Cointegration tests and panel regression models are employed in the empirical analysis using panel data of Southeast Asian countries. The research discovers a long-run equilibrium relationship between carbon dioxide emissions, tourism, industrialization, urbanization, globalization, and economic growth. Accordingly, pertaining to short-run analysis, tourism, urbanization, and globalization directly affect economic growth while industrialization is insignificant. Further analysis shows the extent to which these factors impact environment. The results reveal an intriguing paradox that tourism negatively impacts carbon emissions in the region while industrialization and urbanization directly cause carbon emissions. These findings suggest the effectiveness of green or ecotourism in the region and highlight how Southeast Asian countries develop policies to curb carbon emission levels and leverage these attributes for sustainable environment. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Asia; carbon dioxide emission; Economic growth; environment; globalization; industrialization; tourism; urbanization","assessment method; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; ecotourism; environmental impact; environmental protection; globalization; industrialization; policy development; tourism; urbanization; Asia; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991232738

Key components of population persistence can be attributed to resistance (the capacity to remain unaffected) or resilience (capacity to absorb and recover) to climate change. In situ climatic refugia can act as resistant distribution units, and ex situ climatic refugia and the corridors to reach them may enhance resilience. We develop a novel approach selecting conservation priorities, resistant units and resilient areas according to structural connectivity and future distribution, to identify strategies that maximize the chances of species persistence in a changing climate. Location: Italian Alps. Methods: Conservation priorities were defined across species according to the regional conservation status and the level of threat from climate change, and across sites according to their suitability for target species and their related potential for population persistence (in situ climatic refugia, i.e., resistant units) or redistribution (ex situ climatic refugia and main corridors according to current and future connectivity, i.e., resilient units). Results: Models suggested a marked loss of suitable area for all species by 2050 (ranging from ~50% for pygmy owl and water pipit, to 84% for snowfinch in the worst scenario), and a general loss of connectivity, which was particularly marked for pygmy owl and snowfinch. The approach applied to Alpine birds of different habitats led to a spatially explicit definition of conservation priorities. Main conclusions: The spatial definition of conservation priorities according to species (regional importance and level of threat), resistance and resilience refines the definition of management/conservation priorities (including protected area definition), complementing the existing approaches to address climate change-induced threats in planning conservation and ecological networks. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Alps; birds; distribution; ecological connectivity; global warming; spatial planning","anthropogenic effect; bioclimatology; climate change; climate effect; connectivity; conservation management; conservation planning; ecosystem resilience; endangered species; global warming; habitat corridor; habitat management; habitat selection; passerine; persistence; prioritization; raptor; refugium; regional planning; site selection; stress resistance; Alps; Italy; Anthus spinoletta; Aves; Glaucidium (Aves)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018939161

Restoration interventions aim to increase functionality and resilience of landscapes, conserve biodiversity, store carbon, and mitigate effects of global climate change. We propose four principles to guide tree planting schemes focused on carbon storage and commercial forestry in the tropics in the context of FLR. These principles support activities and land uses that increase tree cover in human-modified landscapes, while also achieving positive socioecological outcomes at local scales, in an appropriate contextualization: (1) restoration interventions should enhance and diversify local livelihoods; (2) afforestation should not replace native tropical grasslands or savanna ecosystems; (3) reforestation approaches should promote landscape heterogeneity and biological diversity; and (4) residual carbon stocks should be quantitatively and qualitatively distinguished from newly established carbon stocks. The emerging global restoration movement and its growing international support provide strong momentum for increasing tree and forest cover in mosaic landscapes. The proposed principles help to establish a platform for FLR implementation and monitoring based on a broad set of socioenvironmental benefits including, but not solely restricted, to carbon mitigation and wood production. © 2017 Society for Ecological Restoration","carbon stock assessment; forest biomass; forest governance; forest regeneration; restoration accountability; tropical reforestation","accountability; biomass; carbon cycle; environmental restoration; forest management; forestry; reforestation; regeneration; tropical forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019941502

During this process, several cold-regulated (COR) proteins are accumulated in the cells. One of them is COR15A, a small, intrinsically disordered protein that contributes to leaf freezing tolerance by stabilizing cellular membranes. The isolated protein folds into amphipathic α-helices in response to increased crowding conditions, such as high concentrations of glycerol. Although there is evidence for direct COR15A-membrane interactions, the orientation and depth of protein insertion were unknown. In addition, although folding due to high osmolyte concentrations had been established, the folding response of the protein under conditions of gradual dehydration had not been investigated. Here we show, using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, that COR15A starts to fold into α-helices already under mild dehydration conditions (97% relative humidity (RH), corresponding to freezing at −3°C) and that folding gradually increases with decreasing RH. Neutron diffraction experiments at 97 and 75% RH established that the presence of COR15A had no significant influence on the structure of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) membranes. However, using deuterated POPC we could clearly establish that COR15A interacts with the membranes and penetrates below the headgroup region into the upper part of the fatty acyl chain region. This localization is in agreement with our hypothesis that COR15A-membrane interaction is at least, in part, driven by a hydrophobic interaction between the lipids and the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic protein α-helix. © 2017 Biophysical Society",,"1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine; Arabidopsis protein; COR15 protein, Arabidopsis; phosphatidylcholine; water; alpha helix; cell membrane; chemistry; metabolism; protein folding; surface property; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cell Membrane; Phosphatidylcholines; Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical; Protein Folding; Surface Properties; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026822031

Amidst this destabilising change in natural and social orders, scientific representations of climate are emerging as dominant. In this perspective piece I start from post-normal science and offer two arguments against completely yielding climate representation to experts, illustrated by my experiences in northeast Bangladesh. Descriptively, abandoning non-scientific representations and knowledge of climate results in a smaller and more fragile knowledge base for adaptation. Normatively, it is our common enterprise to rediscover the places we inhabit; it is not the responsibility of the expert community alone to reinterpret our places under a changing climate. Looking at the co-existence of modern and pre-modern representations of climate in Bangladesh, I suggest that post-normal science approaches may help bridge these different representations, with equal attention to their quality for adaptation, and the values and meanings underpinning them. © 2017 The Author","Adaptation; Bangladesh; Place; Post-normal science; Uncertainty","adaptive management; climate change; nature-society relations; sense of place; uncertainty role; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013127876

One proposed remediation strategy for coastal dead zones in the Baltic Sea is to mix the water column using pump stations, circulating oxygenated water to the sea bottom. Although microbial metabolism in the sediment surface is recognized as key in regulating bulk chemical fluxes, it remains unknown how the microbial community and its metabolic processes are influenced by shifts in oxygen availability. Here, coastal Baltic Sea sediments sampled from oxic and anoxic sites, plus an intermediate area subjected to episodic oxygenation, were experimentally exposed to oxygen shifts. Chemical, 16S rRNA gene, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic analyses were conducted to investigate changes in chemistry fluxes, microbial community structure, and metabolic functions in the sediment surface.RESULTS: Compared to anoxic controls, oxygenation of anoxic sediment resulted in a proliferation of bacterial populations in the facultative anaerobic genus Sulfurovum that are capable of oxidizing toxic sulfide. Furthermore, the oxygenated sediment had higher amounts of RNA transcripts annotated as sqr, fccB, and dsrA involved in sulfide oxidation. In addition, the importance of cryptic sulfur cycling was highlighted by the oxidative genes listed above as well as dsvA, ttrB, dmsA, and ddhAB that encode reductive processes being identified in anoxic and intermediate sediments turned oxic. In particular, the intermediate site sediments responded differently upon oxygenation compared to the anoxic and oxic site sediments. This included a microbial community composition with more habitat generalists, lower amounts of RNA transcripts attributed to methane oxidation, and a reduced rate of organic matter degradation.CONCLUSIONS: These novel data emphasize that genetic expression analyses has the power to identify key molecular mechanisms that regulate microbial community responses upon oxygenation of dead zones. Moreover, these results highlight that microbial responses, and therefore ultimately remediation efforts, depend largely on the oxygenation history of sites. Furthermore, it was shown that re-oxygenation efforts to remediate dead zones could ultimately be facilitated by in situ microbial molecular mechanisms involved in removal of toxic H2S and the potent greenhouse gas methane.","16S rRNA; Anoxic; Metagenomics; Metatranscriptomics; Oxic; Sediment","hydrogen sulfide; methane; oxygen; RNA 16S; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterium; Baltic States; chemistry; classification; gene expression profiling; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; metagenomics; microbial consortium; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; phylogeny; physiology; sea; sediment; Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Baltic States; Gene Expression Profiling; Geologic Sediments; Hydrogen Sulfide; Metagenomics; Methane; Microbial Consortia; Oceans and Seas; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030759622

In many countries, coastlines are a key contested territory for planning for climate change, and also locations where development and conservation conflicts play out. As a ""test bed"" for climate change adaptation, coastal regions provide valuable, but highly diverse experiences and lessons. This paper sets out to explore the lessons of coastal planning and development for the implementation of proactive adaptation, and the possibility to move from adaptation visions to actual adaptation governance and planning. Using qualitative analysis of interviews and workshops, we first examine what the barriers are to proactive adaptation at the coast, and how current policy and practice frames are leading to avoidable lock-ins and other maladaptive decisions that are narrowing our adaptation options. Using examples from UK, we then identify adaptation windows that can be opened, reframed or transformed to set the course for proactive adaptation which links high level top-down legislative requirements with local bottom-up actions. We explore how these windows can be harnessed so that space for proactive adaptation increases and maladaptive decisions are reduced. © 2017 by the authors.

Some hypothesize that this will result in a reduction, and maybe total loss of sea ice derived (sympagic) carbon supply; however, the impact of such change on ecosystems requires further investigation. Here, we used the H-Print biomarker approach that utilizes well-defined indicators of both sympagic and phytoplanktic carbon, in combination with stable isotopes (δ15N), to study the effect of reducing sympagic carbon availability on beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) in the sub-Arctic ecosystem of Cumberland Sound. Our data show that decreasing δ15N in belugas was negatively correlated with pelagic carbon (H-Print) within their diet. We also identified a statistically significant (R2 = 0.82; p ≤ 0.01) change point in the proportion of sympagic/pelagic carbon within beluga around the year 2000, signified by consistently reducing δ15N, coupled with increasing pelagic carbon composition. This observed shift from sympagic to pelagic contribution to diet is likely to remain a feature of the Cumberland Sound ecosystem during the projected reduction of sea ice. © 2017 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",,"biomarker; carbon; diet; ice thickness; nitrogen isotope; nutrient availability; nutrient dynamics; open water; pelagic environment; phytoplankton; sea ice; stable isotope; statistical analysis; subarctic region; whale; Baffin Island; Canada; Cumberland Sound; Nunavut; Delphinapterus; Delphinapterus leucas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014678715

Following concerns that the key messages from these studies were not reaching the public, a comprehensive opinion poll of 10,000 European citizens in 10 countries was conducted to establish levels of awareness, concern, and trust among different demographic groups (by age, gender, proximity to the coast) and nationalities. Citizens exhibited varying levels of self-declared ""informedness"" and concern. Citizens from Germany, Italy and Spain claimed to be the most informed on marine climate change issues; those from Czech Republic, Netherlands and Estonia claimed to be least informed. Respondents were least aware of ocean acidification and most aware of melting sea ice, pollution and overfishing. Citizens of Italy suggested that they were generally most concerned about marine climate change issues. Respondents from coastal areas claimed to be both more informed and more concerned than those living inland, as did females and older age groups (54-64 years). European citizens obtain information about climate change in the seas and ocean from different sources, particularly television and the internet. Trust in the various media sources varies among countries and demographic groups. Television is trusted most in Estonia, Germany and Ireland and least in France. The internet is trusted most in Italy, Czech Republic and Estonia, but least in France and the United Kingdom. 18-24 year olds are the biggest users of the internet, but trust this source less than older age groups. Academic scientists or those working for environmental NGOs are trusted more than scientists working for government or industry. Citizens from France are more trusting of industry than any other country polled. In terms of policy actions, most respondents highlighted mitigation measures as opposed to local-scale adaptation. Younger participants prioritized actions associated with reducing carbon emissions, whereas older age groups prioritized improving coastal defenses. Successful adaptation to the impacts of climate change requires public engagement and support for policy decisions, and the use of different approaches to take account of differences among demographic groups and nationalities. © 2017 Buckley, Pinnegar, Painting, Terry, Chilvers, Lorenzoni, Gelcich and Duarte.","Climate change; Mitigation; Ocean; Polling; Public perception",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024363168

Best-fit solutions of the model to these data suggest that CO2 reduction is the predominant form of methanogenesis in these sediments. These solutions also accurately reproduce the isotope depth profiles, including a broad minimum in the δ13CDIC profile and a much sharper (angular) minimum in the δ13CCH4 profile, both of which appear near the base of the transition zone in the sediments between sulfate reduction and methanogenesis (referred to here as the sulfate-methane transition zone, or SMTZ). Such minima in pore-water profiles of δ13CCH4 near the base of the SMTZ have been seen in a number of other marine sediments across a range of depth and timescales. We show here that this minimum in the δ13CCH4 profile in Santa Barbara Basin sediments results from the balance between (1) anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), which leads to an increase in δ13CCH4 with decreasing depth in the sediment column through and above the SMTZ; (2) methanogenesis, which produces 13C-depleted methane, both in and below the SMTZ; and (3) an upward flux of CH4 from depth that is relatively enriched in 13C as compared with the methane in these pore waters. Possible sources of this deep methane include the following: geologic hydrocarbon reservoirs derived from ancient source rocks; decomposition of buried gas hydrates; and biogenic (or perhaps thermogenic) methane produced hundreds of meters below the seafloor stimulated by increasing temperatures associated with the sediment geothermal gradient. Although we are unable to resolve these possible sources of deep methane, we believe that the significance of an upward methane flux as an explanation for minima in δ13CCH4 pore-water profiles may not be limited to Santa Barbara Basin sediments but may be common in many continental margin sediments. © 2016 David J.

Box 3064520, Tallahassee, FL  32306-4520, United States","The primary input of organic matter to almost all marine sediments comes from deposition at the sediment surface. However, in many continental margin settings, reduced carbon can also be added to sediments from below-for example, from “deep” geologic hydrocarbon reservoirs derived from ancient source rocks or from the decomposition of deeply buried gas hydrate deposits. To examine the impact of these two differing reduced carbon inputs on sediment biogeochemistry, a modified reaction-transport model for anoxic marine sediments is described here and applied to data from sediment cores in Santa Barbara Basin to a depth of 4.6 m. Excellent model fits yield results consistent with previous studies of Santa Barbara Basin and other continental margin sediments. These results indicate that authigenic carbonate precipitation in these sediments is not centered around the sulfatemethane transition zone (SMTZ), as is seen in many other sedimentary environments but occurs at shallower depths in the sediments and over a relatively broad depth range. Sulfate profiles are linear between the surface sediments (upper ~20 cm) and the top of the SMTZ (~105 cm) giving the appearance of refractory particulate organic carbon (POC) burial and conservative sulfate behavior in this intermediate region. However, model results show that linear profiles may also occur when high rates of sulfate reduction occur near the sediment surface (as organoclastic sulfate reduction [oSR]) and in the SMTZ (largely as anaerobic oxidation of methane) with low, but nonzero, rates of oSR inbetween. At the same time, linearity in the sulfate profile may also be related to downward pore-water advection by compaction and sedimentation plus a decrease with depth in sulfate diffusivity because of decreasing porosity. These model-determined rates of oSR and methanogenesis also result in a rate of POC loss that declines near-continuously in a logarithmic fashion over the entire sediment column studied. The results presented further here indicate the importance of a deep methane flux from below on sediment biogeochemistry in the shallower sediments, although the exact source of this methane flux is difficult to ascertain with the existing data. © 2016 David J.

Wastewater treatment is considered to be a minor source of N2O; however, observed in-plant emission factors are more variable than previously considered. Further, emissions associated with treated wastewater effluent are highly uncertain. A model incorporating these uncertainties was compared with current N2O estimates. The modified model features distribution-based emission factors and Monte Carlo simulation. Results of these simulations indicate N2O emissions 7.3, 8.6, and 9.4 times estimates generated with the current method for in-plant, effluent-derived, and total emissions, respectively. Future changes in biological nitrogen removal (BNR) associated with clean water objectives may alter N2O releases. The model, which distinguishes between BNR and non-BNR treatment, predicts decreasing N2O emissions with increasing BNR treatment. Examining the Chesapeake Bay system, the model suggests 2012 BNR levels reduced N2O emissions by 0.86 MMT CO2 eq per year, and planned BNR expansions will result in emissions being reduced by 1.77 MMT CO2 eq relative to 0% BNR scenarios.

This study investigates the potential activity and community shifts of glacial microbiota deposited and buried under layers of sediments within the river delta. A long-term (12-month) incubation experiment was established using Watson River delta sediment under anaerobic conditions, with and without CO2/H2 enrichment. Within CO2/H2-amended incubations, sulphate depletion and a shift in the microbial community to a 52% predominance of Desulfosporosinus meridiei by day 371 provides evidence for sulphate reduction. We found evidence of methanogenesis in CO2/H2-amended incubations within the first 5 months, with production rates of ~4 pmol g−1 d−1, which was likely performed by methanogenic Methanomicrobiales- and Methanosarcinales-related organisms. Later, a reduction in methane was observed to be paired with the depletion of sulphate, and we hypothesise that sulphate reduction out competed hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. The structure and diversity of the original CO2/H2-amended incubation communities changed dramatically with a major shift in predominant community members and a decline in diversity and cell abundance. These results highlight the need for further investigations into the fate of subglacial microbiota within downstream environments. © 2017, The Author(s).","Meltwater export; Methane oxidation; Methanogenesis; River delta; Subglacial environment; Sulphate reduction","methane; sulfate; Greenland; ice cover; Methanomicrobiales; Methanosarcinales; microbiology; microflora; Peptococcaceae; river; sediment; Geologic Sediments; Greenland; Ice Cover; Methane; Methanomicrobiales; Methanosarcinales; Microbiota; Peptococcaceae; Rivers; Sulfates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008698564

As most CDR strategies are unfamiliar to the public, it is unknown how increased media and policy attention on CDR might affect public sentiment about climate change. On the one hand, CDR poses a potential moral hazard: if people perceive that CDR solves climate change, they may be less likely to support efforts to reduce carbon emissions. On the other hand, the need for CDR may increase the perceived severity of climate change and, thus, increase support for other types of mitigation. Using an online survey of US adults (N = 984), we tested these competing hypotheses by exposing participants to information about different forms of CDR. We find that learning about certain CDR strategies indirectly reduces support for mitigation policies by reducing the perceived threat of climate change. This was found to be true for participants who read about CDR in general (without mention of specific strategies), bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or direct air capture. Furthermore, this risk compensation pattern was more pronounced among political conservatives than liberals—although in some cases, was partially offset by positive direct effects. Learning about reforestation, by contrast, had no indirect effects on mitigation support through perceived threat but was found to directly increase support among conservatives. The results suggest caution is warranted when promoting technological fixes to climate change, like CDR, as some forms may further dampen support for climate change action among the unengaged. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Education; Reforestation; Risk management; Surveys; Carbon dioxide removal; Carbon emissions; Indirect effects; Mitigation policies; Moral hazard; Online surveys; Public sentiments; Risk compensations; Climate change; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; environmental policy; reforestation; strategic approach; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026457206

However, climate in mountains, a very sensitive system, is scarcely monitored, making the assessment of global climate models (GCMs) projections problematic. This is even more critical for tropical mountain regions, where complex atmospheric processes acting across scales are specially challenging for GCMs. To help bridge this gap, we evaluated the representation of extreme climate indices by GCMs and reanalysis data in the Andes of Ecuador. This work presents an intercomparison of 11 climate precipitation indices (Climate Change Detection and Indices, ETCCDIs) reconstructed for the period 1 January 1981–31 December 2000 using the data of six climate stations situated in a medium-sized Andean catchment in southern Ecuador, reanalysis data sets (RAD) ERA40, ERA-Interim, NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1 (NCEP/NCAR-R1) and NCEP/DOE Reanalysis 2 (NCEP/DOE-R2), and the data sets of 19 and 29 models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phases 3 and 5 (CMIP3&5). Temporal and spatial analysis highlights that the values and the variability of ETCCDIs based on reanalysis and CMIP3&5 data overestimate observations, especially in ENSO years. However, frequency-type indices are in general better captured than amount-related indices in RAD. In general, reanalysis data displayed a similar uncertainty as the CMIP model data sets and some indices present lower uncertainty. The uncertainty of ETCCDIs based on CMIP5 remains similar to CMIP3 GCMs, with small variations. The indices using NCEP/NCAR-R1, NCEP/DOE-R2, and ERA-Interim data performed better than those obtained with the ERA40 data sets, with no discernible improvement between both NCEP products. It can be concluded that for the given study region CMIP3&5 models and reanalysis products with respectively good and poor performance, exist, however data should be carefully screened before use. Furthermore, these results confirm that the specificity of the studied region is a key to identify limiting aspects on the GCMs and reanalysis extreme climate representation. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society","ETCCDI Ecuador; evaluation of GCMs and reanalysis data; extreme climate indices; mountain regions; Paute basin; tropical regions","Catchments; Climate change; Landforms; Ecuador; Extreme climates; Mountain regions; Paute basin; Reanalysis; Tropical regions; Climate models; climate modeling; CMIP; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; extreme event; global climate; mountain region; precipitation (climatology); spatiotemporal analysis; tropical region; Andes; Ecuador; Paute Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013055685

The objective of this study was to compare gaseous N emissions (N2O and NH3) and NO3 − concentrations in the soil solution during two successive lettuce cropping seasons under contrasting fertilization practices. Treatments were fertilization with regular urea (U), urea treated with urease [N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT)] and nitrification [dicyandiamide (DCD)] inhibitors (UIs), non-acidified pig slurry compost (PSC), acidified pig slurry compost (APSC), and an unfertilized control (C). Acidification of pig slurry during composting had no impact on soil cumulative N2O emissions during the cropping seasons. The use of composts resulted in emission factors (EFs) (PSC, 0.09% of applied N; APSC, 0.16%) an order of magnitude smaller than with regular urea (1.63%). Similarly, adding NBPT and DCD to urea reduced the N2O EF from 1.63 to 0.37% of applied N and fertilizer-induced NH3 emissions from 30.2 to 3.4% of applied N. Composts and UI resulted in yield-scaled N2O emissions that were 33 to 49% lower than the unfertilized control and 64 to 73% lower than the regular urea estimates, indicating a greater efficiency of supplied N with composts and UI. Nitrate concentration of the soil solution (at 0.1 and 0.3 m) in PSC, APSC, and UI plots was similar to the control and up to 17 times lower than with regular urea, indicating reduced risks for leaching losses. We conclude that, as compared to regular urea, the use of composted pig slurry, with and without acidification, and the addition of NBPT and DCD inhibitors to urea are good practices to reduce environmental N losses from lettuce production under sub-tropical climate. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","DCD; Lactuca sativa L; NBPT; Pig slurry composting","agricultural soil; biofertilizer; chemical compound; compost; composting; crop production; fertilizer application; inhibitor; leaching; leafy vegetable; nitrite; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nutrient loss; pig; slurry; soil emission; subtropical region; urea; Lactuca; Lactuca sativa; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017415342

Remarkably, by introduction of trace platinum- and cobalt- precursor in polymer gel, highly dispersed sub-10 nm PtCo nanoalloys can be in situ grown and anchored on graphene-like carbon. The as-prepared catalysts were investigated by a series of physical characterizations, electrochemical measurements, and microbial fuel cell tests. Interestingly, even with a low Pt content (5.13 wt %), the most active Co/N codoped carbon supported PtCo nanoalloys (Co-N-C/Pt) exhibited dramatically improved catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction coupled with superior output power density (1008 ± 43 mW m-2) in MFCs, which was 29.40% higher than the state of the art Pt/C (20 wt %). Notability, the distinct catalytic activity of Co-N-C/Pt was attributed to the highly efficient synergistic catalytic effect of Co-Nx-C and PtCo nanoalloys. Therefore, Co-N-C/Pt should be a promising oxygen reduction catalyst for application in MFCs. Further, the novel strategy for graphene-like carbon also can be widely used in many other energy conversion and storage devices. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","graphene-like carbon; microbial fuel cells; N/Co-dual doping; PtCo nanoalloys; synergistic catalyst","Binary alloys; Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Characterization; Cobalt alloys; Doping (additives); Electrolytic reduction; Flow of gases; Fuel cells; Gas fuel purification; Graphene; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Platinum; Platinum alloys; Reduction; Virtual storage; Electrochemical measurements; Energy conversion and storages; Graphene likes; Microbial fuel cells (MFCs); Nano-alloys; Oxygen reduction catalysts; Oxygen reduction reaction; Physical characterization; Microbial fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023743906

Modeling studies have shown that there are trade-offs between changes in temperature and hydrological cycle in response to solar geoengineering. Here we investigate the possibility of stabilizing both global mean temperature and precipitation simultaneously by combining two geoengineering approaches: stratospheric sulfate aerosol increase (SAI) that deflects sunlight to space and cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) that enables more longwave radiation to escape to space. Using the slab ocean configuration of National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model, we simulate SAI by uniformly adding sulfate aerosol in the upper stratosphere and CCT by uniformly increasing cirrus cloud ice particle falling speed. Under an idealized warming scenario of abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric CO2, we show that by combining appropriate amounts of SAI and CCT geoengineering, global mean (or land mean) temperature and precipitation can be restored simultaneously to preindustrial levels. However, compared to SAI, cocktail geoengineering by mixing SAI and CCT does not markedly improve the overall similarity between geoengineered climate and preindustrial climate on regional scales. Some optimal spatially nonuniform mixture of SAI with CCT might have the potential to better mitigate climate change at both the global and regional scales. ©2017. American Geophysical Union.

The TPU/BiOCl composite samples showed high contrast black markings on the surface after laser treatment, depending on the BiOCl loading and laser fluence in terms of visual and microscopic analysis. The laser-induced blackening on material surfaces was examined by XPS, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy. The results revealed that the laser-induced blackening on the composite surface entails laser absorption of the BiOCl particles and local heating of the surrounding TPU chains. This led to the generation of amorphous black carbonised materials and the reduction of BiOCl into black bismuth metal. The carbonisation of TPU chains and the photo-thermal conversion of BiOCl particles synergistically contributed to the formation of the black-coloured marking on composite surfaces. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bismuth oxychloride; Carbonisation; Laser marking; Reduction; Thermoplastic polyurethane","Amorphous materials; Bismuth; Bismuth compounds; Blending; Carbonization; Chains; Marking machines; Plastics; Polyurethanes; Reduction; Reinforced plastics; Bismuth oxychloride; Carbonisation; Composite samples; Laser marking; Microscopic analysis; Photo-thermal conversions; Sensitive components; Thermoplastic polyurethanes; Polymer matrix composites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028707185

These complexes combine a monodentate ligand with a chelate bipyridine substituted with carboxylate groups. At low pH, both complexes present metal-to-ligand charge transfer absorption bands in the visible region and room-temperature photoluminescence with long excited-state lifetimes (τ &gt; 200 ns). At physiological pH, their absorption and emission maxima are displaced to higher energies, with a significant reduction of their emission lifetime. These species show photosubstitution of the monodentate pyridine upon irradiation at 450 nm. At low pH, the quantum yield for this process is very low, but at physiological pH, they are very active, with a φPS,450 value of 0.14 for (1)2+ and of 0.17 for (2)2+. The products of photosubstitution were identified as monoaquo complexes. Both the reactants and the products of the photosubstitution show photoluminescence, but with very different lifetimes, making it possible to monitor the reaction by the time constant of their decay. The ability of complexes (1)2+ and (2)2+ to photorelease monodentate ligands at physiological pH makes them attractive candidates for the delivery of biomolecules linked to more complex structures through the carboxylate functional group. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Given these concerns, a few studies have assessed leakage risk by evaluating regulatory records, often self-reported, documenting leakage in gas fields. Leakage is thought to be governed largely by initial well-construction quality and the method of well abandonment. The geologic carbon storage community has raised further concerns because acidic fluids in the CO2 storage reservoir, alkaline cement meant to isolate the reservoir fluids from the overlying strata, and steel casings in wells are inherently reactive systems. This is of particular concern for storage of CO2 in depleted oil and gas reservoirs with numerous legacy wells engineered to variable standards.Research suggests that leakage risks are not as great as initially perceived because chemical and mechanical alteration of cement has the capacity to seal damaged zones. Our work centers on defining the coupled chemical and mechanical processes governing flow in damaged zones in wells. We have developed process-based models, constrained by experiments, to better understand and forecast leakage risk. Leakage pathways can be sealed by precipitation of carbonate minerals in the fractures and deformation of the reacted cement. High reactivity of cement hydroxides releases excess calcium that can precipitate as carbonate solids in the fracture network under low brine flow rates. If the flow is fast, then the brine remains undersaturated with respect to the solubility of calcium carbonate minerals, and zones depleted in calcium hydroxides, enriched in calcium carbonate precipitates, and made of amorphous silicates leached of original cement minerals are formed. Under confining pressure, the reacted cement is compressed, which reduces permeability and lowers leakage risks.The broader context of this paper is to use our experimentally calibrated chemical, mechanical, and transport model to illustrate when, where, and in what conditions fracture pathways seal in CO2 storage wells, to reduce their risk to groundwater resources. We do this by defining the amount of cement and the time required to effectively seal the leakage pathways associated with peak and postinjection overpressures, within the context of oil and gas industry standards for leak detection, mitigation, and repairs. Our simulations suggest that for many damage scenarios chemical and mechanical processes lower leakage risk by reducing or sealing fracture pathways. Leakage risk would remain high in wells with a large amount of damage, modeled here as wide fracture apertures, where fast flowing fluids are too dilute for carbonate precipitation and subsurface stress does not compress the altered cement. Fracture sealing is more likely as reservoir pressures decrease during the postinjection phase where lower fluxes aid chemical alteration and mechanical deformation of cement. Our results hold promise for the development of mitigation framework to avoid impacting groundwater resources above any geologic CO2 storage reservoir by correlating operational pressures and barrier lengths. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027398115

Predicting vector occurrence in specific regions is a challenge that disease control programs must meet in order to plan and execute control interventions and climate change adaptation measures. Recently, an increasing number of scientific articles have applied ecological niche modelling (ENM) to study medically important insects and ticks. With a myriad of available methods, it is challenging to interpret their results. Here we review the future projections of disease vectors produced by ENM, and assess their trends and limitations. Tropical regions are currently occupied by many vector species; but future projections indicate poleward expansions of suitable climates for their occurrence and, therefore, entomological surveillance must be continuously done in areas projected to become suitable. The most commonly applied methods were the maximum entropy algorithm, generalized linear models, the genetic algorithm for rule set prediction, and discriminant analysis. Lack of consideration of the full-known current distribution of the target species on models with future projections has led to questionable predictions. We conclude that there is no ideal 'gold standard' method to model vector distributions; researchers are encouraged to test different methods for the same data. Such practice is becoming common in the field of ENM, but still lags behind in studies of disease vectors.

Perennial grasses may increase soil C compared to annual crops because of more extensive root systems, but it is less clear how much soil C is derived from above- vs. belowground inputs. The objective of this study was to synthesize the existing knowledge regarding soil C inputs from above- and belowground crop residues in regions cultivated with sugarcane, corn, and miscanthus, and to predict the impact of residue removal and tillage on soil C stocks. The literature review showed that aboveground inputs to soil C (to 1-m depth) ranged from 70% to 81% for sugarcane and corn vs. 40% for miscanthus. Modeled aboveground C inputs (to 30 cm depth) ranged from 54% to 82% for sugarcane, but were 67% for miscanthus. Because 50% of observed miscanthus belowground biomass is below 30 cm depth, it may be necessary to increase the depth of modeled soil C dynamics to reconcile modeled belowground C inputs with measured. Modeled removal of aboveground corn residue (25–100%) resulted in C stock reduction in areas of corn–corn–soybean rotation under conventional tillage, while no-till management lessoned this impact. In sugarcane, soil C stocks were reduced when total aboveground residue was removed at one site, while partial removal of sugarcane residue did not reduce soil C stocks in either area. This study suggests that aboveground crop residues were the main C-residue source to the soil in the current bioethanol sector (corn and sugarcane) and the indiscriminate removal of crop residues to produce cellulosic biofuels can reduce soil C stocks and reduce the environmental benefits of bioenergy. Moreover, a switch to feedstocks such as miscanthus with more allocation to belowground C could increase soil C stocks at a much faster rate. © 2017 The Authors Global Change Biology Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","bioenergy; corn; miscanthus; root biomass; sugarcane","Agricultural machinery; Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Bioethanol; Biofuels; Biomass; Crops; Cultivation; Sugar cane; Belowground biomass; Bio-energy; Conventional tillage; corn; Environmental benefits; Management practices; Miscanthus; Root biomass; Soils; bioenergy; biomass; energy crop; grass; maize; root; soil carbon; sugar cane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008485814

The delimitation was based primarily on the analysis of the temporal evolution of mortality and morbidity rates of this disease since 2000, by state, which allowed the identification of twelve entities that sustained the highest rates throughout twelve years, as well as the municipalities where the most relevant data of this disease were recorded during that period. Likewise, the twelve states with the lowest rates were delimited in this respect, to review which municipalities of these states presented the most significant mortality and morbidity data and to review in the subsequent analysis, the coincidences or divergences presented by both antagonistic spaces. In total, one hundred twenty municipalities were selected for the analysis of environmental factors that have been identified in various sources as potential sources of risk in the development of breast cancer. The variables analyzed are: contaminated surface waters, contaminated soils, contaminated groundwater, polluting industries and air pollution from thermoelectric plants and how they have been spatially and statistically expressed in the target municipalities. The methodology was based on the analysis of the spatial behavior of the variables indicated and was complemented with the application of the multiple regression models in the target or occurrence municipalities. Considering the statistical data of breast cancer and the selected variables, the relationship resulted positive in three variables: industries, contaminated groundwater and contaminated soils. Some of the most relevant results were: First, according with the indicators currently used by the National Water Commission (CONAGUA) regarding the severely contaminated water surface: five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (DQO) and The total suspended solids (SST), coincided the presence of them in seventy-four of the target municipalities that equal 61.6%. Second, by analyzing the COD index separately, as it shows contamination by industrial discharges and agricultural activity, it turned out that eighty-six sites (74%) contaminated with this indicator of a total of 116 points recorded by CONAGUA are located in the Municipalities. Concerning the presence of groundwater (aquifers) contaminated mainly with nitrates in concentrations greater than 45 mg / l; in the counts of spatial analysis, it is observed that in seventy-five of the target municipalities (65%), this variable is present. Another relevant result was to review the location of thermoelectric plants generating electric energy that run on fuels that affect air quality such as fuel oil, coal and disel, all three generate carcinogenic elements when they combust. In this case of the total of the eighty-four thermoelectric plants operating in the country, fifty-eight (69%) are located in thirty-nine of the target municipalities (32.5%). And of the total number of polluting industries that operate in the country, only five (4.1%) of the target municipalities did not have this type of industry, so this variable was very significant in the study areas. Finally, the presence of sites contaminated with hazardous wastes (RP), resulting from wastes generated by the mining, basic chemistry, petrochemical, oil refining and agribusiness industries, were also present in 112 (93.3%) of the target municipalities. It is concluded that it was relevant to delimit the main spaces where breast cancer has developed during the last twelve years, since this allowed the application of the physical variables to be able to identify several risk factors that have converged in them, a situation that can, possibly explain, in part, the presence of this neoplasm among the female population of certain regions of Mexico. This is of importance if one considers that the World Health Organization attributes to environmental factors as the cause of the development of more than eighty percent of the cancers that occur in the world, mainly lung and breast cancer. This analysis makes it possible to focus and implement public policies aimed at the prevention and detection of women who are currently exposed to the risk factors described in the study and in the designation of resources for the treatment and care of the population that already suffers this disease.

Consequently, governments have applied policies to reduce air pollution. Quantitative health impact assessments of hypothetic changes in air pollution have been conducted at national and global level, but assessments of observed air pollution changes associated with specific clean air policies at a local or regional scale remain scarce. This study estimates health impacts attributable to a decrease in PM10 and NO2 exposure in the Agglomeration of Lausanne-Morges (ALM), Switzerland, between 2005 and 2015, corresponding to the implementation period of a supra-municipal plan of measures to reduce air pollution in different sectors such as transport, energy, and industry (called Plan OPair 05). The health impact assessment compares health effects attributed to air pollution exposure levels in 2015 (reference case) with those in 2005 (counterfactual scenario), using 2015 as baseline for all other input data. In the ALM, the modeled PM10 exposure reduction of 3.3 μg/m3 from 2005 to 2015 prevents 26 premature deaths (equivalent to around 290 years of life lost), 215 hospitalization days due to cardio-vascular and respiratory diseases as well as approximately 47,000 restricted activity days annually. Monetized health impacts of the reduction of PM10 exposure are valued at approximately CHF 36 million annually. Immaterial costs, mainly related to the economic valuation of years of life lost, dominate the monetized health impacts (90% of total value), while savings at the workplace (net loss in production and reoccupation costs) amount to about CHF 1.9 million, and savings in health care costs to about CHF 0.5 million. The assessment is sensitive to the value assigned to immaterial costs and to uncertainties in the relative risk estimates, whereas variations in the baseline year (i.e. using 2005 data instead of 2015 data) affect results to a much lower degree. The alternative calculation based on NO2 exposure, which dropped by 5.6 μg/m3, suggests the prevention of 51 premature deaths (equivalent to around 550 years of life lost) overall impacts valued at CHF 49 million. All in all, the reduction in mortality due to the air quality improvements accounts for (depending on the considered pollutant) about 1% to 2% of total all-cause annual mortality in the ALM population or 4–8 times larger than the annual traffic fatalities in the ALM. © 2017 The Authors","Agglomeration; Air pollution; Clean air policy; Health impact assessment","nitrogen dioxide; adolescent; adult; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; cardiovascular disease; child; environmental exposure; female; hospitalization; human; infant; male; mortality; newborn; particulate matter; preschool child; prevention and control; respiratory tract disease; statistics and numerical data; Switzerland; trends; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Mortality; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Switzerland; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017459542

Turbulent flux measurements from two eddy-covariance towers and additional observations from a dense network of small, wireless meteorological stations combine to relate land cover (savanna forest and agriculture) to evaporation in a small (3.5km2) catchment in Burkina Faso, west Africa. We observe larger sensible and latent heat fluxes over the savanna forest in the headwater area relative to the agricultural section of the watershed all year. Higher fluxes above the savanna forest are attributed to the greater number of exposed rocks and trees and the higher productivity of the forest compared to rain-fed, hand-farmed agricultural fields. Vegetation cover and soil moisture are found to be primary controls of the evaporative fraction. Satellite-derived vegetation index (NDVI) and soil moisture are determined to be good predictors of evaporative fraction, as indicators of the physical basis of evaporation. Our measurements provide an estimator that can be used to derive evaporative fraction when only NDVI is available. Such large-scale estimates of evaporative fraction from remotely sensed data are valuable where ground-based measurements are lacking, which is the case across the African continent and many other semi-arid areas. Evaporative fraction estimates can be combined, for example, with sensible heat from measurements of temperature variance, to provide an estimate of evaporation when only minimal meteorological measurements are available in remote regions of the world. These findings reinforce local cultural beliefs of the importance of forest fragments for climate regulation and may provide support to local decision makers and rural farmers in the maintenance of the forest areas.",,"Agriculture; Catchments; Decision making; Evaporation; Moisture; Rain; Soil moisture; Vegetation; Eddy covariance towers; Ground based measurement; Meteorological measurements; Meteorological station; Remotely sensed data; Sensible and latent heat fluxes; Temperature variance; Turbulent flux measurements; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028066054

The study shows that the United States ’withdrawal from the Paris Agreement will affect the existence and implementation of successive climate policies and result in an additional 8.8–13.4% increase in the global emissions reduction deficit. The United States’ withdrawal will also deteriorate the existing climate finance mechanism. The Green Climate Fund (GCF)’s funding gap will increase by US$2 billion, while the gap of long-term climate finance will increase by about US$5 billion a year. Either the China–EU or the “BASIC plus” mechanism could fill the governance deficit caused by the United States and the lack of political momentum may continue for a while in the future. © 2017 Shandong Normal University.","finance deficit; global climate governance deficit; mitigation deficit; Paris Agreement; Trump administration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029446401

They are typically removed during gas processing operations and acid gases cleaning by chemical absorption with aqueous alkanolamine solution, for example. CO2 and other impurities are also present in combustion products of power stations. Carbon dioxide Capture transport and storage (CCS) is one solution to reduce emission of CO2 attributed to human activities. It exists in several technologies more or less mature which can be used for CO2 capture. These technologies depend on the composition of the flue gas (the stream after combustion is mainly composed of N2 and CO2) and the processes used, (post-, pre- or oxy-combustion processes). CO2 can be transported via ship or pipeline (mainly by pipelines for acid gases). The required compression pressure can be 100-300 bar, depending on the distance between the place of CO2 removal and the place of its utilization but also the composition of CO2 rich gas stream. The CO2 rich stream can contain a lot of impurities which can modify the phase diagram. It is of great importance to know the phase behavior of CO2 rich streams [1]. Indeed, along with carbon dioxide, a great number of compounds such as water, O2, N2, Ar, SOx, NOx, H2, CO and H2S can be present at different levels of concentration. The presence of these impurities combined with potentially long-distance transportation could lead to challenging engineering and flow assurance issues. During transportation by pipeline, if the pipe suffers a major fracture due to an accidental release or a failure, CO2 can rapidly expand and cool: Vapor cloud followed by solid formation of CO2 may appear. The impurities could change the characteristics of the leak and change the conditions and compositions of CO2 clouds and solid. The presence of water in the stream may also result in corrosion, ice and/or gas hydrate formation and pipeline blockage, so the fluid system should meet certain dehydration requirements.

Recent developments in the understanding of the mechanism of electrocatalytic O2 reduction by iron porphyrin complexes in situ using surface enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy coupled to rotating disc electrochemistry (SERRS-RDE) in conjunction with H/D isotope effects on electrocatalytic current reveals that the rate of O2 reduction, ∼104 to 105 M-1 s-1 for simple iron porphyrins, is limited by the rate of O-O bond cleavage of an intermediate ferric peroxide species (FeIII-OOH). SERRS-RDE probes the system in operando when it is under steady state such that any intermediate species that has a greater rate of formation relative to its rate of decay, including the rate determining species, would accumulate and can be identified. This technique is particularly well suited to investigate iron porphyrin electrocatalysts as the intense symmetric ligand vibrations allow determination of the oxidation and spin states of the bound iron with high fidelity.The rate of O2 reduction could be tuned up by 3 orders of magnitude by incorporating residues in the catalyst design that can exert ""push"" or ""pull"" effects, that is, axial phenolate and thiolate ligands and distal arginine residues. Similarly the rate of O-O bond cleavage can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude upon incorporating a distal Cu site and installing the active site in a hydrophobic protein environment in synthetic models and biosynthetic protein scaffolds. The selectivity, however, is solely determined by the site of protonation of a ferric peroxide (FeIII-OOH) intermediate and can be governed by installing preorganized second sphere residues in the distal pocket. The 4e-/4H+ reduction of O2 entails protonation of the distal oxygen of the FeIII-OOH species, while 2e-/2H+ reduction requires the proximal oxygen to be protonated.Mechanistic investigations of CO2 reduction by iron porphyrins reveal that the rate-determining step is the C-O bond cleavage of a FeII-COOH species analogous to the O-O bond cleavage step of a FeIII-OOH species in O2 reduction. The selectivity, resulting in either CO or HCOOH, is determined by the site of protonation of this species. These similarities suggests that the chemical principles governing the rate and selectivity of reduction of small molecules like O2, CO2, NOx, and SOx may be quite similar in nature. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025092918

Nonetheless, the emission of climatically relevant greenhouse gases increases with the disturbance of the mangrove sediment −this might undermine the credible reservoir of carbon within the sediment. This article attempts to estimate the environmental (carbon emission) and economic consequences of converting mangrove to cropland (especially rice paddy) based on field-scale study at three different sites (Khola, Gupti and Damra) within the Bhitarkanika mangrove for two consecutive years. The study suggests that the cumulative methane (CH4) emission was significantly higher from the rice paddy (211.3 kg ha−1) compared to the mangrove sediment (50.8 kg ha−1), while the average nitrous oxide (N2O) emission was significantly higher from the later (2.1 kg ha−1). Multivariate statistical analysis suggests that the land use was the prime controlling factor for variation in CH4 and N2O emission. Total carbon equivalent emission (CEETOT) from the rice paddy was significantly higher than mangrove during the study period. The study suggests that the economic value of the mangrove ecosystem was several folds higher than that of the rice paddy. The CEETOT of the Bhitarkanika mangrove has increased approximately 212 Gg over last few decades due to the conversion of the mangrove area to the rice paddy. Such studies are imperative in developing effective regional climate change adaptation strategies. The study advocates urgent need to educate and aware people about the benefits of the mangrove compared to the cropland. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon equivalent emission; Economic value; Mangrove; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Rice paddy","agricultural emission; carbon emission; climate change; economic analysis; environmental disturbance; greenhouse gas; land use change; mangrove; methane; nitrous oxide; paddy field; regional climate; rice; statistical analysis; Bhitarkanika; India; Odisha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020048408

Forest and landscape restoration focuses on spatial scales beyond the ""site"" level, where multiple land uses and forms of land ownership coexist, and where management decisions are usually made by different sets of stakeholders. In this context, natural regeneration can be a cost-effective approach to expand buffer zones of protected areas or forest reserves, create new forest patches and riparian zones, and create biological corridors to link existing protected areas. Here, I describe different modalities of natural regeneration, describe their benefits and features, and present several case studies of large-scale natural regeneration. Regrowing forests are often ignored, and their ecological and economic value remains largely unrecognized. Effective incentives for landowners and local communities are needed to encourage and protect naturally regenerating forests on farms. Predicting and mapping areas with a high capacity for natural regeneration will lower the overall costs of implementing restoration at local, regional, and national levels and may permit larger areas to be restored. Regrowing tropical forests will play an increasingly important role in climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation in our future uncertain world.","Assisted natural regeneration; farmer-managedn atural regeneration; landscape restoration; large-scale restoration; spatial prioritization; succession",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028435290

The conventional nanoparticle-incorporation route for graphene is to create nucleation/attachment sites via ""carbon-centered"" covalent functionalization, which changes the local hybridization of carbon atoms from trigonal-planar sp2 to tetrahedral sp3. This disrupts the lattice planarity of graphene, thus dramatically deteriorating its mobility and innate superior properties. Here, we show large-area, vapor-phase, ""ring-centered"" hexahapto (η6) functionalization of graphene to create nucleation-sites for silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) without disrupting its sp2 character.

All of the planets orbit nearby M-stars and are likely tidally locked in 1:1 spin-orbit states, which motivates the consideration of the effects that tidal locking might have on planetary habitability. On Earth, periods of global glaciation (snowballs) may have been essential for habitability and remote signs of life (biosignatures) because they are correlated with increases in the complexity of life and in the atmospheric oxygen concentration. In this paper, we investigate the snowball bifurcation (sudden onset of global glaciation) on tidally locked planets using both an energy balance model and an intermediate-complexity global climate model. We show that tidally locked planets are unlikely to exhibit a snowball bifurcation as a direct result of the spatial pattern of insolation they receive. Instead, they will smoothly transition from partial to complete ice coverage and back. A major implication of this work is that tidally locked planets with an active carbon cycle should not be found in a snowball state. Moreover, this work implies that tidally locked planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone with low CO2 outgassing fluxes will equilibrate with a small unglaciated substellar region rather than cycling between warm and snowball states. More work is needed to determine how the lack of a snowball bifurcation might affect the development of life on a tidally locked planet. © 2017. The American Astronomical Society.

The objective of this study was to examine the management and landscape effects on water stable soil aggregates, soil aggregate-associated carbon, nitrogen content and soil carbon, and nitrogen accumulation in Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. Treatments were rubber monoculture (Rm) and four rubber-based agroforestry systems: H. brasiliensis–C. arabica (CAAs), H. brasiliensis–T. cacao (TCAs), H. brasiliensis–F. macrophylla (FMAs) and H. brasiliensis–D. cochinchinensis (DCAs). The results showed that, with the exception of CAAs, the rubber-based agroforestry treatments significantly increased total soil organic carbon (SOC) and N contents and enhanced the formation of macroaggregates compared to the rubber monoculture treatment. SOC and N contents in all water-stable aggregate fractions were significantly higher in rubber-based agroforestry systems (except CAAs) compared to rubber monoculture. The macroaggregate fractions contained more organic carbon and nitrogen than the microaggregate fractions. The proportions of C and N loss from slaking and sieving were shown to have significantly negative correlations with the mean weight diameter and the SOC and N concentrations in bulk soil. The results suggest that soil surface cover with constant leaf litter fall and extensive root systems in the rubber-based agroforestry systems increased soil organic carbon and nitrogen, helped improve soil aggregation, reduced soil erosion, decreased carbon and nitrogen loss, and ultimately improved the carbon and nitrogen accumulation rates. Given that the soil physical-chemical properties improvement and the patterns of the intercropping system played key roles in managing artificial forests, we recommend that local governments and farmers should prefer T. cacao, F. macrophylla and D. cochinchinensis and not C. arabica as the alternative interplanted tree species within rubber plantations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aggregate stability; Aggregate-associated carbon; Agroforestry systems; Erosion; Soil organic matter","Agglomeration; Aggregates; Agriculture; Erosion; Forestry; Land use; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Rubber; Rubber plantations; Soil mechanics; Soil testing; Soils; System stability; Aggregate associated carbons; Aggregate stability; Agroforestry system; Physical chemical property; Soil aggregate stability; Soil organic carbon and nitrogen; Soil organic matters; Water stable aggregates; Soil pollution; aggregate stability; agroforestry; angiosperm; environmental quality; forest management; intercropping; land use; leaf litter; litterfall; local government; microaggregate; monoculture; organic carbon; physicochemical property; plantation forestry; rubber; soil carbon; soil erosion; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; China; Xishuangbanna; Yunnan; Hevea brasiliensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016436841

A key step in decoupling urban economy from carbon emissions is to understand the full impact of socioeconomic development on urban metabolism over time. Herein, we establish a system-based framework for modeling the variation of urban carbon metabolism through time by integrating a metabolic flow inventory, input-output model, and network analysis. Using Beijing as a case study, we track the historical trajectory of carbon flows embodied in urban final consumption over 1985-2012. We find that while the tendency of increase in direct carbon emission continues within this time frame, consumption-based carbon footprint might have peaked around 2010. Significant transitions in emission intensity and roles sectors play in transferring carbon over the period are important signs of decoupling urban development from carbonization. Our further analysis of driving factors reveals a strong competition between efficiency gains and consumption level rise, showing a cumulative contribution of -584% and 494% to total carbon footprint, respectively. Projection into a future pathway suggests there is still a great potential for carbon mitigation for the city, but a strong mitigation plan is required to achieve such decarbonization before 2030.

Energy efficiency and emissions reduction are becoming essential rationales for such investments. It is important, therefore, to understand under what conditions investments in ITS in the context of smart cities produce energy savings. We reviewed existing literature, conducted case studies and interviews, and found that the smart cities context has transformed traditional ITS into “smart mobility” with three major characteristics: people-centric, data-driven, and powered by bottom-up innovations. We argue that there are four main steps for smart mobility solutions to achieve energy savings and that several institutional, technical, and physical conditions are required at each step. Energy savings are achieved when users change their behavior and result in less travel, modal shift, and reduction of per-km energy consumption in the short term. Smart mobility solutions also enable other energy saving policies or initiatives, which would otherwise not be feasible. In the long term, users’ lifestyles could change and lead to further energy savings. For cities in developing countries with lower motorization, less-developed infrastructure, less financial resources, and less institutional and technical capacity, our recommendations to achieve benefits from smart mobility investments are: (1) involve all public and private players in a collaborative and transparent setting; (2) develop the technical capacity to procure and monitor information services; and (3) focus on basic infrastructure, including a coherent road network and basic traffic management measures. © 2017","Energy savings; ITS; Smart cities; Smart mobility","Developing countries; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Highway traffic control; Information management; Information services; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Smart city; Traffic control; Transportation; Emissions reduction; Energy saving policies; Financial resources; Intelligent transportation systems; Mobility solutions; Physical conditions; Technical capacity; Traffic management; Investments; developing world; emission control; energy efficiency; energy use; intelligent transportation system; investment; mobility; smart city; traffic management; urban transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033391841

These islands – Penghu County, Liuqui Island, Kinmen County, Matsu Island and Green Island – have their own waste management approaches that can serve as a guideline for waste management with greenhouse gas mitigation. The findings indicate that the total annual greenhouse gas emissions of the islands ranged from 292.1 to 29,096.2 [metric] tonne CO2-equivalent. The loading waste volumes and shipping distances were positively related to greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. The greenhouse gas emissions from waste-to-energy plants, mainly carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, can be offset by energy recovery (approximately 38.6% of greenhouse gas emissions from incineration). In addition, about 34% and 11% of waste generated on the islands was successfully recycled and composted, respectively.

Based on incorporation of a discrete distribution transformation (DDT) method and integration of advanced statistical inferential methods, a recursive framework of dissimilarity and similarity inferences is proposed for stepwise grouping multi-dimensional climate-variable observations. ReDSICC is capable of eliminating the restriction of samples being normally distributed, enabling classification of regional climates under data uncertainties and multivariate dependencies, identifying the most desired climate classification result, and avoiding subjective judgments in the classification process. To verify methodological effectiveness and facilitate related studies, ReDSICC is applied to climate classification in the Athabasca River Basin (ARB), Canada. It is revealed that the complicated dissimilarities and similarities of climatic conditions among all grids over the ARB are effectively reflected in the results of ReDSICC. A reversible transformation between an abnormal distribution and a normal distribution is achieved by DDT. The effectiveness of climate classification which is represented as the Nash coefficient for climatic features over any grid and the corresponding climate class is decreased if DDT is not employed. In comparison with daily minimum temperature, the spatial heterogeneity of daily maximum temperature is higher while that of daily cumulative precipitation is lower over the ARB. The classification result of ReDSICC varies with changes of representative climate variables and parameter values. These advantages and revelations are helpful for enhancing the reliability of climate classification results, improving the effectiveness of existing climate classification methods, and providing scientific support for the related studies in the ARB or neighbouring regions. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society","Athabasca River; climate classification; recursive; statistical inference","Normal distribution; Rivers; Statistical methods; Watersheds; Athabasca; Classification methods; Classification process; Classification results; Cumulative precipitation; Recursive; Reversible transformation; Statistical inference; Multivariant analysis; climate classification; climate conditions; multivariate analysis; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; temperature gradient; Athabasca Basin; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018822361

Yet uncertainty persists whether protected areas will continue to meet conservation goals if climate change causes community or ecosystem shifts. Previous research has proven equivocal with some studies finding protected areas fail conservation objectives and others finding objectives are largely met. The effectiveness of protected area systems within tropical Asia and for insects are particularly under-studied. Using species distribution modeling of 68 butterfly species (15,346 locality records), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of protected areas in Hong Kong, one of the most well-covered (40% land area) protected area systems in the Asian tropics, and projected how the ability to protect biodiversity would change under different climate change scenarios and different conservation target schemes. Under climate change, 15–37% of the modeled species in 2000 were projected to become extirpated by 2050. Under all conservation target schemes, the proportion of species unprotected increased or leveled, by up to as much as 7%. If buffer grids were considered as unprotected, the increase in these gap species was much greater, by up to as much as 22%.

Here we examine this hypothesis using flow and climate trend estimates (1970–2007) at 55 hydrometric gauge stations and across their contributing watersheds' within the Fraser River basin in British Columbia, Canada. Using a null hypothesis framework, we compared our observed attenuation of river flow trends as a function of increasing area and climate trend diversity, with null-simulated estimates to gauge the likelihood and strength of our observations. We found the Fraser River reduced variability in downstream long-term discharge by >91%, with >3.1 times the attenuation than would be expected under null simulation. Although the strength of dampening varied seasonally, our findings indicate that large free-flowing rivers offer a powerful and largely unappreciated process of climate change mitigation.

Optimization of CH4 remediating bio-filters need to take microbial responses into account. Divalent copper (Cu2+) and iron (Fe2+) are present in landfills at variable ratios and play a vital role in methane oxidation capacity and growth of methanotrophs. This study, as a first of its kind, therefore quantified effects of variable Cu2+ and Fe2+ (5:5, 5:25 and 5:50 μM) ratios on mixed methanotrophic communities enriched from landfill top cover (LB) and compost soils (CB). CH4 oxidation capacity, CH4 removal efficiencies, fatty acids content/profiles and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB; a biopolymer) contents were also analysed to quantify performance and potential co-product development. Mixed methanotroph cultures were raised in 10 L continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs, Bioflo® &amp; Celligen® 310 Fermentor/Bioreactor; John Morris Scientific, Chatswood, NSW, Australia). Community structure was determined by amplifying the V3-V4 region of 16s rRNA gene. Community structure and, consequently, fatty acid-profiles changed significantly with increasing Cu2+/Fe2+ ratios, and responses were different for LB and CB. Effects on methane oxidation capacities and PHB content were similar in the LB- and CB-CSTR, decreasing with increasing Cu2+/Fe2+ ratios, while biomass growth was unaffected. In general, high Fe2+ concentration favored growth of the type -II methanotroph Methylosinus in the CB-CSTR, but methanotroph abundances decreased in the LB-CSTR. Increase in Cu2+/Fe2+ ratio increased the growth of Sphingopyxis in both systems, while Azospirllum was co-dominant in the LB- but absent in the CB-CSTR. After 13 days, methane oxidation capacities and PHB content decreased by ∼50% and more in response to increasing Fe2+ concentrations. Although methanotroph abundance was ∼2% in the LB- (compared to &gt;50% in CB-CSTR), methane oxidation capacities were comparable in the two systems, suggesting that methane oxidation capacity was maintained by the dominant Azospirllum and Sphingopyxis in the LB-CSTR. Despite similar methanotroph inoculum community composition and controlled environmental variables, increasing Cu2+/Fe2+ ratios resulted in significantly different microbial community structures in the LB- and CB-CSTR, indicative of complex microbial interactions. In summary, our results suggest that a detailed understanding of allelopathic interactions in mixed methanotrophic consortia is vital for constructing robust bio-filters for CH4 emission abatement. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biopolymers; Bioreactor; Heavy metal; Methane; Methanotrophs; Microbial community","copper; fatty acid; iron; methane; poly(3 hydroxybutyric acid); RNA 16S; methane; biomass; bioreactor; cation; community composition; copper; growth rate; heavy metal; iron; methane; methanogenic bacterium; methanotrophy; microbial activity; microbial community; microbial ecology; optimization; pollutant removal; polymer; Article; bacterial growth; bacterium culture; community structure; compost; continuous stirred tank reactor; landfill; methanotroph; methanotrophic bacterium; Methylosinus; microbial biomass; microbial community; microbial consortium; nonhuman; oxidation; Australia; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; waste disposal facility; Australia; New South Wales; Methylosinus; Sphingopyxis; Australia; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil Microbiology; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016416754

We projected these combinations onto existing forests in South Korea and grouped them into four forest categories. We used species distribution models for 1031 climate vulnerable plant species as a biodiversity index, and found that species richness loss due to forest conversion could be reduced significantly by deploying the scenarios which preserve forest areas that are climatically suitable for these species. Climate-suitable forest areas declined sharply and moved northward as future temperatures increase, and climate-suitable areas lost the highest proportion of forest extent under the current trend of forest conversion. We suggest climate refugia, defined as existing forests with suitable future climates, be protected from land use conversion as a way to preserve forest biodiversity. These spatially explicit results can be used for developing forest conservation policies, and the methods may be applicable to other forested regions. However, planners should consider the assumptions and uncertainties of climate projections, species distribution models, and land use trends when addressing forest biodiversity conservation. © 2017 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Climate change; Climate refugia; Forest conservation; Forest conversion; Land use change; Policy scenario-planning; Species distribution model","Biodiversity; Climate models; Conservation; Forestry; Land use; Population distribution; Climate refugia; Forest conservation; Forest conversion; Land-use change; Policy scenario; Species distribution modeling; Climate change; biodiversity; climate change; conservation management; forest management; land use change; nature conservation; policy approach; Biodiversity; Climates; Conservation; Distribution; Forests; Land Use; Models; Species Identification; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028718226

As a desperate and emergency measure, the administration implemented ‘traffic intervention’ mitigation effort by instigating ‘odd-even’ policy as a trial for 15 days in January (1–15) 2016. During this period, odd and even numbered private cars were restricted to respective odd and even days. Here we examine the impact of this policy intervention on ambient particulate matter smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) through a combination of in-situ, satellite and model data. Traffic restriction reduces PM2.5 by 4–6% (maximum up to 10% in three local hotspots) which is within the uncertainty range of satellite-based estimates (and hence not detected). This is not a significant result considering the fact that such step was taken as an emergency measure when PM2.5 exposure exceeded 250 μg/m3 during the winter season. The failure is attributed to stable meteorological conditions (winds are not strong enough to disperse PM2.5 away) during the period and there was no control over PM2.5 outside the periphery of the city.

The removal of 18 multi-class pharmaceuticals, as model trace organic contaminants (TrOCs), has been studied. (Biological) activated carbon filtration could reduce the amount of TrOCs significantly (&gt;99%) but is cost-intensive for full-scale applications. Filtration techniques mainly depending on biodegradation mechanisms (TF and SSF) are found to be inefficient for TrOCs removal as a stand alone technique. Ozonation resulted in 90% removal of the total amount of quantified TrOCs, but a post-ozonation step is needed to cope with an increased unselective toxicity. SSF following ozonation showed to be the only technique able to reduce the unselective toxicity to the same level as before ozonation. In view of process control, innovative correlation models developed for the monitoring and control of TrOC removal during ozonation, are verified for their applicability during ozonation in combination with TF, SSF or BAC. Particularly for the poorly ozone reactive TrOCs, statistically significant models were obtained that correlate TrOC removal and reduction in UVA254 as an online measured surrogate parameter. © IWA Publishing 2017.","(biological) activated carbon; Ozonation; Pharmaceuticals; Slow sand filtration; Spectral measurements; Trickling filter","Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Biodegradation; Biological water treatment; Drug products; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Real time control; Toxicity; Trickling filtration; Wastewater treatment; Biological activated carbon; Full-scale applications; Micropollutant removals; Slow sand filtration; Spectral measurement; Statistically significant models; Trace organic contaminants; Trickling filter; Filtration; activated carbon; ozone; charcoal; silicon dioxide; activated carbon; biodegradation; biofiltration; control system; drug; effluent; filter; filtration; organic pollutant; ozonation; ozone; pollutant removal; real time; spectral analysis; toxicity; wastewater treatment; Article; biodegradation; effluent toxicity; filtration; intermethod comparison; ozonation; process control; statistical model; ultraviolet A radiation; waste component removal; waste water management; water pollutant; chemistry; comparative study; devices; filtration; procedures; sewage; waste water; water pollutant; Charcoal; Filtration; Ozone; Silicon Dioxide; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024890142

These action plans are linked to different municipal promotion tools, and a set of indicators has also been proposed to define and monitor the actions. In general, the adequacy of the main indicators used by the SEAPs is analysed, taking into consideration the representation of the urban system across all scales (city, neighbourhood and building) as well as whether the chosen indicators enable the analyst to consider the influence of human activities (i.e. hours of use) on energy consumption, within the system. In contrast, this paper proposes to apply the fund-flow model as an accounting framework that can be used to develop indicators for energy-efficient urban planning. The energy model behind these indicators was obtained using an innovative procedure for energy simulation which considers the isolated characteristics of the buildings (type of construction, occupation, interior comfort, type of energy system) as well as the interaction with the surrounding buildings (shadows, streets, geometry).The indicators proposed have been developed within the SEMANCO UE project, and we have taken into account their potential as criteria for identifying the most effective actions for energy planning on multilevel scales.

In this paper, we characterised the variability of carbon footprints of open-field tomato production by analysing a comprehensive farm dataset gathered over 4 years. We also assessed the importance of the different drivers of variability as compared to model uncertainties. The primary data used in this study were collected from 189 farms from the Extremadura region in Spain and Portugal over a period of four years, from 2012 to 2015. We modelled the carbon footprint of these farms using the Cool Farm Tool model developed by Hillier et al. (2011) and conducted statistical analysis on the results to understand the relative importance of inter-year and intra-year variability. We performed sensitivity analysis to understand how sensitive the results were to variability in the farmers' input parameters and to the uncertainty in model parameters. This was done by varying all factors one-at-a-time, and then by running a Monte Carlo simulation where all uncertainties were propagated simultaneously. Results clearly show significant inter-year and intra-year variability in carbon footprints of tomato production within the study region. We observed approximately 20% variation for each annual carbon footprint (intra-year variability), resulting in an overall 28% coefficient of variation in the aggregated footprint across the different years. The carbon footprint of the whole tomato supply, calculated with the 4-year dataset, showed a weighted geometric mean of 51 kg CO2-eq/t and a weighted GSD of 1.32, meaning a 95% confidence interval of 29–89 kg CO2-eq/t. Results also show that small farms were characterised by a larger variability than larger ones. This highlights the need to weight farm results by production volumes if the objective is to obtain a carbon footprint for the total production in a given region. The carbon footprint was found to be mainly sensitive to variability in farm practices, notably extent of pump irrigation and choice and amount of fertiliser used, with model uncertainties influencing the results to a relatively smaller extent. Further work is needed to extend these findings to other crops, regions and impact categories. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Carbon footprint; Reporting; Tomato; Uncertainty; Variability","Agricultural implements; Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Environmental impact; Fruits; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; Climatic conditions; Coefficient of variation; Confidence interval; Model uncertainties; Reporting; Tomato; Uncertainty; Variability; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019965734

New production technologies have led to rapidly declining natural gas prices that has renewed Hawaii’s interest in liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports. This study integrates a detailed model of Hawaii’s electric sector with a computable general equilibrium model of Hawaii’s economy to estimate the economic and greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts of importing LNG for use in the electric sector. Incorporating a range of possible price pathways (low, medium and high) out to the year 2040 for LNG imports, we find Hawaii could lower electric sector costs in a range from 6 to 16 % and petroleum refining output declines by over 20 % (in 2040). Gross state product increases in a range of $300 million to $5 billion in net present value. Using natural gas reduces out-of-stack GHG emissions but can also increase GHG emissions in other jurisdictions. Moreover, introducing natural gas could reduce the incentive to pursue renewable energy and energy efficiency. As such, adopting and enforcing policies encouraging renewable energy and efficiency becomes even more important to meet Hawaii’s clean energy and GHG mitigation goals. © 2016, Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies and Springer Japan.","Computable general equilibrium; Electric sector; Hawaii; Natural gas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965025507

The primary objective of this study was to update the previous Collet et al. studies by using the most up-to-date (at the time the study was done) modeling emission tools, inventories, and meteorology available to conduct ozone source attribution and sensitivity studies. Results show future-year, 2030, design values for 8-hr ozone concentrations were lower than base-year values, 2011. The ozone source attribution results for selected cities showed that boundary conditions were the dominant contributors to ozone concentrations at the western U.S. locations, and were important for many of the eastern U.S. locations. Point sources were generally more important in the eastern United States than in the western United States. The contributions of on-road mobile emissions were less than 5 ppb at a majority of the cities selected for analysis. The higher-order decoupled direct method (HDDM) results showed that in most of the locations selected for analysis, NOx emission reductions were more effective than VOC emission reductions in reducing ozone levels. The source attribution results from this study provide useful information on the important source categories and provide some initial guidance on future emission reduction strategies.

Four innovative cropping systems were assessed in a “cropping system experiment” in the Ile-de-France region (France) from 2009 to 2014. Three were designed to meet ambitious goals: the total elimination of pesticides (No-Pest), reducing fossil energy consumption by 50% (L-EN), or decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% (L-GHG). They were also required to satisfy a wide range of environmental criteria and to maximize yields whilst respecting the major constraint on the system and the environmental targets set. A fourth system (PHEP), in which the environmental and yield targets were achieved with no major constraint, was also assessed. After completion of the first full crop sequence for these innovative systems, the results obtained indicated that it was possible to design and implement innovative systems achieving multiple goals. In our field trial conditions, the pesticide and energy constraints were almost satisfied, whereas the GHG target was missed by a considerable margin. All four innovative systems satisfied environmental criteria in terms of N management, pesticide use, energy consumption and crop diversity. However, herbicide treatment frequency index (TFIH) was higher than expected in the two systems with no-plow practices, L-EN and L-GHG. In the pesticide-free system, soil organic matter content was lower than expected, due to frequent plowing (every 2 years) and low residue levels as a result of the lower yields obtained. Yields were lower for the L-EN system than for the reference system, and yield was variable in the L-GHG system. These innovative systems had better environmental performances than the systems currently used in the Ile-de-France region, with no decrease in gross margins. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cropping system experiment; Energy; Field assessment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Pesticide","crop improvement; crop plant; crop yield; cropping practice; energy budget; energy use; experimental design; field method; greenhouse gas; herbicide; index method; pesticide; pesticide application; plowing; soil organic matter; yield response; France; Ile de France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020435690

However, the rate of deployment does not match what is required for global temperatures to stay well below 2 °C. Although some consider the hurdles to achieving the widespread application of CCS to be almost insurmountable, a more optimistic view is that a great deal is now known about CCS through research, demonstration, and deployment. We know how to do it; we are confident it can be done safely and effectively; we know what it costs; and we know that costs are decreasing and will continue to do so. We also know that the world will need CCS as long as countries, companies, and communities continue to use fossil fuels for energy and industrial processes. What is lacking are the necessary policy drivers, along with a technology-neutral approach to decrease carbon emissions in a cost-effective and timely manner while retaining the undoubted benefits of ready access to reliable and secure electricity and energy-intensive industrial products. In this paper, Australia is used as an example of what has been undertaken in CCS over the past 20 years, particularly in research and demonstration, but also in international collaboration. Progress in the large-scale deployment of CCS in Australia has been too slow. However, the world's largest storage project will soon be operational in Australia as part of the Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, and investigations are underway into several large-scale CCS Flagship program opportunities. The organization and progress of the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) Otway Project, which is currently Australia's only operational storage project, is discussed in some detail because of its relevance to the commercial deployment of CCS. The point is made that there is scope for building on this Otway activity to investigate more broadly (through the proposed Otway Stage 3 and Deep Earth Energy and Environment Programme (AusDEEP)) the role of the subsurface in carbon reduction. There are challenges ahead if CCS is to be deployed as widely as bodies such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) consider to be necessary. Closer international collaboration in CCS will be essential to meeting that challenge. © 2017 THE AUTHORS","Australia; Carbon capture and storage; Carbon dioxide; Otway","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; International cooperation; Liquefied natural gas; Technology transfer; Australia; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Cooperative research centres; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; International collaborations; International energy agency; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Otway; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036640012

In this paper, after explaining my theoretical and conceptual framework rooted in Africanist geography and currents of political ecology, I analyze the responses of local actors (knowledge, practices, logic, and strategies) to environmental policies and consider the effects of new mechanisms, upon local dynamics in Africa. I focus my attention on the impacts of mangrove reforestation policies on women, who harvest shellfish. My research, conducted over 35 years on coastal mangroves in Africa and Madagascar, provides me with examples. Through a long-term approach to the perception of mangroves and the changing modes of policies, I highlight the weight of imperialism and neo-liberalism and analyze types of environmental injustice against mangrove harvesters, particularly the women, who are the most directly concerned by the preservation of their heritage and are rarely recognized as stakeholders in environmental policies that are defined internationally and implemented at national and local levels. They are not informed (or are deliberately kept unware) of new devices such as REDD+. They have lost their rights of access to the reforested mangrove areas. Carbon policy requires comparative and empirical research, giving voice to local actors, especially women, about their perceptions of policies and actions. The approaches in terms of political ecology must be combined with analysis of the bio-ecological and socio-cultural dynamics of the mangrove. © 2017 by the author.","Environmental justice; Grabbing; Mangrove; Shellfish; Women","environmental justice; harvesting; imperialism; mangrove; neoliberalism; perception; pollution policy; reforestation; shellfish; stakeholder; womens status; Africa; Madagascar; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027690436

A typical framing is that researchers are exploring a ‘Plan B’ in case mitigation fails to avert dangerous climate change. Some options are thought to have the potential to alter the politics of climate change dramatically, yet in evaluating whether they might ultimately reduce climate risks, their political and security implications have so far not been given adequate prominence. This article puts forward what it calls the ‘security hazard’ and argues that this could be a crucial factor in determining whether a technology is able, ultimately, to reduce climate risks. Ideas about global governance of geoengineering rely on heroic assumptions about state rationality and a generally pacific international system. Moreover, if in a climate engineered world weather events become something certain states can be made directly responsible for, this may also negatively affect prospects for ‘Plan A’, i.e. an effective global agreement on mitigation. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Climate change; geoengineering; securitization; security; sociotechnical imaginary",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025139391

To date, noble metals have achieved the best performance in energy yield and faradaic efficiency and have recently reached impressive electrical-to-chemical power conversion efficiencies.However, the scarcity of preciousmetalsmakes the search for scalable, metal-free, CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalysts all themore important.We report an all-organic, that is, metal-free, electrocatalyst that achieves impressive performance comparable to that of best-in-class Ag electrocatalysts.We hypothesized that polydopamine-a conjugated polymer whose structure incorporates hydrogen-bonded motifs found in enzymes-could offer the combination of efficient electrical conduction, together with rendered active catalytic sites, and potentially thereby enable CO2RR. Only by developing a vapor-phase polymerization of polydopamine were we able to combine the needed excellent conductivity with thin film-based processing. We achieve catalytic performance with geometric current densities of 18 mA cm-2 at 0.21 V overpotential (-0.86 V versus normal hydrogen electrode) for the electrosynthesis of C1 species (carbon monoxide and formate) with continuous 16-hour operation at &gt;80%faradaic efficiency. Our catalyst exhibits lower overpotentials than state-of-the-art formate-selective metal electrocatalysts (for example, 0.5 V for Ag at 18mAcm-1). The results confirmthe value of exploiting hydrogen-bonded sequences as effective catalytic centers for renewable and cost-efficient industrial CO2RR applications.

Brazil's urbanization rate increased from 26% in 1940 to almost 70% in 1980. During this period, the Brazilian population tripled and the urban population multiplied by seven. In 2010, the transport sector in São Paulo accounted for 71% of the total emissions released by the energy sector. Ethanol has been considered a fuel with less greenhouse gas emissions, when compared with fossil fuels. However, ethanol production would have to double to meet the expected demand. Electric vehicles (EVs) market is expanding around the world, and is also an option to reduce the transport emissions, if powered by clean electricity. To assess whether the adoption of EVs might bring more benefits than the current ethanol, we develop prospective scenarios supported by the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) simulation tool, taking a bottom-up tank-to-wheel approach to consider the CO2 emissions of car in São Paulo. The scenario considering a substitution of 25% of gasoline-powered cars by EV in 2030 showed a reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, around 15% and 26% respectively in that year in comparison with 2015. We discuss the interplay between ethanol and EV, also considering emission coefficients from life cycle analysis conducted in Brazil, and concluded EV will have higher positive impact on climate change mitigation than ethanol. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","CO2 emissions; electric vehicles; ethanol; hybrid plug-in; São Paulo","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Crashworthiness; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Climate change mitigation; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Emission coefficient; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Life cycle analysis; Plug-ins; Reduction in energy consumption; Transport emissions; Climate change; alternative energy; carbon emission; electric vehicle; energy planning; energy use; ethanol; fuel consumption; transportation mode; travel behavior; urban transport; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Sao Paulo [Sao Paulo (STT)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016957505

This study audited the landfill-destined waste generated at the University of Missouri (MU) football stadium in 2014 and evaluated the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) and energy use associated with waste management options, including options that do and do not comply with zero-waste definitions. An estimated 47.3 metric tons (mt) of waste was generated, the majority (29.6 mt waste) came from off-site, pre-game food preparation activities; of which over 96 percent (%) was pre-consumer and un-sold food waste. The remaining 17.7 mt originated from inside the stadium; recyclable materials accounting for 43%, followed by food waste, 24%. Eleven waste management strategies were evaluated using theWaste Reduction Model (WARM). Results indicate that scenarios achieving zero waste compliance are not necessarily the most effective means of reducing GHG emissions or energy use. The two most effective approaches are eliminating edible food waste and recycling. Source reduction of edible food reduced GHGs by 103.1 mt (carbon dioxide equivalents) CO2e and generated energy savings of 448.5 GJ compared to the baseline. Perfect recycling would result in a reduction of 25.4 mt CO2e and 243.7 GJ compared to the baseline. The primary challenges to achieving these reductions are the difficulties of predicting demand for food and influencing consumer behavior. © 2017 by the authors.","Athletics; Compost; Food waste; Green events; Sustainability; Waste management; Zero waste","energy use; food waste; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; recycling; sustainability; waste management; Missouri; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024099927

Municipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the major challenges facing the world today. In Portugal the growing volume of MSW has become a central problem for municipalities, due to lack of space and the high costs to solve it. Gasification is starting to be considered as a possible alternative when dealing with municipal wastes. However, first is necessary to overcome some concerns related to the process, such as tar mitigation and carbon dioxide emissions. The presented study focuses on a second law analysis conducted on Portuguese MSW gasification using carbon dioxide and air mixtures. To do so, a previously developed numerical model, validated using data from a semi-industrial plant, was used to assess carbon dioxide injection. First, influence of operational conditions on syngas exergy values was studied. Exergy values increased close to 6% when equivalent rate was increased from 0.15 to 0.25, steadily dropping with further increase. On the other hand, exergy values appear to steadily increase with carbon dioxide addition (14% when increased from 0 to 1) and reactor temperature (40% when increased from 700 to 900 °C). Then, the influence of temperature and CO2/MSW ratio on exergy efficiency, tar efficiency and carbon dioxide conversion was investigated. Results showed that both parameters have a positive effect on exergy efficiency. Conversely, CO2/MSW ratio and gasification temperature lead to decreases in both tar exergy efficiency and in carbon dioxide. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The assumption that C–R functions relating levels of exposure and levels of response estimated from historical data usefully predict how future changes in concentrations would change risks has seldom been carefully tested. This paper critically reviews literature on C–R functions for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and mortality risks. We find that most of them describe historical associations rather than valid causal models for predicting effects of interventions that change concentrations. The few papers that explicitly attempt to model causality rely on unverified modeling assumptions, casting doubt on their predictions about effects of interventions. A large literature on modern causal inference algorithms for observational data has been little used in C–R modeling. Applying these methods to publicly available data from Boston and the South Coast Air Quality Management District around Los Angeles shows that C–R functions estimated for one do not hold for the other. Changes in month-specific PM2.5 concentrations from one year to the next do not help to predict corresponding changes in average elderly mortality rates in either location. Thus, the assumption that estimated C–R relations predict effects of pollution-reducing interventions may not be true. Better causal modeling methods are needed to better predict how reducing air pollution would affect public health. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bayesian networks; Causality; concentration–response functions; C–R; manipulative causality; PM2.5; predictive causality; randomForest","aged; air pollution; air quality; California; causal modeling; female; human; human experiment; male; Massachusetts; mortality rate; particulate matter; prediction; public health; seashore; air pollutant; analysis; dose response; environmental exposure; particulate matter; statistics and numerical data; air pollutant; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Particulate Matter",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026645023

This raises a central question: What set of conditions would be effective in moving nations, regions, and the global economy onto the energy transformation and emissions reduction pathways necessary for significant emissions reduction in the aggregate? The current article explores this question through the use of an agent-based model. It seeks, through this modeling, to examine if global carbon mitigation is achievable with no global unitary framework but through bilateral negotiation and to explore what mitigation level can be reached in three different mitigation schemes. Three mitigation scenarios (low/medium/high ambition, see Table 5) are compared and contrasted, and key highlights/conclusions point to that reduction of absolute emissions even after the carbon intensity target is reached must be introduced. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The apparently obvious reason is that climate change threatens life, health and community for the next generation, and parents have a special duty to their children to protect their basic human interests. This argument fails because many parents could protect their children from these central harms without taking more general action to combat climate change, let alone to mitigate it. Instead, subtler reasons are advanced, drawing on children’s relational interests or on their interests as moral agents. It is argued that parents owe it to their children to combat climate change because of the indirect impact on current children of serious threats to their children and grandchildren, and of being required to live in a radically unjust world. It is further argued that parents may owe it directly to their more distant descendants to mitigate climate change because of the role current parents played in bringing them into the world. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","climate change; collective action; parental duties; shared duties; special duties",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027580029

More research effort is needed to reduce uncertainties about the effects of global-scale warming and acidification for benthic microbial communities, which drive sedimentary biogeochemical cycles. In this research, mesocosm experiments were set up using muddy and sandy coastal sediments to investigate the independent and interactive effects of elevated carbon dioxide concentrations (750 ppm CO2 ) and elevated temperature (ambient +4◦ C) on the abundance of taxonomic and functional microbial genes. Specific quantitative PCR primers were used to target archaeal, bacterial, and cyanobacterial/chloroplast 16S rRNA in both sediment types. Nitrogen cycling genes archaeal and bacterial ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) and bacterial nitrite reductase (nirS) were specifically targeted to identify changes in microbial gene abundance and potential impacts on nitrogen cycling. In muddy sediment, microbial gene abundance, including amoA and nirS genes, increased under elevated temperature and reduced under elevated CO2 after 28 days, accompanied by shifts in community composition. In contrast, the combined stressor treatment showed a non-additive effect with lower microbial gene abundance throughout the experiment. The response of microbial communities in the sandy sediment was less pronounced, with the most noticeable response seen in the archaeal gene abundances in response to environmental stressors over time. 16S rRNA genes (amoA and nirS) were lower in abundance in the combined stressor treatments in sandy sediments. Our results indicated that marine benthic microorganisms, especially in muddy sediments, are susceptible to changes in ocean carbonate chemistry and seawater temperature, which ultimately may have an impact upon key benthic biogeochemical cycles. © 2017 Currie, Tait, Parry, de Francisco-Mora, Hicks, Osborn, Widdicombe and Stahl.","Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria; Denitrifying bacteria; Microbial community; Muddy sediment; Ocean acidification; Ocean warming; Sandy sediment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028037610

Due to physiological and morphological characteristics and to the intrinsic tolerance to several stress factors, some species seem particularly promising as an indicator for the state of the urban environment or to decrease the amount of specific pollutants. It must be pointed out that intrinsic species properties (e.g., tolerance and/or bioindication capacity for a specific contaminant) can help planners create an effective monitoring net in strategic areas of a city or to detect single contaminants representative of a specific human impact. In particular, Betula pendula and Robinia pseudoacacia can be considered ideal, low-cost candidates for phytoremediation. Due to their high hardiness, pollution tolerance, and their characteristic as pioneer species, both species might additionally be taken into account as biomonitors, or for their foliar trapping capacity. Tilia cordata is also suitable for phytoremediation in urban environments due to its foliar trapping capacity that can provide valuable information on airborne pollutants. © 2017 International Society of Arboriculture.","Betula pendula; Bioindicators; Monitoring; Phytoremediation; Robinia pseudoacacia; Traffic Emission; Urban planning; Volatile organic compounds","bioindicator; biomonitoring; deciduous tree; heavy metal; phytoremediation; traffic emission; urban area; urban planning; volatile organic compound; Central Europe; Betula pendula; Robinia pseudoacacia; Tilia cordata; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037641974

Methods. A total of 410 women with normal breast or benign or highly suspicious malignant tumors were randomized at 1 : 1 ratio to undergo 3D-PEM followed by WBPET or WBPET followed by 3D-PEM. Lumpectomy or mastectomy was performed on eligible participants after the scanning. Results. The sensitivity and specificity of 3D-PEM were 92.8% and 54.5%, respectively. WBPET showed a sensitivity of 95.7% and specificity of 56.8%. After exclusion of the patients with lesions beyond the detecting range of the 3D-PEM instrument, 3D-PEM showed higher sensitivity than WBPET(97.0% versus 95.5%, P = 0.913), particularly for small lesions (<1 cm) (72.0% versus 60.0%, P = 0.685). Conclusions. The 3D-PEM appears more sensitive to small lesions than WBPET but may fail to detect lesions that are beyond the detecting range.

By analysing 131,394 occurrence records of 1,334 plant species collected over 20 years in the European Alps, we found that non-natives are spreading upwards approximately twice as fast as natives. Whereas the spread of natives was enhanced by traits favouring longer dispersal distances, this was not the case for non-natives. This was due to the non-native species pool already being strongly biased towards species that had traits facilitating spread. A large proportion of native and non-native species seemed to be able to spread upwards faster than the current velocity of climate change. In particular, long-distance dispersal events and proximity to roads proved to be key drivers for the observed rapid spread. Our findings highlight that invasions by non-native species into native alpine communities are a potentially significant additional pressure on these vulnerable ecosystems that are already likely to suffer dramatic vegetation changes with ongoing warming and increasing human activity in mountain regions. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"alpine environment; anthropogenic effect; biological invasion; climate change; disturbance; human activity; mountain region; native species; nature-society relations; plant community; species pool; vulnerability; Alps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026662627

The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America is one of the largest wetland complexes in the world, containing millions of small, shallow wetlands. The sediment pore waters of PPR wetlands contain some of the highest concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and sulfur species ever recorded in terrestrial aquatic environments. Using a suite of geochemical and microbiological analyses, we measured the impact of sedimentary carbon and sulfur transformations in these wetlands on methane fluxes to the atmosphere. This research represents the first study of coupled geochemistry and microbiology within the PPR and demonstrates how the conversion of abundant labile DOC pools into methane results in some of the highest fluxes of this greenhouse gas to the atmosphere ever reported. Abundant DOC and sulfate additionally supported some of the highest sulfate reduction rates ever measured in terrestrial aquatic environments, which we infer to account for a large fraction of carbon mineralization in this system. Methane accumulations in zones of active sulfate reduction may be due to either the transport of free methane gas from deeper locations or the co-occurrence of methanogenesis and sulfate reduction. If both respiratory processes are concurrent, any competitive inhibition of methanogenesis by sulfate-reducing bacteria may be lessened by the presence of large labile DOC pools that yield noncompetitive substrates such as methanol. Our results reveal some of the underlying mechanisms that make PPR wetlands biogeochemical hotspots, which ultimately leads to their critical, but poorly recognized role in regional greenhouse gas emissions. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","16S rRNA gene sequencing; carbon and sulfur cycling; methane emissions; sediments; sulfate reduction rates; wetlands","carbon; carbon cycle; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; methane; methanogenesis; prairie; reaction kinetics; reduction; substrate; sulfate; sulfate-reducing bacterium; sulfur cycle; Prairie Pothole Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013665968

Rates seem to increase in hypofractionated or accelerated hyperfractionated regimens. In this study, we investigate the CB rate and the cumulative doses received by the carotid artery (CA) in a cohort of patients who were reirradiated at CNAO with particle therapy in the H&N region. Methods and materials The dosimetric information, medical records, and tumor characteristics of 96 patients were analyzed. For 49 of these patients, the quality of dosimetric information was sufficient to calculate the cumulative doses to the CA. The corresponding biological equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) was calculated with an α/β-ratio of 3. Results In the final reirradiation at CNAO, 17 patients (18%) had been treated with protons and 79 (82%) with carbon ions. Two patients experienced profuse oronasal bleeding, of which one case was confirmed to be caused by CB. If attributing both cases to CB, we found an actuarial CB rate of 2.7%. Interestingly, there were no CB cases in the carbon ion group even though this was the large majority of patients and they generally were treated more aggressively in terms of larger fraction doses and higher cumulative EQD2. Conclusions The current practice of particle reirradiation at CNAO for recurrent neoplasms in the H&N region results in acceptable rates of CB. © 2017 The Authors on behalf of the American Society for Radiation Oncology",,"carbon; adult; aged; Article; cancer radiotherapy; carbon ion radiation therapy; carotid artery disease; carotid blowout; cohort analysis; controlled study; dosimetry; female; follow up; head and neck cancer; human; major clinical study; male; medical information; medical record; national health organization; neoplasm; oronasal bleeding; particle radiation; proton radiation; radiation dose; radiation dose fractionation; radiation injury; re-irradiation; risk factor; treatment duration; very elderly",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021781968

In this study we report a new squaramide-based chloride sensor, derived from ethyl ortho aminobenzoate, whose emission intensity increases by nearly 40% upon chloride binding. The intramolecularly hydrogen bonded squaramide exhibited a blue-shifted excitation spectrum relative to its absorption spectrum, and its emission displayed excitation wavelength dependence. These unusual characteristics were attributed to the existence of two ground state conformers for the unbound squaramide; an intramolecular hydrogen bonded conformer which undergoes non-radiative decay and a non-hydrogen bonded non-planar conformer from which emission occurs. Using computational investigations we identified two nearly degenerate excited states arising from two different charge transfer pathways with the squaramide nitrogen atom as the donor and either the cyclobutene dione ring or the ortho substituted N-phenyl ring functioning as acceptors. In the unbound squaramide, this competition between the two charge transfer pathways decreases fluorescence intensity. Chloride binding, suppresses charge transfer into the cyclobutene dione ring thereby enhancing emission intensity. Our study contributes to an increased understanding of the excited states of squaramides and could facilitate their use in the development of new sensors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anthranilate esters; Fluorescent sensors; Hydrogen bonding; Squaramide; Supramolecular chemistry",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019080713

Without microbial energy harvesting from sources of light and inorganic chemical bonds for autotrophic fixation of inorganic carbon, there would not be sustainable ecosystems in the vast ocean. Although ecological energetics (eco-energetics) has been emphasized as a core aspect of ecosystem analyses and microorganisms largely control the flow of matter and energy in marine ecosystems, marine microbial communities are rarely studied from the eco-energetic perspective. The diverse bioenergetic pathways and eco-energetic strategies of the microorganisms are essentially the outcome of biosphere-geosphere interactions over evolutionary times. The biogeochemical cycles are intimately interconnected with energy fluxes across the biosphere and the capacity of the ocean to fix inorganic carbon is generally constrained by the availability of nutrients and energy. The understanding of how microbial eco-energetic processes influence the structure and function of marine ecosystems and how they interact with the changing environment is thus fundamental to a mechanistic and predictive understanding of the marine carbon and nitrogen cycles and the trends in global change. By using major groups of chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms that participate in the marine nitrogen cycle as examples, this article examines their eco-energetic strategies, contributions to carbon cycling, and putative responses to and impacts on the various global change processes associated with global warming, ocean acidification, eutrophication, deoxygenation, and pollution.

However, intensive management of these planted forests is very limited. Despite the fact that the Kyoto Convention in 1997 recognized the role of plantations for forest-carbon sequestration, there is still limited knowledge on the effects of management practices and stand density on carbon-sequestration of popular plantation species (i.e. Pinus patula) in Nepal. We carried out case studies in four community forests planted between 1976 and 1990 to assess the impacts of management on forest carbon stocks. The study found that the average carbon stock in the pine plantations was 217 Mg C ha−1, and was lower in forests with intensively managed plantations (214.3 Mg C ha−1) than in traditionally managed plantations (219 Mg C ha−1). However, it was the reverse in case of soil carbon, which was higher (78.65 Mg C ha−1) in the forests with intensive management. Though stand density was positively correlated with carbon stock, the proportionate increment in carbon stock was lower with increasing stand density, as carbon stock increased by less than 25% with a doubling of stand density (300–600). The total carbon stock was higher in plantations aged between 25 and 30 years compared to those aged between 30 and 35 years. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon stock; Formal and informal management system; Rotation age; Stocking","carbon; carbon sequestration; coniferous tree; forest management; information management; Kyoto Protocol; management practice; plantation forestry; soil carbon; Article; carbon sequestration; forest; forest management; harvesting; leaf litter; Nepal; plantation; soil; total organic carbon; China; ecosystem; Nepal; Pinus patula; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; China; Ecosystem; Forests; Nepal; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016029321

The study uses institutional ethnography research methods with informants drawn from government organisations, local academic institutions, and development partners, together with content analysis of key policy documents. It was found that the Cambodian national planning process restricts the involvement of other actors such as researchers, civil society, and private sector; yet flexible, in that it provides opportunities for the inclusion of climate change and other related concerns. The study identified specific entry points in key policy documents, such as the National Strategic Development Plans, and ministries’ plans. Other entry points were identified in the development planning process, for example, in the process of development departments and ministries’ plans, and actors such as department planners, and departments of planning of line ministries.

Seven different ROI pooling schemes are examined which differ in their similarly distance measure containing a range of different site descriptors (also known as pooling variables). The site descriptors also include average annual monsoon rainfall (AAMR) which is introduced to assess its suitability in this climatic condition. The ROI schemes are evaluated against traditional regional as well as at-site frequency analysis. The performance of the selected scheme in terms of homogeneity and frequency behaviour is also assessed. In order to determine the performance, the study uses annual maximum rainfall data of 1-day duration at 34 stations in Bangladesh, which has a tropical monsoon climate. It is found that the ROI method of any variants is superior to the traditional geographical approach of regional analysis as well as to the at-site analysis. The AAMR based pooling scheme has provided the best result among the considered ROI schemes. The pooling groups delineated based on AAMR has also passed the homogeneity test and conveyed a desirable frequency behaviour. All results indicate that the AAMR as a pooling variable, i.e. information about monsoon rainfall, should be accommodated to the estimation of extreme rainfall in a monsoon-dominated region. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society","Bangladesh; extreme precipitation analysis; frequency analysis of rainfall; GEV distribution; monsoon climate; pooling analysis; region-of-influence method; regional frequency analysis","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Precipitation (meteorology); Regional planning; Bangladesh; Extreme precipitation; Frequency Analysis; GEV distributions; Monsoon climate; Pooling analysis; Region of influences; Regional frequency analysis; Rain; climate conditions; extreme event; frequency analysis; monsoon; precipitation intensity; regional climate; site investigation; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014604589

Through the first meta-analysis of its type, we here tested the utility of a high-resolution potential natural vegetation (PNV) map for eastern Africa (vegetationmap4africa) for supporting restoration activities by comparison with 20 molecular marker genetic datasets, identified through literature review and other sources, for ten indigenous tree species. Our analysis indicated that site suitability and stability values from PNV-based ecological niche modelling involving current and past climate scenarios were positively related to population genetic diversity values revealed by molecular markers, supporting the value of PNV maps for the practical planning of restoration activities accounting for anthropogenic climate change. Furthermore, population pairwise genetic divergence was strongly positively correlated with population pairwise geographic distances for most datasets, indicating generalizable sampling implications for tree genetic resource conservation in the region. Population pairwise genetic divergence was however not well explained by sampling across PNV and wider physiognomic types, possibly due to molecular markers’ adaptive neutrality and high rates of recombination in trees, among other factors. Patterns of neutral molecular marker variation are thus no substitute for trials of adaptive variation for confirming or refuting the utility of vegetation boundaries in defining tree planting zones. We discuss the importance of results for eastern Africa and more widely. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Adaptive neutrality; Ecological niche modelling; Landscape restoration; Molecular marker genetic variation; Potential natural vegetation; vegetationmap4africa",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027047001

The seasonality of the climate with a dry summer, high temperatures and low rainfall (which implies increased flammability of materials) is one of the main factors in the ignition and progression of fires. This factor conjugated with more favourable biophysical conditions (e.g., high slopes, aspect) leads to easy propagation and the increasingly destructive power of such phenomena. To prevent and reduce the consequences of forest fires, it is necessary to simulate and forecast the territory use and management, not only focused on forest areas, but also on all land uses and agricultural activities that may coexist there, considering the probability of fire occurrence. The objective of this paper is to present a methodological approach to address the integration of fire risk in integrated Mediterranean forest management models. The methodological approach considers simultaneously the climatic conditions through different times of the year (more or less favourable to forest fire damage) and structural conditions addressed to land uses, aspect, slope, roads and demographic density. The methodological approach was implemented in a management area located in the Algarve, in southern Portugal. The results for the Algarve region showed that the proposed approach is very useful for managers, since it allowed the calculation of fire susceptibility, vulnerability and fire damage, according to several climatic scenarios. It also allowed the incorporation of different paths regarding different fire risk conditions and the minimization of risk due to fire damage through different management responses. © 2017 by the authors.

Abstract: The effects of increasing temperature are worth studying even in tree species from subtropical climates. Araucaria angustifolia occurs in the south and southeast of Brazil and in Argentina and its growth and success may be associated with low temperatures. We measured growth, photosynthetic parameters and the nutritional status of this plant growing under artificial warm and cool conditions. We expected growth and photosynthetic performance to increase under cool rather than warm conditions. Under high daily temperature, plants showed increased leaf area per plant, more leaves, containing more nitrogen. However, CO2 assimilation rates at light saturation were similar in plants grown under both conditions, and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency was 25% higher in plants under cool conditions. This may be the first report of temperature effects on the growth of this species. Despite enhancing growth in A. angustifolia, warm conditions do not directly influence photosynthetic activities, but enhance leaf area per plant allowing increased CO2 uptake. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Brazilian pine; Ecophysiological responses; Gas exchange; Temperature","Carbon dioxide; Nitrogen; Temperature; Brazilian pine; Ecophysiological responses; Gas exchange; Increasing temperatures; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Photosynthetic activity; Photosynthetic parameters; Subtropical climates; Plants (botany); Gas; Pinus; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018807258

Besides the direct effect of water limitation, drought also influences plant activity, determining changes in the quality and quantity of root exudates, thus indirectly affecting soil microbial activity. To determine how the seasonal changes of plant activity and soil microbial metabolism and structure affect SR response to drought, we investigated the correlation between leaf gas exchange, soil carbon pools and soil respiration sources and the role of soil carbon pools on microbial populations and soil respiration, in a summer deciduous Mediterranean (SDS) and a winter deciduous temperate (WDS) shrublands, experiencing a dry summer period. In both sites, drought reduced photosynthesis, but affected SR differently: in SDS, SR decreased, although microbial heterotrophic respiration (SRh) remained unchanged; in WDS, SR did not vary but SRh was reduced. While in SDS the microbial community was able to respire more complex substrates, in WDS it was strongly dependent on easily decomposable molecules, thus on plant activity. Therefore, the response of soil CO2 efflux to water limitation is not exclusively influenced by climate as it is modulated by the degree of adaptation of the microbial community to drought. © 2017 by the authors.

The case study demonstrated that current policy instruments were largely unsuccessful, as they focus on post-disaster impacts rather than mitigating the sources of vulnerability which amplify disaster risk. This is a major deterrent in the current integration of schemes due to the failure to incorporate the relevant actors, appropriate strategies, cost-effective financial structures, and suitable institutional arrangements. Without sustained funding, timely information, and community-level support, implementation on the ground will be difficult. Knowing this, there is a need to change the decision-making structure of the proposed integrated system to include three main aspects: (1) addressing underlying factors of vulnerability as a common, integrated policy objective, (2) recognizing a more meaningful inclusion of informal responses, and (3) taking into account future uncertain climate conditions and pending impacts. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; climate change; developing countries; disaster risk management; Philippines","adaptive management; catastrophic event; climate change; climate conditions; developing world; disaster management; disaster relief; mitigation; risk assessment; sustainability; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965043980

This study extends a renewable capacity expansion model that was initially developed to find optimal extensions of wind and solar generation and transmission for Texas, United States. Here, additional options for the development of the Bavarian electricity supply are added: combined-heat-and-power (CHP), improving transmission connections to the non-Bavarian German generator fleet, and constructing new natural gas combined cycle (CCGT) power plants within Bavaria. The model's solution suggests that an optimal mix includes 3.5 GW of transmission to the non-Bavarian generator fleet, 6.0 to 9.5 GW of new CCGT capacity, and 8.5 to 10.0 GW of transmission capacity to the on-shore wind resources of the Schleswig-Holstein state in northern Germany, depending on the CO2 price. Compared to the model results for Texas, Bavaria's system is less sensitive to a CO2 price in both the optimal system configuration and the resulting emissions.

Among the mechanisms that may drive this mutualism, the most studied is provisioning of nutrients by AMF in exchange for carbon from plant hosts. However, AMF may also provide a suite of non-nutritional benefits to plants including improved water uptake, disease resistance, plant chemical defense, soil aggregation, and allelochemical transport and protection. Here, we use a meta-analysis of 93 studies to assess the relative effect of AMF on nutritional and non-nutritional factors that may influence plant fitness. We find that the positive effects of AMF on soil aggregation, water flow and disease resistance are equal to the effect of AMF on plant nitrogen and phosphorus uptake. However, AMF had no effect on the uptake of other nutrients, plant water content, allelopathic transport or production of chemical defense compounds. We suggest future research directions, including experimentally assessing the relative contribution on plant fitness of AMF interactions by untangling the independence of alternative benefits of AMF from an increase in nutrient uptake. This will lead to a more holistic view of the mycorrhizal-plant association and a more accurate picture of the net impact on the plant or plant community in question. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America","allelochemical protection; allelochemical transport; arbuscular mycorrhizas; disease resistance; meta-analysis; mutualism-parasitism continuum; nutrient uptake; plant chemical defense; plant defense; soil aggregation; water uptake","allelochemical; arbuscular mycorrhiza; disease resistance; fitness; fungus; meta-analysis; mutualism; nutrient uptake; parasitism; plant community; plant defense; soil aggregate; water flow; water uptake; Fungi; nitrogen; phosphorus; meta analysis; metabolism; microbiology; mycorrhiza; physiology; plant; plant root; soil; symbiosis; Mycorrhizae; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plant Roots; Plants; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021448954

In 2008, only 3.8% of Brazilian municipalities had access to composting plants and about 11.6% of municipalities destined the municipal solid waste to recycling plants. This is only 1.4% of waste generated. Recycling and composting are key programs for municipalities to reduce environmental impact. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the environmental impact of inserting a recycling, composting and integrated program in a region of Sao Paulo State, Brazil through the Waste Reduction Model method simulation of greenhouse gases emission (carbon dioxide equivalent and carbon equivalent) and energy use. The results show that recycling and composting can minimize the emission of greenhouse gases, reducing carbon dioxide and carbon equivalents, and promote energy savings. The best result is the integration of these techniques, which can reduce 78.8% of carbon dioxide and carbon equivalents and save 490.9% in energy versus baseline scenario.

It draws on institutional theories to develop and test a number of hypotheses on the role of shared beliefs and politico-economic institutions in determining the discursive choices of policy actors. The results show that win–win ecological modernization discourse, embraced by powerful government agencies and international actors, dominates national REDD+ policy arenas. This discourse is challenged primarily by a minority reformist civic environmentalist discourse put forward primarily by domestic NGOs. We find evidence that countries with a less democratic political system and large-scale primary sector investments facilitate the adoption of reconciliatory ecological modernization discourse, which may not directly challenge the drivers of deforestation. Policy actors who believe in and are engaged in market-based approaches to REDD+ are much more likely to adopt ecological modernization discourses, compared to policy actors who work on community development and livelihoods issues. © 2017","Climate change discourse; Environmental governance; Forest; Institutions; Mitigation; Policy beliefs","climate change; deforestation; emission control; forest; governance approach; hypothesis testing; institutional development; mitigation; nongovernmental organization; policy making; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020813757

All these actions affect greenhouse climate and thereby plant processes. Measuring crop photosynthesis, a process that responds very rapidly to changes in climate, would be suited to monitor whether the climate is set according to the needs of the plant. Two monitoring systems have been developed, the crop photosynthesis monitor and the CropObserver. The crop photosynthesis monitor is a soft sensor that calculates the CO2 uptake of the entire greenhouse, based on the mass balance of a greenhouse for CO2. At known CO2 supply rates, measuring the CO2 concentrations inside and outside the greenhouse, and determining the ventilation loss allows the calculation of the crop photosynthesis. The CropObserver is a fluorescence sensor that provides laser light pulses from above in a surface of 3×3 m. Since the measurements are fast, the sensor provides a good image of the electron transport rate (ETR) of a large crop area in a short period of time. Evaluation of the sensors in a tomato cultivation showed that the data of the crop photosynthesis monitor matched the daily pattern of manual photosynthesis data up-scaled to crop photosynthesis by a crop growth model reasonably well. The CropObserver data were very comparable to local reference fluorescence measurements, and closely followed irradiance patterns over the day. Both systems have attracted the attention of Dutch growers, and will be further evaluated in commercial greenhouses. © 2017 ISHS.","Assimilation light; Chlorophyll fluorescence; CO2 uptake; Crop monitoring; Energy consumption; Tomato",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029577863

Recently, the ability of this technique to directly control the urea dosing on a current NH3 storing zeolite catalyst has been demonstrated on an engine dynamometer for the first time and this paper continues that work. Therefore, a well-known serial-type and zeolite-based SCR catalyst (Cu-SSZ-13) was investigated under deliberately chosen high space velocities. At first, the full functionality of the RF system with Cu-SSZ-13 as sample was tested successfully. By direct RF-based NH3 storage control, the influence of the storage degree on the catalyst performance, i.e., on NOx conversion and NH3 slip, was investigated in a temperature range between 250 and 400◦C. For each operation point, an ideal and a critical NH3 storage degree was found and analyzed in the whole temperature range. Based on the data of all experimental runs, temperature dependent calibration functions were developed as a basis for upcoming tests under transient conditions. Additionally, the influence of exhaust humidity was observed with special focus on cold start water and its effects to the RF signals. © 2017 by the authors.

The MDA application presents unique processing and operational challenges for this fuel electrode. The electrode must demonstrate adequate electronic conductivity under high-temperature reducing conditions in hydrocarbon-containing environments. The electrode must also catalyze rapid transfer of hydrogen from the gas phase into the protonic-ceramic membrane, while simultaneously showing limiting catalytic activity with the hydrocarbon gases. In this study, the suitability of the BFMO material for the membrane-assisted MDA application was explored against qualitative and quantitative metrics. The performance of BFMO materials synthesized by solid-state reaction was compared with that by the modified-Pechini method. The particle size of BFMO synthesized by solid-state reaction was found to be substantially larger than powders synthesized using the modified-Pechini method. BFMO showed excellent chemical stability under exposure to 5% H2, and reasonable stability in 10% CH4 at 750 °C, with no carbon formation observed under exposure to methane. Electrode microstructure and adhesion to the BCZY27 membrane were improved through use of a composite BFMO-BCZYYb (BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3 − δ) electrode with addition of a CuO sintering aid.

Two of the satellitederived inventories are estimated by using the DECSO (Daily Emission derived Constrained by Satellite Observations) algorithm, which is based on an extended Kalman filter applied to observations from OMI or from GOME-2. The other two are derived with the EnKF algorithm, which is based on an ensemble Kalman filter applied to observations of multiple species using either the chemical transport model CHASER and MIROC-chem. The temporal behaviour and spatial distribution of the inventories are compared on a national and regional scale. A distinction is also made between urban and rural areas. The intercomparison of all inventories shows good agreement in total NOx emissions over mainland China, especially for trends, with an average bias of about 20% for yearly emissions. All the inventories show the typical emission reduction of 10% during the Chinese New Year and a peak in December. Satellite-derived approaches using OMI show a summer peak due to strong emissions from soil and biomass burning in this season. Biases in NOx emissions and uncertainties in temporal variability increase quickly when the spatial scale decreases. The analyses of the differences show the importance of using observations from multiple instruments and a high spatial resolution model for the satellite-derived inventories, while for bottom-up inventories, accurate emission factors and activity information are required. The advantage of the satellite-derived approach is that the emissions are soon available after observation, while the strength of the bottom-up inventories is that they include detailed information of emissions for each source category. © 2017 Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028589514

However, most of the existing researches on NOx pollution are from the natural science and technology perspective, few studies have been conducted from an economic point, and regional differences have not been given adequate attention. This paper adopts provincial panel data from 2006 to 2013 and the LMDI model to analyze the key driving factors and regional dilemmas of NOx emissions. The results show that significant regional disparities still exit on NOx emissions and its reduction effect 27 provinces didn't accomplish their corresponding reduction targets. Economic development factor is the dominating driving factor of NOx emissions during the study period, while energy efficiency and technology improvement factors offset total NOx emissions in the majority of provinces. In addition, the industrial structure factor plays a more significant role in reducing the NOx emissions after 2011. Therefore, the government should consider all these factors as well as regional heterogeneity in developing appropriate pollution mitigating policies. It's necessary to change NOx emissions control attitude from original key areas control to divided-zone control, not only attaches great importance to the reduction of the original key areas, but also emphasizes the new potential hotspots with high NOx emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; LMDI; NOx emissions; Pollution reduction; Regional predicament; Spatial-temporal characteristics","atmospheric pollution; energy efficiency; heterogeneity; industrial structure; nitric oxide; panel data; pollution control; pollution monitoring; science and technology; air pollution; China; economic development; government; model; economic development; industry; risk; China; Air Pollution; Economic Development; Industry; Risk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014851035

Characterization on thermal behavior of RTS treated with three organic (acetate, malate and citrate) potassium salts and three inorganic (chloride, sulfate and phosphate) potassium salts was then performed using thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with Fourier transforms infrared spectrometer (TG-FTIR) at the heating rate of 20 °C min−1. TG results illustrated that potassium decreased the peak temperature of carbohydrate pyrolysis, retarded the thermal degradation of the major components of RTS and meanwhile promoted the formation of stable char firmly depending on its chemical state. The organic potassium salts had a more significant effect on the process of char oxidation than inorganic ones with a new peak at around 570 °C. Analyses of evolved gaseous products distribution demonstrated a significant reduction of CO and CO2 during carbohydrates pyrolysis in the presence of potassium, especially organic potassium salts. Moreover, the maximum firecone temperature was also measured by Infrared thermography, and it had been found that the burning cone temperature of ED-modified RTS was averagely 13.27 °C higher than that of organic potassium treated RTS but averagely 16.57 °C lower than that of inorganic ones. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Carbon oxides; Potassium organic and inorganic salts; Reconstituted tobacco sheet; Thermal decomposition","Carbohydrates; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cracking (chemical); Decomposition; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fourier transforms; Pyrolysis; Thermolysis; Tobacco; Burning characteristics; Carbon oxide; Gaseous products; Inorganic salts; Peak temperatures; Reconstituted tobacco sheets; Thermal behaviors; Thermogravimetric analyzers; Salts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014062130

The challenges arise from declining biophysical conditions and the socio-political and economic barriers that delay, delegitimize or co-opt genuine community responses. Opportunities are arising from global climate change activism networks that provide new resources and discourses for activists and community organizers. These challenges and opportunities are unevenly shaped by the possibility for genuine democratic contestation in different contexts. In this article we draw on recent climate justice mobilizations in Aotearoa New Zealand. These mobilizations called for divestment from fossil fuel activities by blocking access to major banks around the country that directly support the industry. While most actions in the campaign were peaceful and effective in closing down business-as-usual for the day at specific bank branches, one in particular provoked police and implicit state-sanctioned violence against the activists, pitting bank customers against climate activists. We use this case study to illustrate the complexity of contemporary climate activism and tactics within communities, and draw on the work of Judith Butler to show how violence and stigma are used to discipline certain bodies who contest more dominant development trajectories and investment. © Oxford University Press and Community Development Journal 2017.

Thermal pyrolysis and circulation produce fluids rich in hydrocarbons and reduced compounds that stimulate microbial activity in surrounding sediments. Several studies have characterized the diversity of Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California) sediment-inhabiting microorganisms; however, many of the identified taxa lack cultures or genomic representations. Here, we resolved the metabolic potential and community-level interactions of these diverse communities by reconstructing and analyzing microbial genomes from metagenomic sequencing data.RESULTS: We reconstructed 115 microbial metagenome-assembled genomes comprising 27 distinct archaeal and bacterial phyla. The archaea included members of the DPANN and TACK superphyla, Bathyarchaeota, novel Methanosarcinales (GoM-Arc1), and anaerobic methane-oxidizing lineages (ANME-1). Among the bacterial phyla, members of the Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Deltaproteobacteria were metabolically versatile and harbored potential pathways for hydrocarbon and lipid degradation and a variety of respiratory processes. Genes encoding enzymes that activate anaerobic hydrocarbons for degradation were detected in Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Latescibacteria, and KSB1 phyla, while the reconstructed genomes for most candidate bacteria phyla (Aminicenantes, Atribacteria, Omnitrophica, and Stahlbacteria) indicated a fermentative metabolism. Newly obtained GoM-Arc1 archaeal genomes encoded novel pathways for short-chain hydrocarbon oxidation by alkyl-coenzyme M formation. We propose metabolic linkages among different functional groups, such as fermentative community members sharing substrate-level interdependencies with sulfur- and nitrogen-cycling microbes.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, inferring the physiologies of archaea and bacteria from metagenome-assembled genomes in hydrothermal deep-sea sediments has revealed potential mechanisms of carbon cycling in deep-sea sediments. Our results further suggest a network of biogeochemical interdependencies in organic matter utilization, hydrocarbon degradation, and respiratory sulfur cycling among deep-sea-inhabiting microbial communities.","Archaea; Bacteria; Comparative genomics; Deep sea; Metagenome; Microbiome; Population genomes","bacterial DNA; hydrocarbon; methane; RNA 16S; archaeon; bacterium; biodiversity; classification; Deltaproteobacteria; genetics; genomics; hydrothermal vent; metabolism; metagenome; metagenomics; microbiology; microflora; oxidation reduction reaction; phylogeny; physiology; Archaea; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Deltaproteobacteria; DNA, Bacterial; Genomics; Hydrocarbons; Hydrothermal Vents; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Methane; Microbiota; Oxidation-Reduction; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043340802

The Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis was analysed for the member states of the European Union, in the presence of electricity generation, landfill and GHG emissions for the period 1995 to 2012. The results revealed that there is no inverted-U-shaped relationship between income and GHG emissions in European Union countries. The renewable fuel extracted from waste contributes to a reduction in GHG, and although the electricity produced also increases emissions somewhat, they would be far greater if the waste-based generation of renewable energy did not take place. The waste sector needs to strengthen its political, economic, institutional and social communication instruments to meet its aims for mitigating the levels of pollutants generated by European economies. To achieve the objectives of the Horizon 2020 programme, currently in force in the countries of the European Union, it will be necessary to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","EKC-W; European Union; GHG emissions; Panel data; Renewable energy; Waste sector","economic growth; electricity generation; energy resource; environmental degradation; environmental economics; environmental issue; European Union; greenhouse gas; Kuznets curve; landfill; panel data; renewable resource; solid waste; waste management; analysis; economic development; European Union; greenhouse gas; procedures; renewable energy; solid waste; standards; waste disposal facility; waste management; Economic Development; European Union; Greenhouse Gases; Renewable Energy; Solid Waste; Waste Disposal Facilities; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020540687

The modification was done by introducing the reduction coefficient in consumption amount and loss load as well as the proportion of bioactive ingredients of fertilizer and pesticide to the export coefficient model developed by Johnes in 1996. The modified export coefficient model was then applied to estimate non-point source pollution load in Gaoxi community, Yunnan Province, China where a water-saving and emission reduction technology was implemented by changing cropping pattern. Study results showed that the improved export coefficient model had a favorable flexibility in calculating the non-point source pollution loads and well applicable to the watersheds where various input data is in short.

Decision-making units which are all data envelopment analysis (DEA)-effective cannot be ranked by using the original DEA model. While previous studies omit environmental factors when gauging resources or environmental efficiency. In this study, we combine a Ruggiero three-stage model with a super-efficiency DEA model (SE-DEA) to solve these two problems. Following this method, we consider environmental factors and thereby compare provincial CEE in China in the new production frontier. The main results obtained are as follows: (1) provincial CEE values differ significantly in the first stage and the third stage; (2) in the third stage, only Eastern China reaches the SE-DEA relatively effective level, where CEE rankings in descending order are: Eastern, Central, and Western China; (3) provinces are divided into four categories in terms of provincial CEE values and per-capita GDPs, and therefore, regional climate and development policies could be oriented due to different categories. This efficiency evaluation methodology and the results obtained in our study not only contribute to understanding this issue, but also could be of specific interest to climate change policy makers in China. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Carbon emission efficiency; Ruggiero; Super-efficiency DEA; Three-stage","carbon emission; climate change; data envelopment analysis; environmental factor; numerical model; policy development; regional climate; regional planning; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015748173

In this manner one can separate the origin of biomass in forestry, agriculture, landscape maintenance, municipal solid waste and industrial waste. Subsequent chemical and physical parameters were described to assess the applicability for thermal utilization as well as for the production of biokerosene. The focus is on calorific values, ash and water content as well as on inhibiting parameters such as sulfur, nitrogen and heavy metals. Based on this, the second part of this paper describes the energy potential of the ubiquitous occurring biomass originating from waste. Therefore the incidence of each waste fraction is related to a specific energy potential respectively calorific value.

These changes may modify the edaphic features of the soil as well as the soil quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the chemical and physical fraction of SOMand to analyze changes in the carbon stock and C management index in areas of implanted vineyards in altitude regions of Santa Catarina. Four regions were selected: Region I (Urubici); Region II (San Joaquim); Region III (Campos Novos) and Region IV (Água Doce). In each region, we selected vineyards implanted between 2001 and 2005 as well as surrounding forested areas. Disturbed and undisturbed samples were collected from the 0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm layers of the soil. Samples were prepared in the laboratory to obtain air-dried soft soil, which was then used for the analysis of several parameters, namely total organic carbon (TOC), carbon stock,and chemical fractionation of the soil. The chemical fractionation was then used to determine carbon content in the fulvic acid fraction (C-FAF), humic acid fraction (C-HAF), and humin fraction (C-HUM). We also analyzed particle size, quantifed the levels of particulate carbon (COp) and carbon associated with clay and silt (COam), and calculated the carbon management index (CMI). We evaluated normality and homogeneity for all data. The results were evaluated with an analysis of variance and subsequent F-test. Mean values were compared using a 5% Student's t-test and subsequently submitted to a Tukey's test. The highest TOC levels were observed in Region II in the 0-5 cm layer in both vineyard and forested areas. Vineyard areas exhibited lower values of TOC, Cop, and COam compared to forested areas indicating that the management adopted in these areas contributed to the reduction of these fractions. Forested areas exhibited a higher proportion of Cop compared to vineyard areas. The humin fraction represented the largest portion of the TOC and comprised the highest values in both forested and vineyard areas. The carbon management index indicated a low contribution of vineyard areas or a reduction in carbon storage in their soils.","Organic matter fractionation; Soil management; Viticulture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027049114

This ever increasing energy consumption leads to negative environmental impact such as global warming. To reduce their carbon footprints, large Internet service operators begin to utilize green energy. Since green energy is currently more expensive than the traditional brown one, it is important for the operators to maximize the green energy usage subject to their desired long-term (e.g., a month) cost budget constraint. In this paper, we propose an online algorithm GreenBudget based on the Lyapunov optimization framework. We prove that our algorithm is able to achieve a delicate tradeoff between the green energy usage and the enforcement of the cost budget constraint, and a control parameter V is the knob to arbitrarily tune such a tradeoff. We evaluate GreenBudget utilizing real-life traces of user requests, cooling efficiency, electricity price and green energy availability. Experimental results demonstrate that under the same cost budget constraint, GreenBudget can increase the green energy usage by 11.55% compared with the state-of-the-art work, without incurring any performance violation of user requests. © 2016, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","cooling efficiency; data center; electricity cost budgeting; green energy; Lyapunov optimization","Carbon; Carbon footprint; Cooling; Costs; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Global warming; Optimization; Web services; Control parameters; Cooling efficiency; Data centers; Electricity costs; Electricity prices; Green energy; On-line algorithms; Optimization framework; Budget control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014072187

Because invasive species may also use these waters, dispersing into previously inaccessible areas, the costs and benefits of artificial waters must be gauged and potential invasion- and climate change-management strategies assayed. Objectives: We present a network analysis framework to identify waters that likely contribute to the spread of invasive species. Methods: Using the Sonoran Desert waters network and the American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus)—a known predator, competitor, and carrier of pathogens deadly to other amphibians—as an example, we quantified the structural connectivity of the network to predict regional invasion potential under current and two future scenarios (climate change and management reduction) to identify waters to manage and monitor for invasive species. Results: We identified important and vulnerable waters based on connectivity metrics under scenarios representing current conditions, projected climate-limited conditions, and conditions based on removal of artificial waters. We identified 122,607 km2 of land that could be used as a buffer against invasion and 67,745 km2 of land that could be augmented by artificial water placement without facilitating invasive species spread. Conclusions: Structural connectivity metrics can be used to evaluate alternative management strategies for invasive species and climate mitigation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Catchments; Dispersal; Fragmentation; Invasion; Network analysis; Spatial ecology","biological invasion; catchment; dispersal; fragmentation; frog; graphical method; invasive species; landscape ecology; mathematical theory; network analysis; spatial analysis; Sonoran Desert; Lithobates; Rana catesbeiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023612893

Marine and coastal ES and the associated benefits to humans are usually assessed, quantified, and mapped at the ecosystem level to inform policy and decision-making. Yet those benefits may reach humans beyond the provisioning ecosystem, at the regional or even global level. Current efforts to map ES generated by a single ecosystem rarely consider the distribution of benefits beyond the ecosystem itself, especially at the regional or global level. In this article, we elaborate on the concept of ""extra-local"" ES to refer to those ES generating benefits that are enjoyed far from the providing ecosystem, focusing on the marine environment. We emphasize the spatial dimension of the different components of the ES provision framework and apply the proposed conceptual framework to food provision and climate regulation ES provided by marine and coastal ecosystems. We present the different extents of the mapping outputs generated by the ecosystem-based vs. the extra-local mapping approach and discuss practical and conceptual challenges of the approach. Lack of relevant ES mapping methodologies and lack of data appeared to be the most crucial bottlenecks in applying the extra-local approach for marine and coastal ES. We urge for more applications of the proposed framework that can improve marine and coastal ES assessments help fill in data gaps and generate more robust data.

The environment (e.g., soils and climate) and management influence agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and the potential to reduce emissions. For agriculture to contribute to greenhouse gas abatement in the long term, it is important to identify low-cost mitigation actions that farmers can adopt. It is hypothesized that greenhouse gas abatement potential and the associated costs will differ substantially between environments in Australia. Seven alternative management scenarios were identified as both suitable for adoption across different grain growing environments in Australia and potentially able to provide greenhouse gas abatement. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator was used to simulate these alternative management scenarios over a 25-year period and analyze the potential for Australian grain farmers, across contrasting environments, to increase soil organic carbon stocks and/or reduce nitrous oxide emissions. This analysis was paired with a whole-farm economic analysis to determine the implications of the different greenhouse gas abatement scenarios on farm profitability. Results from case studies in Australia’s three main grain growing regions demonstrate that significant heterogeneity exists in the biophysical potential and costs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across locations. The maximum predicted abatement potential for the case study sites varied from 0.34 to 2.03 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per hectare per year. In most simulations, greenhouse gas abatement came at a cost to farmers ranging from 0.11 Australian dollars (AUD) to more than 300 AUD per metric ton of abated carbon dioxide equivalent. This is the first study to explore the costs of mitigation including multiple greenhouse gases and grain farming case studies across Australia. These findings can inform the future development of effective climate change mitigation policies, which frequently use national default values in their design. © 2017, The Author(s).","APSIM; Bio-economic modeling; Climate change policies; Emissions reduction; Farm economic modeling; Greenhouse gas mitigation","abatement cost; agricultural development; agricultural emission; carbon dioxide; climate change; economic analysis; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; long-term change; nitrous oxide; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025094697

By understanding the geographic distribution of changes in suitable habitat, migration corridors can be identified for conservation and active management. With the increased availability of climate projection data, ancillary Geographic Information Systems data, and field observations, modeling efforts at the regional scale are now possible. Here, we modeled and mapped the continuous distribution of Tsuga canadensis throughout the state of Maine at the regional scale(30 m) with high precision (89% of pixels had a coefficient of variation ≤ 4.0%). The random forest algorithm was used to create a strong prediction of suitable habitat for the years 2050 and 2100 from both high and low emission climate projections.

Truck transport of water is an expensive and energy-intensive process with significant external costs including roads damages, and pollution. The integrated development plan (IDP) is the industry nomenclature for an integrated oil and gas infrastructure system incorporating pipeline-based transport of water and wastewater, centralized water treatment, and high rates of wastewater recycling. These IDP have been proposed as an alternative to truck transport systems so as to mitigate many of the economic and environmental problems associated with natural gas production, but the economic and environmental performance of these systems have not been analyzed to date. This study presents a quantification of lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and road damages of a generic oil and gas field, and of an oil and gas development sited in the Denver-Julesburg basin in the northern Colorado region of the US. Results demonstrate that a reduction in economic and environmental externalities can be derived from the development of these IDP-based pipeline water transportation systems. IDPs have marginal utility in reducing GHG emissions and road damage when they are used to replace in-field water transport, but can reduce GHG emissions and road damage by factors of as much as 6 and 7 respectively, when used to replace fresh water transport and waste-disposal routes for exemplar Northern Colorado oil and gas fields. © 2017 Duthu, Bradley.

These forests provide essential goods and services at local to global scales. It is uncertain how recovery dynamics, the processes by which forests respond to past forest land use, will continue to influence future forest conditions. Climate change compounds this uncertainty. Objectives: We explored how continued forest recovery dynamics affect forest biomass and species composition and how climate change may alter this trajectory. Methods: Using a spatially explicit landscape simulation model incorporating an ecophysiological model, we simulated forest processes in New England from 2010 to 2110. We compared forest biomass and composition from simulations that used a continuation of the current climate to those from four separate global circulation models forced by a high emission scenario (RCP 8.5). Results: Simulated forest change in New England was driven by continued recovery dynamics; without the influence of climate change forests accumulated 34 % more biomass and succeed to more shade tolerant species; Climate change resulted in 82 % more biomass but just nominal shifts in community composition. Most tree species increased AGB under climate change. Conclusions: Continued recovery dynamics will have larger impacts than climate change on forest composition in New England. The large increases in biomass simulated under all climate scenarios suggest that climate regulation provided by the eastern forest carbon sink has potential to continue for at least a century. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change; Forests; LANDIS-II; New England; Recovery dynamics","biomass; carbon sink; climate change; climate effect; community composition; ecological modeling; environmental restoration; forest ecosystem; future prospect; land use; reforestation; shade tolerance; tree; New England; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978087254

Laboratory populations of fleas decline under dry conditions, implying that populations of fleas will also decline when precipitation is scarce under natural conditions. If precipitation and hence vegetative production are reduced, however, then herbivorous hosts might suffer declines in body condition and have weakened defenses against fleas, so that fleas will increase in abundance. We tested these competing hypotheses using information from 23 yr of research on 3 species of colonial prairie dogs in the western United States: Gunnison's prairie dog (Cynomys gunnisoni, 1989-1994), Utah prairie dog (Cynomys parvidens, 1996-2005), and white-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys leucurus, 2006-2012). For all 3 species, flea-counts per individual varied inversely with the number of days in the prior growing season with >10 mm of precipitation, an index of the number of precipitation events that might have caused a substantial, prolonged increase in soil moisture and vegetative production. Flea-counts per Utah prairie dog also varied inversely with cumulative precipitation of the prior growing season. Furthermore, flea-counts per Gunnison's and white-tailed prairie dog varied inversely with cumulative precipitation of the just-completed January and February. These results complement research on black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) and might have important ramifications for plague, a bacterial disease transmitted by fleas that devastates populations of prairie dogs. In particular, our results might help to explain why, at some colonies, epizootics of plague, which can kill >95% of prairie dogs, are more likely to occur during or shortly after periods of reduced precipitation. Climate change is projected to increase the frequency of droughts in the grasslands of western North America. If so, then climate change might affect the occurrence of plague epizootics among prairie dogs and other mammalian species that associate with them. © 2017 American Society of Parasitologists.",,"Bacteria (microorganisms); Cynomys; Cynomys gunnisoni; Cynomys leucurus; Cynomys ludovicianus; Cynomys parvidens; Insecta; Mammalia; Siphonaptera (fleas); Vertebrata; rain; age distribution; animal; Arizona; binomial distribution; classification; climate change; Colorado; female; flea; Flea Infestations; male; microbiology; parasitology; plague; Rodent Diseases; Sciuridae; season; sex ratio; statistical model; transmission; Utah; veterinary; Age Distribution; Animals; Arizona; Binomial Distribution; Climate Change; Colorado; Female; Flea Infestations; Linear Models; Male; Plague; Rain; Rodent Diseases; Sciuridae; Seasons; Sex Distribution; Siphonaptera; Utah",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026317649

Here, 169 000 boundary layer trajectories are calculated in four eastern subtropical ocean basins following reanalysis winds at 925 mb (1 mb 5 1 hPa). These trajectories combined with a twice-daily cloud-top-height-inferred PBL depth product allow for a comprehensive Lagrangian analysis of the stratocumulus (Sc)-topped PBL as the cloud deck transitions from Sc to trade cumulus (Cu). Month-to-month variations of this PBL product are strongly positively correlated with an independent PBL product derived from GPS radio occultation. A climatology shows the PBL deepening offshore in every region. The yearly cycle of PBL depth varies in opposition to the yearly cycle of lower-tropospheric stability (LTS), but high-frequency variation between LTS and PBL depth is more complex. Observed geographical patterns of Lagrangian PBL deepening rates appear nonuniform between and within study regions, with smaller regions of maximum deepening rates. A Lagrangian analysis suggests that many variables act to alter the PBL: increased sea surface temperature and droplet concentration act to deepen the PBL, while increases in upper-level humidity, LTS, precipitation, upper-level temperature, and subsidence lead to PBL shallowing. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climatology; Clouds; Drop breakup; Drops; Geographical regions; Lagrange multipliers; Oceanography; Surface waters; Tropics; Droplet concentration; Geographical patterns; GPS radio occultations; Lagrangian evolution; Planetary boundary layers; Sea surface temperature (SST); Stratocumulus clouds; Upper level temperatures; Boundary layers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027420893

First, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and the dispersion curves of the fundamental Lamb wave modes are utilized to estimate the distance between an AE source and a sensor. This step uses a modal acoustic emission approach. Then, an analytical model is proposed that uses the estimated distances to simulate the edge-reflected waves. Finally, the correlation between the experimental and the simulated waveforms is used to estimate the location of AE sources.

The C-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of Rab5 is post-translationally modified at residues Cys212 and Cys213 to accommodate two geranylgeranyl anchors (C20 carbon chain length) in order to associate Rab5 with the membrane. The structural role of the HVR regarding protein-early endosome membrane recruitment is not resolved due to its high degree of flexibility and lack of crystallographic information. Here, full-atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the truncated Rab5 HVR206–215 in three model membranes of increasing complexity (pure phospholipid bilayer, ternary membrane with cholesterol, six-component early endosome) were performed. Specific electrostatic interactions between the HVR206–215 Arg209 residue and the phosphate group of the inositol ring of PI(3)P were detected. This shows that PI(3)P acts as a first contact site of protein recruitment to the early endosome. The free energy change of HVR206–215 extraction from the bilayer was largest for the physiological negatively charged membrane. 5 μs coarse-grained simulations revealed an active recruitment of PI(3)P to the HVR206–215 supporting the formation of Rab5- and PI(3)P enriched signaling platforms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Hypervariable region; Lipid enrichment; Lipid-protein interactions; Molecular dynamics; Peripheral membrane protein; Small GTPase","arginine; cholesterol; glycosylphosphatidylinositol; guanosine triphosphatase; lipid; Rab protein; water; 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylglycero-3-phosphoserine; 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine; 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine; cholesterol; diterpene; geranylgeranic acid; lipid bilayer; palmitoylsphingomyelin; phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate; phosphatidylserine; polyphosphoinositide; protein binding; Rab protein; RAB5C protein, human; sphingomyelin; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; controlled study; diffusion; diffusion coefficient; endosome; human; hydrogen bond; membrane structure; molecular dynamics; phospholipid bilayer; priority journal; protein localization; protein protein interaction; protein targeting; simulation; static electricity; alpha helix; amino acid sequence; beta sheet; binding site; chemistry; glycosylation; lipid bilayer; metabolism; molecular model; protein domain; signal transduction; thermodynamics; Amino Acid Sequence; Binding Sites; Cholesterol; Diterpenes; Endosomes; Glycosylation; Humans; Lipid Bilayers; Models, Molecular; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Phosphatidylcholines; Phosphatidylethanolamines; Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates; Phosphatidylserines; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical; Protein Conformation, beta-Strand; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; rab5 GTP-Binding Proteins; Signal Transduction; Sphingomyelins; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019168286

This can help by reducing vehicle emissions in the most polluted road sections, optimizing the pollution levels while maximizing the vehicle flow. For this, we use data sets gathered from a set of air quality monitoring stations, embedded low-cost e-participatory pollution sensors, contextual data, and the road network available data. These data are used in the air quality indexes calculation and then the generation of a dynamic traffic network. This network is represented by a weighted graph in which the edges weights evolve according to the pollution indexes. In this paper, we propose to combine the benefits of agent technology with both machine learning and big data tools. An artificial neural networks model and the Dijkstra algorithm are used for air quality prediction and the least polluted path finding in the road network.

We hypothesized that changes in soil properties resulting from grazing regulate the diversity of soil microbes by releasing/suppressing subordinate microbial taxa via competition. To test this, we examined how intensity of vertebrate herbivores influences the diversity and composition of soil bacteria and fungi at 216 soil samples from 54 sites across four microsites. Increasing grazing intensity reduced soil carbon, suppressing the dominant bacterial phylum Actinobacteria (indirectly promoting bacterial diversity) and increasing the dominant fungal phylum Ascomycetes (indirectly reducing fungal diversity). Our data provide novel evidence that grazing modulates the diversity and composition of soil microbes via increases or reductions in competition by dominant taxa.

Several biomass maps have been produced for Brazil, using different approaches and methods, and for different purposes. These maps have been used to estimate historic, recent, and future carbon emissions from land use change (LUC). It can be difficult to determine which map to use for what purpose. The implications of using an unsuitable map can be significant, since the maps have large differences, both in terms of total carbon storage and its spatial distribution. This paper presents comparisons of Brazil's new ‘official’ carbon map; that is, the map used in the third national communication to the UNFCCC in 2016, with the former official map, and four carbon maps from the scientific literature. General strengths and weaknesses of the different maps are identified, including their suitability for different types of studies. No carbon map was found suitable for studies concerned with existing land use/cover (LULC) and LUC outside of existing forests, partly because they do not represent the current LULC sufficiently well, and partly because they generally overestimate carbon values for agricultural land. A new map of aboveground carbon is presented, which was created based on data from existing maps and an up-to-date LULC map. This new map reflects current LULC, has high accuracy and resolution (50 m), and a national coverage. It can be a useful alternative for scientific studies and policy initiatives concerned with existing LULC and LUC outside of existing forests, especially at local scales when high resolution is necessary, and/or outside the Amazon biome. We identify five ongoing climate policy initiatives in Brazil that can benefit from using this map.

Therefore, road contribution to climate change should be mitigated to achieve the proposed goals in the fight against climate change. Policies and strategies suggest several preventive mitigation options, but have paid little attention to compensatory mitigation. We have conducted a theoretical case study in a Spanish province, Segovia, estimating the carbon dioxide emissions in the road network between 2015 and 2050, and analysing different compensation possibilities through conservation agriculture, agroforestry, afforestation and hedgerow plantation. We have calculated carbon sequestration in the reference period and costs per tonne for each option, estimating the budget range of offsetting road carbon emission, and funding possibilities, especially through fuel taxes. The paper demonstrates that offsetting carbon emissions produced by roads in this area is technically possible and highly desirable, unifying carbon sequestration, biodiversity improvement and rural development.

In addition, meteorological changes, along with the possibility of enhanced UV reflection from these surfaces, can have complex impacts on ozone and PM2.5 concentrations. We aim to evaluate the air-quality impacts of widespread cool-roof installations prescribed by California’s Title 24 building energy efficiency standards within the heavily populated and polluted South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB). Development of a comprehensive rooftop area database and evaluation of spectral reflectance measurements of roofing materials allows us to project potential future changes in solar and UV reflectance for simulations using the Weather Research Forecast and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) models. 2012 meteorological simulations indicate a decrease in daily maximum temperatures, daily maximum boundary layer heights, and ventilation coefficients throughout the SoCAB upon widespread installation of cool roofs. CMAQ simulations show significant increases in PM2.5 concentrations and policy-relevant design values. Changes in 8-h ozone concentrations depend on the potential change in UV reflectance, ranging from a decrease in population-weighted concentrations when UV reflectance remains unchanged to an increase when changes in UV reflectance are at an upper bound. However, 8-h policy-relevant ozone design values increase in all cases. Although the other benefits of cool roofs could outweigh small air-quality penalties, UV reflectance standards for cool roofing materials could mitigate these negative consequences. Results of this study motivate the careful consideration of future rooftop and pavement solar reflectance modification policies. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

The air quality in many urban environments is causing many premature deaths because of asthma, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and dementia associated with combustion emissions. The global social cost of air pollution is at least $3 trillion/year; particulates, nitrogen oxides and ozone associated with combustion emissions are very costly pollutants. Better air quality in urban environments is one of the reasons for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. There are many potential benefits associated with limiting climate change. In the recent past, the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have been increasing and the number of weather and climate disasters with costs over $1 billion has been increasing. The average global temperature set new record highs in 2014, 2015, and 2016.

Our objective was to characterize mechanisms controlling methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) production from permafrost. We simulated permafrost thaw for the length of one growing season (90 days) in oxic and anoxic treatments at 1 and 15 °C to stimulate aerobic and anaerobic respiration. We measured headspace CH4 and CO2 concentrations, as well as soil chemical and biological parameters (e.g. dissolved organic carbon (DOC) chemistry, microbial enzyme activity, N2O production, bacterial community structure), and applied an information theoretic approach and the Akaike information criterion to find the best explanation for mechanisms controlling GHG flux. In addition to temperature and redox status, CH4 production was explained by the relative abundance of methanogens, activity of non-methanogenic anaerobes, and substrate chemistry. Carbon dioxide production was explained by microbial community structure and chemistry of the DOC pool. We suggest that models of permafrost CO2 production are refined by a holistic view of the system, where the prokaryote community structure and detailed chemistry are considered. In contrast, although CH4 production is the result of many syntrophic interactions, these actions can be aggregated into a linear approach, where there is a single path of organic matter degradation and multiple conditions must be satisfied in order for methanogenesis to occur. This concept advances our mechanistic understanding of the processes governing anaerobic GHG flux, which is critical to understanding the impact the release of permafrost C will have on the global C cycle. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy; Greenhouse gas production; Illumina sequencing; Information theoretic; Methanogenesis; Microbial respiration","Akaike information criterion; carbon dioxide; community structure; concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; enzyme activity; FTIR spectroscopy; greenhouse gas; metabolism; methane; methanogenesis; microbial community; permafrost; redox conditions; soil respiration; temperature profile; Bacteria (microorganisms); Prokaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021943855

This paper presents the design of a hybrid wind turbine / Gas system, while taking into consideration the optimization of the carbon footprint. This optimization is carried out taking in consideration the evaluation of the availability, which is set by the introduction of the universal generating function (UGF), and by optimizing the cost.

This is a case study of a transdisciplinary project whose success was constrained by contextual factors that ultimately favoured technical and scientific forms of knowledge over the cultural intelligence that might ensure technical solutions were socially feasible. In response to Alaskan Water and Sewer Challenge (AWSC), an international team with expertise in engineering, consultative design and public health formed in 2013 to collaborate on a two-year project to design remote area water and sanitation systems in consultation with two native Alaskan communities. Team members were later interviewed about their experiences. Project processes are discussed using a ‘Knowledge Ecology’ framework, which applies principles of ecosystems analysis to knowledge ecologies, identifying the knowledge equivalents of ‘biotic’ and ‘abiotic’ factors and looking at their various interactions. In a positivist ‘knowledge integration’ perspective, different knowledges are like Lego blocks that combine with other ‘data sets’ to create a unified structure. The knowledge ecology framework highlights how interactions between different knowledges and knowledge practitioners (‘biotic factors’) are shaped by contextual (‘abiotic’) factors: the conditions of knowledge production, the research policy and funding climate, the distribution of research resources, and differential access to enabling infrastructures (networks, facilities). This case study highlights the importance of efforts to negotiate between different knowledge frameworks, including by strategic use of language and precepts that help translate social research into technical design outcomes that are grounded in social reality. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Community engagement; Designing thinking; Knowledge ecologies; Social research; Transdisciplinarity; Water and sanitation planning","Alaska; Alaska Native; cultural anthropology; ecology; ethics; human; procedures; public health; sanitation; standards; waste management; water management; Alaska; Alaska Natives; Culture; Ecology; Humans; Public Health; Sanitation; Waste Management; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997666880

The photo-excited electrons in the conduction band of GaP should have a sufficient reduction potential to drive the reduction of pyridinium and CO2. In this work, we have studied water adsorption on the GaP surface using density functional theory calculations, and its effect on the band alignment. Our calculations have shown that there are surface states present near the band edges due to unsaturated dangling bonds, and water adsorption can remove these states partially or almost completely depending on the adsorption states of water. More importantly, we have found that water adsorption has considerable effects on the band alignment, shifting up the band positions by up to 0.5 eV compared to the bare surface. The computed level of the conduction band with the adsorption of water is rather close to the reduction level of pyridinium ions, thus suggesting that photo-excited electrons are thermodynamically possible to reduce pyridinium to pyridinyl radicals that further help CO2 reduction. © 2017 Science Press","Band alignment; CO2 reduction; DFT; GaP; Pyridinium","Adsorption; Alignment; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Conduction bands; Dangling bonds; Density functional theory; Gallium alloys; Adsorption of water; Adsorption state; Band alignments; Photocatalytic activities; Photoexcited electrons; Pyridinium; Reduction potential; Water adsorption; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015693951

However, the cross-flow through interlayers under different permeability conditions is not well investigated for a multi-layer aquifer system. In this work, a multi-layer aquifer system with different permeability conditions was built up to quantify the brine production yield and the leakage risk under both schemes of pure brine recovery and enhanced by supercritical CO2. Numerical simulation results show that the permeability conditions of the interlayers have a significant effect on the brine production and the leakage risk as well as the regional pressure. Brine recovery enhanced by supercritical CO2 injection can improve the brine production yield by a factor of 2–3.5 compared to the pure brine recovery. For the pure brine recovery, strong cross-flow through interlayers occurs due to the drastic and extensive pressure drop, even for the relative low permeability (k = 10−20 m2) mudstone interlayers. Brine recovery enhanced by supercritical CO2 can successfully manage the regional pressure and decrease the leakage risk, even for the relative high permeability (k = 10−17 m2) mudstone interlayers. In addition, since the leakage of brine mainly occurs in the early stage of brine production, it is possible to minimize the leakage risk by gradually decreasing the brine production pressure at the early stage. Since the leakage of CO2 occurs in the whole production period and is significantly influenced by the buoyancy force, it may be more effective by adopting horizontal wells and optimizing well placement to reduce the CO2 leakage risk. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","A multi-layer aquifer; CO2-enhanced brine recovery (CO2-EBR); Leakage risk; Pressure control; Pure brine recovery (PBR)","Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Horizontal wells; Numerical models; Optical disk storage; Pressure control; Production; Sedimentary rocks; Aquifer systems; Brine productions; Buoyancy forces; High permeability; Low permeability; Permeability conditions; Pure brine recovery (PBR); Supercritical CO2; Recovery; aquifer; brine; buoyancy forcing; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; fluid injection; groundwater flow; hydrogeology; numerical method; permeability; China; Hunan; Jianghan Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021886706

In response, we established under the auspices of the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative a coupled indoor-outdoor emission-to-exposure framework to provide a set of consistent primary PM2.5 aggregated exposure factors. We followed a matrix-based mass balance approach for quantifying exposure from indoor and ground-level urban and rural outdoor sources using an effective indoor-outdoor population intake fraction and a system of archetypes to represent different levels of spatial detail. Emission-to-exposure archetypes range from global indoor and outdoor averages, via archetypal urban and indoor settings, to 3646 real-world cities in 16 parametrized subcontinental regions. Population intake fractions from urban and rural outdoor sources are lowest in Northern regions and Oceania and highest in Southeast Asia with population-weighted means across 3646 cities and 16 subcontinental regions of, respectively, 39 ppm (95% confidence interval: 4.3-160 ppm) and 2 ppm (95% confidence interval: 0.2-6.3 ppm). Intake fractions from residential and occupational indoor sources range from 470 ppm to 62 000 ppm, mainly as a function of air exchange rate and occupancy.

Globalization related dietary changes are contributing to the epidemic of non-communicable diseases and to the global climate crisis, and are associated with huge carbon and water footprints. The objective of the study is to assess inequalities in health impacts and in attributable greenhouse gases-GHG emissions in Italy by hypothesizing different scenarios of reduction in red and processed meat consumption towards healthier consumption patterns more compliant with the recommendations of the Mediterranean food pyramid. Methods: We used demographic and food consumption patterns from national surveys and risk relationships between meat intake and cardiovascular and colorectal cancer mortality from IARC and other meta-analyses. From the baseline data (year 2005–2006, average 406 gr/week beef and 245 gr/week processed meat), we considered hypothetical meat reduction scenarios according to international dietary guidelines such as the Mediterranean pyramid targets. For each geographical area (Northwest, Northeast, Centre, and South) and gender, we calculated the number of avoidable deaths from colorectal cancer, and cardiovascular disease among the adult population. Moreover, years of life gained by the adult population from 2012 to 2030 and changes in life expectancy of the 2012 birth cohort were quantified using gender-specific life tables. GHG emission reductions under Mediterranean scenario were estimated only for beef by applying the Global Warming Potential (GWP) coefficient to total consumption and to a low carbon food substitution in adult diet. Results: The deaths avoidable (as percentage change compared to baseline) according to the three reduction scenarios for beef consumption were between 2.3% and 4.5% for colorectal cancer, and between 2.1% and 4.0% for cardiovascular disease; higher benefits would be observed in Northwestern areas and among males. In parallel, 5% and 6.4% of colorectal cancer and CVD deaths would be avoided if the Italian population ate the advised quantity of processed meat. Life table analysis suggests that the scenario that is fully compliant with the Mediterranean diet model would save 5 million years of life lost prematurely among men and women over the next 18 years and would increase average life expectancy of future generations by over 7 months. Considering the environmental impact, emissions associated with the actual total intake of beef range from 12,900 to 21,800 Gg CO2 eq; emissions saved according to the Mediterranean scenario are in the range 8000–14000 Gg CO2 eq per year. The per capita reduction is 263 KgCO2eq/year/person with higher reductions in Northwestern and Central areas. Conclusions: In Italy, scenarios for reducing beef consumption are consistent with significant health and environmental co-benefits on current and future generations. Results support introducing policies to promote healthier behavior towards red and processed meat in the adult population within an overall balanced and healthy dietary pattern. Interventions should address gender, vulnerable population groups, and geographical differences in order to be more effective. © 2017 Farchi et al.

An assumed lifetime for nuclear power plants is 40 years, and the average age of the operating nuclear power stations is 30 years. From numbers related to non-RE capacities operating at end of 2014 and following this tendency, only 340 GW would still be operational by 2030, which implies the shutdown of 48.6% of the gas, 78.3% of the oil, 79.1% of the coal and 81.7% of the nuclear capacities. By 2050 only 6.1% and 1.4% of the currently operating capacity will be within the lifetime range for coal and nuclear, respectively, while 100% of the currently operating capacities of gas and oil would have reached the expected lifetime. From the total of the fossil and nuclear capacities of Europe, 65% is operating within the European Union, 72.3% of which is in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom and the Nordics. This presents a prime opportunity for Europe to evolve and set the example on the way towards sustainable power systems. To achieve the target of limiting climate change to 2 °C, net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 may be required, resulting in 17 GW of coal capacities installed in Europe from 2010 onwards facing a shorter-than-expected operational lifetime, which will lead to stranded assets. Gas and oil-fired capacities commissioned from 2016 onwards may be required to shift to carbon-neutral fuels such as biodiesel or RE-based syngas. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Operational lifetime; Power sector evolution; Renewable energy; Stranded assets","Carbon; Climate change; Coal; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Plant shutdowns; Carbon neutral fuel; Installed capacity; Operational lifetime; Power sector; Renewable energies; Stranded assets; Sustainable power systems; Total power capacity; Fossil fuel power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009732699

The alternative raw materials were employed as pore forming agent, in order to reduce sintering temperature and energy consumption of the furnace. The three technical nutrients studied were provided for local food industries: sludge from wastewater treatment plant from brewery industry (SB), meat-bone meal (MBM) and corn cob (CC). These materials were characterized in terms of chemical (XRF and elemental analysis - CHNS) and mineralogical (XRD) composition, as well as their thermal behavior (TGA/DTA/DSC) and LOI. For the production of LWAS different percentage of waste/by product (0, 5, 10 and 15%) were mixed with three types of clays (white, black and red) in two different clay-based mixtures. With the addition of water were produced approximately spherical pellets and thermal treated at two different temperatures (900 and 1000°C) for 1 hour. Technological parameters such as bulk and absolute density, total porosity, water absorption capacity, pH, electrical conductivity and organic matter content were measured, to determine their potential use in agriculture. XRD and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were performed for the characterization of different samples. The results indicate the potential for manufacturing high quality lightweight aggregates for agronomic purposes, using relatively simple processing and low sintering temperature that contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. © 2017, Gh.

Data were obtained from primary sources using a set of structured questionnaire assisted with interview schedule. Multistage sampling technique was used. Data were analyzed using the following: descriptive statistics and the stochastic frontier production function. The findings showed that majority of the respondents (59.1 %) still believed that climate change is a natural phenomenon that is beyond man’s power to abate while industrial release, improper sewage disposal, fossil fuel use, deforestation and bush burning were perceived as the most human factors that influence climate change by the category that chose human activities (40.9 %) as the main causes of climate change. The main employed adaptation strategies by the farmers were mixed cropping, planting early matured crop, planting of resistant crops and use of agrochemicals. The arable crop farmers were relatively technically efficient with about 53 % of them having technical efficiency above the average of 0.784 for the study area. The study observed that education, adaptation, perception, climate information and farming experience were statistically significant in decreasing inefficiency of arable crop production. Therefore, advocacy on climate change and its adaptation strategies should be intensified in the study area. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.",,"adaptive management; agricultural worker; arable farming; climate change; crop production; food security; technical efficiency; Nigeria; Ondo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968698082

In this framework, the Distribution System Operators (DSO) are exposed to the risk of reliability decrease and there is, earlier than expected, the issue of new and substantial investments for enhancing the network infrastructure. Nevertheless, DSOs have a very strong inclination to defer investment in new facilities in favour of more 'flexible measures' for improving the life of the existing components. Solutions of this type are primarily based on demand management, i.e. activities aimed at encouraging the end-users to a different/smart electricity utilization. The use of such methods for demand management has a very large number of benefits for the distribution system. As an example, they may slow the growth rate of annual peak load, reduce the energy demand on the system, reduce the power system losses, reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere and, as said, defer investments for strengthening the distribution network. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to assess the effects on the electrical distribution system of the application of load control programs and Building Automation and Control (BAC) systems in residential buildings.

Much of this work has employed frameworks informed by scholarship in the vulnerability field, which draws upon interviews with community members to identify and characterize climatic risks and adaptive responses. This scholarship has developed a baseline understanding of vulnerability in specific places and industries at particular times. However, given the dynamic nature of vulnerability new methodologies are needed to generate insights on how climate change is experienced and responded to over time. Longitudinal approaches have long been used in sociology and the health sciences to capture the dynamism of human processes, but their penetration into vulnerability research has been limited. In this article, we describe the application of two longitudinal approaches, cohort and trend studies, in climate change vulnerability assessment by analyzing three case studies from the Arctic where the authors applied these approaches. These case studies highlight how longitudinal approaches can be operationalized to capture the dynamism of vulnerability by identifying climate anomalies and trends, and how adaptations develop over time, including insights on themes such as social learning and adaptive pathways. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Arctic; Climate change; Inuit; Longitudinal approaches; Vulnerability","adaptive management; assessment method; baseline survey; climate change; longitudinal gradient; optimization; questionnaire survey; spatiotemporal analysis; vulnerability; Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019686781

China’s gas engine development strategies and three types of gas resource are discussed in the study, which indicates that gas engines could decrease GHG emissions by 520 megatonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) by 2020. This would account for 9.7 % of the government’s target for decreasing GHG emissions and is dominated by methane recovery from the use of coal mine gas (CMG) and landfill gas (LFG) for power generation. In the public urban transport vehicle and shipping sectors the low price of natural gas and the increasing demand for the control of harmful emissions could spur the rapid uptake of gas engine vehicles. However, the development of CMG- and LFG-fuelled power plants has been limited by the unwillingness of local enterprises to invest in high-performance gas engine generators and the associated infrastructure. Therefore, further compulsory policies that promote CMG use and LFG recovery should be implemented. Moreover, strict regulations on limiting methane leakage during the production and distribution of gas fuels are urgently needed in China to prevent leakage causing GHG emissions and largely negating the climate benefits of fuel substitution. Strategies for increasing the application of gas engines, promoting gas resources and recovering methane in China are instrumental in global GHG mitigation strategies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Gas engines; Gas fuel resources; GHG emissions; Power generation; Transport","coal mine; emission control; engine; governance approach; greenhouse gas; natural gas; pollution control; pollution policy; power generation; power plant; price dynamics; public transport; recovery plan; transport vehicle; China",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023749015

The steady state performance of the CH4 biofilter was studied for CH4 inlet loads (ILs) of 33, 66 and 132 gCH4 m−3 h−1 prior and after each ethanol cycle. In addition, the steady state removal of a mixture of CH4 and ethanol for a CH4/ethanol mass ratio of around 7.5 gCH4 g −1ethanol was evaluated over three cycles (EBRTs of 6, 3 and 1.5 min). In the absence of ethanol, the CH4 removal efficiency (RE) dropped from 35 to 7% due to an EBRT decrease from 6 to 1.5 min. In addition, the presence of ethanol resulted in a CH4 RE reduction at a constant EBRT in every cycle. The CH4 REs dropped from 35 to 29%, 17 to 13% and 7 to 0% for corresponding ethanol ILs of 4.5, 9 and 18 gethanol m−3 h−1 over the cycles. Moreover, the periodic presence of ethanol in the CH4 biofilter allowed the study of transient behaviors of the biofilter during ethanol addition and the biofilter recovery after each cycle. The CH4 RE reduction as a result of ethanol addition in each cycle was instantaneous. However, the CH4 RE recovery after completion of ethanol addition took 10, 14 and 25 days for ethanol ILs of 4.5, 9 and 18 gethanol m−3 h−1 respectively. The recovery time was related to the ethanol concentration in the leachate which were 1100 ± 200, 1100 ± 350 and 2500 ± 400 gethanol m−3leachate for corresponding ethanol ILs of 4.5, 9 and 18 gethanol m−3 h−1, respectively. Based on steady state and dynamic process conditions of the biofilter, the lowest gas flow rate of 3 L min−1 (EBRT of 6 min) produced the best performance when both pollutants were present (CH4 IL of 33 gCH4 m−3 h−1 and ethanol IL of 4.5 gethanol m−3 h−1). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biofilter; Ethanol; Gas flow rate; Methane; Mixture; Sensitivity","alcohol; methane; alcohol; gas; biofiltration; concentration (composition); ethanol; gas flow; leachate; methane; performance assessment; residence time; sensitivity analysis; steady-state equilibrium; absorption; alcohol consumption; Article; biodegradation; biofilter; biomass production; carbon dioxide tension; dynamics; flow rate; gas flow; leaching; methanotroph; mineralization; nonhuman; oxidation; reduction (chemistry); steady state; vapor; bioremediation; filtration; gas; Biodegradation, Environmental; Ethanol; Filtration; Gases; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015776323

Reforestation projects in the rural–urban fringe represent an opportunity for enhancing the environmental quality of peri-urban spaces and a means to contribute to cities carbon neutrality policies. Yet, relatively little information exists regarding the long term (10–25 years) survival and growth rate in urban and peri-urban plantations. This paper reports and discusses the results achieved by a reforestation in the peri-urban space of Rome (Italy), 25 years after its establishment. The plantation has been periodically surveyed between 6 and 24 years of age by means of continuous inventories, with the aim of monitoring growth dynamics. Permanent sample plots have been investigated and stratified by tree species composition (broadleaves vs. conifers, single vs. multispecies) for data analysis. On the whole, plantations show suitable results in terms of rate of growth, carbon storage and uptake, especially in coniferous and mixed stands. The average stand volume of the forest plantation, currently ranges from one-and-a third to one-and-a-half times the average values estimated for natural high forest stands of the same age and species groups at country level. The species groups exhibit differential growth patterns over the observed period, that are mainly due to differences in the ecological traits of the planted trees. Ten years after the establishment, the average annual value of carbon uptake in conifer and mixed species group exceeds 10 Mg CO2 equivalent ha−1 year−1, a figure corresponding to 4 times the value of deciduous broadleaves (oaks and other species) and 1.5 times the value of evergreen oaks. Twenty years after the establishment, the average annual carbon uptake peaks to 25 Mg CO2 equivalent ha−1 year−1 in the mixed species group, exceeds 15 Mg CO2 equivalent ha−1 year−1 in the conifers, and ranks between 6 and 12.5 Mg CO2 equivalent ha−1 year−1 in the groups dominated by broadleaved species. Overall with a surface area just under 300 ha, the carbon uptake level of the Castel di Guido reforestation allows to offset the 0.04% of CO2 emissions of the city of Rome. Although the spatial coexistence of even-aged plantation blocks characterized by a range of ecological traits, is expected to ensure a more continuous carbon sequestration, being less susceptible to damage of any kind, the current lack of silvicultural management may also lead to degradation processes, by triggering e.g. fuel accumulation and, by consequence, forest fires. In this line, recommendations are provided in order to improve the ecological and functional efficiency of the investigated reforestation. The field experiment demonstrates, ultimately, the capability of the continuous forest inventory to take the pulse over several decades of tree species performance and carbon uptake levels in urban and peri-urban reforestations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Carbon sequestration; Carbon uptake; Continuos forest inventory; Growth dynamics; Peri-urban reforestation; Tree species performance","Carbon dioxide; Deforestation; Digital storage; Ecology; Forestry; Reforestation; Urban planning; Carbon sequestration; Carbon uptake; Forest inventory; Growth dynamics; Tree species; Urban growth; carbon sequestration; coexistence; coniferous tree; environmental quality; forest fire; forest inventory; growth rate; periurban area; plantation forestry; range expansion; reforestation; Carbon; Chelation; Ecology; Forest Fires; Plantations; Reforestation; Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Rome; Coniferophyta; Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014535592

Coordinated adjustment of several parameters is required. Theoretical analysis reveals the combinations of parameters with the greatest effect. The influence of the granulometric composition of the sinter on the blast-furnace efficiency is considered in terms of the influence of the mean piece size on the reduction rate and the gas dynamics of the upper furnace region. When the reaction FeO + CO = Fe + CO2reaches equilibrium, the heat consumption in smelting is reduced by increasing the smelting rate. Analysis of specific approaches to reducing the heat consumption in blast furnaces for the example of PAO Novolipetskii Metallurgicheskii Kombinat (NLMK) indicates the basic measures that decrease heat consumption: optimization of the iron ore by reducing the proportion of the &gt;45 mm fraction; increase in output of the blast furnaces to 75–90 t/day (per m2of hearth); operation with the highest permissible pressure (in terms of the charging-unit design); increase in hot strength of the coke to 60–62%; pulverized- coal injection at 140 kg/t of hot metal; and optimization of the ore distribution over the furnace radius. Between 2013 and 2016, those measures decreased coke consumption by more than 10 kg/t of hot metal.

For this reason, we compare the model aerosol optical depth (AOD) outputs to observations, focusing on three key regions: North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the eastern Mediterranean. Three sets of four simulations have been performed for the 6-month period of spring and summer 2011. Each simulation set uses a different dust emission parametrisation and for each parametrisation, the dust emissions are multiplied with various coefficients in order to tune the model performance. Our assessment approach is performed across different spatial and temporal scales using AOD observations from satellites and ground-based stations, as well as from airborne measurements of aerosol extinction coefficients over the Sahara. Assessment over the entire domain and simulation period shows that the model presents temporal and spatial variability similar to observed AODs, regardless of the applied dust emission parametrisation. On the other hand, when focusing on specific regions, the model skill varies significantly. Tuning the model performance by applying a coefficient to dust emissions may reduce the model AOD bias over a region, but may increase it in other regions. In particular, the model was shown to realistically reproduce the major dust transport events over the eastern Mediterranean, but failed to capture the regional background AOD. Further comparison of the model simulations to airborne measurements of vertical profiles of extinction coefficients over North Africa suggests that the model realistically reproduces the total atmospheric column AOD. Finally, we discuss the model results in two sensitivity tests, where we included finer dust particles (less than 1 μm) and changed accordingly the dust bins' mass fraction. © Author(s) 2017.",,"aerosol; climate modeling; dust; emission inventory; optical depth; parameterization; performance assessment; sensitivity analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; weather forecasting; Arabian Peninsula; Mediterranean Region; North Africa; Sahara",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027249442

Appropriate choice of prime movers is paramount to make trigeneration feasible. It is common for trigeneration to be considered in district-wide application; however, there is little study on the effectiveness of various available prime movers in building-scale use. As such, diesel engine (DE), gas engine (GE), gas turbine with recuperator, and combined gas turbine cycle (CGTC) were involved as prime mover options for trigeneration in this study. Through year-round dynamic simulation, the energy and environmental performances of different trigeneration systems were thoroughly evaluated for a high-rise hotel building in subtropical climate. It was found that the DE-primed trigeneration would have the highest primary energy saving, while the CGTC-primed trigeneration would be the largest in carbon emissions cut. However, the GE-primed trigeneration system was deemed to be the best choice with both energy merit and system simplicity. It was also found that the part-load performance of prime mover and the required fuel type were closely associated to the annual energy and environmental performances. © 2017, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","carbon emissions cut; dynamic simulation; primary energy saving; prime movers; thermodynamic analysis; trigeneration","Climate change; Computer simulation; Diesel engines; Environmental management; Gas turbines; Tall buildings; Thermoanalysis; Carbon emissions; Primary energy savings; Prime movers; Thermo dynamic analysis; Tri-generation; Energy conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018316089

The occurrence of heavy haze pollution days is the most visible effect. Although many researchers have studied such problem, a high number of spatio-temporal limitations in the recent studies were identified. From our best knowledge the long trends of PM2.5 concentrations were not fully investigated in China, in particular the year-to-year trends and the seasonal and daily cycles. Therefore, in this work the PM2.5 concentrations collected from automatic monitors from five urban sites located in megacities with different climatic zones in China were analysed: Beijing (40°N), Chengdu (31°N), Guangzhou (23°N), Shanghai (31°N) and Shenyang (43°N). For an inter-comparison a meta-analysis was carried out. An evaluation conducted since 1999 demonstrates that PM2.5 concentrations have been reduced until 2008, period which match with the occurrence of the Olympic Games. However, a seasonal analysis highlight that such decrease occurs mostly during warmer seasons than cold seasons. During winter PM2.5 concentrations are typically 1.3 to 2.7 higher than in summer. The average daily cycle shows that the lowest and highest PM2.5 concentrations often occurs in the afternoon and evening hours respectively. Such daily variations are mostly driven by the daily variation of the boundary layer depth and emissions. Although the PM2.5 levels have showing signs of improvement, even during the warming season the values are still too high in comparison with the annual environmental standards of China (35 μg m−3). Moreover, during cold seasons the north regions have values twice higher than this limit. Thus, to fulfil these standards the governmental mitigation measures need to be strongly reinforced in order to optimize the daily living energy consumption, primarily in the north regions of China and during the winter periods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Daily cycle; Megacities; PM2.5 concentrations; Trends","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); diurnal variation; economic growth; haze; long-term change; megacity; meta-analysis; Olympic Games; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; trend analysis; urban area; boundary layer; China; cold stress; energy consumption; human; meta analysis; summer; warming; winter; air pollutant; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; China; Air Pollutants; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016589374

The effect of adding river water, reducing the salinity by 15 and 30%, on an autumn plankton community in a Mediterranean coastal lagoon (Thau Lagoon, France) was determined during a 6-day mesocosm experiment. Adding river water brought not only nutrients but also chlorophyceans that did not survive in the brackish mesocosm waters. The addition of water led to initial increases (days 1–2) in bacterial production as well as increases in the abundances of bacterioplankton and picoeukaryotes. After day 3, the increases were more significant for diatoms and dinoflagellates that were already present in the Thau Lagoon water (mainly Pseudo-nitzschia spp. group delicatissima and Prorocentrum triestinum) and other larger organisms (tintinnids, rotifers). At the same time, the abundances of bacterioplankton, cyanobacteria, and picoeukaryote fell, some nutrients (NH4 +, SiO4 3−) returned to pre-input levels, and the plankton structure moved from a trophic food web based on secondary production to the accumulation of primary producers in the mesocosms with added river water. Our results also show that, after freshwater inputs, there is rapid emergence of plankton species that are potentially harmful to living organisms. This suggests that flash flood events may lead to sanitary issues, other than pathogens, in exploited marine areas. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Coastal ecosystems; Flood impact; Planktonic food web; Potentially harmful species","carbon; fresh water; animal; bacterium; chemistry; food chain; France; plankton; river; Rotifera; salinity; Animals; Bacteria; Carbon; Food Chain; France; Fresh Water; Plankton; Rivers; Rotifera; Salinity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015654468

Using the case of low-carbon vehicle technologies in the US passenger vehicle sector (ethanol, plug-in electric and hydrogen), we develop a technology adoption simulation model that represents increasing returns to adoption in both financial costs and consumer preferences, representing uncertainty through Monte Carlo analysis. We compare the policy costs ($/tonne CO2 out to 2050) of: i) a technology-neutral carbon tax, ii) a somewhat neutral vehicle standard requiring low carbon vehicle sales, but allowing competition among technologies, and iii) technology-specific vehicle standards requiring sales of just one technology. On average across simulations, the carbon tax is twice as cost-effective as the best vehicle standard, in part because the tax more substantially affects vehicle use rates. Among the vehicle standards, a technology-specific standard that selects the right “winner” (plug-in electric vehicles) is more cost-effective than the neutral standard, as it more quickly stimulates technology improvement. However, there is risk in a technology-specific approach; mistakenly forcing a “loser” technology (hydrogen) results in policy costs that are 2 to 5 times higher than other policies. Results can help policymakers trade-off the costs and risks of different climate policy options. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate Policy; Low-carbon Vehicles; Simulation Model; Technology Adoption Model; Technology-neutral; Technology-specific","cost analysis; environmental economics; environmental policy; Monte Carlo analysis; policy making; pollution tax; technology adoption; trade-off; transport vehicle; uncertainty analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015359305

Our analysis shows that parking reforms at the CBD that increase delay congestion costs in the short-run such as parking supply limits can be welfare improving if other commuting externalities such as air pollution can be reduced. In addition, because parking limits can also change location decisions such as where to live and invest they may complement anti-sprawl policies efforts by leading to a more compact urban spatial structure in the long run. We also show that changes in downtown parking supply can have different spatial impacts on the market supply of residential parking by affecting urban residents’ location decisions.

It focuses on the ways in which professional community development facilitators and lead members of community groups attempt to actively shape how environmental projects are locally received. Drawing principally on identity, social sustainability and social practice theory scholarship, it reviews the often very personal and place-specific ways in which appeals to green identity are variously understood and applied, or are actively avoided, by community group leaders. Individuals who have become skilful in negotiating and influencing the presentation of environmental projects to the local community are understood here as (green) identity entrepreneurs. Arguably, it is the situated entrepreneurial skilfulness of lead individuals in negotiating the multiple and evolving (green) identities circulating through any one project, which plays a significant part in determining its subsequent impact and longevity. In understanding the contribution of (green) identity entrepreneurship, however, its relational association with everyday practices, routines and meanings of community and place is brought to the fore. The paper also considers how divergent external interpretations of what constitutes legitimate environmental practice at a local level further shape project identity. The discussion is informed by evidence drawn from a qualitative study of 17 community groups and 7 professional environmental support officers participating in a Welsh Government led programme aimed at facilitating ‘community action on climate change’. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Community; entrepreneur; environment; identity; sustainability","climate change; community development; entrepreneur; learning; local participation; qualitative analysis; state role; sustainability; United Kingdom; Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021176058

Arbuscular mycorrhizae (phylum Glomeromycota) form symbiotic relationships with over 80% of vascular plants. In return for carbon, these fungi improve plant health and tolerance to environmental stress. This symbiosis is over 400 million years old and there are currently over 200 known arbuscular mycorrhizae, with dozens of new species described annually. Metagenomic sequencing of native soil communities, from species-rich meadows to mangroves, suggests biologically diverse habitats support a variety of mycorrhizal species with potential agricultural, medical, and biotechnological applications. This review looks at the effect of mycorrhizae on plant metabolism and how we can harness this symbiosis to improve crop health. I will first describe the mechanisms that underlie this symbiosis and what physiological, metabolic, and environmental factors trigger these plant-fungal relationships. These include mycorrhizal manipulation of host genetic expression, host mitochondrial and plastid proliferation, and increased production of terpenoids and jasmonic acid by the host plant. I will then discuss the effects of mycorrhizae on plant root and foliar secondary metabolism. I subsequently outline how mycorrhizae induce three key benefits in crops: defense against pathogen and herbivore attack, drought resistance, and heavy metal tolerance. I conclude with an overview of current efforts to harness mycorrhizal diversity to improve crop health through customized inoculum. I argue future research should embrace synthetic biology to create mycorrhizal chasses with improved symbiotic abilities and potentially novel functions to improve plant health. As the effects of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance increase, the global diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi should be monitored and protected to ensure this important agricultural and biotechnological resource for the future. © 2017 French.","Agriculture; Bioprotectants; Endosymbiosis; Fungal diversity; Microbial-plant communication; Synthetic biology","heavy metal; jasmonic acid; terpenoid; arbuscular mycorrhiza; bioengineering; crop improvement; drought tolerance; metagenomics; microbial colonization; mycorrhizal inoculation; mycosis; nonhuman; plant growth; plant metabolism; plasmodesma; Review; symbiosis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025636851

Thus, methanogens play a key role in sustaining rumen metabolism and function. Research of rumen methanogenic archaea typically focuses on their composition and function in mature animals, while studies of early colonization and functional establishment remain scarce. Here, we investigated the metabolic potential and taxonomic composition of the methanogenic communities across different rumen developmental stages. We discovered that the methanogenesis process changes with age and that the early methanogenic community is characterized by a high activity of methylotrophic methanogenesis, likely performed by members of the order Methanosarcinales, exclusively found in young rumen. In contrast, higher hydrogenotrophic activity was observed in the mature rumen, where a higher proportion of exclusively hydrogenotrophic taxa are found. These findings suggest that environmental filtering acts on the archaeal communities and select for different methanogenic lineages during different growth stages, affecting the functionality of this ecosystem. This study provides a better understanding of the compositional and metabolic changes that occur in the rumen microbiome from its initial stages of colonization and throughout the animals' life. © 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"hydrogen; methane; animal; bovine; classification; gastrointestinal tract; metabolism; Methanosarcinales; microbiology; microflora; rumen; Animals; Cattle; Gastrointestinal Tract; Hydrogen; Methane; Methanosarcinales; Microbiota; Rumen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027142700

Type I methanotrophs are gamma-proteobacterial methanotrophs using the ribulose monophosphate cycle (RuMP) cycle for methane assimilation. In order to facilitate metabolic engineering in the industrially promising Type I methanotroph Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1, flux analysis of cellular metabolism is needed and 13C tracer analysis is a foundational tool for such work. This biological system has a single-carbon input and a special network topology that together pose challenges to the current well-established methodology for 13C tracer analysis using a multi-carbon input such as glucose, and to date, no 13C tracer analysis of flux in a Type I methanotroph has been reported. In this study, we showed that by monitoring labeling patterns of several key intermediate metabolites in core metabolism, it is possible to quantitate the relative flux ratios for important branch points, such as the malate node. In addition, it is possible to assess the operation of the TCA cycle, which has been thought to be incomplete in Type I methanotrophs. Surprisingly, our analysis provides direct evidence of a complete, oxidative TCA cycle operating in M. buryatense 5GB1 using methane as sole carbon and energy substrate, contributing about 45% of the total flux for de novo malate production. Combined with mutant analysis, this method was able to identify fumA (METBUDRAFT_1453/MBURv2__60244) as the primary fumarase involved in the oxidative TCA cycle, among 2 predicted fumarases, supported by 13C tracer analysis on both fumA and fumC single knockouts. Interrupting the oxidative TCA cycle leads to a severe growth defect, suggesting that the oxidative TCA cycle functions to not only provide precursors for de novo biomass synthesis, but also to provide reducing power to the system.

The integrated combined gasification cycle (IGCC) is also modeled and evaluated for the co-production of electricity, ammonia and methane for 543.13 kilo tonne per annum (KTA) of municipal solid waste (MSW). The final products are 1284.89 MW, 8731.07 kg/h of liquid ammonia at 8 ◦ C and 32,468 kg/h of methane gas at 271 C. The conceptual design includes advanced heat integration between syngas and hot and cold streams in all process units. The water gas shift (WGS) unit includes integration between equilibrium reactors and cold streams. The air separation unit (ASU) includes four air compressors followed by a pressure swing adsorber (PSA), which separates oxygen and nitrogen gases into separate streams. Both O2 and N2 gases are compressed and sent to gasifier and syngas cleaning unit, respectively. The overall design shows reliability and solved steady state equations for all process units with improvements in thermal efficiency in comparison with single cycle gasification plants. The environmental emissions for GHGs such CO2 and SO2 are lower due to higher overall energy efficiency. © 2017 by the authors.

Here we propose an integrated assessment and interpretation of climate change impacts as a prerequisite for stakeholder outreach and planning of suitable climate change adaptation measures. The assessment includes (i) identifying trends in meteorological and hydrological observations and their nature, (ii) analysing the relation between the meteorological drivers and generated run-off as an integrated catchment response and (iii) analysing how hitherto changes agree with the simulations by regional climate models (RCMs). The Lusatian river catchments of Spree and Schwarze Elster, characterised by high anthropogenic impact (e.g. mining activities) and low natural water yield, serve as study areas. The results of this study suggest that increases in observed temperature and potential evapotranspiration are robust while observed precipitation remained nearly unchanged (1963–2006). The RCMs agree on simulating a temperature increase but simulate opposing trends for precipitation for both past (1963–2006) and future (2018–2060) periods, the latter inducing differences in the hydrological response (actual evapotranspiration and run-off). For stakeholder outreach, we communicated a range of potential future climates and identified the statistical RCMs (STAR, WettReg) as warm and dry scenarios, and the dynamical RCMs (REMO, CCLM) as wet scenarios. Ultimately, the combined analysis of trends in observations and simulation models can be beneficial for stakeholder outreach and may increase their willingness to plan and implement suitable climate change adaptation strategies which are urgently needed within the Lusatian river catchments. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Change points; Global dimming; Regional climate models; Stakeholder outreach; Trends analysis; Water management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015690912

Its development raises a trade-off between the deployment of large-scale projects (learning by replication), and the preservation of a large portfolio of competing technologies (learning by diversity), on each of its steps (capture, transport, storage). By now large-scale CCS projects are still few, most devoted to EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery). Although EOR has provided a first feasible business model for CCS, CCS has still to prove its economic viability on a large variety of carbon emitters (power plant, industrial and bioenergy sources). A competing business model for CCS is to find other carbon uses and energy sources, better adapted to medium and small carbon sources.

Numerical modeling is a helpful tool in these analyses, but it is hard to manage with limited data available, which is frequent in developing countries. The aim of the paper is to show that there are other simple and reliable options. The primary objective of this research is to propose and validate a simplified-to-available-data approach, useful for aquifer modeling, followed by scenarios’ simulation, based on realistic future events. The Mexican overexploited aquifer Cuautitlán–Pachuca case study assess the responses of the water level under different outflows and infiltration scenarios from 2007 (base year) to 2031. Modflow software allowed the model calibration with 2007 data, and further spatial and temporal evolution of the piezometric level. The aquifer is the main water supplier for economic activities, and population in the northern region of Mexico City and outflows are continuously increasing, despite its severe overexploitation and even stronger negative impacts in the decline water levels are predicted in this study. A previous study reported −194.97 hm3/year deficit in 2010, and this paper predicts the strongest effect due to overpumping caused by the population growth that would intensify the deficiency up to −236.29 hm3/year. The results have revealed to decision makers the urgency to prevent the aquifer’s irreversible impairment, with a proper operation and management planning. This paper provides a contribution for simplifying conceptual models allowing to predict aquifers’ outcome scenarios with limited data. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Aquifer overexploitation; GIS; Modflow; Numerical modeling; Scenario analysis","Aquifers; Climate change; Decision making; Developing countries; Economics; Geographic information systems; Groundwater; Hydrogeology; Numerical models; Population statistics; Water levels; Water management; Economic activities; MODFLOW; Operation and management; Over-exploited aquifers; Overexploitation; Piezometric levels; Scenario analysis; Scenario predictions; Groundwater resources; aquifer; calibration; climate change; GIS; groundwater; infiltration; megacity; numerical model; population growth; scenario analysis; software; temporal evolution; water level; water management; water planning; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026728254

Recent studies indicate that the trend of global warming and nitrogen deposition will continue over the next few decades. These changes not only affect the growth of aboveground vegetation, but also change the belowground soil environment, and thus directly or indirectly affect the microbial process. The microbial biomass and soil enzymes play significant roles in terrestrial environments, particularly through the decomposition of soil organic matter, dynamic fluctuation between carbon sink and source, and the transformation of soil nutrient. However, little is known about that how global warming and nitrogen deposition will affect the soil microbial and soil enzymes in the subtropical zone. In the present study, we aim to evaluate the responses of the microbial biomass and soil enzyme activity to short-term simulated warming and nitrogen deposition in young Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) in Sanming Fujian province in subtropical China. The results showed that soil warming increased microbial biomass carbon content and improved the activity of acid phosphatase and lignin enzymes significantly (P b 0.05). Additionally, microbial biomass carbon content was significantly higher than that of the control after the application of nitrogen fertilizer. Besides, nitrogen addition also significantly raised the C/N ratio of microbial biomass. It also reduced the activity of lignin and cellulose hydrolysis. The combination of warming and nitrogen treatment was more effective than individual warming and nitrogen treatments, increasing the content of soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, decreasing the activity of lignin hydrolytic enzymes and chitinase, and leading to further acidification of the soil. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that moisture and pH are the major determinants of soil enzyme activity at the 0-10 cm depth. However, at the 10-20 cm depth, the major determiner is microbial biomass. In summary, the simulated warming and nitrogen deposition affected soil microbial biomass and enzyme activity significantly in the short-term, and the interaction of the two factors was significant. That suggests that the climate change could have a profound effect on soil microbial processes. Therefore, the effects of simulated warming and nitrogen deposition on microbial biomass and soil enzyme activity and the mechanism of their interaction with soil, microorganisms and plants need to be studied further, in order to reveal the responses and feedback mechanisms of Chinese fir plantations to global climate change in subtropical China. © 2017 Ecological Society of China.

To aid home builders in this need, this paper presents some key observations based on a thorough examination of the costs and benefits of green single-family homes certified by the National Green Building Standard (NGBS). These observations were verified via interviews with green home builders and included the following: (1) Climate zones and local codes are the base to determine the additional costs and benefits of green buildings. (2) Additional construction costs to achieve green certification are higher in hot and humid climate zones. (3) After satisfying local code requirements following the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), NGBS bronze or silver certification entails a very low additional construction cost. (4) Payback periods to cover additional construction costs at the NGBS bronze, silver, and gold levels might be as low as 3 years or less. (5) A client base of homebuyers who are willing to buy affordable, smaller, and greener homes exists in today's market. (6) Prioritizing inclusion of specific green features (e.g., advanced framing techniques) facilitates achieving NGBS bronze, silver, and even gold certification at a potentially very low additional cost.

In comparison to other biomes, the natural depletion of C content in arid and semiarid lands harbors a high potential for carbon sequestration. We provide a comprehensive review of carbon biogeochemistry, the associated microbial communities and strategies for soil restoration in drylands under the scope of global change. In these areas, the biogeochemistry of organic carbon is governed by climate conditions. Photodegradation, water availability and temperature, overcontrol microbial activity and hence carbon cycling. Under limited water availability, microbial activity is diminished and hence the organicmatter accumulation in soil increases, but the development of a sustainable plant cover is not promoted. Soil degradation as a consequence of low carbon content can be avoided by organic amendments consisting of biosolids (composts, sludges, etc.). Organic amendments promote an increase of soil organic matter and microbial activity, which are linked to a rise in soil fertility. Appropriate management practices in cropland and shrub lands, which have deep soil profiles with low organic carbon saturation, seem to be a win-win option for sequestering carbon and improving soil productivity.

The A allele of the functional variant rs13306560 in its promoter region has been liked to decreased transactivation capacity. Therefore, we sought to determine a possible association of the rs13306560 and SPD.METHODS: In total, 237 individuals were genotyped, 113 patients with SPD diagnosed according to the Queen Square Brain Bank criteria and 124 neurologically healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using TaqMan probes for the rs13306560 and real-time PCR.RESULTS: The A allelle was associated to protection in SPD, under the dominant model, (OR=0.22, C.I.=[0.048-1.080], p=0.04), nevertheless, after logistic regression analysis with adjustment for gender, resulted only in a trend (Exp (β)=0.211, [I.C. 95.0%, 0.042-1.057], p=0.058).CONCLUSION: Although further studies are needed, our data suggest an important role of the MTHFR gene variants in the fine-tuning regulation of one-carbon metabolism in the brain.",,"methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NADPH2); MTHFR protein, human; adult; aged; allele; case control study; female; gene frequency; genetic association study; genetic predisposition; genetics; genotype; human; male; middle aged; Parkinson disease; promoter region; single nucleotide polymorphism; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alleles; Case-Control Studies; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Humans; Male; Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2); Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Promoter Regions, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050876291

The natural geothermal conditions in southern Iceland provide an opportunity to study the impact of warming on plants, because of the geothermal bedrock channels that induce stable gradients of soil temperature. We studied two valleys, one where such gradients have been present for centuries (long-term treatment), and another where new gradients were created in 2008 after a shallow crustal earthquake (short-term treatment). We studied the impact of soil warming (0 to +15° C) on the foliar metabolomes of two common plant species of high northern latitudes: Agrostis capillaris, a monocotyledon grass; and Ranunculus acris, a dicotyledonous herb, and evaluated the dependence of shifts in their metabolomes on the length of the warming treatment. The two species responded differently to warming, depending on the length of exposure. The grass metabolome clearly shifted at the site of long-term warming, but the herb metabolome did not. The main up-regulated compounds at the highest temperatures at the long-term site were saccharides and amino acids, both involved in heat-shock metabolic pathways. Moreover, some secondary metabolites, such as phenolic acids and terpenes, associated with a wide array of stresses, were also up-regulated. Most current climatic models predict an increase in annual average temperature between 2–8° C over land masses in the Arctic towards the end of this century. The metabolomes of A. capillaris and R. acris shifted abruptly and nonlinearly to soil warming >5° C above the control temperature for the coming decades. These results thus suggest that a slight warming increase may not imply substantial changes in plant function, but if the temperature rises more than 5° C, warming may end up triggering metabolic pathways associated with heat stress in some plant species currently dominant in this region. © 2017 by the authors.

Increasingly, however, crops and livestock are produced in isolation, particularly in farms operating at the commercial scale. It has been suggested that re-integrating crop and livestock systems at the field and farm level could help reduce the pollution associated with modern agricultural production and increase yields. Despite this potential, there has been no systematic review to assess remaining knowledge gaps in both the social and ecological dimensions of integrated crop and livestock systems (ICLS), particularly within commercial agricultural systems. Based on a multi-disciplinary workshop of international experts and additional literature review, we assess the current knowledge and remaining uncertainties about large-scale, commercial ICLS and identify the source of remaining knowledge gaps to establish priorities for future research. We find that much is understood about nutrient flows, soil quality, crop performance, and animal weight gain in commercial ICLS, but there is little knowledge about its spatial extent, animal behavior or welfare in ICLS, or the tradeoffs between biodiversity, pest and disease control, greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, and drought and heat tolerance in ICLS. There is some evidence regarding the economic outcomes in commercial ICLS and supply chain and policy barriers to adoption, but little understanding of broader social outcomes or cultural factors influencing adoption. Many of these knowledge gaps arise from a basic lack of data at both the field and system scales, which undermines both statistical analysis and modeling efforts. Future priorities for the international community of researchers investigating the tradeoffs and scalability of ICLS include: methods standardization to better facilitate international collaborations and comparisons, continued social organization for better data utilization and collaboration, meta-analyses to answer key questions from existing data, the establishment of long term experiments and surveys in key regions, a portal for citizen science, and more engagement with ICLS farmers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agroecology; Ecosystem services; Food systems; Mixed crop livestock; Sustainable agriculture","agricultural production; agroecology; alternative agriculture; commercial activity; crop yield; ecosystem service; expert system; farmers knowledge; food production; food security; integrated approach; livelihood; mixed farming; social organization; trade-off; uncertainty analysis; Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019414239

Climate change adaptation is of special concern in regions facing water scarcity where water management is already challenged by many problems. This paper is a review of current knowledge on approaches to address water issues under uncertainty in water-scarce regions, identifying specific policy actions for climate change adaptation. The focus is on regions, like the Mediterranean, California or Australia, where water resources are well developed and have become an essential part of socioeconomic activities but are currently facing significant challenges due to their dependence on water availability to maintain living standards. We provide an overview of the expected impacts of climate change on water resources and discuss management responses based on peer-reviewed studies published over the past three decades. The adaptation choices cover a wide range of options, from adaptive demand management to utilization of remaining marginal water sources. The intensification of successful measures already applied in the past is still viewed as a solution to reduce climate impacts. However, the emphasis is progressively being placed on sustainability, developing and extending the water management paradigm to include not only technical and economic criteria, but also ecological and social considerations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change adaptation; Reservoir storage; Water management; Water resources","Facings; Reservoir management; Reservoirs (water); Water management; Water resources; Climate change adaptation; Climate impacts; Economic criteria; Living standards; Policy actions; Reservoir storage; Water availability; Water resources management; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; living standard; reservoir; uncertainty analysis; water availability; water management; water resource; Australia; California; Mediterranean Region; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020696192

Here, we explore the effects of foundation species above and below tree line, a globally consistent and often abrupt climatic and ecological transition. The experiment was developed in Northern Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and Montana, USA, in vegetation with similar herbaceous physiognomies without trees, but containing dominant foundation species with “cushion” morphologies. In these systems, we compared the diversity and structure of plant communities occurring within these foundation species to that in the open at three sites below tree line and three sites above tree line. Above tree line, 69–94% of all species were significantly spatially associated with foundation species, whereas below tree line, 29–62% of the species were associated with foundation species. Similar patterns were observed in species accumulation curves with foundation species affecting the accumulation of species by +17 to +47% above tree line vs. –27 to +24% below tree line. Our results were consistent with the idea that facilitative interactions are more common with greater abiotic stress. However, our results also suggest the possibility that the climatic transition representing tree line might also represent a threshold, rather than a simple linear response, in how foundation species affect community diversity. A much larger sample size is warranted to thoroughly test such thresholds, but the fundamental ecological and physiological transition that plants experience at the climate of the tree line may also be reflected in small-scale species interactions that organize communities. © 2016 Società Botanica Italiana.","Alpine; community; competition; cushion plant; facilitation; foundation species; interactions; stress gradient; threshold; timberline; tree line",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978512139

In tropical estuaries, bacterial metabolic rates and carbon modification are regulated by physicochemical changes influenced by the annual monsoon-mediated river runoff. The present study is the first report on the effect of monsoon-influenced river discharge magnitude on bacterial metabolic rates and organic matter variation in the tropical Godavari estuary and adjacent coastal waters. Concentrations, nature, and sources of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen were investigated by elemental analyser-isotopic ratio mass spectrometer, whereas concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen were determined by a high-temperature catalytic oxidation in surface waters of Godavari estuary, east coast of India. Bacterial abundance and metabolic rates were measured, and pCO2 levels were calculated for surface water samples. The maxima obtained in bacterial respiration (BR) rate (994 μg C l−1 d−1) were associated with maximum concentrations and the terrigenous nature of organic matter with high C:N ratio (∼12). The highly depleted δ13C POC (−32.9 ± 1.4‰) associated with Chl-a maxima suggest its contribution from freshwater planktons. The significant positive correlation of bacterial productivity (BP), bacterial growth efficiency (BGE), and BR with particulate organic matter associated with low DOC:POC ratio could imply a heterotrophic preference for an abundant form of organic matter. We, moreover, uncovered that terrigenous organic matter is modified efficiently in the estuarine transect by heterotrophic bacteria under favorable physicochemical conditions like low salinity and high nutrient content. Furthermore, the majority (76%) of BGE values were &lt;8%, and average pCO2 levels were ∼14 times greater than the atmospheric levels. Overall, this study reported that the Godavari estuary is net heterotrophic and hence significantly contributes to global carbon cycle biogeochemistry. © 2017 CSIR–National Institute of Oceanography Dona Paula Goa India.","Bacterial metabolic rates; Godavari estuary; organic matter; pCO2 levels; river discharge","biogeochemical cycle; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; estuarine environment; metabolism; microbial activity; monsoon; organic matter; river discharge; tropical region; Andhra Pradesh; Godavari Estuary; India; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024383643

This catalog provides a large array of variables that can be used to examine AR cases and their climate-scale variability in exceptional detail. The new record of AR activity, as presented, validated and examined here, provides a perspective on the seasonal cycle and the interannual-interdecadal variability of AR activity affecting the hydroclimate of western North America. Importantly, AR intensity does not exactly follow the climatological pattern of AR frequency. Strong links to hydroclimate are demonstrated using a high-resolution precipitation data set. We describe the seasonal progression of AR activity and diagnose linkages with climate variability expressed in Pacific sea surface temperatures, revealing links to Pacific decadal variability, recent regional anomalies, as well as a generally rising trend in land-falling AR activity. The latter trend is consistent with a long-term increase in vapor transport from the warming North Pacific onto the North American continent.

The furnace and catalytic reactors are modeled based on the mass and energy conservation laws at steady state condition. To prove the accuracy of the developed mathematical model, simulation results of conventional process are compared with the available plant data. Then, the optimal condition of Claus process is calculated considering sulfur recovery as the objective function using Genetic algorithm as a useful method in global optimization. The attainable decision variables are inlet temperature of furnace and fixed bed reactors, feed distribution along the furnace and flow rate of air in the furnace. The simulation results show that sulfur recovery is improved about 4.63% in the optimized process compared to the conventional process.

However, the effects of projected climate change on crop pollinators and therefore on crop production are still unclear, especially for wild pollinators and aggregate community responses. Using species distributional modeling, we assessed the effects of climate change on the geographic distribution of 95 pollinator species of 13 Brazilian crops, and we estimated their relative impacts on crop production. We described these effects at the municipality level, and we assessed the crops that were grown, the gross production volume of these crops, the total crop production value, and the number of inhabitants. Overall, considering all crop species, we found that the projected climate change will reduce the probability of pollinator occurrence by almost 0.13 by 2050. Our models predict that almost 90% of the municipalities analyzed will face species loss. Decreases in the pollinator occurrence probability varied from 0.08 (persimmon) to 0.25 (tomato) and will potentially affect 9% (mandarin) to 100% (sunflower) of the municipalities that produce each crop. Municipalities in central and southern Brazil will potentially face relatively large impacts on crop production due to pollinator loss. In contrast, some municipalities in northern Brazil, particularly in the northwestern Amazon, could potentially benefit from climate change because pollinators of some crops may increase. The decline in the probability of pollinator occurrence is found in a large number of municipalities with the lowest GDP and will also likely affect some places where crop production is high (20% to 90% of the GDP) and where the number of inhabitants is also high (more than 6 million people). Our study highlights key municipalities where crops are economically important and where pollinators will potentially face the worst conditions due to climate change. However, pollinators may be able to find new suitable areas that have the potential to improve crop production. The results shown here could guide policy decisions for adapting to climate change and for preventing the loss of pollinator species and crop production. © 2017 Giannini et al This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"algorithm; animal; Brazil; climate change; crop; environmental protection; growth, development and aging; physiology; pollination; Algorithms; Animals; Brazil; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Pollination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030619404

Improving photosynthetic efficiency by engineering carbon fixation has been identified as one of the most important approaches for increasing agricultural output. Recent studies indicate that introducing cyanobacterial-like carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) into plant chloroplasts represents a promising strategy for enhancing plant photosynthesis. Here, we give a general outline for transferring CCMs to plants. The proposed trajectory includes introducing bicarbonate transporters and CO2-fixing organelles into plant chloroplasts as well as minimizing stromal carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity. We focus on different approaches for constructing compartments that co-localize the CO2-fixing enzyme D-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and CA, aimed at increasing RuBisCO turnover and decreasing wasteful photorespiration. We consider strategies based on cyanobacterial carboxysomes and on other protein-based compartments, specifically encapsulin nanocompartments.

Thus, in most of the cases, the CO 2 emissions series display orders of integration equal to or higher than 1, implying that there are permanent effects of shocks for CO 2 emissions. The only exceptions are Germany, the US and the UK, where shocks will have transitory effects. With respect to the non-linearities, more evidence of non-linear behaviour was obtained for the G7 countries, especially in the cases of the US, the UK, Germany and France. Partial evidence was also found in Canada and India. The significantly different results obtained for emerging and developed economies have important policy implications. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","CO 2 emission; Long memory; Non-linear trends","Economics; CO2 emissions; Developed economies; Long memory; Mean reversion; Non-linear trends; Nonlinear behaviours; Policy implications; Structural break; Public policy; carbon emission; economic development; emission control; environmental economics; long-term change; nonlinearity; trend analysis; Canada; France; Germany; India; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975784217

However, on many occasions substantial environmental gain can be attained through waste management optimization. In this particular study, the main objective was to combine operational research techniques with Life Cycle Assessment to locate collection sites for general and recyclable residues and create an effective collection-route system for compactor trucks to attain a reduction in environmental impacts. The case study selected was the district of Comas, one of the most populated districts in the city of Lima, a city that has experienced several episodes of poor waste collection management in recent years. For the location of the collection sites a mathematical optimization model was proposed to decide where to locate them, as well as the number of containers required at each site, considering that general and recyclable residues would not be collected at the same site due to the restricted space available. For the creation of collection routes, a heuristic approach based on the Vehicle Routing Problem was constructed, taking into account the available working time of each collection truck to assign them collection routes and minimize the number of compactor trucks. These results, when combined with LCA, focused mainly on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air pollution impact categories and the depletion of abiotic resources. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was developed by varying three different parameters with respect to the proposed baseline scenario, comparing the several impact categories. Computed results show that implementing a container collection system reduces the number of compactor trucks required by up to 50% as compared to the current door-to-door collection system. Moreover, GHG emissions where reduced by almost 14% with the proposal, mostly due to a 41% reduction in distance traveled. Reductions in terms of particulate matter formation and photochemical oxidant formation were even more significant, especially considering that air pollution is an important health hazard in the district analyzed, whereas most scenarios showed a slight increase in resource depletion due to the inclusion of container infrastructure in the system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Allocation optimization; Heuristic; Industrial ecology; LCA; Peru; Waste management","Air pollution; Automobiles; Containers; Cost reduction; Crashworthiness; Decision making; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Health hazards; Heuristic methods; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Optimization; Pollution; Sensitivity analysis; Trucks; Vehicle routing; Allocation optimization; Heuristic; Industrial ecology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mathematical optimization model; Particulate matter formations; Peru; Waste collection managements; Waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019094605

In this paper, we consider whether blockages in national policy processes − resulting for example from austerity or small state political philosophies − might be overcome by the development of more polycentric governance arrangements. Drawing on evidence from three stakeholder workshops and fifteen interviews, we address this question by exploring the United Kingdom's recent retrenchment in the area of climate change policy, and the ways in which its policy community have responded. We identify two broad strategies based on polycentric principles: ‘working with gatekeepers’ to unlock political capital and ‘collaborate to innovate’ to develop policy outputs. We then empirically examine the advantages that these actions bring, analysing coordination across overlapping sites of authority, such as those associated with international regimes, devolved administrations and civic and private initiatives that operate in conjunction with, and sometimes independently of, the state. Despite constraining political and economic factors, which are by no means unique to the UK, we find that a polycentric climate policy network can create opportunities for overcoming central government blockages. However, we also argue that the ambiguous role of the state in empowering but also in constraining such a network will determine whether a polycentric approach to climate policy and governance is genuinely additional and innovative, or whether it is merely a temporary ‘sticking plaster’ for the retreat of the state and policy retrenchment during austere times. © 2017 The Authors","Climate policy; Nation state; Policy innovation; Polycentric governance","climate change; empirical analysis; environmental policy; governance approach; nation state; national planning; policy development; public-private partnership; questionnaire survey; spatiotemporal analysis; stakeholder; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030547699

In this study, we developed a new parameterization scheme to characterize allocation of the assimilated carbon to plant parts, including leaves and fine roots. The amount of carbon allocation in this scheme depends on the climatological net primary production (NPP) of the plants. The newly developed scheme is implemented in the augmented Noah land surface model with multiple parameterization options (Noah-MP) along with other biophysical processes related to variations in photosynthetic capacity. The scheme and the augmented biophysical processes are evaluated against tower measurements of vegetation from four forest sites in various regions—two for the deciduous broadleaf and two for the needleleaf evergreen forest. Results from the augmented Noah-MP showed good agreement with the observations and demonstrated improvements in representing the seasonality of leaf area index (LAI), gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and latent heat flux. In particular, significant improvements are found in simulating amplitudes and phase shift timing in the LAI seasonal cycle, and the amount of GPP and ER in the growing season. Furthermore, the augmented Noah-MP performed reasonably well in simulating the spatial distributions of LAI, GPP, and NPP in East Asia, consistent with the satellite observations. © 2017.

To meet carbon emission reduction targets, however, it is necessary to keep the number of buildings exempt from energy efficiency improvements to a minimum. The need to preserve the aesthetic and structural qualities of historic buildings makes energy retrofit complicated and costly but these arguments should not be used to resist change. The research presented in this paper investigates how conservation professionals in the UK approach and sanction energy retrofit measures in historic buildings. It provides an overview of the current UK legislation and guidance relating to energy efficiency in heritage buildings and presents findings from a study focused on the approach of conservation professionals to retrofit slim profile double glazing (SPDG). It finds that there is regional variation to energy retrofit in historic buildings between Scotland and the rest of the UK, and that individual conservation professionals hold different views on the use of SPDG, which leads to inconsistencies in its application. Recommendations are made for a more consistent approach to window upgrade as a means of improving the energy efficiency and comfort of historic buildings and for greater interdisciplinary cooperation to align conservation of energy with conservation of heritage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation; Energy efficiency; Historic buildings; Retrofit; Slim profile double glazing; Windows","Air navigation; Buildings; Carbon; Conservation; Emission control; Glazes; Historic preservation; Retrofitting; Windows; Carbon emission reductions; Conservation of energy; Double glazings; Efficiency requirements; Energy efficiency improvements; Historic buildings; Interdisciplinary cooperations; Retrofit; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020260449

This paper addresses the design of a new DC Fast Charging Station (DCFCS) for EVs coupled with a local Battery Energy Storage (BES) by using the IEC 15118, which provides a communication interface among different actors. DCFCS is equipped with a bidirectional AC/DC converter for feeding power back to the grid, two lithium batteries and a DC/DC converter. The proposed solution decreases the charging time of EVs and facilitates the integration of fast chargers in existing low voltage (LV) grids.

Studies on climate change and gender links with climate change have initially and by necessity been somewhat speculative in nature. While all societies are affected by climate change, the impacts also vary by location, exposure, and context specific social characteristics, identity, power relations and political economy. This draws attention to recognition of difference and sameness and the way in which common, confusing, contradictory results emerge across and within terrains. In its concern for gender-blindness, this paper specifically considers the way in which climate variability impacts on men and women in a given locale and captures the enriched narratives and voices of both rural women and men in two selected villages in Lambani, Limpopo Province, South Africa. To build women's participation in national climate change adaptation planning and to take heed of the multiple entanglements around this topic, participatory processes are required that enable diverse groups of disadvantaged women's as well as men's voices to be heard by policy-makers. We use participatory action research (PAR) to capture people's emotions and perceptions around climate change. In our context, difference is not positioned as the opposition to sameness. It is also incorporated into the self as difference within and is seen as a means of becoming. We consider climatic impacts to be moments where the human and non-human rub up against each other and where human affect becomes tangible. Here our attention to affect is twofold. Not only does it allow for a more realistic reflection of entanglements with nature but also we see affect as being more than emotion as it is a dynamic opening up to possibilities that can effectuate change. © 2017 Institute for Human Geography.","climate change; diffraction; emoticons; entanglements; gender; Limpopo Province; participatory action research",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106519467

Taking Boston as an illustrative Northeast U.S. city, we developed a novel method to estimate sub-urban, food-borne carbon and land footprints using multiregion-input-output modeling and nutritional surveys. Computer simulations utilizing primary data explored UF's ability to reduce these footprints using select farming technologies, building on previous city-scale UF assessments which have hitherto been dependent on proxy data for UF. We found that UF generated meagre food-related carbon footprint reductions (1.1-2.9% of baseline 2211 kg CO2 equivalents/capita/annum) and land occupation increases (&lt;1% of baseline 9000 m2 land occupation/capita/annum) under optimal production scenarios, informing future evidence-based urban design and policy crafting in the region. Notwithstanding UF's marginal environmental gains, UF could help Boston meet national nutritional guidelines for vegetable intake, generate an estimated $160 million U.S. in revenue to growers and act as a pedagogical and community building tool, though these benefits would hinge on large-scale UF proliferation, likely undergirded by environmental remediation of marginal lands in the city. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon footprint; Environmental impact; Food supply; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Carbon emissions; Carbon footprint reductions; Community buildings; Environmental remediation; Food consumption; Multi-region input-output models; Optimal production; Urban sustainability; Urban transportation; agricultural technology; carbon footprint; emission control; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; farming system; input-output analysis; sustainability; urban area; urban design; agricultural worker; Article; carbon footprint; computer simulation; economic aspect; ecosystem restoration; environmental impact; environmental policy; environmental sustainability; food contamination; food industry; food intake; geographic distribution; human; land use; Massachusetts; nutritional requirement; nutritional value; occupation; United States; urban area; vegetable; agriculture; city; United States; Boston; Massachusetts; United States; Agriculture; Boston; Carbon Footprint; Cities; New England",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024402101

The average annual precipitation, average anneal temperature and evapotranspiration are the important indexes to weigh the climate change. In this paper, the annual precipitation, annual average temperature and evapotranspiration data of every pixel point in Central Asia are analyzed by using long-time series remote sensing data to analyze the trend of warm and humid conditions. Finally, using the model to analyzed the distribution of warm-dry trend, the warm-wet trend, the cold-dry trend and the cold-wet trend in Central Asia and Xinjiang area. The results showed that most of the regions of Central Asia were warm-humid and warm-dry trends, but only a small number of regions showed warm-dry and cold-dry trends.

Buildings are one of the largest consumers of primary energy and attaining their efficiency is, therefore, an important goal. The Internet of Things currently provides vast amounts of data that can be used to extract knowledge of all kinds, including that regarding energy prediction. This has motivated us to test wether the prior information on the physics of building heat transfer, that is currently available is now redundant owing to the completeness of the data from the system. We propose a machine learning approach and a grey-box model approach with which to test this hypothesis. The former is blind to the physiscs of the problem, while the latter is greatly influenced by it. The energy consumption prediction models were created with both approaches and then used to estimate energy consumption in a normal operation state and compare it with energy consumption when an energy efficiency campaign is run. Our black-box method, which is based on a combination of statistical and machine learning models and on a time series structurization of the data, shows better prediction accuracy than the so-called grey-box methods that include basic physical equations. This shows that also a data driven approach outperforms more informed methods in this, like other fields. © 2017 IEEE.","black-box models; data analytics; data-driven models; grey-box models; smart buildings","Big data; Data Analytics; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heat transfer; Intelligent buildings; Machine learning; Black-box model; Data-driven approach; Data-driven model; Energy consumption prediction; Grey-box models; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning models; Prediction accuracy; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047765252

Establishing how to best characterize these paleoclimate records is thus critical for understanding the evolution of past planetary climates. Here, we present an ~40 k.y. lake sediment record from Lake Towuti, Indonesia, developed using visible to near-infrared (VNIR) reflectance spectroscopy. Source sediment from the main river input to Lake Towuti, the Mahalona River, is spectrally dominated by Mg-rich serpentine; however, we also identify a distinct Al-phyllosilicate component, which we interpret as kaolinite, that increases in relative proportion to serpentine with decreasing grain size. Sink sediment from two cores collected at the distal margins of the Mahalona River delta has similar spectral signatures to the input source sediment. The cores capture systematic variations in the proportion of Alphyllosilicate to serpentine over time, which is also expressed in changes in bulk elemental chemistry of the sediment. We show that the abundance of serpentine relative to Al-phyllosilicate increases dramatically during the globally cooler, regionally drier climate of the Last Glacial Maximum. This change records the grain size-dependent mineralogy of deltaic sediment, which is ultimately driven by forced delta progradation and river incision during lake lowstands. Our analyses show that VNIR reflectance spectroscopy offers a rapid, nondestructive, and effective method for developing paleoenvironmental records from sedimentary phyllosilicate mineralogy. Exposed paleolake deposits on Mars should preserve similar paleoenvironmental information that can be accessed through detailed remote sensing observations of stratigraphy and VNIR reflectance spectroscopy in a source-to-sink framework. © 2017 Geological Society of America.",,"Aluminum; Grain size and shape; Infrared devices; Kaolinite; Minerals; Reflection; Remote sensing; Rivers; Sediments; Serpentine; Silicate minerals; Spectroscopy; Stratigraphy; Elemental chemistries; Environmental conditions; Lake-sediment records; Last Glacial Maximum; Paleoclimate reconstruction; Paleoclimate records; Reflectance spectroscopy; Systematic variation; Lakes; clay mineral; lacustrine deposit; lake; Last Glacial Maximum; Mars; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; reflectance; spectroscopy; Greater Sunda Islands; Lake Towuti; Malili Lakes; South Sulawesi; Sulawesi; Sunda Isles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026724974

Building on previous work in low carbon sea transport in the Pacific, this paper further considers the barriers to achieving such transition by assessing, through a ‘post-Paris Agreement’ lens, the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted by PICs and contrasting these to the near total lack of investment and planning for low carbon transition in the transport sector with the parallel occurrence in the electricity sector where ~USD 2 billion of donor investment is deployed or queued despite electricity using only ~20% of fossil fuel across the region. Consistent with recent international studies, inadequate and inappropriate financing and policy have been identified as dominant transition barriers for low carbon sea transport development in PICs. This paper further examines the regional level barriers to policy development, and finds them inhibited by the silo nature of the major regional actors. The implications that the Paris Agreement has for climate financing to support the essential research and capacity development needed to underpin a successful low carbon sea transport transition strategy at any useful scale and speed are also considered in this paper. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"carbon emission; international agreement; investment; maritime transportation; policy development; shipping; transportation planning; transportation policy; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; South Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016039941

Nowadays, colloidal dispersions of MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and other related materials are considered for a wide range of applications, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, energy storage and conversion, sensors for gases, catalysts and catalyst supports, biomedicine, etc. We address various methods developed so far for transferring these materials from bulk to nanoscale thickness, and discuss their stabilization and factors influencing it. Long-time known exfoliation through Li intercalation has received renewed attention in recent years, and is recognized as a method yielding highest dispersed concentrations of single-layer MoS2 and related materials. Latest trends in the intercalation/exfoliation approach include electrochemical lithium intercalation, experimenting with various intercalating agents, multi-step intercalation, etc. On the other hand, direct sonication in solvents is a much simpler technique that allows one to avoid dangerous reagents, long reaction times and purifying steps. The influence of the solvent characteristics on the colloid formation was closely investigated in numerous recent studies. Moreover, it is being recognized that, besides solvent properties, sonication parameters and solvent transformations may affect the process in a crucial way. The latest data on the interaction of MoS2 with solvents evidence that not only solution thermodynamics should be employed to understand the formation and stabilization of such colloids, but also general and organic chemistry. It appears that due to the sonolysis of the solvents and cutting of the MoS2 layers in various directions, the reactive edges of the colloidal nanosheets may bear various functionalities, which participate in their stabilization in the colloidal state. In most cases, direct exfoliation of MQ2 into colloidal nanosheets is conducted in organic solvents, while a small amount of works report low-concentrated colloids in pure water. To improve the dispersion abilities of transition metal dichalcogenides in water, various stabilizers are often introduced into the reaction media, and their interactions with nanosheets play an important role in the stabilization of the dispersions. Surfactants, polymers and biomolecules usually interact with transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets through non-covalent mechanisms, similarly to the cases of graphene and carbon nanotubes. Finally, we survey covalent chemical modification of colloidal MQ2 nanosheets, a special and different approach, consisting in the functionalization of MQ2 surfaces with help of thiol chemistry, interaction with electrophiles, or formation of inorganic coordination complexes. The intentional design of surface chemistry of the nanosheets is a very promising way to control their solubility, compatibility with other moieties and incorporation into hybrid structures. Although the scope of the present review is limited to transition metal dichalcogenides, the dispersion in colloids of other chalcogenides (such as NbS3, VS4, Mo2S3, etc.) in many ways follows similar trends. We conclude the review by discussing current challenges in the area of exfoliation of MoS2 and its related materials. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Colloidal dispersion; Exfoliation; Functionalization; Molybdenum disulfide; Nanosheet; Transition metal dichalcogenide","Catalysts; Chemical modification; Colloids; Coordination reactions; Digital storage; Inorganic compounds; Intercalation; Layered semiconductors; Molybdenum compounds; Nanosheets; Optoelectronic devices; Phase transitions; Selenium compounds; Solvents; Stabilization; Sulfur compounds; Surface chemistry; Thermodynamics; Tungsten compounds; Yarn; Colloidal dispersion; Exfoliation; Functionalizations; Molybdenum disulfide; Transition metal dichalcogenides; Transition metals",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018948811

Here, we present a diagnostics package, implemented in the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy), which keeps track of the contribution of source categories (mainly emission sectors) to various concentrations. The diagnostics package is implemented as a submodel (TAGGING) of EMAC (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts - Hamburg (ECHAM)/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry). It determines the contributions of 10 different source categories to the concentration of ozone, nitrogen oxides, peroxyacytyl nitrate, carbon monoxide, non-methane hydrocarbons, hydroxyl, and hydroperoxyl radicals ( Combining double low line tagged tracers). The source categories are mainly emission sectors and some other sources for completeness. As emission sectors, road traffic, shipping, air traffic, anthropogenic non-traffic, biogenic, biomass burning, and lightning are considered. The submodel obtains information on the chemical reaction rates, online emissions, such as lightning, and wash-out rates. It then solves differential equations for the contribution of a source category to each of the seven tracers. This diagnostics package does not feed back to any other part of the model. For the first time, it takes into account chemically competing effects: for example, the competition between NOx, CO, and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) in the production and destruction of ozone. We show that the results are in-line with results from other tagging schemes and provide plausibility checks for concentrations of trace gases, such as OH and HO2, which have not previously been tagged. The budgets of the tagged tracers, i.e. the contribution from individual source categories (mainly emission sectors) to, e.g., ozone, are only marginally sensitive to changes in model resolution, though the level of detail increases. A reduction in road traffic emissions by 5% shows that road traffic global tropospheric ozone is reduced by 4% only, because the net ozone productivity increases. This 4% reduction in road traffic tropospheric ozone corresponds to a reduction in total tropospheric ozone by 0.3%, which is compensated by an increase in tropospheric ozone from other sources by 0.1%, resulting in a reduction in total tropospheric ozone of 0.2%. This compensating effect compares well with previous findings. The computational costs of the TAGGING submodel are low with respect to computing time, but a large number of additional tracers are required. The advantage of the tagging scheme is that in one simulation and at every time step and grid point, information is available on the contribution of different emission sectors to the ozone budget, which then can be further used in upcoming studies to calculate the respective radiative forcing simultaneously. © 2017 Author(s).",,"air quality; air transportation; anthropogenic source; atmospheric modeling; biogenic emission; biomass burning; chemical compound; chemical reaction; climate change; concentration (composition); environmental impact assessment; lightning; radiative forcing; road traffic; shipping; software; source apportionment; tracer; traffic emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022199910

ΔR, which can vary spatially and temporally, is a locality-specific adjustment applied to the global ocean reservoir, R, to further account for the offset between the atmospheric and marine 14C calibration curves. To assess the temporal variability in ΔR, continuous δ18O sampling along the oyster shell hinge provides a seasonal record throughout the oyster's life. This is then used to identify sampling locations for 14C measurements based on calcite precipitated during the Summer (&gt;19 °C) and Fall through Spring (F-Sp, &lt;15 °C) months. The resulting seasonal ΔR values range from −151 ± 46 to +109 ± 55 14C years (260 years) due to changes in the contribution and age of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from marine and freshwater sources in the James River estuary. The F-Sp samples display a larger ΔR range than the Summer samples, as do the shells precipitated during drought conditions (1606–1612) when compared to shells from the remainder of the 17th century. The largest intrashell ΔR variability, 195 14C years, is similarly found in a drought shell and is attributed to variability caused by the extreme regional 1606–1612 drought. Early land use changes related to European development and farming practices also altered the age of DIC in the James River estuary. We estimate that the soil inorganic carbon (SIC) contributing to freshwater DIC ranged from 0 to ∼1800 years old and reflected both the drought and land use changes that occurred during the 17th century. Using only the Summer samples, which represent the majority of shell calcite, we obtain a mean ΔR = −32 ± 11 14C years (1σ) for 17th century James River estuary ΔR at the very onset of European colonization. Employing a seasonally resolved sampling method will provide the greatest constraint on 14C measurements in an estuarine environment where multiple carbon sources can fluctuate on seasonal timescales and as a result of large scale environmental change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Crassostrea virginica; Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); Estuary; Radiocarbon; Reservoir age (ΔR); Sclerochronology","colonization; dissolved inorganic carbon; environmental change; geochronology; paleoenvironment; radiocarbon dating; seasonal variation; seventeenth century; James Estuary; United States; Virginia; Crassostrea virginica; Ostreidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017450526

This control problem is mainly approached by an intensive stationary calibration process and dynamic compensation techniques. However, large differences in combustion conditions between steady state, as used for calibration, and real transient maneuvers, such as tip-ins, can lead to undesired emission peaks. Against this background, the present work adapts a previously introduced input shaping strategy for injection parameters, such that it is applicable in the full engine operation range. Different to the former approach, the shape of the correction profile is determined directly from identified local models of the selected injection parameters to the NOx response. By using local linear models it is possible to consider variations in the system dynamics and parameterize the input shapers in an automated fashion. Additionally this approach can be applied together with a state of the art engine control, since it does not need a change in the base calibration. The improved strategy is evaluated on a passenger car Diesel engine and it is shown that a reduction of the undesired NOx overshoot can be achieved without impacting other performance indicators. © 2017",,"Automobiles; Calibration; Combustion; Computer control systems; Nitrogen oxides; Calibration process; Combustion condition; Dynamic compensation; Engine operations; Injection parameters; Local linear models; Performance indicators; Transient maneuvers; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031779277

In Hawaiʻi, historical reports suggest that many Hawaiian honeycreepers such as the ‘I‘iwi (Drepanis coccinea) once undertook seasonal migrations, but the existence of such movements today is unclear. Because Hawaiian honeycreepers are highly susceptible to avian malaria, currently minimal in high-elevation forests, understanding the degree to which honeycreepers visit lower elevation forests may be critical to predict the current impact of malaria on population dynamics and how susceptible bird populations may respond to climate change and mitigation scenarios. Using radio telemetry data, we demonstrate for the first time that a large fraction of breeding adult and juvenile ‘I‘iwi originating from an upper-elevation (1,920 m) population at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge exhibit post-breeding movements well below the upper elevational limit for mosquitoes. Bloom data suggest seasonal variation in floral resources is the primary driver of seasonal movement for ‘I‘iwi. To understand the demographic implications of such movement, we developed a spatial individual-based model calibrated using previously published and original data. ʻI‘iwi dynamics were simulated backward in time, to estimate population levels in the absence of avian malaria, and forward in time, to assess the impact of climate warming as well as two potential mitigation actions. Even in disease-free ‘refuge’ populations, we found that breeding densities failed to reach the estimated carrying capacity, suggesting the existence of a seasonal “migration load” as a result of travel to disease-prevalent areas. We predict that ‘I‘iwi may be on the verge of extinction in 2100, with the total number of pairs reaching only ~ 0.2–12.3% of the estimated pre-malaria density, based on an optimistic climate change scenario. The probability of extinction of ‘I‘iwi populations, as measured by population estimates for 2100, is strongly related to their estimated migration propensity. Long-term conservation strategies likely will require a multi-pronged response including a reduction of malaria threats, habitat restoration and continued landscape-level access to seasonally variable nectar resources. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America","altitudinal migration; avian malaria; climate change; conservation; demographics; Hawaii; individual-based model; telemetry; ‘I‘iwi","altitude; carrying capacity; climate change; conservation status; demography; habitat restoration; individual-based model; malaria; migration; passerine; population dynamics; population estimation; protected area; seasonal variation; telemetry; Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge; Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; United States; Aves; Coccoidea; Drepanidinae; Drepanis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017344720

Methods 30 patients were randomized (ice: 30 min, n = 15 or cold CO2: 2 min, n = 15 both applied twice at 8 h interval). Contralateral non-treated arthritic knees were used as paired controls (n = 11 and n = 10 respectively). The PDUS semi-quantitative score (0–3) and pain visual analogic scale were evaluated before/after each cold application, 2 min, 2 h, 24 h after the first application. PDUS scores were checked in double-blind by 2 ultrasonographists. Results The inter-class effect size of local cryotherapy on the power Doppler score remained significant the day after treatment in local cryotherapy-treated compared to contralateral non-treated knees (Global difference: −1 [95% confidence interval: −1.23; −0.77]; ice: −0.73 [−1.06; −0.4]; CO2: −0.7 [−1.18; −0.22]). Both techniques significantly and to the same extent reduced the power Doppler score and pain visual analogic scale at all evaluation times and globally throughout the 24 hour-study period. No dropout nor adverse event was reported. In multivariate analysis, the Power Doppler score decrease was associated with pain decrease, while pain decrease was associated with the female sex and ice technique. Conclusion Local ice and cold CO2 applied twice equally reduced synovial Power Doppler activity and pain over 24 h in knee arthritis. These effects remained significant the day after treatment.

The system was initiated at the highest levels within the government, but the fast-tracked nature of the implementation process did not provide sufficient notification to the donor community to mobilize much-needed technical support until the pilot phase had been completed. Implementation of a fully operational system was postponed until 2018 due to industry mobilization against the system and unresolved legal and technical issues.

Using both top-down and bottom-up approaches and scenarios, we examine building energy use for heating and cooling. Globally, the energy use for heating and cooling by the middle of the century will be between 45 and 59 exajoules per year (corresponding to an increase of 7–40% since 2010). Most of this variability is due to the uncertainty in future urban densities of rapidly growing cities in Asia and particularly China. Dense urban development leads to less urban energy use overall. Waiting to retrofit the existing built environment until markets are ready in about 5 years to widely deploy the most advanced renovation technologies leads to more savings in building energy use. Potential for savings in energy use is greatest in China when coupled with efficiency gains. Advanced efficiency makes the least difference compared with the business-as-usual scenario in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa but significantly contributes to energy savings in North America and Europe. Systemic efforts that focus on both urban form, of which urban density is an indicator, and energy-efficient technologies, but that also account for potential co-benefits and trade-offs with human well-being can contribute to both local and global sustainability. Particularly in growing cities in the developing world, such efforts can improve the well-being of billions of urban residents and contribute to mitigating climate change by reducing energy use in urban areas. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

Herein, the effects of doped Pd, Ru, and Cu on the adsorption, activation, and reduction selectivity of CO2 on CeO2(111) were investigated by periodic density functional theory. The doped metals distorted the configuration of a perfect CeO2(111) by weakening the adjacent Ce-O bond strength, and Pd doping was beneficial for generating a highly active O vacancy. The analyses of adsorption energy, charge density difference, and density of states confirmed that the doped metals were conducive for enhancing CO2 adsorption, especially for Cu/CeO2(111).

For the application of SF6/N2 gas mixtures in power equipment, this paper studied on the breakdown characteristics of SF6/N2 gas mixtures with low SF6 mixing ratio in different electric field non-uniformity under power frequency voltage, and the characteristic of partial discharge initial voltage was studied in non-uniform electric field. In order to study the breakdown characteristic of SF6/N2 gas mixtures under high voltage grade, a fully enclosed power frequency voltage test device was set up. The sphere-plane and rod-plane electrodes were used to simulate the slightly non-uniform field and local-field enhancement in GIS or GIL. The research indicates that the breakdown voltage of SF6/N2 gas mixtures increases linearly with increase of gas pressure in slightly non-uniform electric field. With the increase of the electric field non-uniformity, the linearity of breakdown voltage weakens and the stable corona discharge appears. Because of the space charge effect, the N-curve characteristic of breakdown voltage appears in SF6 and its mixtures. When electric field non-uniformity exceeds a certain value, the stable corona discharge appears before the electric breakdown of electrodes gap. But the breakdown occurs immediately with the appearance of corona when the gas pressure exceeds a certain value. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect was strengthened and then weakened. And the amplitude and range of N-curve extend when electric field non-uniformity increased. © 2017 IEEE.","electric field non-uniformity; gas mixtures; N-curve characteristic; partial discharge inception voltage; power frequency voltage; SF6/N2; synergistic effect","Curve fitting; Electric breakdown; Electric corona; Electric discharges; Electric field effects; Electric fields; Electrodes; Electronic equipment testing; Gas mixtures; Insulation; Mixing; Partial discharges; SF6 insulation; Sulfur hexafluoride; Electric field non uniformities; Partial discharge inception voltage; Power frequency voltage; SF6/N2; Synergistic effect; Gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030222226

The results show that the estimated energy consumption and carbon emissions for CLT buildings are 9.9% and 13.2% lower than those of RC buildings in view of life-cycle assessment. This indicates that the CLT construction system has good potential for energy saving when compared to RC in the severe cold region of China. The energy efficiency of residential buildings is closely related to the height for both RC and CLT buildings.

The developed ITRM incorporates interval-parameter programming (IPP) and two-stage stochastic programming (TSP) within a robust optimization (RO) framework to deal with uncertainties presented as both probabilities and intervals and to reflect economic penalties as corrective measures or recourse against any infeasibilities arising due to a particular realization of an uncertain event. Compared with the traditional TSP, ITRM can effectively reflect the risk generated by stochastic programming process and enhance the robustness of the model, such that it is suitable for risk-aversive planners under high-variability conditions. The ITRM is applied to a case of carbon sink trading of Zhangjiakou and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission planning under uncertainty.

This paper presents an integrated model for reliable estimation of passenger transport emissions of local pollutants and CO2 using an integrated Land-Use and Transport Interaction (LUTI) model in Bogota (Colombia) between 2010 and 2026. Two additional scenarios are modelled to illustrate the use of the model to evaluate the impacts of possible policy interventions. An alternative system dynamics approach is proposed as part of a structured decision-making process. The methodology uses causal loop diagrams (CLD) from systems dynamics to explain cause-and-effect relations, through linking the transport emissions and transport subsystems. The emissions model considers 11 different vehicle categories in total and emission factors for CO2, NOx, THC and PM2.5 were established using local data collected with portable devices and from other available secondary sources. Adjustment factors were established in order to account for ageing of vehicles, technology improvements and changes in category distributions. The development of a general framework based on dynamic systems for assessing long-term emissions estimations according with the particular transport systems is needed for effective sustainable transport planning. The inclusion of adjustment factors for ageing and technology changes provides more reliable projections and helps identify important long-term trends in the emissions inventory. The scenarios proposed are meant to show the results obtained by the model to assist the decision-making process and do not represent current measures in the city or the best practices available. Due to an increase in the use of the private car transport, CO2 emissions will continue to grow in Bogota despite possible technology improvements. Results show that the use of natural gas in the public transport fleet would imply considerable emission reductions in all studied species, being this an alternative technology while electric buses become financially viable. © 2016 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.","compressed natural gas; Developing countries; electric buses; integrated urban models; long-term trends; technology change; transport modelling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963568250

This article proposes a policy framework that integrates the three, deploying personal carbon trading as a key element within a policy portfolio to reduce personal carbon footprints. It draws on policy and human motivation literatures that address the behavioural changes that may be needed in the context of a long-term threat such as climate change. This proposal builds on an analysis of the British Columbia carbon tax, international examples of carbon pricing instruments and strategies for behavioural change such as social networks, loyalty management, mobile apps and gamification. Interviews were conducted with experts in financial services, energy conservation and clean technology, as well as with specialists in climate, health and taxation policy. Their input, together with a review of the theoretical literature and practical case studies, informed the proposed design of a Carbon, Health and Saving System for promoting individual engagement and collective action by linking long-term climate mitigation measures with short-term personal and social goals, including health, recreation and social reinforcement. Policy Relevance This article identifies areas for climate policy innovation and recommends policies that can support, promote and enable personal carbon budgeting and collective action. Although this study is focused on British Columbia, both the input provided by key opinion leaders and the proposed framework are applicable to other jurisdictions. This policy proposal shows how personal carbon trading could work in the context of a Canadian province with an existing climate mitigation policy. It also specifies a minimum viable product approach to establishing the economic, social and technological foundations for personal carbon trading. The Carbon, Health and Saving System identifies the technologies and stakeholders needed to implement personal carbon trading, and offers the possibility of motivating a widespread conscious human response in the event that carbon taxation proves insufficient to generate economic adaptation in a changing climate. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Behavioural change; behavioural economics; carbon pricing; carbon tax; gamification; personal carbon trading","adaptive management; behavioral response; carbon emission; climate change; collective action; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental policy; health impact; pollution tax; savings; socioeconomic impact; British Columbia; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961211301

In addition, particulate air pollution has been classified as Group 1 carcinogen by international agency for research on cancer (IARC) in 2013. Objectives: The aim of this study was to quantify the number of gender-specific lung cancer deaths due to exposure to PM2.5 among individuals aged over 30 years using WHO AirQ+ model in 10 cities of Iran during March 2013-March 2016. Methods: Hourly concentrations of PM2.5 were obtained from department of environment (DOE) of Iran and Tehran air quality control company (TAQCC). Demographic information and baseline incidence (BI) were acquired from statistical center of Iran, ministry of health and medical education, respectively. AirQ+ model was used to quantify the lung cancer deaths among males and females aged over 30 years. Results: The highest lung cancer deaths were in Tehran with approximately 407 cases of death during the whole three-year period. The total deathsamongmenandwomenin the whole period were 433 and 431 cases, respectively. Thesumof lung cancer deaths due to PM2.5 exposure in all the 10 cities during these 3 years were estimated 864 cases. In addition, the attributable proportion of lung cancer due to PM2.5 exposure in each city was estimated. Despite the high number of lung cancer deaths in Tehran, higher AP values were observed in cities such as Isfahan, Ahvaz, Khoram Abad and Arak, reflecting the higher risk of death per unit of population. Conclusions: The results of this study could be used by authorities for making air pollution reduction strategies and plans.

For example, the dollar value of carbon dioxide emissions due to anthropogenic climate damages, known as the social cost of carbon dioxide (SC-CO2), can be computed via the widely used DICE (Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy) IAM by solving an open-loop optimal control problem. The results of such an open-loop decision-making strategy, however, do not fully reflect the impacts of uncertainty in the dynamic response of the global climatic system to radiative forcing. In this paper, we propose an implementation of the DICE IAM based on model predictive control (MPC). This MPC-based approach draws a clear distinction between the climate model used by DICE for mitigation planning purposes, and the “true” global climate herein captured by a low-order emulation of a model drawn from a state-of-the-art climate model ensemble (CMIP5, the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project). The closed-loop control methodology in this paper thereby quantifies the impact of parametric climate model uncertainty (plant-model mismatch) on estimates of the SC-CO2 obtained from DICE. © 2017","Climate change; Control in economics; Economic models","Atmospheric radiation; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Decision making; Economics; Global warming; Model predictive control; Optimal control systems; Predictive control systems; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon dioxide emissions; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Decision-making strategies; Economic models; Integrated assessment models; Open loop optimal control; Parametric uncertainties; Plant model mismatches; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031805790

Small and medium forest enterprises (SMFEs) can contribute towards the achievement of REDD+ goals through conservation, sustainable use of forests, and enhancement of carbon stocks, while simultaneously improving local livelihoods and contributing to local economies. Thus, the promotion of SMFEs can be thought of as an important component of a nation’s REDD+ strategy. This study assesses the degree to which enabling environments for SMFEs are being promoted in countries that are in the midst of becoming REDD-ready. It uses an analytical framework, developed from a literature review on small-scale forestry-enabling environments, to conduct a qualitative content analysis of REDD-readiness documents that 41 countries have submitted to multi-lateral funders and assess the degree to which enabling environments for small-scale forest enterprises are being promoted under the auspices of REDD+. Despite a general recognition of the importance of SMFEs in REDD+ schemes, most countries failed to propose strategies and actions for improving enabling environments, particularly with respect to internal business capacities. Priority areas for investment of REDD-readiness funds that will deliver returns for both carbon and livelihoods through SMFEs are identified and enumerated. Policy relevance Small and medium forest enterprises (SMFEs)–with their potential to bring about high returns in terms of livelihoods, forest management, and climate change mitigation when compared to alternative forest uses–represent a potentially formidable tool for successful REDD+ implementation. By uncovering gaps in countries’ REDD-readiness with regards to SMFEs, results from this work can be used to design appropriate climate policies that will foment pro-poor REDD+ implementation that creates appropriate enabling environments for SMFEs to thrive. Doing so will not only reduce emissions, but it will also deliver substantial co-benefits. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","community forestry; enabling environments; REDD+; REDD+-readiness; small-scale forestry; SMFEs","climate change; community forestry; environmental policy; forest management; livelihood; small and medium-sized enterprise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974726316

Climate change will likely affect the ability of these lands to provide ecosystem services. We describe 2 efforts to assess climate change vulnerabilities and develop adaptation options on federal lands in the Rocky Mountains. We specifically focus on aspects that affect community economic security and livelihood security, including water quality and quantity, timber, livestock grazing, and recreation. Headwaters of the Rocky Mountains serve as the primary source of water for large populations, and these headwaters are located primarily on public land. Thus, federal agencies will play a key role in helping to protect water quantity and quality by promoting watershed function and water conservation. Although increased temperatures and atmospheric concentration of CO2 have the potential to increase timber and forage production in the Rocky Mountains, those gains may be offset by wildfires, droughts, insect outbreaks, non-native species, and altered species composition. Our assessment identified ways in which federal land managers can help sustain forest and range productivity, primarily by increasing ecosystem resilience and minimizing current stressors, such as invasive species. Climate change will likely increase recreation participation. However, recreation managers will need more flexibility to adjust practices, provide recreation opportunities, and sustain economic benefits to communities. Federal agencies are now transitioning from the planning phase of climate change adaptation to implementation to ensure that ecosystem services will continue to be provided from federal lands in a changing climate. © 2017 Halofsky et al.

China is planning to launch a multi-functional atmospheric observation satellite equipped with a CO2-IPDA (integrated path differential absorption Lidar) to measure columnar concentrations of atmospheric CO2 globally. As space and power are limited on the satellite, compromises have been made to accommodate other passive sensors. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity of the system's retrieval accuracy and precision to some critical parameters to determine whether the current configuration is adequate to obtain the desired results and whether any further compromises are possible. We then mapped the distribution of random errors across China and surrounding regions using pseudo-observations to explore the performance of the planned CO2-IPDA over these regions. We found that random errors of less than 0.3% can be expected for most regions of our study area, which will allow the provision of valuable data that will help researchers gain a deeper insight into carbon cycle processes and accurately estimate carbon uptake and emissions. However, in the areas where major anthropogenic carbon sources are located, and in coastal seas, random errors as high as 0.5% are predicted. This is predominantly due to the high concentrations of aerosols, which cause serious attenuation of returned signals. Novel retrieving methods must, therefore, be developed in the future to suppress interference from low surface reflectance and high aerosol loading. © 2017 by the authors.","Atmospheric CO2; IPDA; Performance evaluation; Remote sensing satellite","Aerosols; Atmospheric aerosols; Carbon dioxide; Errors; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space optics; Anthropogenic carbon; Atmospheric observations; Carbon cycle process; Current configuration; Differential absorption lidars; IPDA; Performance evaluation; Remote sensing satellites; Random errors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028310741

It is positive for oilfield development, such as enhancing oil saturation and formation pressure energy. According to the study object, previous relevant works can be divided into two types: CO2-crude oil system and hydrocarbon component-CO2 system. However, neither of them answered the following question: Which is the key or advantageous hydrocarbon for crude oil swelling due to CO2 dissolution? Based on composition analysis of crude oil from five representative oil regions in China, this paper selected eleven hydrocarbons, which had carbon numbers from six to sixteen and molecular structures of chain, cycloalkane with single or double rings, and benzene ring with single or double rings. The eleven hydrocarbons had combined with different molar fractions of CO2 into oil-gas systems for CCE (constant component expansion) experiments. And then system volume at different temperature and pressure condition had been studied. From the experiment's results, the CO2 dissolution in the hydrocarbons could swell the system volume to various degrees. The swelling factor was defined to describe the degree of hydrocarbon volume swelling. By summarizing how the hydrocarbon affects the volume expansion degree, the concept of hydrocarbon molar density was proposed. It turned out that hydrocarbon molar density had a strict linear relationship with the swelling factor. The larger the hydrocarbon molar density, the larger the swelling factor was, while hydrocarbon molar density depended on the molecular structure. Based on further research and analysis, it was proposed that advantageous hydrocarbons for crude oil-CO2 system swelling were low carbon numbers and ring structure hydrocarbons, which have small percentages in crude oil, rather than those n-alkanes. At the same time, the rule of hydrocarbon swelling as a result of CO2 dissolution was summarized and revealed. It is the first time the concept of hydrocarbon molar density has been proposed and the regulation of hydrocarbon swelling with it explained. On this basis, advantageous hydrocarbons of crude oil-CO2 system swelling are announced. The research results will be helpful to predict swelling degree because of CO2 dissolution for a given composition crude oil. Therefore, it has a theoretical significance and application value for CO2 EOR technology. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Carbon Dioxide; CCE Experiment; Key Hydrocarbons; Molar density; Volume Expansion","Carbon dioxide; Dissolution; Molecular structure; Oil field development; Paraffins; Petroleum analysis; Swelling; Composition analysis; Constant components; Hydrocarbon components; Linear relationships; Molar density; Research and analysis; Temperature and pressures; Volume expansion; Crude oil",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050609471

Their changes during the middle and the end of the 21st century were also projected. The evaluations show that the RegCM4 downscaling simulations can generally capture the observed features of the AEC and WVD distributions over the period 1986-2005. The projections indicate that the annual AEC tends to decrease and the annual WVDs tend to increase over almost the whole country except central China, concurrent with greater change by the late 21st century than by the middle of the 21st century. It suggests that annual haze pollution potential would be enlarged under the RCP4.5 scenario compared to the present. For seasonal change in the four main economic zones of China, it is projected consistently that there would be a higher probability of haze pollution risk over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region in winter and over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in spring and summer in the context of the warming scenario. Over Northeast China (NEC), future climate change might reduce the AEC or increase the WVDs throughout the whole year, which favours the occurrence of haze pollution and thus the haze pollution risk would be aggravated. The relative contribution of different components related to the AEC change further indicates that changes in the boundary layer depth and the wind speed play leading roles in the AEC change over the BTH and NEC regions. In addition to those two factors, the precipitation change also exerts important impacts on the AEC change over the YRD and PRD zones. © 2017 Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028617688

We characterized biogenic influence on urban C cycling throughout Massachusetts, USA using an ecosystem model that integrates improved representation of urban vegetation, growing conditions associated with urban heat island (UHI), and altered urban phenology. Boston's biomass density is 1/4 that of rural forests, however 87% of Massachusetts’ urban landscape is vegetated. Model results suggest that, kilogram-for-kilogram, urban vegetation cycles C twice as fast as rural forests. Urban vegetation releases (RE) and absorbs (GEE) the equivalent of 11 and 14%, respectively, of anthropogenic emissions in the most urban portions of the state. While urban vegetation in Massachusetts fully sequesters anthropogenic emissions from smaller cities in the region, Boston's UHI reduces annual C storage by &gt; 20% such that vegetation offsets only 2% of anthropogenic emissions. Asynchrony between temporal patterns of biogenic and anthropogenic C fluxes further constrains the emissions mitigation potential of urban vegetation.

Dryland farming systems have been developed across 20 million ha in a zone with 300–600 mm y−1 annual rainfall and a Mediterranean climate. This zone is beset with land degradation problems, such as salinity and wind erosion, and there has been considerable effort in the last three decades to develop reforestation options to stabilise the landscapes. Traditional forestry approaches using pulp wood or sawlog production in this zone have been limited by unfavourable economics driven by modest tree growth rates, large transport costs to processing and export facilities, and high labour costs. Given that salinity results from a disruption of the landscape water balance, reforestation has represented a major component in attempts to tackle the problem. Issues with reforestation include (1) obtaining sufficient scale of activity to impact watershed water balances, (2) obtaining a hydrological response without displacing farm production and rural communities and (3) gaining payment for non-forest benefits. This paper reviews the approaches that have been used to integrate trees into the dryland farming (300–600 mm y−1 annual rainfall) systems of south-western Australia, and have resulted in at least 113 286 ha of reforestation. These included both traditional (pine and eucalypt sawlogs) and new (sandalwood, biodiversity restoration and carbon mitigation through bioenergy and carbon sequestration) projects. Ongoing investment has centred on carbon sequestration as this represents one of the few profitable options for the management of dryland salinity in this region. Approaches developed in this region to encourage farmland reforestation will be applicable in other dryland regions, particularly with the interest in using the land-sector to meet climate mitigation targets. © 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd.","agroforestry; biomass; carbon mitigation; carbon sequestration; desertification; dryland agriculture; salinisation; soil carbon",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016116304

Here we examine how climate change to 2040 influences pasture growth rates, grazed pasture harvested (PH) and profitability of three case study (baseline) farms in southern Australia. We applied ‘development options’ (or adaptations) to baseline farms in each region that either intensified, simplified or modified the seasonal distribution of feed supply (Intensify, Simplify or Adapt, respectively) by manipulating several components of the farm system simultaneously, including herd size, liveweight and farm assets. In general, climate change reduced annual pasture produced. On dryland farms, hotter, drier conditions reduced growing durations through later autumn breaks and earlier finishes to spring growth, although winter growth rates were enhanced. On irrigated farms, the magnitude and inter-annual variability of PH was less influenced by climate change. Overall, climate change reduced milk production and income, and increased costs due to additional fodder conservation and more purchased feed. Current climate variability caused far greater inter-annual variation in PH and profit compared with the long-term impacts of climate change. This suggests that farm outcomes may be improved by tactically managing for short-term climatic variability, rather than by making long-term strategic changes in preparation for climate change. Future work on adapting dairy businesses to climate change should examine development options that help maintain or extend growing season length and/or harness the additional winter growth. Our study indicates that climate change impacts on dairy systems will be regionally-specific; no individual development option was universally effective in reducing pasture losses to climate change across regions and development options, and no option consistently increased or decreased PH across sites. Future adaptation strategies should thus take into account not only local climate variability as well as climate change, but also the existing farming systems already operating at each site. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Drought; Extreme climatic events; Grazing; Heat wave; Rainfall; Representative concentration pathway; Simulation","adaptive management; artificial diet; body mass; climate change; climate variation; dairy farming; drought; extreme event; grazing management; growing season; heat wave; milk production; profitability; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017561405

We therefore provide the Provenancing Using Climate Analogues (PUCA) framework that integrates the principles of the climate-adjusted provenancing strategy with concepts from population genetics (i.e. potential inbreeding in small fragmented populations) as both a research and operational-ready tool to guide the collection of nonlocal seed. We demonstrate the application of PUCA using the Midlands of Tasmania, Australia, a region that is currently undergoing large-scale ecological restoration. We highlight multiple nonlocal seed sources for testing by identifying actual species distribution records that currently occupy environments similar to that projected to occur at the restoration site in the future.

Forty-six local fire years affecting a single site and 16 moderate fire years affecting two or more sites were identified (1600–1900 A.D.). Existing fire history data were incorporated to identify 17 regionally synchronous fire years (fires that affected ≥3 sites). Interannual and multidecadal relationships between fire occurrence and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the Pacific North American (PNA) pattern were examined, in addition to the effects of additive positive phases of ENSO and PDO. We examined multiple reconstructions of ENSO, PDO, and PNA and utilized three methodological approaches to characterize climate-fire relationships. We found that the influence of interannual climate, expressed as PDSI, increasingly synchronized the occurrence of fires when examined from local to regional scales. An association between local fires and positive antecedent moisture conditions suggests moisture-driven fine fuel development and the proximity of some sites to grasslands likely function as key determinants of local-scale fire activity. The relationships between regional fires and ENSO, PDO, and PNA suggest that large-scale patterns of climate variability exert a weak and/or inconsistent influence over fire activity in west central British Columbia between 1700 and 1900 A.D. Although inconsistent among reconstructions of climate patterns, we identified a significant relationship between regional fires and large-scale climate patterns when ENSO and PDO were both in positive phases. ©2017.

In relation to mitigating climate change, the debate has been more recent, with a growing interest from policy makers, academics, and society. Many researchers have highlighted the need for changes to food consumption in order to achieve the required greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. So far, food consumption has not been anchored in climate change policy to the same extent as energy production and usage, nor has it been considered within the context of achieving GHG targets to a level where tangible outputs are available. Here, we address those issues by performing a relatively simple analysis that considers the extent to which one food exchange could contribute to achieving GHG reduction targets in the United States (US). We use the targeted reduction for 2020 as a reference and apply published Life Cycle Assessment data on GHG emissions to beans and beef consumed in the US. We calculate the difference in GHGs resulting from the replacement of beef with beans in terms of both calories and protein. Our results demonstrate that substituting one food for another, beans for beef, could achieve approximately 46 to 74% of the reductions needed to meet the 2020 GHG target for the US. In turn, this shift would free up 42% of US cropland (692,918 km2). While not currently recognized as a climate policy option, the “beans for beef” scenario offers significant climate change mitigation and other environmental benefits, illustrating the high potential of animal to plant food shifts. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"Beef; Food supply; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Meats; Climate change mitigation; Climate change policies; Dietary patterns; Energy productions; Environmental benefits; Food consumption; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Climate change; agricultural land; climate change; environmental policy; food consumption; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; policy making; protein; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019157550

In the electricity sector, a shift from traditionally nuclear and coal-based production towards renewable energies and lower carbon intensive gas power plants can be expected. Additionally, heat production from gas fuels will play a more dominant role. This results in a stronger dependence of the electrical power and heat sector on a reliable and secure operation of the underlying natural gas (NG) provision infrastructure. Growing uncertainties in the electricity and NG systems have in and of themselves been widely analysed. With this paper, we question how uncertainties in power and heat production development compromise the NG supply and thereby endanger energy security. We introduce a NG pipeline model with a detailed grid representation of northeast Germany. We utilise two representative days to model the NG demand differentiated by heat, industry and power sector consumption. Using a cost minimisation approach, we investigate possible congestions in the gas grid to assess if and to what extent NG pipelines can be seen as a crucial bottleneck for future energy security. Our results show the resilience of the NG system during a scenario of a MILD winter day. However, simultaneous NG demand peaks in the heat and power sector in the COLD scenario might lead to congestions in some regions. © 2017 IEEE.","Congestion; Natural gas; Security of supply; Spatial resolution demand","Carbon; Carbonization; Commerce; Energy security; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas fuels; Gases; Natural gas; Pipelines; Power markets; Traffic congestion; Uncertainty analysis; Congestion; Electricity sector; Natural gas networks; Natural gas systems; Renewable energies; Representative days; Security of supply; Spatial resolution; Gas plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027132682

In this study, we analyzed the spatial features of the trend changes of temperature during the growing season and the response of vegetation growth in China based on observed climatic data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 1984 to 2011. An obvious warming to cooling shift during growing season from the period 1984–1997 to the period 1998–2011 was identified in the northern and northeastern regions of China, whereas a totally converse shift was observed in the southern and western regions, suggesting large spatial heterogeneity of changes of the trend of growing season temperature throughout China. China as a whole, a significant positive relationship between vegetation growth and temperature during 1984 to 1997 has been greatly weakened during 1998–2011. This change of response of vegetation growth to temperature has also been confirmed by Granger causality test. On regional scales, obvious shifts in relationship between vegetation growth and temperature were identified in temperate desert region and rainforest region.

First, overall, within the sample time period, a 1% increase in LGI inhibits carbon emissions by 0.8906% and 0.5851% through its influence on the industrial structure and energy efficiency, respectively, with the industrial structure path playing a greater role than the efficiency path. Second, carbon emissions to some extent exhibit inertia. The previous year’s carbon emissions impact the following year’s carbon emissions by 0.5375%. Thus, if a reduction in carbon emissions in the previous year has a positive effect, then the carbon emissions reduction effect generated by LGI in the following year will be magnified. Third, LGI can effectively reduce carbon emissions, but there are significant regional differences in its impact. For example, in some provinces, such as Sichuan and Anhui, economic growth has not been decoupled from carbon emissions. Fourth, the carbon emissions reduction effect in the 30 provinces and municipalities sampled in this study can be classified into five categories—strong, relatively strong, medium, relatively weak and weak—based on the degree of local governments’ regulation of carbon emissions. The carbon emissions reduction effect of LGI is significant in the western and central regions of China but not in the eastern and northeast regions. This study helps overcome the limitations of previous studies on the regulatory effects of LGI on carbon emissions, and the constructed model may more closely reflect actual economic conditions. Moreover, the current study can benefit countries similar to China that aim to objectively identify the impacts of their LGI on carbon emissions, and such countries can use it as a reference in the formulation of investment policies based on their economic and industrial characteristics. © 2017 He et al.

Moreover, the quantitative inversion algorithm model was established, especially the correlation analysis and temperature correction function were optimized. The ammonia volatilization experiment was carried out in the demonstration area in Guoyang, Anhui in 2015 by the ammonia regional monitoring system based on Open-path Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (OP-TDLAS). Then, ammonia dynamic volatilization character of corn and wheat straw returning to the field was studied. The monitoring results show that the ammonia concentration has a certain diurnal variation trend: it increased during the daytime and got to the maximum value at midday, then reduced gradually at night to the minimum. The typical hourly concentration varied from 0.6×10-3 to 1.34×10-3 mmol/mol in summer, and it varied from 1.14×10-3 to 1.82×10-3 mmol/mol in autumn. In autumn, the maximum daily average of ammonia volatilization from corn straw returning was 4.6×10-4 mmol/mol, and it was 1.7×10-3 mmol/mol from wheat straw returning in summer. The results indicate that the emission concentration rises significantly after more than one month of straw returning which has some certain seasonal difference in farmland scale.

Accurate temperature calculations for circumstellar disks are particularly important for their chemical evolution. Their temperature distribution is determined by the optical properties of the dust grains, which, among other parameters, depend on their radius. However, in most disk studies, only average optical properties and thus an average temperature is assumed to account for an ensemble of grains with different radii. Aims. We investigate the impact of subdividing the grain radius distribution into multiple sub-intervals on the resulting dust temperature distribution and spectral energy distribution (SED). Methods. The temperature distribution, the relative grain surface below a certain temperature, the freeze-out radius, and the SED were computed for two different scenarios: (1) Radius distribution represented by 16 logarithmically distributed radius intervals, and (2) radius distribution represented by a single grain species with averaged optical properties (reference). Results. Within the considered parameter range, i.e., of grain radii between 5 nm and 1 mm and an optically thin and thick disk with a parameterized density distribution, we obtain the following results: in optically thin disk regions, the temperature spread can be as large as ∼ 63% and the relative grain surface below a certain temperature is lower than in the reference disk. With increasing optical depth, the difference in the midplane temperature and the relative grain surface below a certain temperature decreases. Furthermore, below ∼ 20 K, this fraction is higher for the reference disk than for the case of multiple grain radii, while it shows the opposite behavior for temperatures above this threshold. The thermal emission in the case of multiple grain radii at short wavelengths is stronger than for the reference disk. The freeze-out radius (snowline) is a function of grain radius, spanning a radial range between the coldest and warmest grain species of ∼ 30 AU. © 2017 ESO.","Dust, extinction; Methods: numerical; Protoplanetary disks; Radiative transfer","Dust; Numerical methods; Radiative transfer; Stars; Temperature distribution; Density distributions; Dust , extinction; Methods: numericals; Protoplanetary disks; Spectral energy distribution; Temperature calculation; Temperature decrease; Temperature spreads; Optical properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026468864

The VERT approach is more general than previous ionospheric tomography methods because it can reconstruct the volume emission rate field irrespective of the particular excitation mechanisms (e.g., radiative recombination, photoelectron impact excitation, and energetic particle precipitation in auroras); physical models are then applied to interpret the airglow. The technique was developed and tested using data from the Special Sensor Ultraviolet Limb Imager and Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager instruments aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program F-18 spacecraft and planned for use with upcoming remote sensing missions. The technique incorporates several features to optimize the tomographic solutions, such as the use of a nonnegative algorithm (Richardson-Lucy, RL) that explicitly accounts for the Poisson statistics inherent in optical measurements, capability to include extinction effects due to resonant scattering and absorption of the photons from the lines of sight, a pseudodiffusion-based regularization scheme implemented between iterations of the RL code to produce smoother solutions, and the capability to estimate error bars on the solutions. Tests using simulated atmospheric emissions verify that the technique performs well in a variety of situations, including daytime, nighttime, and even in the challenging terminator regions. Lastly, we consider ionospheric nightglow and validate reconstructions of the nighttime electron density against Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-range Tracking and Identification Radar (ALTAIR) incoherent scatter radar data. ©2017.

The mixing is triggered by the molecular weight inversion created above the hydrogen shell during first dredge-up when helium-3 burns via 3He(3He,2p)4He. The standard 1D diffusive mixing scheme cannot simultaneously match carbon and lithium abundances to NGC 6397 red giants. We investigate two modifications to the standard scheme: (1) an advective two-stream mixing algorithm and (2) modifications to the standard 1D thermohaline mixing formalism. We cannot simultaneously match carbon and lithium abundances using our two-stream mixing approach. However, we develop a modified diffusive scheme with an explicit temperature dependence that can simultaneously fit carbon and lithium abundances to NGC 6397 stars. Our modified diffusive scheme induces mixing that is faster than the standard theory predicts in the hotter part of the thermohaline region and mixing that is slower in the cooler part. Our results infer that the extra mixing mechanism needs further investigation and more observations are required, particularly for stars in different clusters spanning a range in metallicity. © 2017 The Authors.","Stars: abundances; Stars: evolution; Stars: interiors; Stars: low-mass",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051489196

Multiple stakeholders, including policy-makers, industry, and public health professionals, seek to quantify the benefits of regulations on air pollution and public health, a major focus of air pollution accountability research. Two methods, one empirical, the other based on a chemical transport model (CTM), are used to calculate the sensitivities of ozone (O3) and particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) to electricity-generating unit (EGU) and mobile source emissions. Both methods are applied to determine impacts of controls on daily concentrations (which are important in assessing acute health responses to air pollution), accounting for nonlinear, meteorologically, and emission-dependent responses of pollutant concentrations. The statistical method separates contributions of nearby EGU, regional EGU, and mobile source emissions on ambient city-center concentrations. Counterfactual emissions, an estimate of emissions under a scenario where no new controls were implemented on local EGU sources after 1995, regional EGUs after 1997, and mobile sources after 1993, are combined with these sensitivities to estimate counterfactual concentrations that represent what daily air quality in Atlanta, GA would have been had controls not been implemented and other emissions-reducing actions not been taken. Regulatory programs are linked with reduced peak summertime O3, but have had little effect on annual median concentrations at the city-center monitoring site, and led to increases in pollutant levels under less photochemically-active conditions. The empirical method and the CTM method found similar relationships between ozone concentrations and ozone sensitivity to anthropogenic emissions. Compared to the counterfactual between 2010 and 2013, the number of days on which O3 (PM2.5) concentrations exceeded 60 ppb (12.0 μgm−3) was reduced from 396 to 200 (1391 to 222). In 2013, average daily ambient O3 and PM2.5 concentrations were reduced by 1.0 ppb (2 %) and 9.9 μgm−3 (48 %), respectively, and fourth highest maximum daily average 8-h O3 was reduced by 14 ppb. Comparison of model-derived sensitivities to those derived using empirical methods show coherence, but some important differences, such as the O3 concentration where the sensitivity to NOx emissions changes sign. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Accountability; Air pollution modeling; Sensitivity; Statistical modeling","accountability; air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); electricity generation; emission; emission control; ozone; particulate matter; policy making; public health; regulatory approach; sensitivity analysis; stakeholder; statistical analysis; Atlanta; Georgia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014069138

However, contrasting results are often reported on fruit size and composition, a challenge for generalizing the positive impact of this technique. Our research investigated the effect of water deficit (WD) imposed at veraison on Merlot grapevines, during two experimental seasons (2014-2015). In both years WD resulted in reduced carbon assimilation rates and leaf shedding. However, the treatment effect on the analyzed berry parameters varied between seasons. Modification of skin metabolites was more evident in 2015 than in 2014, despite the similar soil water content and water stress physiological parameters (gas exchange, water potential) recorded in the two experimental years. Higher solar radiation and air temperature in 2015 than in 2014 hint for the involvement of atmospheric parameters in fulfilling the potential effect of WD.

However, there is large uncertainty in the projected changes of these extreme events from climate models. In this study, historical biases in models are compared against their future projections to understand and attempt to constrain these uncertainties. Biases in precipitation, near-surface air temperature, evapotranspiration, and a land-atmospheric coupling metric are calculated for 24 models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) against 2 models from phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2) as reference for 1979-2005. These biases are highly correlated across variables, with some models being hotter and drier and others wetter and cooler. Models that overestimate summer precipitation project larger increases in precipitation, evapotranspiration, and land-atmospheric coupling over important agricultural regions by the end of the twenty-first century (2070-99) under RCP8.5, although the percentage variance explained is low. Changes in the characteristics of droughts and heat waves are calculated and linked to historical biases in precipitation and temperature. A method to constrain uncertainty by ranking models based on historical performance is discussed but the rankings differ widely depending on the variable considered. Despite the large uncertainty that remains in the magnitude of the changes, there is consensus among models that droughts and heat waves will increase in multiple regions in the United States by the end of the twenty-first century unless climate mitigation actions are taken. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Atmosphere-land interaction; Climate change; Climate models; Drought; Extreme events; North America","Agriculture; Climate change; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Atmosphere-land interactions; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Electricity generation; Extreme events; Historical performance; Near surface air temperature; North America; North american land data assimilation systems; Climate models; air-soil interaction; climate change; climate modeling; drought; extreme event; heat wave; precipitation (climatology); summer; uncertainty analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025648382

At the same time, some of the measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, so-called climate change mitigation measures, have significant health co-benefits (e.g., walking or cycling more; eating less meat). The goal of limiting global warming to 1,5° Celsius set by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in 2015 can only be reached if all stakeholders, including households, take actions to mitigate climate change. Results on whether framing mitigation measures in terms of their health co-benefits increases the likelihood of their implementation are inconsistent. The present study protocol describes the transdisciplinary project HOPE (HOuseholds' Preferences for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in four European high-income countries) that investigates the role of health co-benefits in households' decision making on climate change mitigation measures in urban households in France, Germany, Norway and Sweden. Methods: HOPE employs a mixed-methods approach combining status-quo carbon footprint assessments, simulations of the reduction of households' carbon footprints, and qualitative in-depth interviews with a subgroup of households. Furthermore, a policy analysis of current household oriented climate policies is conducted. In the simulation of the reduction of households' carbon footprints, half of the households are provided with information on health co-benefits of climate change mitigation measures, the other half is not. Households' willingness to implement the measures is assessed and compared in between-group analyses of variance. Discussion: This is one of the first comprehensive mixed-methods approaches to investigate which mitigation measures households are most willing to implement in order to reach the 1,5° target set by the Paris Agreement, and whether health co-benefits can serve as a motivator for households to implement these measures. The comparison of the empirical data with current climate policies will provide knowledge for tailoring effective climate change mitigation and health policies. © 2017 The Author(s).","Climate change; Health co-benefits; household preferences; Mitigation; Mixed-methods; Policy","analysis of variance; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; decision making; France; Germany; health care policy; high income country; household; human; interview; medical information; Norway; simulation; Sweden; developed country; environmental protection; health behavior; health care policy; health promotion; procedures; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Developed Countries; France; Germany; Health Behavior; Health Policy; Health Promotion; Humans; Norway; Paris; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026545731

Do grass and forb species differ in the degree of intraspecific trait variation?. Location: Managed grasslands in three regions of Germany. Methods: Using a phytometer approach, we raised 20 common European grassland species (ten forbs and ten grasses) and planted them into 54 plots of different land-use types (pasture, meadow, mown pasture). After 1 yr in the field, we measured above- and below-ground plant functional traits. Linear mixed effects models (LMEM) were used to identify the most powerful predictors for every trait. Variation partitioning was applied to assess the amount of inter- and intraspecific trait variation in grasses and forbs explained by environmental conditions (land-use intensity, climate and soil conditions) and plant species diversity of the local neighbourhood. Results: For 12 out of the 14 traits studied, either land-use intensity or local neighbourhood diversity were predictors in the best LMEM. Land-use intensity had considerably stronger effects than neighbourhood diversity. Root dry matter content and root phosphorus concentration of forbs were more affected by land-use intensity than those of grasses. For almost all traits, intraspecific trait variation of grasses was much higher than that of forbs, while traits of forbs varied more among species. Overall, inter- and intraspecific variation was of the same magnitude. Conclusion: The similar magnitude of intra- and interspecific trait variation suggests that both sources should be considered in grassland studies at a scale similar to that of our study. The high amount of intraspecific trait variation that was explained by environmental factors and local neighbourhood diversity clearly demonstrates the high potential of species to adjust to local conditions, which would be ignored when only considering species mean trait values. © 2017 International Association for Vegetation Science","Biodiversity Exploratories; Grassland; Growth form; Intraspecific trait variation; Land-use intensity; Local neighbourhood; Phytometer; Plant functional traits; Root traits; Shannon index; Trait adjustment","biodiversity; climate effect; dry matter; environmental conditions; equipment; functional role; grass; growth rate; herb; intraspecific variation; land use; neighborhood; species diversity; Germany; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018909692

However, there is a gap in our understanding about the carbon dynamics of eucalypt (broadleaf evergreen) forests in temperate climates, which might differ from temperate evergreen coniferous or deciduous broadleaved forests given their fundamental differences in physiology, phenology and growth dynamics. To address this gap we undertook a 3-year study (2010-2012) of eddy covariance measurements in a dry temperate eucalypt forest in southeastern Australia. We determined the annual net carbon balance and investigated the temporal (seasonal and inter-annual) variability in and environmental controls of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). The forest was a large and constant carbon sink throughout the study period, even in winter, with an overall mean NEE of-1234±109 (SE) g Cm-2 yr-1. Estimated annual ER was similar for 2010 and 2011 but decreased in 2012 ranging from 1603 to 1346 g Cm-2 yr-1, whereas GPP showed no significant inter-annual variability, with a mean annual estimate of 2728±39 gCm-2 yr-1. All ecosystem carbon fluxes had a pronounced seasonality, with GPP being greatest during spring and summer and ER being highest during summer, whereas peaks in NEE occurred in early spring and again in summer. High NEE in spring was likely caused by a delayed increase in ER due to low temperatures. A strong seasonal pattern in environmental controls of daytime and night-time NEE was revealed. Daytime NEE was equally explained by incoming solar radiation and air temperature, whereas air temperature was the main environmental driver of night-time NEE. The forest experienced unusual above-average annual rainfall during the first 2 years of this 3-year period so that soil water content remained relatively high and the forest was not water limited. Our results show the potential of temperate eucalypt forests to sequester large amounts of carbon when not water limited. However, further studies using bottom-up approaches are needed to validate measurements from the eddy covariance flux tower and to account for a possible underestimation in ER due to advection fluxes. © Author(s) 2017.

Here we use a spatially representative network of 874 forest plots in New Zealand to examine whether commonly hypothesised drivers of forest biomass and biomass change (diversity, disturbance, nutrients and climate) differ between old-growth and secondary forests at a national scale. We calculate biomass stocks and net biomass change for live above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, deadwood and litter pools. We combine these data with plot-level information on forest type, tree diversity, plant functional traits, climate and disturbance history, and use structural equation models to identify the major drivers of biomass change. Over the period 2002–2014, secondary forest biomass increased by 2.78 (1.68–3.89) Mg ha−1 y−1, whereas no significant change was detected in old-growth forests (+0.28; −0.72 to 1.29 Mg ha−1 y−1). The drivers of biomass and biomass change differed between secondary and old-growth forests. Plot-level biomass change of old-growth forest was driven by recent disturbance (large tree mortality within the last decade), whereas biomass change of secondary forest was determined by current biomass and past anthropogenic disturbance. Climate indirectly affected biomass change through its relationship with past anthropogenic disturbance. Our results highlight the importance of disturbance and disturbance history in determining broad-scale patterns of forest biomass change and suggest that explicitly modelling processes driving biomass change within secondary and old-growth forests is essential for predicting future changes in global forest biomass. © 2016, The Author(s).","carbon; disturbance; diversity; ecosystem function; New Zealand; species composition; temperate forest; UNFCCC","aboveground biomass; anthropogenic effect; belowground biomass; community composition; ecosystem function; environmental disturbance; global change; old-growth forest; secondary forest; species diversity; temperate forest; uncertainty analysis; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; New Zealand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997701242

In western North America, there has been a shift toward earlier spring runoff and more winter precipitation as rain. This raises questions about the need for increased water storage to mitigate both floods and droughts. Some water managers have identified natural storage structures as valuable tools for increasing resiliency to these climate change impacts. However, identifying adequate sites and quantifying the storage potential of natural structures is a key challenge. This study addresses the need for a method for identifying and estimating floodplain water storage capacity in a manner that can be used by water planners through the development of a model that uses open-source geospatial data. This model was used to identify and estimate the storage capacity of a 0.33 km2 floodplain segment in eastern Montana, USA. The result is a range of storage capacities under eight natural water storage conditions, ranging from 900 m3 for small floods to 321,300 m3 for large floods.

The band gap energies and photoluminescence (PL) spectra are tunable over the visible spectral region according to quantum size effects on an atomic scale. The increased carrier lifetime revealed by time-resolved PL spectra, indicates the efficient electron-hole separation and transfer. As expected, the CsPbBr3 QDs with high selectivity of greater than 99 % achieve an efficient yield of 20.9 μmol g−1 towards solar CO2 reduction.

A growing evidence base exists for the ecological value of introducing non-native species, yet urban policy and practice guidance continues to portray non-native species negatively, focusing on their assumed invasiveness. In this context there is a lack of research focusing on the cultural relevance of non-native species in the urban landscape. To address this gap we surveyed 1411 members of the UK public who walked through designed and semi-natural planting of three levels of visual nativeness: “strongly native”; “intermediate” and “strongly non-native”, whilst completing a site-based questionnaire. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were then carried out with 34 questionnaire participants. A majority (57.6%) of our respondents would be happy to see more non-native planting in UK public spaces, rising to 75.3% if it were better adapted to a changing climate than existing vegetation. Respondents recognised the three broad levels of nativeness, yet this was not a factor driving perceptions of the attractiveness of the planting. In addition to climate change, we identified four key factors driving acceptance and rejection of non-native planting: aesthetics; locational context; historic factors and inevitability; and perceptions of invasiveness and incompatability with native wildlife. Our research indicates that in the context of a changing climate, focus should be placed on the potentially positive role of non-invasive, climate-adapted, aesthetically pleasing species within urban planting schemes as these could be well-received by the public. © 2017 The Authors","Aesthetic; Climate change; Cultural relevance; Non-native; Public perception; Species; Urban planting design","Plants (botany); Surveys; Aesthetic; Cultural relevance; Non-native; Public perception; Species; Climate change; climate change; cultural influence; esthetics; greenspace; introduced species; invasiveness; landscape ecology; perception; public space; sustainability; tree planting; urban design; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018491902

A new approach to compare the simulation metric of Arctic SIE between observation and 31 CMIP5 models was established. The approach is based on four factors including the climatological average, linear trend of SIE, span of melting season and annual range of SIE. It is more objective and can be popularized to other comparison of models. Six good models (GFDL-CM3, CESM1-BGC, MPI-ESM-LR, ACCESS-1.0, HadGEM2-CC, and HadGEM2-AO in turn) are found which meet the criterion closely based on above approach. Based on ensemble mean of the six models, we found that the Arctic sea ice will continue declining in each season and firstly drop below 1 million km2 (defined as the ice-free state) in September 2065 under RCP4.5 scenario and in September 2053 under RCP8.5 scenario. We also study the seasonal cycle of the Arctic SIE and find out the duration of Arctic summer (melting season) will increase by about 100 days under RCP4.5 scenario and about 200 days under RCP8.5 scenario relative to current circumstance by the end of the 21st century. Asymmetry of the Arctic SIE seasonal cycle with later freezing in fall and early melting in spring, would be more apparent in the future when the Arctic climate approaches to “tipping point”, or when the ice-free Arctic Ocean appears. Annual range of SIE (seasonal melting ice extent) will increase almost linearly in the near future 30–40 years before the Arctic appears ice-free ocean, indicating the more ice melting in summer, the more ice freezing in winter, which may cause more extreme weather events in both winter and summer in the future years. © 2017, The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","annual range; Arctic sea ice; CMIP5; melting season; seasonal cycle",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020748500

We have investigated whether long-term inhalation exposure to diesel engine exhaust (DEE), a dominant contributor to particulate air pollution in urban environments, can aggravate Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-like effects in female 5X Familial AD (5XFAD) mice and their wild-type female littermates. Following 3 and 13weeks exposures to diluted DEE (0.95mg/m3, 6h/day, 5days/week) or clean air (controls) behaviour tests were performed and amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque formation, pulmonary histopathology and systemic inflammation were evaluated. Results: In a string suspension task, assessing for grip strength and motor coordination, 13weeks exposed 5XFAD mice performed significantly less than the 5XFAD controls. Spatial working memory deficits, assessed by Y-maze and X-maze tasks, were not observed in association with the DEE exposures. Brains of the 3weeks DEE-exposed 5XFAD mice showed significantly higher cortical Aβ plaque load and higher whole brain homogenate Aβ42 levels than the clean air-exposed 5XFAD littermate controls. After the 13weeks exposures, with increasing age and progression of the AD-phenotype of the 5XFAD mice, DEE-related differences in amyloid pathology were no longer present. Immunohistochemical evaluation of lungs of the mice revealed no obvious genetic background-related differences in tissue structure, and the DEE exposure did not cause histopathological changes in the mice of both backgrounds. Luminex analysis of plasma cytokines demonstrated absence of sustained systemic inflammation upon DEE exposure. Conclusions: Inhalation exposure to DEE causes accelerated plaque formation and motor function impairment in 5XFAD transgenic mice. Our study provides further support that the brain is a relevant target for the effects of inhaled DEE and suggests that long-term exposure to this ubiquitous air pollution mixture may promote the development of Alzheimer's disease. © 2017 The Author(s).","5XFAD mice; Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid-β; Behaviour; Diesel engine exhaust; Inhalation; Particulate matter","amyloid beta protein; air pollutant; air quality; Alzheimer disease; amnesia; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight; brain homogenate; controlled study; diesel engine; disease association; exhaust gas; female; grip strength; histopathology; immunohistochemistry; long term exposure; motor coordination; mouse; nonhuman; organ weight; phenotype; priority journal; spatial memory; working memory; Alzheimer disease; amyloid plaque; analysis; animal; disease model; drug effect; exhaust gas; exposure; inbred mouse strain; particulate matter; pathology; short term memory; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Inhalation Exposure; Memory, Short-Term; Mice, Inbred Strains; Particulate Matter; Plaque, Amyloid; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028534097

Specifically, information relating to both longer term climate change and weather variability are combined to identify potential resource implications for health service planning when faced with higher frequencies of heatwaves. A range of climate projection-city combinations are explored in order to test the robustness of the economic justification for heatwave warning systems (HWWS) in Europe – London, Madrid and Prague. Our results demonstrate that in most cases the HWWS option can be justified in the current climate – it is therefore a “no/low regret” option. Our results also show that whilst costs increase slightly under climate change scenarios, benefits of HWWS are likely to increase more steeply in European contexts. However, whilst the majority of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) outcomes are found to be positive, (i.e. economic benefits are greater than economic costs), across alternative climate projection-city combinations, in sensitivity analyses it is possible to generate negative results in certain geographical contexts. Indeed, with respect to this climate change risk, this analysis has identified that the analysis of key uncertainties, such as effectiveness of HWWSs and the valuation of health improvements, is critical in strengthening the case for HWWS implementation. © 2016 The Authors",,"adaptive management; climate change; climate prediction; cost-benefit analysis; health impact; heat wave; sensitivity analysis; service provision; Czech Republic; England; London [England]; Madrid [Spain]; Prague [Czech Republic]; Spain; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006117593

Of these, however, meteorological effects are considered to be the primary determinants of water consumption. In this study, the effects of climate on residential water consumption in Las Vegas, Nevada, were examined during the period from 1990 to 2014. The investigations found that climatic variables, including maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, precipitation, diurnal temperature, dew point depression, wind speed, wind direction, and percent of calm wind influenced water use. The multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model found that the historical data of water consumption and dew point depression explain the highest percentage of variance (98.88%) in water use when dew point depression is used as an explanatory variable. Our results indicate that the ARIMAX model with dew point depression input, and average temperature, play a significant role in predicting long-term water consumption rates in Las Vegas. The sensitivity analysis results also show that the changes in average temperature impacted water demand three times more than dew point depression. The accuracy performance, specifically the mean average percentage error (MAPE), of the model's forecasting is found to be about 2-3% from five years out. This study can be adapted and utilized for the long-term forecasting of water demand in other regions. By using one significant climate factor and historical water demand for the forecasting, the ARIMAX model gives a forecast with high accuracy and provides an effective technique for monitoring the effects of climate change on water demand in the area. © 2017 by the authors.

Even though the NDH-1 complex is a well-characterized protein complex in the thylakoid membrane of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis), the exact roles of different NDH-2s remain poorly understood. To elucidate this question, we studied the function of NdbC, one of the three NDH-2s in Synechocystis, by constructing a deletion mutant (DndbC) for a corresponding protein and submitting the mutant to physiological and biochemical characterization as well as to comprehensive proteomics analysis. We demonstrate that the deletion of NdbC, localized to the plasma membrane, affects several metabolic pathways in Synechocystis in autotrophic growth conditions without prominent effects on photosynthesis. Foremost, the deletion of NdbC leads, directly or indirectly, to compromised sugar catabolism, to glycogen accumulation, and to distorted cell division. Deficiencies in several sugar catabolic routes were supported by severe retardation of growth of the DndbC mutant under light-activated heterotrophic growth conditions but not under mixotrophy. Thus, NdbC has a significant function in regulating carbon allocation between storage and the biosynthesis pathways. In addition, the deletion of NdbC increases the amount of cyclic electron transfer, possibly via the NDH-12 complex, and decreases the expression of several transporters in ambient CO2 growth conditions. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

In addition, the monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of carbon dioxide emissions is necessary for the success of international agreements to reduce emissions. However, existing fossil-fuel carbon dioxide (FFCO2) emissions inventories vary in terms of the data and methods used to estimate and distribute FFCO2. This paper compares how the approaches used to create spatially explicit FFCO2 emissions inventories affect the spatial distribution of emissions estimates and the magnitude of emissions estimates in specific locales. Five spatially explicit FFCO2 emission inventories were compared: Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Center (CDIAC), Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), Fossil Fuel Data Assimilation System (FFDAS), Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC), and Vulcan. The effects of using specific data and approaches in the creation of spatially explicit FFCO2 emissions inventories, and the effect of resolution on data representation are analyzed using graphical, numerical, and cartographic approaches. We examined the effect of using top-down versus bottom-up approaches, nightlights versus population proxies, and the inclusion of large point sources. The results indicate that the approach used to distribute emissions in space creates distinct patterns in the distribution of emissions estimates and hence in the estimates of emissions in specific locations. The different datasets serve different purposes but collectively show the key role of large point sources and urban centers and the strong relationship between scale and uncertainty. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Carbon dioxide; Emissions inventories; Emissions uncertainty; Geographic information systems; Spatial analysis; United States (US) CO2 emissions","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon flux; comparative study; database; emission control; emission inventory; fossil fuel; GIS; international agreement; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; uncertainty analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962213303

The purpose of this study is to estimate GHG emissions and emission factors at nine incineration facilities in Korea by measuring the GHG concentrations in the flue gas samples. The selected incineration plants had different operation systems (i.e., stoker, fluidized bed, moving grate, rotary kiln, and kiln &amp; stoker), and different nitrogen oxide (NOx) removal systems (i.e., selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR)) to treat municipal solid waste (MSW), commercial solid waste (CSW), and specified waste (SW). The total mean emission factors for A and B facilities for MSW incineration were found to be 134 ± 17 kg CO2 ton−1, 88 ± 36 g CH4 ton−1, and 69 ± 16 g N2O ton−1, while those for CSW incineration were 22.56 g CH4 ton−1 and 259.76 g N2O ton−1, and for SW incineration emission factors were 2959 kg CO2 ton−1, 43.44 g CH4 ton−1 and 401.21 g N2O ton−1, respectively. Total emissions calculated using annual incineration for MSW were 3587 ton CO2-eq yr−1 for A facility and 11,082 ton CO2-eq yr−1 for B facility, while those of IPCC default values were 13,167 ton CO2-eq yr−1 for A facility and 32,916 ton CO2-eq yr−1, indicating that the emissions of IPCC default values were estimated higher than those of the plant-specific emission factors. The emission of CSW for C facility was 1403 ton CO2-eq yr−1, while those of SW for D to I facilities was 28,830 ton CO2-eq yr−1. The sensitivity analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation for GHG emission factors in MSW showed that the GHG concentrations have a greater impact than the incineration amount and flow rate of flue gas. For MSW incineration plants using the same stoker type in operation, the estimated emissions and emission factors of CH4 showed the opposite trend with those of NO2 when the NOx removal system was used, whereas there was no difference in CO2 emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide; Emission factor; Greenhouse gases; Nitrous oxide; Waste incineration","carbon; nitrogen oxide; carbon dioxide; catalysis; emission; greenhouse gas; incineration; Monte Carlo analysis; municipal solid waste; nitrous oxide; pollutant removal; sensitivity analysis; Article; combustion; greenhouse gas; incineration; Korea; Monte Carlo method; municipal solid waste; sensitivity analysis; solid waste; waste; gas; greenhouse effect; South Korea; waste disposal; Korea; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Incineration; Refuse Disposal; Republic of Korea; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016404241

In this pursuit numerous studies have been carried out to synthesize alkali activated concrete (AAC) utilizing industrial by-products, such as, fly ash that is rich in silica and alumina. Natural Pozzolan (NP) is one of such alternative cementitious materials having desirable chemical compositions that could be potentially used to develop AAC. The present work focuses on the effect of curing period, composition of alkaline activators and binder content on the properties of natural pozzolan-based AAC. A total of 15 AAC mixes were prepared by varying the sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide (SS/SH) by weight ratio from 2.0 to 2.75 and binder content between 350 kg/m3 and 450 kg/m3. Fresh properties, such as, setting time of alkali activated pastes (AAP) and workability of concrete were determined. Compressive strength was measured on the specimens cured for 0.5, 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days in an oven maintained at 60 °C. For selected mixtures, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were utilized to study the morphology and mineral composition of the developed alkali activated paste (AAP), respectively. Additionally, FTIR was used to identify functional groups formed in the AAP. The results showed that the composition of alkaline activators and binder content have significant effect on the properties of AAC. Considerable strength gain was recorded after 3 days of curing and further curing up to 7 days improved the strength. However, continued curing up to 28 days marginally decreased the strength. Further, SS/SH ratio of 2.5 and binder content of 400 kg/m3, resulting in alkaline activators to binder ratio of 0.525, was found to be suitable for achieving superior strength and microstructural characteristics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alkali activated concrete (AAC); Alkali activated paste (AAP); Compressive strength; Mineralogical composition; Morphology; Natural pozzolan (NP)","Activated alumina; Alkalinity; Aluminum oxide; Carbon footprint; Compressive strength; Concrete products; Curing; Fly ash; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Mechanical properties; Morphology; Portland cement; Pozzolan; Scanning electron microscopy; Silica; Silicates; Sodium hydroxide; X ray diffraction; Alkali activated; Alkali-activated concretes; Cementitious materials; Industrial by-products; Micro-structural characteristics; Mineralogical compositions; Natural pozzolan; Ordinary Portland cement; Binders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018760889

In the early days of REDD+, such costs for tropical smallholders were believed to be quite low, but this has increasingly been questioned. A decade after the concept was proposed, direct payments to forest stakeholders remain rare, while concerns about safeguarding livelihoods are increasing. Households facing restrictions on forest-based activities will have to be compensated, yet evidence on actual costs to households, their distribution, and implications for efficiency and equity is limited. We estimate smallholder opportunity costs of REDD+ in 17 sites in six countries across the tropics. We use household data collected from multiple sites in multiple countries using a uniform methodology. We find that opportunity costs per tCO2 emissions from deforestation are less than the social costs of tCO2 emissions ($36) in 16 of the 17 sites; in only six of the sites, however, are opportunity costs lower than the 2015 voluntary market price for tCO2 ($3.30). While opportunity costs per tCO2 are of interest from an efficiency perspective, it is opportunity costs per household that are relevant for safeguarding local peoples’ income. We calculate opportunity costs per household and examine how these costs differ for households of different income groups within each site. We find that poorer households face lower opportunity costs from deforestation and forest degradation in all sites. In a system of direct conditional payments with no transactions costs to households, poorer households would earn the highest rents from a system of flat payments. Our findings highlight that heterogeneity and asymmetrical distribution of opportunity costs within and between communities bear important consequences on both equity and efficiency of REDD+ initiatives. © 2017 The Authors","Deforestation; Degradation; Equity; Opportunity costs; REDD+","carbon emission; deforestation; degradation; emission control; household income; smallholder; tropical region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017474097

This seasonal process has fueled geoengineering initiatives to fertilize the surface ocean with deep seawater to enhance productivity and thus promote the drawdown of CO2. Coccolithophores, which inhabit many upwelling regions naturally ‘fertilized’ by deep seawater, have been investigated in the laboratory in the context of ocean acidification to determine the extent to which nutrients and CO2 impact their physiology, but few data exist in the field except from mesocosms. Here, we used the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (north Atlantic Ocean) Observatory to retrieve seawater from depths with elevated CO2 and nutrients, mimicking geoengineering approaches. We tested the effects of abrupt natural deep seawater fertilization on the physiology and biogeochemistry of two strains of Emiliania huxleyi of known physiology. None of the strains tested underwent cell divisions when incubated in waters obtained from &lt;1,000 m (pH = 7.99–8.08; CO2 = 373–485 p.p.m; 1.5–12 μM nitrate). However, growth was promoted in both strains when cells were incubated in seawater from ~1,000 m (pH = 7.9; CO2 ~560 p.p.m.; 14–17 μM nitrate) and ~4,800 m (pH = 7.9; CO2 ~600 p.p.m.; 21 μM nitrate). Emiliania huxleyi strain CCMP 88E showed no differences in growth rate or in cellular content or production rates of particulate organic (POC) and inorganic (PIC) carbon and cellular particulate organic nitrogen (PON) between treatments using water from 1,000 m and 4,800 m. However, despite the N: P ratio of seawater being comparable in water from ~1,000 and ~4,800 m, the PON production rates were three times lower in one incubation using water from ~1,000 m compared to values observed in water from ~4,800 m. Thus, the POC:PON ratios were threefold higher in cells that were incubated in ~1,000 m seawater. The heavily calcified strain NZEH exhibited lower growth rates and PIC production rates when incubated in water from ~4,800 m compared to ~1,000 m, while cellular PIC, POC and PON were higher in water from 4,800 m. Calcite Sr/Ca ratios increased with depth despite constant seawater Sr/Ca, indicating that upwelling changes coccolith geochemistry. Our study provides the first experimental and field trial of a geoengineering approach to test how deep seawater impacts coccolithophore physiological and biogeochemical properties. Given that coccolithophore growth was only stimulated using waters obtained from &gt;1,000 m, artificial upwelling using shallower waters may not be a suitable approach for promoting carbon sequestration for some locations and assemblages, and should therefore be investigated on a site-by-site basis. © 2017 Iglesias-Rodriguez et al.

This novel approach to CO2 removal by immobilized CA in a hollow-fiber membrane bioreactor (HFMB) was investigated via a multiscale steady-state model, under gas-filled and partially liquid-filled membrane pores conditions. The impact of CA loading, buffer acid-base constant and concentration, membrane wetting, uncatalyzed/catalyzed CO2 hydration in the wetted membrane zone, operating conditions, and cocurrent/countercurrent flow orientation on the HFMB performance was analyzed.

In this context, ethanol can be used as an alternative fuel or an additive of gasoline owing to many advantages, above all the possibility to rise oxygen amount in the fuel (so reducing CO and HC exhaust emissions) and to stem the depletion of fossil fuels.

In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of using temperature as an indicator for detecting leakage in and around wellbores. Numerical simulation tools are used to simulate temperature propagation both along and around the wellbore when leakage occurs. Typical overall heat transfer coefficient of formation rock is applied to quantify heat dissipation from the fluids leaked in well. We have tested the cases of CO2 phase only and the mixture of CO2 and brine. Thermodynamic phase change of CO2 throughout the wellbore depth is accounted by an equation-of-state. Both vertical and slant (off-shore) wells are examined.

It is closely related with and mostly generated from the transportation and industrialization sectors, as well as from the environmentally degrading effect of the urban physical development. Air pollution promotes the lower level of air quality, which in turn promotes the greater risk on health, especially that of the human being. This research aims to aid the government in the policy making process related to air pollution mitigation by developing a standard index model for air polluter (Air Polluter Standard Index - APSI) based on the Mixed Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) approach using the adaptive bandwidth. The adaptive bandwidth kernel has different bandwidth value in each observation location. Akaike Information Criterion-corrected (AICc) value is used to choose the most optimum bandwidth. The Monte Carlo Simulation is used to tests for regression coefficient non-stationarity. In this research, we also consider seven variables that are directly related to the air pollution level, which are the traffic velocity, the population density, the business center aspect, the air humidity, the wind velocity, the air temperature, and the area size of the urban forest. Based on AICc and MSE value it is know that the MGWR model with adaptive bisquare kernel is the best bandwidth to analyze this model. © 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Adaptive bisquare kernel; Air polluter; APSI; MGWR; Monte Carlo simulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027731566

A major hallmark of COPD is elevated apoptosis of structural lung cells including fibroblasts. The NF-κB member RelB may suppress apoptosis in response to cigarette smoke, but its role in lung cell survival is not known. RelB may act as a pro-survival factor by controlling the expression of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). SOD2 is also regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that suppresses cigarette smoke-induced apoptosis. As the AhR is also a binding partner for RelB, we speculate that RelB suppresses cigarette smoke-induced apoptosis by regulating the AhR. Using an in vitro model of cigarette smoke exposure (cigarette smoke extract [CSE]), we found that CSE down-regulated RelB expression in mouse lung fibroblasts, which was associated with elevated levels of cleaved PARP. Genetic ablation of RelB elevated CSE-induced apoptosis, including chromatin condensation, and reduced mitochondrial function. There was also more reactive oxygen species production in RelB-/- cells exposed to CSE. While there was no alteration in Nrf2 expression or localization between RelB-/- and wild type cells in response to CSE, RelB-/- cells displayed significantly decreased AhR mRNA and protein expression, concomitant with loss of AhR target gene expression (Cyp1a1, Cyp1b1, Nqo1). Finally, we found that RelB binds to the Ahr gene at 3 sites to potentially increase its expression via transcriptional induction. These data support that RelB suppresses cigarette smoke-induced apoptosis, potentially by increasing the AhR. Together, these two proteins may comprise an important cell survival signaling pathway that reduces apoptosis upon cigarette smoke exposure. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Apoptosis; Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP); Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); Cigarette smoke","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; cigarette smoke; cigarette smoke extract; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 1B1; messenger RNA; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; reactive oxygen metabolite; small interfering RNA; transcription factor Nrf2; transcription factor RelB; unclassified drug; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase 1; protein binding; Relb protein, mouse; transcription factor RelB; animal cell; apoptosis; Article; cell survival; chromatin condensation; controlled study; down regulation; gene expression; human; in vitro study; lung fibroblast; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein expression; protein localization; smoking; transcription initiation; 3' untranslated region; animal; apoptosis; C57BL mouse; cell culture; chronic obstructive lung disease; cigarette smoking; fibroblast; genetic transcription; genetics; knockout mouse; lung; metabolism; pathology; physiology; signal transduction; 3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Apoptosis; Cells, Cultured; Cigarette Smoking; Down-Regulation; Fibroblasts; Humans; Lung; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1; Protein Binding; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Reactive Oxygen Species; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factor RelB; Transcription, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015651191

It is difficult to select the most relevant indicators that are useful in a specific context, and that are measurable and achievable at the same time. Indicator selection frameworks – criteria based; causal chains and causal networks have been proposed and used in the past. All three frameworks have certain limitations and strengths. In this study we have proposed a systematic approach of selecting sustainable mobility indicators for Indian cities by combining – criteria based, causal chain and causal network frameworks. The methodology involves both subjective judgments for evaluation of indicators against a set of criteria and objectivity during development and assessment of causal network. The method results in identifying 20 relevant factors for which 32 indicators are shortlisted. Further work is required to develop measurable indicators related to accessibility to the disadvantaged, speed limit restriction and street lighting. These have not been discussed in detail in the existing literature. The 20 factors are classified as root nodes, central and end-of-the-chain nodes that helps in identifying levers of attaining sustainable mobility in Indian cities. The developed causal network is evaluated for its ability to address all sectors associated with sustainable mobility. The causal network has low density and centralization index and therefore accounts for multiple factors. The shortlisted indicators are proposed for preparing low carbon mobility plan (LCMP) for three medium size Indian cities. The indicators are checked for data availability and ease of measurability based on the data collected for preparing the three LCMPs. The analysis shows that the data are available from secondary sources like census to measure root node indicators, whereas central indicators require conducting primary surveys and specific models are required to measure end-of-the-chain indicators. Based on the position of indicators within causal network, it is interpreted that pricing policy, urban form and infrastructure are the levers of sustainable mobility. The indicators of energy consumption, emissions and accessibility are the sustainable mobility targets that we want to achieve. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Causal chain framework; Causal network framework; Criteria based selection; Indian cities; Indicators; Sustainable mobility","Carbon; Chains; Energy utilization; Indicators (instruments); Surveys; Causal chains; Causal network; Criteria based selection; Indian cities; Sustainable mobility; Transportation; analytical framework; census; centralization; data processing; infrastructure; methodology; mobility; sustainability; urban area; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018919595

The monitoring of ocean carbon dioxide is important for a better understanding of the role of the ocean as a carbon sink, and regional and global carbon cycles. This study estimated the fugacity of carbon dioxide (ƒCO2 ) over the East Sea located between Korea and Japan. In situ measurements, satellite data and products from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) and the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) reanalysis data were used through stepwise multi-variate nonlinear regression (MNR) and two machine learning approaches (i.e., support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF)). We used five ocean parameters—colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM; &lt;0.3 m−1 ), chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a; &lt;21 mg/m3 ), mixed layer depth (MLD; &lt;160 m), sea surface salinity (SSS; 32–35), and sea surface temperature (SST; 8–28 ◦ C)—and four band reflectance (Rrs) data (400 nm–565 nm) and their ratios as input parameters to estimate surface seawater ƒCO2 (270–430 µatm). Results show that RF generally performed better than stepwise MNR and SVR. The root mean square error (RMSE) of validation results by RF was 5.49 µatm (1.7%), while those of stepwise MNR and SVR were 10.59 µatm (3.2%) and 6.82 µatm (2.1%), respectively. Ocean parameters (i.e., sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), and mixed layer depth (MLD)) appeared to contribute more than the individual bands or band ratios from the satellite data.

If the cap does not capture all sectors, we demonstrate that variations of a renewable energy subsidy change aggregate carbon emissions through an inter-industry leakage effect. We decompose this effect into intuitively intelligible components that depend in natural ways on measurable elasticity parameters. Raising the subsidy always reduces emissions if funded by a lump-sum tax, reinforcing recent findings that tightening environmental regulation can cause negative leakage. However, if the subsidy is funded by a levy on electricity, it can increase emissions. These results provide a valuable basis for an informed design of renewable energy policies and an accurate assessment of their effectiveness.

It is not always feasible to accommodate electric powertrain in conventional platforms based on the target requirements. Electrification of conventional vehicles will cut back dependence on fossil fuels, emission of greenhouse gases and emission of pollutants. Fossil fuel are going to be depleted in few decades. Moreover, the emission from traditional vehicle has raised a huge threat to the atmosphere. Auto OEM's have recognized that electric drive vehicles are critical to the future of the industry. However, some difficulties exist to more noteworthy selection: the view of cost, EV range, access to charging, potential impacts, and absence of open mindfulness about the accessibility and common sense of these vehicles. It is therefore important to assess and follow a methodological approach in converting the platform to electrified one. In present state of affairs, the importance of fuel economical vehicles, reduced emissions & energy potency is the foremost concern for any vehicle manufacturer. To meet these expectations vehicle manufacturers are exploring alternate powertrains to cut back emissions and manufacture higher fuel economical vehicles. For any vehicle producer part cost, weight and package volume are the significant driving variables for achievement.

Gasoline- and diesel-powered engines and biomass burning are known to emit HNCO and hypothesized to emit precursors such as amides that can photochemically react to produce HNCO in the atmosphere. Increasingly, diesel engines in developed countries like the United States are required to use selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to reduce tailpipe emissions of oxides of nitrogen. SCR chemistry is known to produce HNCO as an intermediate product, and SCR systems have been implicated as an atmospheric source of HNCO. In this work, we measure HNCO emissions from an SCR system-equipped diesel engine and, in combination with earlier data, use a three-dimensional chemical transport model (CTM) to simulate the ambient concentrations and source/pathway contributions to HNCO in an urban environment. Engine tests were conducted at three different engine loads, using two different fuels and at multiple operating points. HNCO was measured using an acetate chemical ionization mass spectrometer. The diesel engine was found to emit primary HNCO (3-90mg-1) but we did not find any evidence that the SCR system or other aftertreatment devices (i.e., oxidation catalyst and particle filter) produced or enhanced HNCO emissions. The CTM predictions compared well with the only available observational datasets for HNCO in urban areas but underpredicted the contribution from secondary processes. The comparison implied that diesel-powered engines were the largest source of HNCO in urban areas. The CTM also predicted that daily-averaged concentrations of HNCO reached a maximum of 110pptv but were an order of magnitude lower than the 1ppbv level that could be associated with physiological effects in humans. Precursor contributions from other combustion sources (gasoline and biomass burning) and wintertime conditions could enhance HNCO concentrations but need to be explored in future work. © 2017 Author(s).",,"biomass burning; concentration (composition); diesel engine; organic compound; urban area; United States; Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026215193

The excessive usage of grid energy raises sustainability issues in the face of global changes, such as climate change, population, economic growths, etc. Traditionally, the power systems that deliver this commodity are fuel operated and lead towards high carbon emissions and global warming. To overcome these issues, the recent concept of the nearly zero energy building (nZEB) has attracted numerous researchers and industry for the construction and management of the new generation buildings. In this regard, this paper proposes various demand side management (DSM) programs using the genetic algorithm (GA), teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO), the enhanced differential evolution (EDE) algorithm and the proposed enhanced differential teaching learning algorithm (EDTLA) to manage energy and comfort, while taking the human preferences into consideration. Power consumption patterns of shiftable home appliances are modified in response to the real-time price signal in order to get monetary benefits. To further improve the cost and user discomfort objectives along with reduced carbon emission, renewable energy sources (RESs) are also integrated into the microgrid (MG). The proposed model is implemented in a smart residential complex of multiple homes under a real-time pricing environment. We figure out two feasible regions: One for electricity cost and the other for user discomfort. The proposed model aims to deal with the stochastic nature of RESs while introducing the battery storage system (BSS). The main objectives of this paper include: (1) integration of RESs; (2) minimization of the electricity bill (cost) and discomfort; and (3) minimizing the peak to average ratio (PAR) and carbon emission. Additionally, we also analyze the tradeoff between two conflicting objectives, like electricity cost and user discomfort. Simulation results validate both the implemented and proposed techniques. © 2017 by the authors.","Demand Side Management (DSM); Heuristic Techniques; Microgrid (MG); Planning And Scheduling; Renewable Energy Sources (RESs); Storage System; Zero Energy Buildings","Buildings; Carbon; Costs; Demand side management; Domestic appliances; Economics; Electric power system economics; Electric utilities; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Global warming; Heuristic methods; Learning algorithms; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Demand Side Management (DSM); Heuristic techniques; Micro grid; Planning and scheduling; Renewable energy source; Storage systems; Zero energy buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040368874

In the case of carbon nanotubes, a very peculiar coupling between localized excitons and the one-dimensional acoustic phonon modes can be achieved, which gives rise to pronounced phonon wings in the luminescence spectrum. By coupling an individual nanotube to a tunable optical microcavity, we show that this peculiar exciton-phonon coupling is a valuable resource to enlarge the tuning range of the single-photon source while keeping an excellent exciton-photon coupling efficiency and spectral purity. Using the unique flexibility of our scanning fiber cavity, we are able to measure the efficiency spectrum of the very same nanotube in the Purcell regime for several mode volumes. Whereas this efficiency spectrum looks very much like the free-space luminescence spectrum when the Purcell factor is small (large mode volume), we show that the deformation of this spectrum at lower mode volumes can be traced back to the strength of the exciton-photon coupling. It shows an enhanced efficiency on the red wing that arises from the asymmetry of the incoherent energy exchange processes between the exciton and the cavity. This allows us to obtain a tuning range up to several hundred times the spectral width of the source. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Condensed matter physics; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Light emission; Luminescence; Nanotubes; Particle beams; Phonons; Photons; Tuning; Yarn; Efficiency spectra; Enhanced efficiency; Exciton-phonon couplings; Exciton-photon coupling; Luminescence spectrum; Optical microcavities; Single photon generation; Single-photon source; Excitons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027047791

Neglecting the interaction of the electrons and the radiation field, the formula of the coherent spontaneous emission is given, the power of which is proportional to the square of the initial bunching factor and of the undulator length. For the general emission case of the prebunched electron beam, the evolution equation of the optical field is deducted. Then the analytical expression of the emission power is obtained for the resonant case; it is applicable to the regions from the low gain to the high gain. It is found that when the undulator length is shorter than four gain lengths, the emission is just the coherent spontaneous emission, and conversely, it is the self-amplified stimulated emission growing exponentially. For the nonresonant prebunched electron beam, the variations of the emission intensity with the detuning parameter for different interaction length are presented. The radiation field characters of the prebunched electron beam are discussed and compared with that of the seeded FEL amplifier. © 2017 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.

The functions and structures of bacteria and archaea populations show significant succession in the CHMP-AF process. There are many kinds of bacterial functional proteins, mainly belonging to phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, that are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Ferredoxin-NADP reductase, present in bacteria in genus Azotobacter, is an important enzyme for NADH/NAD+ equilibrium regulation in hydrogen production. The archaeal functional proteins are mainly involved in methane metabolism in energy metabolism, such as acetyl-CoA decarboxylase, and methyl-coenzyme M reductase, and the acetic acid pathway exhibited the highest proportion of the total. The archaea of genus Methanosarcina in phylum Euryarchaeota can produce methane under the effect of multi-functional proteins through acetic acid, CO2 reduction, and methyl nutrient pathways. The study demonstrates metaproteomics as a new way of uncovering community functional and metabolic activity. The combined information was used to identify the metabolic pathways and organisms crucial for lignocellulosic biomass degradation and biogas production.

However, few studies have comprehensively assessed the effects of straw incorporation on net global warming potential (NGWP) considering both emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) and accumulation of SOC in Northeast China, the most important agricultural regions across the nation. An ongoing straw incorporation experiment was initiated in a maize cropping system of Northeast China from 2010, including three treatments: no straw incorporation (CK), incorporation of maize straw at a low level of 4000 kg ha−1 (S4), and at a high level of 8000 kg ha−1 (S8). At 2015, the crop yield was significantly elevated (11% and 21% for S4 and S8, respectively) by the straw additions resulting from improved soil fertility. During the growing season of 2015, we found that the straw additions did not affect seasonal patterns of the N2O and CH4, but changed their seasonal magnitudes. Averaged over this period, CH4 flux was very low based on its GWP, and straw incorporation tended to reduce the CH4 emissions (6.6, 3.6 and 4.3 kg CO2 eq ha−1 for CK, S4 and S8, respectively); while straw incorporation significantly enhanced N2O emissions with the value of 429, 590 and 746 kg CO2 eq ha−1 for CK, S4 and S8, respectively. On the other hand, a significantly linear relationship (SOC sequestration rate = 0.29 × annual C input–0.57, R2 = 0.99, P &lt; 0.05) was detected between annual straw C input and SOC sequestration rate over the 5-year cycles, indicating the soil we studied was still not C-saturated at least during the experimental interval. More notably, the C conversion rate (29%, the slope of the equation) was generally larger than the values reported in other region of China. These results implied and confirmed that the soil of Northeast China possessed greater potentials to sequestrate external C. Taken together, the SOC accumulation accounted for major portion of the NGWP and counteracted the extra emissions of GHGs (492, −1183 and −3040 kg CO2 eq ha−1 for NGWP of CK, S4 and S8, respectively). Therefore, the agricultural practise of straw incoporation was strongly recommended to be adopted in Northeat China to improve the soil productivity and simultaneously mitigate the negative influence of GHG emissions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Greenhouse gas; Net global warming potential; Soil C sequestration; Straw incorporation","Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Soils; C sequestration; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Linear relationships; Seasonal patterns; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil productivity; Straw incorporations; Soil pollution; carbon sequestration; crop yield; cropping practice; experimental study; flux measurement; global warming; greenhouse gas; maize; methane; nitrogen dioxide; soil carbon; soil fertility; straw; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016149325

In each experiment, 2.7–3.1 kg of firewood were combusted while continuously monitoring temperature, exhaust gases, burn rate, and collecting particulate matter samples in Teflon filters under isokinetic conditions for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and levoglucosan analyses. Mean particulate matter emission factors were 2.03, 4.06, and 3.84 g/kg dry wood for eucalyptus, oak, and mimosa, respectively. The emission factors were inversely correlated with combustion efficiency. The mean emission factors of the sums of 12 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in particle phases were 1472.5, 2134.0, and 747.5 μg/kg for eucalyptus, oak, and mimosa, respectively. Fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene, and chrysene were present in the particle phase in higher proportions compared with other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that were analyzed. Mean levoglucosan emission factors were 854.9, 202.3, and 328.0 mg/kg for eucalyptus, oak, and mimosa, respectively. Since the emissions of particulate matter and other pollutants were inversely correlated with combustion efficiency, implementing more efficient technologies would help to reduce air pollutant emissions from wood combustion. Implications: Residential wood burning has been identified as a significant source of air pollution in populated areas. Local wood species are combusted for home cooking and heating, which releases several toxic air pollutants, including particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Air pollutant emissions depend on the type of wood and the technology and operational conditions of the wood stove. A better understanding of emissions from local wood species and wood stove performance would help to identify better biomass fuels and wood stove technologies in order to reduce air pollution from residential wood burning. © 2017 A&WMA.",,"Aromatization; Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Efficiency; Exhaust gases; Housing; Hydrocarbons; Particulate emissions; Pyrene; Stoves; Wood; Wood fuels; Air pollutant emission; Combustion efficiencies; Efficient technology; Eucalyptus globulus; Operational conditions; Particulate matter emissions; Residential wood burning; Toxic air pollutants; Air pollution; benz[a]anthracene; chrysene; fluoranthene; levoglucosan; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrene; 1,6-anhydro-beta-glucopyranose; glucose; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; Acacia; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; carbon footprint; Chile; combustion; Eucalyptus globulus; exhaust gas; fire; oak; particulate matter; priority journal; temperature measurement; wood; analogs and derivatives; analysis; chemistry; cooking; heating; particulate matter; wood; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Chile; Cooking; Glucose; Heating; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018669812

The following three nitrooxy compounds, each with different molecular structures, were evaluated: 2,2-dimethyl-3-(nitrooxy) propanoic (DNP), N-[2-(Nitrooxy)ethyl]-3-pyridinecarboxamide (NPD), and nitroglycerin (NG). All three compounds substantially decreased the total gas production, methane production, and the acetate:propionate ratio, while increasing hydrogen production. The growth of methanogens was specifically inhibited by all three compounds, without affecting the abundance of bacteria, anaerobic fungi, or protozoa. However, inhibition of methanogenesis required a much higher dose of DNP when compared to NPD or NG. Further investigations were conducted on NG to determine its effects on the methanogenic community. NG reduced the relative abundance of Methanomassiliicoccales, while increasing the relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter and Methanosphaera. Overall, the results suggested that all three of these nitrooxy compounds could specifically inhibit rumen methanogenesis, but NPD and NG were much more efficient than DNP at rumen methane mitigation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"hydrogen; methane; nicorandil; propionic acid derivative; antiinfective agent; methane; nitro derivative; anaerobic bacterium; archaeon; Article; chemical structure; community structure; experimental sheep; fungus; in vitro study; Methanobrevibacter; methanogen; methanogenesis; Methanosphaera; nonhuman; pH; priority journal; protozoon; rumen; animal; biological model; biota; drug effects; metabolism; metabolome; microbiology; rumen; Animals; Anti-Infective Agents; Biota; Metabolome; Methane; Models, Biological; Nitro Compounds; Rumen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019056830

Potentially adaptive phenotypic traits of 66 diverse populations of Thurber's needlegrass were measured in common gardens at Central Ferry, Washington and Reno, Nevada in 2012 and 2013. Extensive genetic variation was observed among phenology, morphology, and production traits (P &lt; 0.01), and canonical correlation was used to relate traits to source climate variables. Only with the first two canonical variates were F values significant (P &lt; 0.05), explaining 42% and 18% of the variation, respectively. For variates 1 and 2, strong canonical correlations of 0.97 and 0.94 linked genetic variationwith source climates, providing evidence for climate-driven evolution. Pearson linear correlations indicated that populations from warmer, drier locations generally had earlier blooming and longer awns than those from cooler, wetter locations. Plants from warmer, drier locations also had higher survival at Central Ferry and higher leaf length to width (narrower leaves) at Reno in 2012. Regression of the canonical variates 1 and 2 for traits with source climate variables produced very strongmodels, explaining 94% and 87% of the variation in plant traits.

By including carbon offsets directly in the objective function of a Markov decision process (MDP) model, we find long-term trade-offs exist between economic and ecological outcomes. An economic supply schedule is provided, which shows an exponential increase in the cost of sequestration. Moderate carbon prices effectively sequester additional CO2 from the atmosphere while having a positive impact on ecological indicators such as size and species diversity. In contrast, high carbon prices promote more of a monoculture in order to maximize expected forest value in the long run from carbon sequestration. This study finds evidence that the optimal adaptive decisions are sensitive to the magnitude of carbon prices, and consequently, so too are ecological outcomes. While some governments acknowledge the influence carbon markets have on the ecological integrity of the forest, fluctuations in carbon prices within a cap-and-trade market likely influence the optimal decision making of the forest manager, and thus, the ecological landscape of the forest itself. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon offsets; Diversity; Management; Markov decision process; Risk","age structure; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; decision making; forest management; Markov chain; monoculture; risk assessment; steady-state equilibrium; timber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016053564

We present a multi-proxy record spanning the past 19,800 years from Cupola Pond in the Ozarks Mountains, consisting of replicate high-resolution pollen records, 25 AMS radiocarbon dates, and macrofossil, charcoal, and coprophilous spore analyses. Full-glacial Pinus and Picea forests gave way to no-analog vegetation after 17,400 yr BP, followed by development of Quercus-dominated Holocene forests, with late Holocene rises in Pinus and Nyssa. Vegetation transitions, replicated in different cores, are closely linked to hemispheric climate events. Rising Quercus abundances coincide with increasing Northern Hemisphere temperatures and CO2 at 17,500 yr BP, declining Pinus and Picea at 14,500 yr BP are near the Bølling-Allerød onset, and rapid decline of Fraxinus and rise of Ostrya/Carpinus occur 12,700 yr BP during the Younger Dryas. The Cupola no-analog vegetation record is unusual for its early initiation (17,000 yr BP) and for its three vegetation zones, representing distinct rises of Fraxinus and Ostrya/Carpinus. Sporormiella was absent and sedimentary charcoal abundances were low throughout, suggesting that fire and megaherbivores were not locally important agents of disturbance and turnover. The Cupola record thus highlights the complexity of the late-glacial no-analog communities and suggests direct climatic regulation of their formation and disassembly. © 2017",,"Charcoal; Cupolas; Domes; Forestry; Glacial geology; Lakes; Plants (botany); Last deglaciation; Last Glacial Maximum; Northern Hemispheres; Plant communities; Radiocarbon dates; Southeastern US; Vegetation dynamics; Vegetation history; Vegetation; charcoal; deglaciation; disturbance; herbivore; Holocene; last deglaciation; new record; Northern Hemisphere; plant community; pollen; vegetation dynamics; Missouri; Ozark Mountains; United States; Fraxinus; Nyssa; Picea; Preussia (ascomycete); Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021712573

However, global changes in ocean anoxia are difficult to quantify using proxies for local anoxia. Uranium isotopes (δ238U) in CaCO3 sediments deposited under locally well-oxygenated bottom waters can passively track seawater δ238U, which is sensitive to the global areal extent of seafloor anoxia due to preferential reduction of 238U(VI) relative to 235U(VI) in anoxic marine sediments. We measured δ238U in shallow-marine limestones from two stratigraphic sections in the Lombardy Basin, northern Italy, spanning over 400 m. We observe a ∼0.7‰ negative excursion in δ238U beginning in the lowermost Jurassic, coeval with the onset of the initial negative δ13C excursion and persisting for the duration of subsequent high δ13C values in the lower-middle Hettangian stage. The δ238U excursion cannot be realistically explained by local mixing of uranium in primary marine carbonate and reduced authigenic uranium. Based on output from a forward model of the uranium cycle, the excursion is consistent with a 40–100-fold increase in the extent of anoxic deposition occurring worldwide. Additionally, relatively constant uranium concentrations point toward increased uranium delivery to the oceans from continental weathering, which is consistent with weathering-induced eutrophication following the rapid increase in pCO2 during emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. The relative timing and duration of the excursion in δ238U implies that anoxia could have delayed biotic recovery well into the Hettangian stage. © 2017. American Geophysical Union.

We show that not only does fragmentation at both of these levels help predict the emergence of climate change entrepreneurs in individual cities, but also exchanges between these levels could drive the rapid development of policy entrepreneurship and related policy innovations throughout urban systems. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cities; Fragmentation; Metropolitan/micropolitan regions; Policy entrepreneurs; Policy innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017110407

This study is part of a larger program, characterising the rumen microbiomes of sheep which vary naturally in methane yield (g CH4/kg DM/day) and aims to define differences in microbial communities, and in gene and transcript abundances that can explain the animal methane phenotype. Methods: Rumen microbiome metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data were analysed by Gene Set Enrichment, sparse partial least squares regression and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test to estimate correlations between specific KEGG bacterial pathways/genes and high methane yield in sheep. KEGG genes enriched in high methane yield sheep were reassembled from raw reads and existing contigs and analysed by MEGAN to predict their phylogenetic origin. Protein coding sequences from Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens strains were analysed using Effective DB to predict bacterial type III secreted proteins. The effect of S. dextrinosolvens strain H5 growth on methane formation by rumen methanogens was explored using co-cultures. Results: Detailed analysis of the rumen microbiomes of high methane yield sheep shows that gene and transcript abundances of bacterial type III secretion system genes are positively correlated with methane yield in sheep. Most of the bacterial type III secretion system genes could not be assigned to a particular bacterial group, but several genes were affiliated with the genus Succinivibrio, and searches of bacterial genome sequences found that strains of S. dextrinosolvens were part of a small group of rumen bacteria that encode this type of secretion system. In co-culture experiments, S. dextrinosolvens strain H5 showed a growth-enhancing effect on a methanogen belonging to the order Methanomassiliicoccales, and inhibition of a representative of the Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii clade. Conclusions: This is the first report of bacterial type III secretion system genes being associated with high methane emissions in ruminants, and identifies these secretions systems as potential new targets for methane mitigation research. The effects of S. dextrinosolvens on the growth of rumen methanogens in co-cultures indicate that bacteria-methanogen interactions are important modulators of methane production in ruminant animals. © 2017 The Author(s).","Bacterial; Methane; Rumen; Succinivibrio; Type III secretion","bacterial protein; methane; transcriptome; animal; bacterium; biosynthesis; chemistry; classification; culture medium; fermentation; gene expression regulation; gene ontology; genetics; intestine flora; isolation and purification; metabolism; metagenome; Methanobrevibacter; microbiology; molecular genetics; phylogeny; rumen; sheep; Succinivibrionaceae; type III secretion system; Animals; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Culture Media; Fermentation; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Ontology; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metagenome; Methane; Methanobrevibacter; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Phylogeny; Rumen; Sheep; Succinivibrionaceae; Transcriptome; Type III Secretion Systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027137947

The development of regulatory emission control plans to meet air quality standards primarily relies on modeled projections of future-year air quality, although a weight of evidence approach (which takes into account a number of factors including modeling results, model evaluation and other pertinent information such as ambient trends) is recommended and is also typically used as part of the attainment demonstration. Thus, it is important to determine if the modeling system used to project future-year quality can correctly simulate ozone responses to the projected emissions reductions. Uncertainties and errors in modeled projections can lead to erroneous estimates of emissions controls required to attain the standards. We use two existing regulatory modeling databases, employed for forecasting future-year air quality in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) of California, for a number of historical years to evaluate the ability of the system to accurately simulate the observed changes in air quality over a multi-year period. The evaluation results with the older (2012) database show that the modeling system consistently under-predicts the reductions in ozone in response to emission reductions over the years. Model response improves with the newer (2016) database with good agreement at some locations, but the system still tends to under-predict ozone responses by as much as a factor of 2 in recent years for the Basin maximum ozone design value. This suggests that future-year estimates of ozone design values may be overly conservative, resulting in emission controls that are technologically challenging or very expensive to implement. The development of better emission inventories and model inputs is recommended to develop a modeling system that more accurately responds to emission changes. Future regulatory planning should include dynamic evaluation in addition to the traditional operational evaluation of the model to provide more confidence to all stakeholders that the resulting policy decisions are necessary to attain the air quality standards and to protect public health. © 2017 by the authors.","CMAQ; Dynamic model evaluation; Future-year ozone; South Coast Air Basin","Air quality; Air quality standards; Database systems; Emission control; Forecasting; Ozone; Standards; Uncertainty analysis; CMAQ; Emission inventories; Emissions reduction; Model evaluation; Operational evaluation; Ozone concentration; South Coast Air basins; Weight of evidence approach; Quality control; air quality; concentration (composition); emission inventory; forecasting method; future prospect; ozone; photochemistry; standard (reference); California; South Coast Air Basin; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027468175

The aim of this paper is to simulate transition towards low carbon transportation in the European Union until 2050 and to assess the ensuing macroeconomic and sectorial impacts. Transport restructuring is dynamically simulated using a new transport-oriented version of the computable general equilibrium model GEM-E3 which is linked with the PRIMES-TREMOVE energy and transport sectors model. The analysis draws from comparing a reference scenario projection for the EU member-states up to 2050 to alternative transport policy scenarios and sensitivities which involve deep cutting of CO2 emissions. The simulations show that transport restructuring affects the economy through multiple channels, including investment in infrastructure, the purchasing and manufacturing of new technology vehicles, the production of alternative fuels, such as biofuels and electricity. The analysis identifies positive impacts of industrial activity and other sectors stemming from these activities. However, the implied costs of freight and passenger transportation are of crucial importance for the net impact on GDP and income. Should the transport sector transformation imply high unit costs of transport services, crowding out effects in the economy can offset the benefits. This implies that the technology and productivity progress assumptions can be decisive for the sign of GDP impacts. A robust conclusion is that the transport sector decarbonisation, is likely to have only small negative impacts on the EU GDP compared to business as usual. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Economic modelling; General equilibrium; Transport decarbonisation; Transport economic assessment","Alternative fuels; Biofuels; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Crashworthiness; Decarbonization; Economics; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Transportation; Computable general equilibrium model; Decarbonisation; Economic modelling; General equilibrium; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Low carbon transportations; Passenger transportation; Transport economics; Economic and social effects; assessment method; carbon emission; European Union; Gross Domestic Product; macroeconomics; modeling; transportation economics; transportation policy; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007508337

The smoke from the biomass burnings covered the entire region including Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, with haze particulate matter (PM) reducing the air quality to hazardous levels. Here we report a comprehensive size-composition-morphology characterization of the PM collected from an urban site in Singapore during the two haze events. The two haze events were a result of biomass burning and occurred in two different geographical source regions. We show the similarities and variations of particle size distribution during hazy and clear days during the two haze events. Sub-micron particles (<1 μm) dominate (∼50%) the aerosols in the atmosphere during clear and hazy days. Using electron microscopy, we also categorize the PM, namely soot, organic-inorganic clusters and hybrid particles. The composition and morphology were similar in both the haze events. The majority of the PM is composed of carbon (∼51%) and other elements pertaining to the earth's crust. The complexity of the mixing state of the PM is highlighted and the role of the capture mode is addressed. We also present the morphological characterization of all the classified PM. The box counting method is used to determine the fractal dimensions of the PM, and the dimensionality varied for every classification from 1.79 to 1.88.

(AL), while the second one was proposed by Katerji and Perrier with the addition of the carbon dioxide (CO2) effect on evapotranspiration (KP). The study analyses the impact of the calculation by the two formulas on the irrigation requirement (IR). Both formulas are based on the Penman-Monteith equation but adopt different approaches for parameterising the canopy resistance rc. In the AL formula, rc is assumed constant and not sensitive to climate change, whereas in the KP formula, rc is first parameterised as a function of climatic variables, then ET0 is corrected for the air CO2 concentration. The two formulas were compared in two periods. The first period involves data from two sites in the Mediterranean region within a measured climate change period (1981–2006) when all the input climatic variables were measured. The second period (2070–2100) involves data from a future climate change period at one site when the input climatic variables were forecasted for two future climate scenarios (A2 and B2). The annual cumulated values of ET0 calculated by the AL formula are systematically lower than those determined by the KP formula. The differences between the ET0 estimation with the AL and KP formulas have a strong impact on the determination of the IR for the reference crop. In fact, for the two periods, the annual values of IR when ET0 is calculated by the AL formula are systematically lower than those calculated by the KP formula. For the actual measured climate change period, this reduction varied from 26 to 28 %, while for the future climate change period, it varied based on the scenario from 16 % (A2) to 20 % (B2). © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.",,"carbon dioxide; climate change; climate variation; crop; evapotranspiration; irrigation; parameterization; Penman-Monteith equation; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966709684

However, this causes increased heating costs due to the increase in global energy price. Thus, greenhouse growers prefer unheated production in the Mediterranean Region with a mild climate. In order to have a high quality yield, greenhouses should be heated when average daily temperature drops below 12°C. Due to today's continuous increase of energy costs, greenhouse insulation and minimizing heating requirements are equally important as heating itself. Heating energy requirements in greenhouses are calculated based on the average daily temperature which leads to errors in determining the actual heat requirements. In order to calculate more accurate heating requirements, the calculation should be based on hourly climate data. The aim of this study is to calculate the heat energy requirements as well as the energy that can be saved. The technical approach utilized ""long-period mean hourly temperatures, radiation and wind speed values"". The study was carried out for greenhouses having different types of cladding material in Mersin (Turkey) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region where intensive greenhouse production exists. © 2017 ISHS.","Greenhouse heating; Heat saving; Thermal curtains",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029576482

However, human-induced changes in climate are likely to exceed historical ranges of variability and rates of change, and have effects on forests well beyond the experience of forest managers. These conditions will require implementation of management practices appropriate to a changing climate. This paper provides an overview of the potential changes in climate in key forest-growing regions; current knowledge of the impacts of climate change on Australian forests, forest industries and forest-dependent communities; adaptation options; and approaches to potential climate change challenges. Developments in understanding are considered, and information gaps, research needs and policy changes required to support adaptation are discussed. In order to adapt well to a rapidly changing climate, forest managers will need to better understand how global climate change will impact on the local environment where their resources, assets and people are located, and consider their key vulnerabilities and how climate might affect their wider supply chains, inputs, customers and competitors. Improved monitoring can provide clear signals of change. New tools are required that integrate climate scenarios into organisational and business planning. Industry leaders will need to encourage experimentation, adopt greater flexibility in raw material supply sources, in species and genetic selection, and in plantation and native forest management practices, and have strategies in place to adapt quickly during periods of rapid change. © 2017 Institute of Foresters of Australia (IFA).","adaptation; climate change; forests; impacts; management; organisation","Forestry; Management; Managers; Planning; Supply chains; adaptation; Forest-dependent communities; forests; Global climate changes; impacts; Impacts and adaptation; Management practices; organisation; Climate change; Climates; Forest Management; Forests; Production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027488808

The method uses a spatial prediction model to impute missing data and PM2.5 relative response factors based on simulations with reductions in anthropogenic emissions of primary PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursors (i.e., NOx and SO2). Case study results indicate that relatively urban sites are generally more responsive to primary PM2.5 reductions, while outlying sites are more responsive to NOx and SO2 reductions.

To investigate these mechanisms, we have used benthic foraminiferal B/Ca to reconstruct deep-water [CO32−] in cores from the deep Indian and Equatorial Pacific Oceans during the past five glacial cycles. Based on our reconstructions, we suggest that the shelf-to-basin shift of carbonate deposition raised deep-water [CO32−], on average, by 7.3 ± 0.5 (SE) μmol/kg during glaciations. Oceanic carbon reorganisations during major climatic transitions caused deep-water [CO32−] deviations away from the long-term trend, and carbonate compensation processes subsequently acted to restore the ocean carbonate system to new steady state conditions. Deep-water [CO32−] showed similar patterns to sediment carbonate content (%CaCO3) records on glacial–interglacial timescales, suggesting that past seafloor %CaCO3 variations were dominated by deep-water carbonate preservation changes at our studied sites. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","alkalinity; carbonate compensation; carbonate ion; coral reef hypothesis; glacial","Alkalinity; Calcium carbonate; Deposition; Glacial geology; Ions; Oceanography; pH; Reefs; Carbonate deposition; Carbonate ions; Compensation process; Coral reef; Deep-water carbonates; Equatorial Pacific Ocean; glacial; Steady-state condition; Carbonation; alkalinity; calcium carbonate; carbonate; carbonate sediment; chemical oceanography; concentration (composition); deposition; glacial-interglacial cycle; ionic composition; marine sediment; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Equatorial); Anthozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019401149

This paper reviews the experiences of some southern African countries with the impacts of Jatropha biofuel development on sustainability, with a view to providing lessons for biofuel development policy for Botswana. The review has shown that most of the large commercial plantations planned to produce jatropha seed for home consumption and export were not economically viable mainly due to low seed yield, high cost of production, delayed production and uncompetitive feedstock prices. On the other hand, smallholder-based jatropha biofuel projects were economically viable due to their low input costs. Analysis of social impacts showed that jatropha production has been associated with loss of rights to land, low compensation levels, and compromised food security where land and other production inputs were diverted from food crops to jatropha production. Positive social impacts in some countries included increased employment opportunities and incomes. Jatropha production is associated with environmental impacts such as loss of biodiversity, high water requirements and high carbon debts resulting from conversion of land. Positive environmental impacts included high energy return on investment and high GHG savings when Jatropha is cultivated on abandoned agricultural fields as revealed by research in some parts of West Africa. Policy considerations for the Government of Botswana include: providing support to biofuel projects at their early stage of development, discouraging large plantation business models until such time that research in Botswana produces high seed-yielding Jatropha varieties, introducing legal safeguards for protection of land rights of local communities, and ensuring that land-use change and high carbon debts are minimized as they have adverse impacts on biodiversity and climate change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiesel production; Botswana; Energy policy; Jatropha projects; Southern Africa; Sustainability","agricultural production; biodiversity; biofuel; climate change; crop yield; cultivation; dicotyledon; economic development; energy policy; environmental impact; mitigation; price dynamics; sustainability; Botswana; Southern Africa; Jatropha; Jatropha curcas",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030623268

Aircraft contribute to local air pollution during the Landing and Take Off cycle. A big portion of the time aircraft spend on the ground is taken by taxi operations. Taxi times also increase at higher rates than traffic demand because of congestion at airports. Several measures are explored in the literature regarding the mitigation of taxi related emissions. These measures are often assessed by means of analytical approaches. In this article, the authors introduce a new micro simulation approach to assess aircraft ground movements with the aim of providing a more realistic estimation of taxi times. The approach is based on the definition of a discrete event model using a generic simulation software, AnyLogic 7. The new model is then used to assess the potential benefits and impacts deriving from the introduction of an environmental friendly taxi procedure at Lisbon International Airport. The simulated procedure envisages the utilization of TaxiBot, a semi-robotic towbarless tractor suitable for dispatch towing at medium to large airports. Results prove the alternative measure would potentially lead to environmental benefits in terms of fuel saved and emissions reduction. Considering an average day, both airports and airlines would gain in terms of, respectively, emitted pollutants and operational costs. Starting from these observations, possibilities for further research are explored. © 2017 IEEE.","airport congestion; green taxi; ground movement; Lisbon Airport; microsimulation; sustainability; TaxiBot","Airports; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Computer software; Discrete event simulation; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Pollution; Robotics; Sustainable development; Taxicabs; Tractors (truck); Transportation; Airport congestion; green taxi; Ground movement; Microsimulation; TaxiBot; Fighter aircraft",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030242127

The SO2 level was compared with other important pollutants concurrently measured, including methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter (PM10). If split into three different periods (period 1, 1987–1988, period 2, 1999–2000, and period 3, 2004–2013), the respective mean [SO2] values (6.57 ± 4.29, 6.30 ± 2.44, and 5.29 ± 0.63 ppb) showed a slight reduction across the entire study period. The concentrations of SO2 are found to be strongly correlated with other pollutants such as CO (r = 0.614, p = 0.02), which tracked reductions in reported emissions due to tighter emissions standards enacted by the South Korean government. There was also a clear seasonal trend in the SO2 level, especially in periods 2 and 3, reflecting the combined effects of domestic heating by coal briquettes and meteorological conditions. Although only a 16% concentration reduction was achieved during the 27-year study duration, this is significant if one considers rapid urbanization, an 83.2% increase in population, and rapid industrialization that took place during that period. Implications: Since 1970, a network of air quality monitoring (AQM) stations has been operated by the Korean Ministry of Environment (KMOE) for routine nationwide monitoring of air pollutant concentrations in urban/suburban areas. To date, the information obtained from these stations has provided a platform for analyzing long-term trends of major pollutant species. In this study, we examined the long-term trends of SO2 levels and relevant environmental parameters monitored continuously in the Yong-san district of Seoul between 1987 and 2013. The data were analyzed over various time scales (i.e., monthly, seasonal, and annual intervals). The results obtained from this study will allow us to assess the effectiveness of abatement strategy and to predict future concentrations trends in association with future abatement strategies and technologies. © 2017 A&WMA.",,"Carbon monoxide; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollutant concentrations; Air quality monitoring; Air quality monitoring stations; Atmospheric concentration; Concentration reduction; Environmental parameter; Meteorological condition; Ministry of environments; Air quality; carbon monoxide; methane; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; carbon monoxide; methane; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air monitoring; air pollutant; air quality; Article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; government; heating; human; industrialization; meteorological phenomena; particulate matter; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); seasonal variation; South Korea; temporal analysis; trend study; urbanization; air pollution; analysis; environmental monitoring; South Korea; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon Monoxide; Environmental Monitoring; Methane; Nitric Oxide; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Seoul; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020527469

Capacity expansion and operation costs of urban rail systems are brought forward energy efficiency improvements in the urban rail transportation. Accordingly, there is urgent need to use renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures for railway systems. Photovoltaic (PV) technology has not been widely applied to railway vehicles. It can lead to considerable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, a feasibility study on the use of PV panels for the interior lighting of the urban rail vehicles was performed. The feasibility study was carried out with HOMER software, which is version 3.1.4. After performing a literature review about integrating renewable energy sources to railway systems, a case study is developed to explore the application of solar energy systems for internal lighting of vehicles having got mathematical models of the solar system.

In this study, the rationality of the ice storage system for wind energy was investigated using the Rational Exergy Management Model, REMM for two options and compared with a base scenario, which comprises a wind turbine system, grid connection, conventional chillers, and the district cooling system. The main objective is to minimize exergy destructions and thus to improve the exergy performance. The first ice storage option is composed of wind turbines, deep chillers for ice making, ice storage tanks, and the district cooling system. The second option is similar to the first option but it also includes a ground-source heat pump upstream the deep chiller. These options were also compared against a mini-hydrogen economy (District size) alternative, which encompasses a hydrogen-water cycle with excess renewable energy-powered PEM electrolysis unit, hydrogen tank, fuel cell, absorption chiller, gas compression chiller, and the district cooling system. These two options and the hydrogen-water cycle alternative were compared in terms of their REMM efficiency, First and Second-law efficiencies, and the primary energy ratio. A new Sustainability Performance Index, namely SPI was also defined. SPI is the product of the REMM efficiency, First-Law Efficiency, and the load coincidence factor, CF of wind energy. In order to establish a realistic application background for the comparisons, first a nearly-net-zero exergy farmland (nZEXF) utilizing biogas, cogeneration, solar photovoltaics, heat, absorption cycle, ground-source heat pump, Organic Rankine Cycle, and wind turbines was introduced as a model. The primary objective of this study is to determine the best option with the least avoidable CO2 emissions responsibility of the systems considered in terms of the REMM efficiency in thermal or hydrogen storage systems. Results have been compared in terms of SPI with the base scenario and it has been concluded that the second option (SPI = 0.88) is better than the first option (SPI = 0.38). However, hydrogen storage is an even better alternative with an SPI value of 1.06.

New hydrological insights for the region Evapotranspiration (ET) and water yield (WY) with projected CO2, precipitation, and temperature during 2044–2070 were affected by each climate factor separately and synergistically. Increasing CO2 to 600 ppm only scenario resulted in an ET decrease (5–17%) which led to WY increase (17–36%). With projected temperature increases (1–5 °C) only scenarios, ET was projected to increase noticeably (12–112%) especially in winter and spring. The amount of projected ET increase was reduced by a CO2 increase to 600 ppm due to decreased stomatal conductance. Projected WY varied due to the high variability of future precipitation patterns (−54% to 33%) but generally increased when solely precipitation projections were applied. However, WY with combined effects of CO2, precipitation, and temperature did not show significant changes compared with the historical WY. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate interactions of precipitation, temperature, and CO2 to simulate future water availability in the North Carolina Piedmont. © 2017 The Authors","CO2 increment; NARCCAP; North Carolina Piedmont; Statistical bias correction; SWAT",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021138908

This accident was followed by the implementation of policies to reduce summer electricity consumption in the affected areas, for example, by limiting air-conditioning (AC) use. This provided a natural experimental scenario to investigate if these policies were associated with an increase in heat-related mortality. OBJECTIVES: We examined whether the reduced electricity consumption in warm season modified heat-related mortality from 2008 to 2012. METHODS: We conducted prefecture-specific interrupted time-series (ITS) analyses to compare temperature–mortality associations before and after the earthquake, and used meta-analysis to generate combined effect estimates for the most affected and less affected areas (prefectures with >10% or ≤10% reductions in electricity consumption, respectively). We then examined whether the temperature–mortality association in Tokyo, one of the most affected areas, was modified by the percent reduction in electricity consumption relative to expected consumption for comparable days before the earthquake. RESULTS: Contrary to expectations, we estimated a 5–9% reduction in all-cause heat-related mortality after the earthquake in the 15 prefectures with the greatest reduction in electricity consumption, and little change in the other prefectures. However, the percent reduction in observed vs. expected daily electricity consumption after the earthquake did not significantly modify daily heat-related mortality in Tokyo. CONCLUSIONS: In the prefectures with the greatest reductions in electricity consumption, heat-related mortality decreased rather than increased following the Great East Japan Earthquake. Additional research is needed to determine whether this finding holds for other populations and regions, and to clarify its implications for policies to reduce the consequences of climate change on health. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

While much of the problem is linked to China's broader reliance on coal and other fossil fuels across the energy system, road transportation is an important and growing source of air pollution. Here we use an energy-economic model, embedded in a Regional Emissions Air Quality Climate and Health (REACH) integrated assessment framework, to analyze the impacts of implementing vehicle emissions standards (ES) together with a broader economy-wide climate policy on total air pollution in five species and 30 Chinese provinces. We find that full and immediate implementation of existing vehicle ES at China 3/III level or tighter will significantly reduce the contribution of transportation to degraded air quality by 2030. We further show that road transport ES function as an important complement to an economy-wide price on CO2, which delivers significant co-benefits for air pollution reduction that are concentrated primarily in non-transportation sectors. Going forward, vehicle emissions standards and an economy-wide carbon price form a highly effective coordinated policy package that supports China's air quality and climate change mitigation goals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"Air quality; Air quality standards; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Coal transportation; Crashworthiness; Economics; Fossil fuels; Motor transportation; Pollution; Roads and streets; Transportation; Vehicles; Climate change mitigation; Energy-economic model; Integrated assessment; Pollution emissions; Pollution reduction; Road transportation; Transportation sector; Vehicle emission; Air pollution; air quality; atmospheric pollution; pollution policy; road transport; traffic emission; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018930064

The present study used an attributional life cycle assessment to investigate the carbon footprint and potential for nutrient recovery of two sanitation systems for a hypothetical urban area in Southern Sweden. The systems represented a typical Swedish conventional system and a possible source separation system with increased nutrient recovery. The assessment included the management chain from household collection, transport, treatment and final return of nutrients to agriculture or disposal of the residuals. The results for carbon footprint and nutrient recovery (phosphorus and nitrogen) concluded that the source separation system could increase nutrient recovery (0.30–0.38 kg P capita−1 year−1 and 3.10–3.28 kg N capita−1 year−1), while decreasing the carbon footprint (−24 to −58 kg CO2-eq. capita−1 year−1), compared to the conventional system. The nutrient recovery was increased by the use of struvite precipitation and ammonium stripping at the wastewater treatment plant. The carbon footprint decreased, mainly due to the increased biogas production, increased replacement of mineral fertilizer in agriculture and less emissions of nitrous oxide from wastewater treatment. In conclusion, the study showed that source separation systems could potentially be used to increase nutrient recovery from urban areas, while decreasing the climate impact. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Food waste; Life cycle assessment; Nutrient recovery; Source separation; Wastewater management","ammonia; nitrous oxide; struvite; phosphorus; waste water; ammonium; carbon footprint; eutrophication; food waste; life cycle analysis; nitrous oxide; sanitation; urban area; wastewater treatment; agriculture; Article; carbon footprint; climate; environmental sanitation; food waste; life cycle assessment; nutrient; urban area; waste water management; sewage; Sweden; waste water; Sweden; Carbon Footprint; Phosphorus; Sweden; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017025634

The emissions were calculated for a common maritime mission, the current ferry route between Vallejo CA and San Francisco CA. Calculations are made of the energy required for the SF-BREEZE and VALLEJO to perform the mission route profile. The SF-BREEZE requires 10.1% more fuel energy than the VALLEJO, primarily due to the SF-BREEZE being heavier. Estimates are made for the SF-BREEZE GHG emissions associated with five LH2 fuel production pathways including renewable and non-renewable (fossil-fuel based) methods. Estimates are also made for GHG emissions associated with fossil-diesel production and delivery as well as those for biodiesel, which can be considered a renewable “drop-in” fuel replacement for conventional diesel fuel. We find that the GHG emissions for the SF-BREEZE using non-renewable LH2 are significantly higher than for the Tier 4 diesel-fueled VALLEJO on a per passenger basis. However, using renewable LH2, the GHG emissions for the SF-BREEZE ferry are reduced 75.8% compared to the diesel-fueled VALLEJO operating at Tier 4 emissions standards. We also compare the criteria pollutant emissions (NOx, HC, PM10) for the SF-BREEZE to that of the VALLEJO held to Tier 4 emissions standards fueled by diesel fuel or biodiesel. Hydrogen PEM fuel cell technology dramatically reduces NOx and HC emissions below the most advanced Tier 4 criteria pollutant emissions requirements regardless of whether the LH2 is made by NG reforming or via water electrolysis using 70% renewable energy. Renewable LH2 made with greater than 84% renewable process energy is needed to also drop the SF-BREEZE PM10 emissions below that of Tier 4 for high-speed fuel cell ferry transportation. Overall, the results show that operating a hydrogen fuel cell ferry on nearly 100% renewable hydrogen provides the dramatic reduction in GHG and criteria pollutant emissions commensurate with the problems of global climate change and maritime air pollution worldwide. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Criteria pollutant emissions; Ferry emissions; GHG emissions; Hydrogen; PEM fuel cell","Air quality; Biodiesel; Climate change; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Drops; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Hydrogen; Pollution; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Standards; Water pollution; GHG emission; Global climate changes; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Maritime air pollutions; PEM fuel cell; Pollutant emission; Renewable energies; Renewable hydrogens; Greenhouse gases; biofuel; carbon emission; comparative study; fuel cell; greenhouse gas; hydrogen sulfide; renewable resource; vessel; California; San Francisco [California]; United States; Vallejo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019970975

In many regions of the world, public and domestic gardens contain a huge pool of non-native plants. Climate change may relax constraints on their naturalization and hence facilitate hybridization with related species in the resident flora. Here, we evaluate this possible increase in hybridization risk by predicting changes in the overlap of climatically suitable ranges between a set of garden plants and their congeners in the resident flora. Location: Europe. Methods: From the pool of alien garden plants, we selected those which (1) are not naturalized in Europe, but established outside their native range elsewhere in the world; (2) belong to a genus where interspecific hybridization has been previously reported; and (3) have congeners in the native and naturalized flora of Europe. For the resulting set of 34 alien ornamentals as well as for 173 of their European congeners, we fitted species distribution models and projected suitable ranges under the current climate and three future climate scenarios. Changes in range overlap between garden plants and congeners were then assessed by means of the true skill statistic. Results: Projections suggest that under a warming climate, suitable ranges of garden plants will increase, on average, while those of their congeners will remain constant or shrink, at least under the more severe climate scenarios. The mean overlap in ranges among congeners of the two groups will decrease. Variation among genera is pronounced; however, and for some congeners, range overlap is predicted to increase significantly. Main conclusions: Averaged across all modelled species, our results do not indicate that hybrids between potential future invaders and resident species will emerge more frequently in Europe when climate warms. These average trends do not preclude, however, that hybridization risk may considerably increase in particular genera. © 2017 The Authors.

Previous studies have shown that climate change, increasing atmospheric CO2, and human demographic dynamics can lead to substantially altered wildfire risk in the future, with fire activity increasing in some regions and decreasing in others. The present study re-examines these results from the perspective of air pollution risk, focussing on emissions of airborne particulate matter (PM2. 5), combining an existing ensemble of simulations using a coupled fire-dynamic vegetation model with current observation-based estimates of wildfire emissions and simulations with a chemical transport model. Currently, wildfire PM2. 5 emissions exceed those from anthropogenic sources in large parts of the world. We further analyse two extreme sets of future wildfire emissions in a socio-economic, demographic climate change context and compare them to anthropogenic emission scenarios reflecting current and ambitious air pollution legislation. In most regions of the world, ambitious reductions of anthropogenic air pollutant emissions have the potential to limit mean annual pollutant PM2. 5 levels to comply with World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines for PM2. 5. Worst-case future wildfire emissions are not likely to interfere with these annual goals, largely due to fire seasonality, as well as a tendency of wildfire sources to be situated in areas of intermediate population density, as opposed to anthropogenic sources that tend to be highest at the highest population densities. However, during the high-fire season, we find many regions where future PM2. 5 pollution levels can reach dangerous levels even for a scenario of aggressive reduction of anthropogenic emissions. © 2017 Author(s).",,"air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; hazard assessment; livelihood; particulate matter; population density; twenty first century; wildfire",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026656877

CO2 emissions from aviation have been included in the EU-ETS since 2012, and all airlines operating in Europe are required to report and submit allowances against those emissions. The EU-ETS is only applied to flights that begin or end in EU territory, therefore one of the options non-EU based airlines use to deal with the EU-ETS requirements is aircraft reassignment or flight route adjustment. We investigate strategic airline operations that address the carbon constraints on the air transport industry. A mathematical model and algorithm are developed to derive efficient strategies for airline operations in terms of aircraft reassignment and route adjustment.

Methane has been one of the key molecules in these investigations. In earlier studies, strongly reducing gas mixtures containing methane and ammonia were used to simulate possible reactions in the primitive atmosphere of Earth, producing amino acids and other organic compounds. Since Earth's early atmosphere is now considered to be less reducing, the contribution of extraterrestrial organics to chemical evolution has taken on an important role. Such organic molecules may have come from molecular clouds and regions of star formation that created protoplanetary disks, planets, asteroids, and comets. The interstellar origin of organics has been examined both experimentally and theoretically, including laboratory investigations that simulate interstellar molecular reactions. Endogenous and exogenous organics could also have been supplied to the primitive ocean, making submarine hydrothermal systems plausible sites of the generation of life. Experiments that simulate such hydrothermal systems where methane played an important role have consequently been conducted. Processes that occur in other Solar System bodies offer clues to the prebiotic chemistry of Earth. Titan and other icy bodies, where methane plays significant roles, are especially good targets. In the case of Titan, methane is both in the atmosphere and in liquidospheres that are composed of methane and other hydrocarbons, and these have been studied in simulation experiments. Here, we review the wide range of experimental work in which these various terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments have been modeled, and we examine the possible role of methane in chemical evolution. © 2017 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Interstellar environments; Methane; Origin of life; Submarine hydrothermal systems; Titan","methane; prebiotic agent; astronomy; atmosphere; space; Atmosphere; Evolution, Chemical; Extraterrestrial Environment; Methane; Prebiotics; Solar System",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027847480

Here, a novel combination strategy utilizing carbon ion irradiation as a high–linear energy transfer (LET) radiotherapy and a thermo-triggered nanodevice is proposed, and drug accumulation in the tumor and treatment effects are evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging relaxometry and immunohistology (Ki-67, n = 15). The thermo-triggered liposomal anticancer nanodevice was administered into colon-26 tumor-grafted mice, and drug accumulation and efficacy was compared for 6 groups (n = 32) that received or did not receive the radiotherapy and thermo trigger. In vivo quantitative R1 maps visually demonstrated that the multimodal thermosensitive polymer-modified liposomes (MTPLs) can accumulate in the tumor tissue regardless of whether the region was irradiated by carbon ions or not. The tumor volume after combination treatment with carbon ion irradiation and MTPLs with thermo-triggering was significantly smaller than all the control groups at 8 days after treatment.

This imine-forming reaction is applied in fields as diverse as polymer chemistry, biomaterials and hydrogels, dynamic combinatorial chemistry, organic synthesis, and chemical biology. Here we outline chemical developments in this field, with special focus on the past ∼10 years of developments. Recent strategies for installing reactive carbonyl groups and α-nucleophiles into biomolecules are described. The basic chemical properties of reactants and products in this reaction are then reviewed, with an eye to understanding the reaction's mechanism and how reactant structure controls rates and equilibria in the process. Recent work that has uncovered structural features and new mechanisms for speeding the reaction, sometimes by orders of magnitude, is discussed. We describe recent studies that have identified especially fast reacting aldehyde/ketone substrates and structural effects that lead to rapid-reacting α-nucleophiles as well. Among the most effective new strategies has been the development of substituents near the reactive aldehyde group that either transfer protons at the transition state or trap the initially formed tetrahedral intermediates. In addition, the recent development of efficient nucleophilic catalysts for the reaction is outlined, improving greatly upon aniline, the classical catalyst for imine formation. A number of uses of such second- and third-generation catalysts in bioconjugation and in cellular applications are highlighted. While formation of hydrazone and oxime has been traditionally regarded as being limited by slow rates, developments in the past 5 years have resulted in completely overturning this limitation; indeed, the reaction is now one of the fastest and most versatile reactions available for conjugations of biomolecules and biomaterials. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Aldehydes; Bioassay; Biochips; Biomolecules; Catalysts; Microarrays; Molecular biology; Nitrogen compounds; Nucleophiles; Cellular applications; Chemical development; Dynamic combinatorial chemistry; Orders of magnitude; Organic synthesis; Structural effect; Structural feature; Tetrahedral intermediates; Reaction rates; biomaterial; hydrazone derivative; imine; oxime; catalysis; chemical structure; chemistry; synthesis; Biocompatible Materials; Catalysis; Hydrazones; Imines; Molecular Structure; Oximes",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027254811

For this purpose, a combined use of the airmass origin fractions (AOFs) and regionally resolved mean ages (RMAs) is presented. This approach merges the concept of the origin of air with the wellknown theory of the mean age of air (AoA) for different regions covering the whole Earth. The authors show how the AoA calculated relative to Earth's surface can be decomposed into regionally resolved components (i.e., into RMAs). Using both AOFs and RMAs, the authors discuss differences in the seasonality of transport from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres into the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), the asymmetries of the interhemispheric exchange, and differences in relation to the continental or oceanic origin of air. Furthermore, a simplified transport model for a chemically passive species (tracer) is formulated that has some potential to approximate the full transport within a CTM. This analytic approach uses the AOFs as well as the RMAs as parameters to propagate a tracer prescribed on Earth's surface (lower boundary condition). This method is exactly valid for sources that change linearly with time in each of the considered regions. The authors analyze how well this approach approximates the propagation of CO2 from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) into the whole atmosphere. The CO2 values in the PBL are specified by the CarbonTracker dataset. The authors discuss how this approach can be used for inverse modeling of CO2. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.",,"Boundary layers; Inverse problems; Analytic approach; Complex chemistry; Lower boundary conditions; Planetary boundary layers; Southern Hemisphere; Transport modeling; Transport process; Tropical tropopause layers; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027412030

This paper presents a cost-effective method to estimate methane emissions using ambient air methane measurements taken within a landfill. Stochastic search techniques combined with the standard Gaussian dispersion model are employed to identify locations and emission rates of potential emission sources. Four stochastic search techniques are tested and compared. Results show effectiveness of the optimization-based emission estimation and source-locating scheme. Two hand-generated case-studies showed that methane flux estimation-error is lower than 15%. The method proves also useful in identifying locations of emission sources.

The δ13Ccarb profiles exhibit sequential negative/positive fluctuations, which are correlatable with the reported worldwide sequential negative-shift events, enabled further stratigraphic division of the successions to stages and sub-stages. The successions changed their relative siliciclastic content relative to the degree of influence of each terrestrial influx source (eastern or southern), an outcome of humid up to extreme aridization hinterland exchanges, actually recording the expansion or contraction of the paleo-ITCZ. The δ18O profiles exhibited a range of values (− 5‰ to − 7.5‰ on average) typical to the western NeoTethys and similar to the reported worldwide climate trends with three major warming periods: (I) Late Permian to the PTB; (II) Late Dienerian - most of the Smithian; (III) early-mid Anisian, and two relatively cool periods: Griesbachian-Dienerian and Late Smithian – Spathian, but each of the three periods exhibiting short respites with the opposite trend. The δ13Ccarb, δ18Ocarb and the δ13Corg profiles of the proximal position consistently differ in magnitude from the distal ones, assuming a high contribution and involvement of meteoric water rich in terrestrial OM derived from the nearby supercontinent and affecting also the original water δ18Oseawater value (calculated to about − 3‰),which seemingly should be applied on the entire western Tethys seaway.

The initial data were collected from 30 tea producers using a face-to-face questionnaire. Two models including constant return to scale (CCR) and variable return to scale (BCC) were used for calculating efficiency scores. Simultaneously, ten impact categories (AD, AC, EP, GW, OLD, FE, ME, HT, TE, and PO) were assessed to identify the main problem areas in the tea farms. The results indicated that the average technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency were 0.881, 0.979, and 0.897, respectively. Moreover, the total energy saving was computed to be in the range of 7193 MJ ha−1. The highest share of total energy saving potential belonged to nitrogen with 65.93% observed. Based on the results, nitrogen, diesel fuel and machinery were the main hotspots in the majority of impact categories in both of present and DEA farms. Furthermore, in this study, the potential for impact category reduction was investigated and the results illustrated that between 17 and 20% of emissions can be reduced by converting present to DEA farms.

However, the link between energy, sanitation, and agricultural productivity is often neglected. Hence, the potential self-sufficient nature of many smallholdings in sub-Saharan Africa is underexploited. Objective To compare those cooking and sanitation technologies most commonly used in north-western Tanzania with locally developed alternatives, with respect to (i) resource consumption, (ii) potential to recover resources, and (iii) environmental emissions. This study examines technologies at the household level, and was carried out using material flow analysis (MFA). The specific bioenergy technologies analysed include: three-stone fires; charcoal burners; improved cooking stoves (ICS), such as rocket and microgasifier stoves; and biogas systems. The specific sanitation alternatives studied comprise: pit latrines; two approaches to EcoSan; and septic systems. Results The use of ICS reduces total resource consumption; using charcoal or biogas does not. The residues from microgasifiers were analysed as having a substantial recovery potential for carbon (C) and phosphorus (P). The fact that input substrates for biogas digesters are post-agricultural in nature means that biogas slurry is not considered an ‘untapped resource’ despite its ample nutrient content. Exchanging pit latrines for water-based sanitation systems places heavy pressure on already scarce water resources for local smallholders. In contrast, the implementation of waterless EcoSan facilities significantly promotes nutrient recovery and reduces environmental emissions, particularly through greenhouse gas emission and nutrient leaching. Conclusions Recycled outputs from the triple energy-sanitation-agriculture nexus display complementary benefits: residues from cooking can be used to restore organic matter in soils, while sanitation residues contribute to fertilisation. The combination of microgasifiers and EcoSan-facilities is the most appropriate in order to simultaneously optimise resource consumption, reduce environmental impacts, and maximise recycling-based soil management in smallholder farming systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biochar; Biogas slurry; Carbon recovery; EcoSan; Nutrient recycling; Resource-oriented technology assessment","Agriculture; Agronomy; Biogas; Charcoal; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent control; Natural resources management; Nutrients; Productivity; Pulp digesters; Recovery; Recycling; Resource allocation; Rockets; Soils; Water resources; Bio chars; Biogas slurry; Carbon recovery; EcoSan; Nutrient recycling; Technology assessments; Sanitation; biogas; carbon; charcoal; phosphorus; water; agricultural production; biochar; energy resource; material flow analysis; recycling; resource management; sanitation; smallholder; waste technology; agricultural slurry; agriculture; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; cooking; energy; energy consumption; environmental sanitation; flow measurement; household; leaching; material flow analysis; recycling; Tanzania; water supply; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014596916

Understanding the impact of changes in temperature and precipitation on socio-ecological systems is therefore not enough. Insights into the complexity of urban development, social inequalities, economics and politics are needed. To address this complexity, the article focuses on the challenges associated with socio-environmental fragmentation patterns and residential vulnerability, since the interlinkages between them contribute substantially to furthering insights into the specifics of ‘urban’ vulnerabilities to climate-related hazards.

This paper focuses on the assessment of the proposed green strategies in the master plan. Firstly, numerical simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting were conducted for the present land use condition as well as the condition proposed by the master plan under the same extremely hot summer conditions of June 2010. Secondly, the results of the master plan condition were further compared with other scenarios comprising different green strategies for assessing their cooling effects. Based on the results, the daytime peak air temperature in the master plan condition was projected to maintain almost the same level as the current condition. However, the high temperature areas with temperature of 40–41 °C, would expand widely over the planned built-up areas. Further results showed that the green strategies were not necessarily effective at cooling all of the built-up areas, though these strategies largely reduced the air temperature within the green spaces, particularly at night. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Developing cities; Future urbanisation; Master plan; Urban heat island; Weather research and forecasting","Atmospheric temperature; Landforms; Population statistics; Weather forecasting; Developing cities; Future urbanisation; Master plan; Urban heat island; Weather research and forecasting; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017583562

It also highlights some issues related to atmospheric Nr in this region. Based upon various reports, Indian Nr emissions are estimated to be 6.24Tg per year whereas annual Nr depositions are estimated to be 3.61Tg per year. The balance Nr could have been distributed among intermediate phases such as cultivation biological nitrogen fixation, Nr losses as gases, runoff, leaching, and accumulation. The nitrogenous fertilizers, fossil fuels, and livestock are the major contributors to Nr emissions. However, there are large uncertainties in the estimates, especially N2O inventories from livestock have vast differences. Wet deposition (1.97Tg) of Nr species is almost equal to the dry deposition (1.67Tg) indicating that both these removal processes are equally important for Indian region. According to the estimates, gaseous ammonia contributes the highest flux among N-NH3, N-NH4, and N-NO3. Significant amount of gaseous ammonia is contributed by multiple sources such as intensive agriculture, human population, biomass burning, disposal of untreated sewage, and municipal wastes. In addition, higher temperature and alkaline nature of aerosol and dust particles also support building up of NH3 in the atmosphere in Indian subcontinent. Measurements revealed that rural sites had higher deposition fluxes of NH3 as compared to urban sites due to increased agricultural and other related activities in the village which contribute atmospheric NH3. Indo-Gangetic plain has been reported as the region of high deposition of NH4 and NO3 which is probably due to high population density and related activities. Among different categories of sites (rural, suburban, urban, and industrial), wet deposition fluxes of NH4-N are found to be higher than NO3-N at rural as well as urban areas. However, the highest ratios of wet fluxes of (NH4-N)/(NO3-N) are noticed in industrial areas. Similarly, due to rapid urbanization and industrialization, remarkable increase in wet deposition fluxes of NH4 and NO3 has been reported at Delhi between 1994 and 2011. A similar scenario can be in found other urban areas too. Hence, considering the present growth rate of development and consumption of fertilizers and fossil fuels, adverse effects of perturbed N cycle are inevitable if we fail to immediately control the man-made nitrogen imbalance. In order to evaluate future emission trends and possible consequences, it is suggested to develop a proper design of a program for an integrated assessment of Nr in this region. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

It is, therefore, necessary to have robust techniques for speedy assessment of forest biophysical parameters at the landscape level. It is arduous and time taking to monitor the status of vast forest landscapes using traditional field methods. Remote sensing and GIS techniques are efficient tools that can monitor the health of forests regularly. Biomass estimation is a key parameter in the assessment of forest health. Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) remote sensing has already shown its potential for forest biophysical parameter retrieval. The current research work focuses on the retrieval of forest biophysical parameters of tropical deciduous forest, using fully polarimetric spaceborne C-band data with Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (PolInSAR) techniques. PolSAR based Interferometric Water Cloud Model (IWCM) has been used to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB). Input parameters to the IWCM have been extracted from the decomposition modeling of SAR data as well as PolInSAR coherence estimation. The technique of forest tree height retrieval utilized PolInSAR coherence based modeling approach. Two techniques – Coherence Amplitude Inversion (CAI) and Three Stage Inversion (TSI) – for forest height estimation are discussed, compared and validated. These techniques allow estimation of forest stand height and true ground topography. The accuracy of the forest height estimated is assessed using ground-based measurements. PolInSAR based forest height models showed enervation in the identification of forest vegetation and as a result height values were obtained in river channels and plain areas. Overestimation in forest height was also noticed at several patches of the forest. To overcome this problem, coherence and backscatter based threshold technique is introduced for forest area identification and accurate height estimation in non-forested regions. IWCM based modeling for forest AGB retrieval showed R 2 value of 0.5, RMSE of 62.73 (t ha −1 ) and a percent accuracy of 51%. TSI based PolInSAR inversion modeling showed the most accurate result for forest height estimation. The correlation between the field measured forest height and the estimated tree height using TSI technique is 62% with an average accuracy of 91.56% and RMSE of 2.28 m. The study suggested that PolInSAR coherence based modeling approach has significant potential for retrieval of forest biophysical parameters. © 2017 COSPAR","Aboveground biomass; Coherence amplitude inversion; Interferometric Water Cloud Model; Polarimetric SAR Interferometry; Three Stage Inversion; Tree height","Biomass; Biophysics; Cloud computing; Ecosystems; Interferometry; Parameter estimation; Polarimeters; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Above ground biomass; Interferometric water cloud models; Polarimetric SAR interferometry; Three Stage Inversion; Tree height; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020097768

Traditional Ricardian studies at the country and regional levels reveal that net revenue is affected by seasonal climate. A structural Ricardian model of growing season choice reveals climate change will reduce net revenues in the near term by 4-8% and in the long term by 10-18%. The implications of this impact on key sustainable development goals such as poverty reduction is likely to be profound. The study finds that farmers who rely on cultivating in three seasons will be especially hard hit by climate change relative to those that rely only on a single season. The results indicate that farmers will switch from 3 seasons to 1 season per year and reduce some of the losses that they would otherwise sustain. An analysis of crop adaptation finds that farmers will also adjust irrigation, crop choice, and the timing of planting in response to climate change. The livestock adaptation study finds that farmers will move towards livestock as climate warms. Farmers will also shift their choice of species away from large animals and move towards small animals. An analysis of perceptions finds that farmers throughout the region are aware that temperature is rising and they generally perceive that precipitation is falling. Half of the farmers interviewed have begun to take measures such as those reported in this study to adapt to climate change. The overall results suggest that acting on their self-interest, the agriculture sector will undertake a great deal of adaptation on its own. However, measures taken by the government such as providing up-to-date weather reports, extension, irrigation and assistance with new varieties can also be effective. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","adaptation; agriculture; Climate change; impact; South-East Asia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028347438

The aim of this study is to understand trace element contents and carbon-oxygen isotope ratios in different originated magnesite, magnesite bearing huntite, and hydromagnesite deposits. Also, the element contents and isotope ratios of the magnesite occurrences are to compare with each other and similar magnesite occurrences in Turkey and world. It is found that the Madenli magnesite occurrences in the Şarkikaraağaç ophiolites, Aşağıtırtar magnesite bearing huntite deposits in the lacustrine rocks of the Miocene-Pliocene, and the Salda hydromagnesite deposits in lacustrine basin on the Yeşilova ophiolites. The paragenesis contains a common carbonate mineral magnesite, less calcite, serpentine, smectite, dolomite, and talc in the Madenli magnesite occurrences, mostly huntite and locally magnesite, dolomite, calcite, illite, quartz, and smectite in the Aşağıtırtar huntite-magnesite occurrences, and only hydromagnesite mineral in the Salda Lake hydromagnesite occurrences. Vein and stockwork Madenli magnesite deposits were recognized by higher total iron oxide concentrations (mean 1.10 wt%) than sedimentary Aşağıtırtar magnesite bearing huntite (mean 0.13 wt%) and lacustrine Salda hydromagnesite (mean 0.22 wt%) deposits. It is suggested that high Fe content (up to 5%) in the magnesite associated with ultramafic rocks than those from sedimentary environments (≤1% Fe). Based on average Ni, Co, Ba, Sr, As and Zr contents in the magnesite deposits, average Ni (134.63 ppm) and Co (15.19 ppm) contents in the Madenli magnesite and Salda hydromagnesite (36.85 ppm for Ni, 3.15 ppm for Co) have higher values than Aşağıtırtar huntite + magnesite (7.67 ppm for Ni and 0.89 ppm for Co). Average Ni-Co contents of these deposits can have close values depending on ophiolite host rock. Average Ba values of the Madenli (108.09 ppm) and Aşağıtırtar (115.88 ppm) areas are higher than those of Salda hydromagnesite (13.15 ppm). Sediment-hosted Aşağıtırtar magnesite-huntite deposits have the highest Sr contents (mean 505.81 ppm) as reasonably different from ultrabasic rock-related Madenli magnesite (mean 38.76 ppm) and Salda hydromagnesite (mean 36.70 ppm). The highest Sr content of sedimentary Aşağıtırtar deposits reveals that Sr is related to carbonate rocks. As and Zr contents have the highest average values (As 52.76 ppm and Zr 9.67 ppm) in the Aşağıtırtar deposits different from Madenli magnesite (As 0.54 ppm and Zr 1.67 ppm) and Salda hydromagnesite (As 0.5 ppm and Zr 2.58 ppm) deposits. High As and Zr concentrations in the Aşağıtırtar magnesite-huntite deposits may come from volcanic rocks in near country rocks. The δ 13C (PDB) isotope values vary between −10.1 and −11.4‰ in the Madenli magnesite, 7.8 to 8.8‰ for huntite, 1.7 to 8.3‰ for huntite + magnesite and 4.0‰ for limestone + magnesite in the Aşağıtırtar huntite-magnesite deposits, and 4.4 to 4.9‰ for Salda Lake hydromagnesite. The sources of the CO2 are hydrothermal solutions, meteoric waters, groundwater dissolved carbon released from fresh water carbonates and marine limestone, soil CO2, and plant C3 in the Madenli magnesite, and may be deep seated metamorphic reactions in limestone and shales of rich in terms of organic matter. The sources of CO2 in Aşağıtırtar huntite and Salda hydromagnesite were meteoric water, groundwater dissolved inorganic carbon, fresh water carbonates, and marine limestone. The δ 18O (SMOW) isotope composition ranges from 26.8 to 28.1‰ in the Madenli magnesite, 30.4 to 32.4‰ for huntite and 29.8 to 35.5‰ for huntite + magnesite and 26.9‰ for limestone + magnesite in the Aşağıtırtar area, and 36.4 to 38.2‰ in the Salda Lake hydromagnesite. The Salda Lake hydromagnesite has heavier oxygen isotopic values than others. The sources of oxygen in the Madenli magnesite deposits are hydrothermal solutions, meteoric water, freshwater carbonates, and marine limestone, but the sources of oxygen of the Aşağıtırtar magnesite-huntite are meteoric water, fresh water carbonates, and marine limestone. The Salda Lake hydromagnesite has very high δ18O isotope values indicating a strong evaporitic environment. Magnesium (Mg+2) and silica are released by disintegration of very weathered-serpentinized ultrabasic rocks of all magnesite deposits and from partly dolomite and dolomitic limestone in the Aşağıtırtar magnesite bearing huntite deposits. In the Aşağıtırtar area, calcium (Ca+2) for huntite mineralization is provided by surrounding carbonate rocks. Based on isotopic data, host rocks, petrographic properties of the Madenli magnesite can be described as an ultramafic-associated hydrothermal vein mineralization corresponding to “Kraubath type” deposits, but Aşağıtırtar ve Salda Lake deposits are sedimentary mineralization (lacustrine/evaporitic) corresponding to “Bela Stena type” deposits. The estimated temperature using average δ18O isotope values is about 33.51 °C for Madenli magnesite, 48.33 °C for Aşağıtırtar huntite-magnesite, and 25 °C for Salda hydromagnesite. Based on isotope data, we can be say that the Madenli magnesite, Aşağıtırtar magnesite-huntite, and Salda hydromagnesite occur at low to moderate-low temperature water and alkaline (pH 8.5–10.5) under surface or near-surface conditions. © 2017, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Huntite; Hydromagnesite; Isotope geochemistry; Lake District (Southwestern Anatolia Turkey); Magnesite; Trace elements","carbon isotope; carbonate rock; chemical composition; geochemistry; host rock; iron oxide; lacustrine deposit; limestone; magnesite; mineral deposit; mineralization; nappe; oxygen isotope; paragenesis; sedimentary sequence; trace element; Anatolia; Burdur [Turkey]; Burdur [Turkey]; Isparta [Turkey]; Salda Lake; Turkey; Lycia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027030601

Understanding the nature and magnitude of the dryness and drought events are crucial mainly in semi-arid regions characterized by water shortage and warm/hot and dry Mediterranean type climate. The present article analyses the major patterns of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the climatological dryness in Turkey. This study adopts a relatively new approach for characterizing the dryness over a certain region; dry days since last rain (DDSLR). The DDSLR in a certain place can be evaluated using three different metrics; its severity, consistency and temporal uncertainty enabling to present intra- and inter-annual variations of the dryness. The DDSLR is also coupled with the Mediterranean Climate Index (MCI) approach, measuring the seasonality of rainfall. Analyses were based on daily precipitation data recorded at 69 principal climatological and synoptic meteorological stations of the Turkish Meteorological Service network during the period 1970–2011. The spatial distributions of the MCI and the various DDSLR metrics are presented and analysed. Overall, the three metrics of the DDSLR show their highest values in southern parts of Turkey along the Mediterranean and the borders with Syria and Iraq. These dryness indices are even larger than in central Turkey which receives less annual rainfall. On the other hand, dryness is at its minimum along the Black Sea in northern Turkey. Logarithmic equations of the type f( DDSLR ) = a × ln(MCI) + b were fitted to describe the dependence of these metrics on the MCI. All regressions are highly significant and enable to evaluate these metrics even in regions without daily data. Finally, linear trends of the longest DDSLR in each year were calculated and reveal trends toward more severe dry conditions in north-western Turkey and less severe dry conditions in east Turkey. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society","daily precipitation; dryness; Mediterranean Climate Index (MCI); spatial distribution; temporal variability; Turkey","Climatology; Drought; Rain; Spatial distribution; Daily precipitations; Dryness; Mediterranean climates; Temporal variability; Turkey; Precipitation (meteorology); drought; dry season; Mediterranean environment; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; regional climate; seasonality; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal variation; trend analysis; uncertainty analysis; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017383995

The impact of disease caused by a virus depends on the virus species, strains, type of inoculum, host plant characteristics, vector pressure, climatic conditions, trade, changes in agricultural landscape and intensive production practices. Viruses affect plants by causing a large variety of symptoms such as alteration of shape, pigmentation, necrosis on different parts of the plant, thus affecting plant development. In most of the cases, these lead to a decrease in crop yield and quality. There are numerous viruses that affect potato; among them, Potato virus Y is considered to be one of the ten most important plant viruses of crops, because of its worldwide distribution and economic impact. Some PVY isolates are able to cause potato ringspot necrotic disease in infected tubers rendering them unmarketable. Understanding the genetic diversity and molecular biology of PVY is essential to understand its infectious cycle, epidemiology and developing efficient methods of control and management for the virus itself and its vector. In spite of an ever-increasing wealth of data in these topics, several major scientific challenges remain in understanding the molecular nature of the interaction between PVY, its hosts, aphid vector in different environments and the epidemiology of PVY.

To investigate the role of apoplastic hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2) in gymnosperm phenolic metabolism, an extracellular lignin-forming cell culture of Norway spruce (Picea abies) was used as a research model. Scavenging of apoplastic H2 O2 by potassium iodide repressed lignin formation, in line with peroxidases activating monolignols for lignin polymerization. Time-course analyses coupled to candidate substrate-product pair network propagation revealed differential accumulation of low-molecular-weight phenolics, including (glycosylated) oligolignols, (glycosylated) flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins, in lignin-forming and H2 O2 -scavenging cultures and supported that monolignols are oxidatively coupled not only in the cell wall but also in the cytoplasm, where they are coupled to other monolignols and proanthocyanidins. Dilignol glycoconjugates with reduced structures were found in the culture medium, suggesting that cells are able to transport glycosylated dilignols to the apoplast. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that scavenging of apoplastic H2 O2 resulted in remodulation of the transcriptome, with reduced carbon flux into the shikimate pathway propagating down to monolignol biosynthesis. Aggregated coexpression network analysis identified candidate enzymes and transcription factors for monolignol oxidation and apoplastic H2O2 production in addition to potential H2O2 receptors. The results presented indicate that the redox state of the apoplast has a profound influence on cellular metabolism. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

We first estimated field-level post-harvest rice residues, including separate fuel-loading factors for rice straw and rice stubble. Results suggested fuel-loading factors of 0.27 kg m-2 (±0.033), 0.61 kg m-2 (±0.076), and 0.88 kg m-2 (±0.083) for rice straw, stubble, and total post-harvest biomass, respectively. Using these factors, we quantified potential emissions from rice residue burning and compared our estimates with other studies. Our results suggest total rice residue burning emissions as 2.24 Gg PM2.5, 36.54 Gg CO and 567.79 Gg CO2 for Hanoi Province, which are significantly higher than earlier studies. We attribute our higher emission estimates to improved fuel-loading factors; moreover, we infer that some earlier studies relying on residue-to-product ratios could be underestimating rice residue emissions by more than a factor of 2.3 for Hanoi, Vietnam. Using the rice planted area data from the Vietnamese government, and combining our fuel-loading factors, we also estimated rice residue PM2.5 emissions for the entirety of Vietnam and compared these estimates with an existing all-sources emissions inventory, and the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED). Results suggest 75.98 Gg of PM2.5 released from rice residue burning accounting for 12.8% of total emissions for Vietnam. The GFED database suggests 42.56 Gg PM2.5 from biomass burning with 5.62 Gg attributed to agricultural waste burning indicating satellite-based methods may be significantly underestimating emissions.

We used an automatic station to measure soil CO2 concentrations and oxidation-reduction potential over the 2014 and 2015 flood cycles of a tree island in the Pantanal that is immune to inundation during the wetland's annual flooding. The soil CO2 concentration profile was then used to estimate soil CO2 efflux over the two periods. In 2014, subsurface soil saturation at 0.30 m depth created conditions in that layer that led to CO2 buildup close to 200,000 ppm and soil oxidation-reduction potential below −300 mV, conditions that were not repeated in 2015 due to annual variability in soil saturation at the site. Mean CO2 efflux over the 2015 flood cycle was 0.023 ± 0.103 mg CO2-C m−2 s−1 representing a total annual efflux of 593 ± 2690 mg CO2-C m−2 y−1. Unlike a nearby tree island site that experiences full inundation during the wet season, here the soil dried quickly following repeated rain events throughout the year, which led to the release of CO2 pulses from the soil. This study highlights not only the complexity and heterogeneity in the Pantanal's carbon balance based on differences in topography, flood cycles, and vegetation but also the challenges of applying the gradient method in the Pantanal due to deviations from steady state conditions. ©2017.

Since 2012, New Zealand has suffered from an epidemic of infectious bovine anaemia associated with T. orientalis, an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite of cattle and buffaloes. The aim of this study was to predict the spatial distribution of habitat suitability of New Zealand for the tick H. longicornis using a simple rule-based climate envelope model, to validate the model against published data and use the validated model to project an expansion in habitat suitability for H. longicornis under two alternative climate change scenarios for the periods 2046–2065 and 2081–2100, relative to the climate of 1981–2010. A rule-based climate envelope model was developed based on the environmental requirements for off-host tick survival. The resulting model was validated against a maximum entropy environmental niche model of environmental suitability for T. orientalis transmission and against a H. longicornis occurrence map. Validation was completed using the I-similarity statistic and by linear regression. The H. longicornis climate envelope model predicted that 75% of cattle farms in the North Island, 3% of cattle farms in the South Island and 54% of cattle farms in New Zealand overall have habitats potentially suitable for the establishment of H. longicornis. The validation methods showed an acceptable level of agreement between the envelope model and published data. Both of the climate change scenarios, for each of the time periods, projected only slight to moderate increases in the average farm habitat suitability scores for all the South Island regions. However, only for the West Coast, Marlborough, Tasman, and Nelson regions did these increases in environmental suitability translate into an increased proportion of cattle farms with low or high H. longicornis habitat suitability. These results will have important implications for the geographical progression of Theileria-associated bovine anaemia (TABA) in New Zealand and will also be of interest to Haemaphysalis longicornis researchers in Australia, Japan, Korea and New Zealand. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bovine; Climate change; Haemaphysalis longicornis; New Zealand; Species distribution modelling; Theileria orientalis; Theileriosis","arthropod vector; Article; cattle disease; cattle farming; climate change; climate envelope model; controlled study; ecological niche; entropy; environmental factor; habitat; Haemaphysalis longicornis; livestock; New Zealand; nonhuman; parasite transmission; prediction; species distribution; statistical model; Theileria; Theileria orientalis; animal; animal dispersal; biological model; ecosystem; forecasting; Ixodidae; physiology; Animal Distribution; Animals; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Forecasting; Ixodidae; Models, Biological; New Zealand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024387959

Testing this hypothesis along multiple – and interacting – gradients of climate and soil variables constitutes a great opportunity to better understand and predict the responses of plant communities to ongoing environmental changes. Based on two key plant traits, maximum plant height and specific leaf area (SLA), we assessed the filtering effects of climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation, precipitation seasonality), soil characteristics (soil pH, sand content and total phosphorus) and all potential interactions on the functional structure and diversity of 124 dryland communities spread over the globe. The functional structure and diversity of dryland communities were quantified using the mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of plant trait distributions. The models accurately explained the observed variations in functional trait diversity across the 124 communities studied. All models included interactions among factors, i.e. climate–climate (9% of explanatory power), climate–soil (24% of explanatory power) and soil–soil interactions (5% of explanatory power). Precipitation seasonality was the main driver of maximum plant height, and interacted with mean annual temperature and precipitation. Soil pH mediated the filtering effects of climate and sand content on SLA. Our results also revealed that communities characterized by a low variance can also exhibit low kurtosis values, indicating that functionally contrasting species can co-occur even in communities with narrow ranges of trait values. Synthesis. We identified the particular set of conditions under which the environmental filtering hypothesis operates in drylands world-wide. Our findings also indicate that species with functionally contrasting strategies can still co-occur locally, even under prevailing environmental filtering. Interactions between sources of environmental stress should be therefore included in global trait-based studies, as this will help to further anticipate where the effects of environmental filtering will impact plant trait diversity under climate change. © 2017 The Authors.

Since, WLTP (Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedures) and RDE (real driving emission) regulations have been recently introduced, the engine operating conditions have been rapidly changed during the emission tests. Significantly more emissions are emitted during transient operation conditions compared to those at steady state operation conditions. For a diesel engine, combustion control is one of the most effective approaches to reduce engine exhaust emissions, particularly during the transient operation. The concern of this paper is about reducing emissions using a closed loop combustion control system which includes a EGR rate estimation model. The combustion control system calculates the angular position where 50 % of the injected fuel mass is burned (MFB50) using in-cylinder pressure for every cycle. In addition, the fuel injection timing is changed to make current MFB50 follow the target values. The EGR rate can be estimated by using trapped air mass and in-cylinder pressure when the intake valves are closed. When the EGR rate is different from the normal steady conditions, the target of MFB50 and the fuel injection timing are changed. The accuracy of the model is verified through engine tests, as well as the effect of combustion control. The peaks in NO level was decreased during transient conditions after adoption of the EGR model-based closed loop combustion control system. © 2017, The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Closed-loop control; EGR estimation; Exhaust emission transient condition; Model-based control","Air intakes; Automobile manufacture; Combustion; Control systems; Diesel engines; Engines; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuel injection; Fuels; Statistical process control; Vehicles; Closed-loop control; Combustion-control systems; Engine operating conditions; In-cylinder pressures; Model based controls; Steady-state operation; Transient conditions; Vehicle manufacturers; Closed loop control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019677805

Using multiple drought metrics and a set of simulations with the Community Earth System Model targeting 1.5°C and 2°C above preindustrial global mean temperatures, we investigate changes in aridity and the risk of consecutive drought years. If warming is limited to 2°C, these simulations suggest little change in drought risk for the U.S. Southwest and Central Plains compared to present day. In the Mediterranean and central Europe, however, drought risk increases significantly for both 1.5°C and 2°C warming targets, and the additional 0.5°C of the 2°C climate leads to significantly higher drought risk. Our study suggests that limiting anthropogenic warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C, as aspired to by the Paris Climate Agreement, may have benefits for future drought risk but that such benefits may be regional and in some cases highly uncertain. ©2017.

This paper reviews the status of climate change and environmentally induced migration in China, and then presents an empirical case study in Shangnan County in northwest China, where a specific GRP called the 'Massive Southern Shaanxi Migration Program' (MSSMP) has been initiated in response to climate change-related impacts. The results showed that the MSSMP helped local residents to adapt better climate change by reducing exposures to risk, enabling mobility, providing financial incentives, raising living standards, and improving emotional status. Furthermore, the MSSMP added additional benefits for migrants compared with traditional GRPs by respecting voluntary participation, preparing for future risks, and reducing social isolation via a short relocation distance. However, GRPs could also be seen as a maladaptation to climate change because they disproportionately increase the burden on the most vulnerable community members, such as those who are financially disadvantaged, new migrants, and people who are left behind. The paper further suggests that the GRPs should be designed by involving multiple adaptation strategies as supplements for GRPs, and broadening the political schemes to consider the special needs of vulnerable groups. This study contributes to an understanding of the roles of GRPs in sustainable climate change adaptation, thereby facilitating the design, organization, and implication of future similar programs. © 2017 by the authors.

We demonstrate that in the absence of externalities both algorithms deliver the same solution.

In the presence of externalities between regions the two solutions differ, which we demonstrate by the inclusion of global spillovers from learning-by-doing in the energy sector.

Therefore, many aspects of the crops and agricultural methods of medieval villages in Finland still remain unknown. At the 12th to mid-16th century medieval village of Mankby, Espoo, a systematic sampling for archaeobotanical material was carried out. The analysed samples derived from hearths, building contexts and medieval field layers etc. The archaeobotanical material was carbonised, and it consisted mostly of conifer needles, cereal grains and weed seeds. Secale cereale (rye) and Hordeum vulgare (barley) were the only crop species found, Secale being the most frequent. Seeds of Bromus secalinus (rye brome) and achenes of Centaurea cyanus (cornflower), which are associated with autumn sown winter cereal crops, were also present. The archaeobotanical material shows areas of activity linked to storing crops, as well as cultivation within the village boundaries. Based on radiocarbon dated grains, cultivation of the fields started in the 12th century and continued until the abandonment of the village in 1556. Archaeobotanical material from Mankby has been compared to other contemporary sites in Finland, and differences between the sites can be seen.

A mobile sampling approach was used to characterize PM1 composition and concentration across Houston based on high-time-resolution measurements of nonrefractory PM1 and trace gases during the DISCOVER-AQ Texas 2013 campaign. Two pollution zones with marked differences in PM1 levels, character, and dynamics were established based on cluster analysis of organic aerosol mass loadings sampled at 16 sites. The highest PM1 mass concentrations (average 11.6 ± 5.7 µg/m3) were observed to the northwest of Houston (zone 1), dominated by secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass likely driven by nighttime biogenic organonitrate formation. Zone 2, an industrial/urban area south/east of Houston, exhibited lower concentrations of PM1 (average 4.4 ± 3.3 µg/m3), significant organic aerosol (OA) aging, and evidence of primary sulfate emissions. Diurnal patterns and backward-trajectory analyses enable the classification of airmass clusters characterized by distinct PM sources: biogenic SOA, photochemical aged SOA, and primary sulfate emissions from the Houston Ship Channel. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicates that secondary biogenic organonitrates primarily related with monoterpenes are predominant in zone 1 (accounting for 34% of the variability in the data set). The relevance of photochemical processes and industrial and traffic emission sources in zone 2 also is highlighted by PCA, which identifies three factors related with these processes/sources (~50% of the aerosol/trace gas concentration variability). PCA reveals a relatively minor contribution of isoprene to SOA formation in zone 1 and the absence of isoprene-derived aerosol in zone 2. The relevance of industrial amine emissions and the likely contribution of chloride-displaced sea salt aerosol to the observed variability in pollution levels in zone 2 also are captured by PCA. Implications: This article describes an urban-scale mobile study to characterize spatial variations in submicrometer particulate matter (PM1) in greater Houston. The data set indicates substantial spatial variations in PM1 sources/chemistry and elucidates the importance of photochemistry and nighttime oxidant chemistry in producing secondary PM1. These results emphasize the potential benefits of effective control strategies throughout the region, not only to reduce primary emissions of PM1 from automobiles and industry but also to reduce the emissions of important secondary PM1 precursors, including sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and volatile organic compounds. Such efforts also could aid in efforts to reduce mixing ratios of ozone. © 2017 A&WMA.",,"Aerosols; Air pollution; Air pollution control; Chlorine compounds; Cluster analysis; Industrial emissions; Isoprene; Monoterpenes; Nitrogen oxides; Photochemical reactions; Sulfur compounds; Surface measurement; Volatile organic compounds; Backward trajectory analysis; Control strategies; High-time resolution; Mass concentration; Particulate Matter; Photochemical process; Secondary organic aerosols; Spatial characterization; Principal component analysis; amine; ammonia; chloride; isoprene; levoglucosan; nitrogen oxide; organic nitrate; sulfur oxide; terpene; volatile organic compound; 1,3 butadiene derivative; hemiterpene; pentane; aerosol; air pollution; Article; car; chemical composition; circadian rhythm; cluster analysis; concentration (parameters); exhaust gas; industrial area; meteorological phenomena; particulate matter; photochemistry; pollution; principal component analysis; priority journal; secondary organic aerosol; spatial analysis; surface property; United States; urban area; air pollutant; analysis; city; environmental monitoring; particle size; particulate matter; Texas; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Butadienes; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Hemiterpenes; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Pentanes; Texas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020501138

The modes of governing in eThekwini are considered through a framework of local climate governing and identified mainly as self-governing and governing through enabling, the campaign being an example of the latter. The campaign also exemplifies how network governance can shape climate policy and significantly alter a project from initiation to implementation. While networks can contribute to improved communication and information exchange, there may be an inherent risk of private partners having a perverse incentive against implementing effective climate policies due to their own interests in maintaining current structures. It is not clear whether the change from regulative governance to governing by enabling will lead to more effective climate policies in the longer term. More research is required to determine this. While this study is too small to make broader generalizations, it does provide insight into how the introduction of network governance may impact climate governance at the local level in the South.

Reasons for predicting an increase in positivity are presented, followed by reasons that help to explain why the reverse is occurring. To illustrate the age-stereotype paradox, four domains that help to shape the status of older individuals were selected: health, intergenerational contact, legislation, and social climate. Two proposals are then made for eliminating the paradox by reversing the age-stereotypes negativity trend: establishment of an anti-aging czar and the launching of an aging-rights movement. © The Author 2017.

Nevertheless, power capacity has become an important bottleneck that restricts horizontal scaling of servers, especially in datacenters that oversubscribe power infrastructure. When a datacenter hits its ceiling for power provisioning, conventionally the owner has to either build another facility or upgrade existing infrastructure - both approaches add huge cost, require significant time, and can further increase carbon footprint. This paper proposes Oasis, a novel datacenter expansion strategy that enables power-/carbon- constrained servers to scale out economically and sustainably. The basic structure of Oasis, called Oasis Node, naturally supports incremental capacity expansion with near-zero environmental impact since it leverages modular solar panels and distributed battery systems to power newly added servers. To optimize the operation of newly added nodes, we further propose a management framework called Ozone. It allows Oasis to jointly perform power supply switching and server speed scaling to improve efficiency locally and globally. We implement a prototype of Oasis and use it as a research platform for evaluating the design tradeoffs of green scale-out datacenters. With Oasis, a green datacenter could gradually double its capacity with near-oracle performance, extended battery lifetime, and 26 percent cost savings. © 2016 IEEE.","Data center; Energy efficiency; Power management; Scalabilty","Big data; Carbon footprint; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Power management; Big data applications; Data centers; Expansion strategies; Management frameworks; Power infrastructures; Power supply switching; Research platforms; Scalabilty; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025633492

In this paper, based on the land use pattern in 2008 (the base year) and in 2020 (the planning year), the comparative analysis of flood disaster risk changes in Haihe basin were studied by the spatial analysis function of ARCGIS and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The results showed the flood disaster risk in Haihe basin had an obvious zonality in the space, among which low risk was located in the northwest regions, and high risk was located in the southeast regions. Flood disaster risk in planning year was lower than in the base year. The risk value of 2020 in the mountain decreases from 0.445 to 0.430, while the risk value of the plain increases from 0.562 to 0.564. For the plain, high-risk area in 2020 is increased by 13.2%, which is the biggest change in risk grades. For the mountain, low-risk area and low risk area in 2020 are increased, and the low-risk area is the biggest increase, up to 37.7%. Meanwhile, high-risk area, high risk area, and medium risk area all tend to decrease, and the high-risk area is the biggest decrease, up to 32.6%. Overall, land use planning pattern under low-carbon mode is conducive to the Haihe basin flood control. The research can provide scientific foundations for basin land use planning and flood disaster risk management. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Analytic hierarchy process; Different land use patterns; Flood disaster risk; Land use planning","Analytic hierarchy process; Disasters; Flood control; Hazards; Land use; Landforms; Risk assessment; Risk management; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Comparative analysis; Flood disaster; Land use pattern; Land Use Planning; Northwest regions; Scientific foundations; Spatial analysis; Floods; rain; carbon; analytical hierarchy process; basin management; disaster management; flooding; GIS; land use planning; risk assessment; Article; construction work; controlled study; disaster planning; environmental management; evaporation; flood control; flooding; grassland; land drainage; land use; low carbon mode; precipitation; risk assessment; spatial analysis; tillage; water supply; disaster; environmental monitoring; flooding; procedures; risk assessment; statistics and numerical data; China; Hai Basin; Carbon; Disasters; Environmental Monitoring; Floods; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024392836

Long-term set-asides however cannot satisfy provisionment, therefore the use of short-term set-asides to restore cultivated soil is a better option. Few studies have compared short-term set-aside patterns, and the effects of set-asides on soil microbial community and enzyme enzymes. We analyzed the bacterial structure, microbial biomass carbon/nitrogen and enzyme activity of farmland soil under different set-aside regimes in the Yellow River Delta of China. Bacterial alpha diversity was relatively lower under only irrigation, and farmyard manure applications showed clear advantages. Set-asides should consider their influence on soil organic carbon and nitrogen, which were correlated with microbial community structure. Nitrospira (0.47–1.67%), Acidobacteria Gp6 (8.26–15.91%) and unclassified Burkholderiales (1.50–2.81%) were significantly altered (p < 0.01). Based on functions of these genera, some set-aside patterns led to a relative balance in nitrogen and carbon turnover. Partial treatments showed a deficiency in organic matter. In addition, farmyard manure may lead to the increased consumption of organic matter, with the exception of native plants set-asides. Conventional farming (control group) displayed a significant enzyme activity advantage. Set-aside management practices guided soil microbial communities to different states. Integrated soil microbiota and the content of carbon and nitrogen, native plants with farmyard manure showed an equilibrium state relatively, which would be helpful to improve land quality in the short-term. © 2017 by the authors.

Thus, there is a strong political desire to forecast carbon emissions reduction potential and the best way to achieve it. This study constructs a methodology to assess carbon reduction potential in a resource-dependent region. The Simulated Annealing Programming algorithm and the Genetic algorithm were introduced to create a prediction model and an optimized regional carbon intensity model, respectively. Shanxi Province in China, a typical resource-dependent area, is selected for the empirical study. Regional statistical data are collected from 1990 to 2015. The results show that the carbon intensity of Shanxi Province could drop 18.78% by 2020. This potential exceeds the 18% expectation of the Chinese Government in its '13th Five-Year Work Plan' for Controlling Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Moreover, the carbon intensity of the province could be further reduced by 0.97 t per 10,000 yuan GDP. The study suggests that the carbon emissions of a resource-dependent region can be reduced in the following ways; promoting economic restructuring, upgrading coal supply-side reform, perfecting the self-regulation of coal prices, accelerating the technical innovation of the coal industry, and establishing a flexible mechanism for reducing emissions. © 2017 by the authors.","Carbon intensity; Carbon reduction potential; Resource-dependent regions; Shanxi province; Simulated annealing programming","carbon emission; economic development; emission control; forecasting method; genetic algorithm; governance approach; greenhouse gas; industrial ecology; innovation; linear programing; resource economy; simulated annealing; China; Shanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022090299

Ten Holstein cows fed a total mixed ration (TMR) diet were randomly allocated into two groups, one supplied with mineral salts as the treatment group and the other as the control group. The methane measurement showed that the ingestion of mineral salts lowered enteric methane emissions significantly (P < 0.05), with an average of 10.5% reduction over the whole lactation period. Ruminal fermentation analysis showed the mineral salt intake could significantly decrease the acetate : propionate ratio (P < 0.05). Real-time PCR assay showed that rumen methanogen abundance significantly reduced in the treatment group (P < 0.05) but was not significantly influenced by mineral salt intake over the whole lactation period. Intergroup methanogen community composition was influenced slightly by mineral salt intake; however, significantly different intragroup profiles were apparent throughout the whole lactation period, according to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis. In conclusion, these results suggested that the effective mitigation of enteric methane emissions by mineral salt intake could be attributed to decreased density of methanogenic archaea and that fluctuations in methane emission over the lactation period might be related to Methanobrevibacter diversity. © 2016 Japanese Society of Animal Science","dairy cow; methane; methanogen; mineral salt","methane; mineral; analysis; animal; animal food; archaeon; bovine; diet; dietary supplement; female; fermentation; greenhouse effect; lactation; metabolism; Methanobrevibacter; microbiology; physiology; prevention and control; real time polymerase chain reaction; rumen; veterinary; Animal Feed; Animals; Archaea; Cattle; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Female; Fermentation; Greenhouse Effect; Lactation; Methane; Methanobrevibacter; Minerals; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rumen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006340139

This structure is metallic with robust metallicity against external strain. In addition, we find that the adsorption of Li atoms on ψ-graphene is exothermic, and the diffusion energy barrier is low and comparable to that of graphene. Furthermore, ψ-graphene can achieve a maximum Li storage capacity equivalent to that of LiC6, suggesting its potential as an anode material for Li-ion batteries (LIBs).

A quantitative source-receptor relationship can provide valuable insights that can inform effective emission control strategies. Both source apportionment (SA) and source sensitivity (SS) can provide such information from different perspectives. In this study, both methods are applied in northern China to identify the most significant emission categories and source regions for PM2.5 exposure in BTH in 2013. Despite their differences, both models show similar distribution patterns for population and simulated PM2.5 concentrations, resulting in overall high PM2.5 exposure values (approximately 110 μg/m3) and particularly high exposure values during the winter (approximately 200 μg/m3). Both methods show that local emissions play a dominant role (70%), with some contribution from surrounding provinces (e.g., Shandong) via regional transport. The two methods also agree on the priority of local emission controls: both identify industrial, residential, and agricultural emissions as the top three categories that should be controlled locally. In addition, the effect of controlling agricultural ammonia emissions is approximately doubled when the co-benefits of reducing nitrate are considered. The synthesis of SA and SS for addressing specific categories of emissions provides a quantitative basis for the development of emission control strategies and policies for controlling PM2.5 in China. © 2017 Science China Press","China; Control priority; PM2.5 exposure; Source apportionment; Source sensitivity","Agriculture; Emission control; Population statistics; Agricultural emissions; China; Distribution patterns; High population density; PM2.5 concentration; Source apportionment; Source sensitivity; Source-receptor relationships; Industrial emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021734934

However, parameters in TEMs are rarely constrained by observations from Chinese forest ecosystems, which are important carbon sink over the northern hemispheric land. In this study, eddy covariance data from six forest sites in China are used to optimize parameters of the ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamics EcosystEms TEM. The model-data assimilation through parameter optimization largely reduces the prior model errors and improves the simulated seasonal cycle and summer diurnal cycle of net ecosystem exchange, latent heat fluxes, and gross primary production and ecosystem respiration. Climate change experiments based on the optimized model are deployed to indicate that forest net primary production (NPP) is suppressed in response to warming in the southern China but stimulated in the northeastern China. Altered precipitation has an asymmetric impact on forest NPP at sites in water-limited regions, with the optimization-induced reduction in response of NPP to precipitation decline being as large as 61% at a deciduous broadleaf forest site. We find that seasonal optimization alters forest carbon cycle responses to environmental change, with the parameter optimization consistently reducing the simulated positive response of heterotrophic respiration to warming. Evaluations from independent observations suggest that improving model structure still matters most for long-term carbon stock and its changes, in particular, nutrient- and age-related changes of photosynthetic rates, carbon allocation, and tree mortality. ©2017.

In these regions, extensive sequestration of dissolved inorganic carbon can occur in the terminal lakes of endorheic basins - basins that do not drain to external bodies of water. However, the global magnitude of this dissolved inorganic carbon sink is uncertain. Here we present isotopic, radiocarbon, and chemical analyses of groundwater, river water, and sediments from the terminal region of the endorheic Shiyang River drainage basin, in arid northwest China. We estimate that 0.13 Pg of dissolved inorganic carbon was stored in the basin during the mid-Holocene. Pollen-based reconstructions of basin-scale productivity suggest that the mid-Holocene dissolved inorganic carbon sink was two orders of magnitude smaller than terrestrial productivity in the basin. We use estimates of dissolved inorganic carbon storage based on sedimentary data from 11 terminal lakes of endorheic basins around the world as the basis for a global extrapolation of the sequestration of dissolved organic carbon in endorheic basins. We estimate that 0.152 Pg of dissolved inorganic carbon is buried per year today, compared to about 0.211 Pg C yr '1 during the mid-Holocene. We conclude that endorheic basins represent an important carbon sink on the global scale, with a magnitude similar to deep ocean carbon burial.",,"carbon sequestration; carbon sink; chemical analysis; dissolved inorganic carbon; dissolved organic carbon; drainage basin; global perspective; groundwater; Holocene; isotopic analysis; palynology; pollen; radiocarbon dating; reconstruction; river water; sediment analysis; China; Gansu; Shiyang River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021815307

Effects of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and SO42− mass concentration ratio on the decomposition of organic matter, methane production and sulfate reduction were investigated and the microbial community was analyzed using the high throughout methods. Results showed that high removal efficiency of COD, methane production and heavy metal removal was achieved when the initial COD/SO42− ratio (based on mass) was set at 3.0. The relative abundance of anaerobic hydrogen-producing bacteria (Candidatus Cloacamonas) in the experimental group with the addition of AMD was significantly increased compared to the control.

Herein, based on the transient-state surface photovoltage responses and the atmosphere-controlled steady-state surface photovoltage spectra, it is demonstrated that the lifetime and separation of photogenerated charges of nanosized α-Fe2O3 are increased after coupling a proper amount of nanocrystalline SnO2. This naturally leads to greatly improved photocatalytic activities for CO2 reduction and acetaldehyde degradation. It is suggested that the enhanced charge separation results from the electron transfer from α-Fe2O3 to SnO2, which acts as a proper energy platform. Based on the photocurrent action spectra, it is confirmed that the coupled SnO2 exhibits longer visible-light threshold wavelength (~590 nm) compared with the coupled TiO2 (~550 nm), indicating that the energy platform introduced by SnO2 would accept more photogenerated electrons from α-Fe2O3. Moreover, electrochemical reduction experiments proved that the coupled SnO2 possesses better catalytic ability for reducing CO2 and O2. These are well responsible for the much efficient photocatalysis on SnO2-coupled α-Fe2O3.

One was a 20-yr data set from the Wisconsin Integrated Cropping System Trial documenting management inputs, crop and pasture yields, and soil characteristics, used to estimate field-level emissions from land associated with feed production (row crop and pasture), including N2O and soil carbon sequestration. The other was a data set summarizing organic farm management in Wisconsin, which was used to estimate replacement heifer emission (CO2 equivalents), enteric methane (CH4), and manure management (N2O and CH4). Three combinations of corn grain (CG) and soybean (SB) as concentrate (all corn = 100% CG; baseline = 75% CG + 25% SB; half corn = 50% CG + 50% SB) were assigned to each of 4 representative management strategies as determined by survey data. Overall, GHG emissions associated with crop production was 1,297 ± 136 kg of CO2 equivalents/t of ECM without accounting for soil carbon changes (ΔSC), and GHG emission with ΔSC was 1,457 ± 111 kg of CO2 equivalents/t of ECM, with greater reliance on pasture resulting in less ΔSC. Higher levels of milk production were a major driver associated with reduction in GHG emission per metric tonne of ECM. Emissions per metric tonne of ECM increased with increasing proportion of SB in the ration; however, including SB in the crop rotation decreased N2O emission per metric tonne of ECM from cropland due to lower applications of organically approved N fertility inputs. More SB at the expense of CG in the ration reduced enteric CH4 emission per metric tonne of ECM (because of greater dietary fat content) but increased N2O emission per metric tonne of ECM from manure (because of greater N content). An increased reliance on pasture for feed at the expense of grain resulted in decreased in milk production, subsequently leading to substantially higher emissions per metric tonne of ECM. © 2017 American Dairy Science Association","carbon footprint; grazing management; partial life cycle assessment","methane; agricultural land; animal; animal food; biosynthesis; bovine; dairying; female; greenhouse effect; metabolism; milk; organic farming; Wisconsin; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Cattle; Dairying; Farms; Female; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Milk; Organic Agriculture; Wisconsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019159949

However, these low-productivity and water-limited ecosystems are sensitive and vulnerable to climate perturbations and human intervention, the latter of which is often not considered due to lack of spatial information regarding the grassland management. Here by the application of a model tree ensemble (MTE-GRASS) trained on local eddy covariance data and using as predictors gridded climate and management intensity field (grazing and cutting), we first provide an estimate of global grassland gross primary production (GPP). GPP from our study compares well (modeling efficiency NSE = 0.85 spatial; NSE between 0.69 and 0.94 interannual) with that from flux measurement. Global grassland GPP was on average 11 ± 0.31 Pg C yr−1 and exhibited significantly increasing trend at both annual and seasonal scales, with an annual increase of 0.023 Pg C (0.2%) from 1982 to 2011. Meanwhile, we found that at both annual and seasonal scale, the trend (except for northern summer) and interannual variability of the GPP are primarily driven by arid/semiarid ecosystems, the latter of which is due to the larger variation in precipitation. Grasslands in arid/semiarid regions have a stronger (33 g C m−2 yr−1/100 mm) and faster (0- to 1-month time lag) response to precipitation than those in other regions. Although globally spatial gradients (71%) and interannual changes (51%) in GPP were mainly driven by precipitation, where most regions with arid/semiarid climate zone, temperature and radiation together shared half of GPP variability, which is mainly distributed in the high-latitude or cold regions. Our findings and the results of other studies suggest the overwhelming importance of arid/semiarid regions as a control on grassland ecosystems carbon cycle. Similarly, under the projected future climate change, grassland ecosystems in these regions will be potentially greatly influenced. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","arid/semiarid ecosystems; climate control; data-driven method; global grassland GPP; grazing and cutting; model tree ensembles; spatiotemporal patterns","arid region; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate change; ensemble forecasting; grassland; grazing; primary production; semiarid region; carbon dioxide; carbon cycle; climate; climate change; ecosystem; grassland; tree; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Grassland; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010699948

CO2 geosequestration, that is, to store CO2 under the subsurface of Earth, is feasible because the world's sedimentary basins have high capacity and are often located in the same region of the world as emission sources. How CO2 interacts with the connate water and minerals is the focus of this Account. There are four trapping mechanisms that keep CO2 in the pores of subsurface rocks: (1) structural trapping, (2) residual trapping, (3) dissolution trapping, and (4) mineral trapping. The first two are dominated by capillary action, where wettability controls CO2 and water two-phase flow in porous media. We review state-of-the-art studies on CO2/water/mineral wettability, which was found to depend on pressure and temperature conditions, salt concentration in aqueous solutions, mineral surface chemistry, and geometry. We then review some recent advances in mineral trapping.First, we show that it is possible to reproduce the CO2/water/mineral wettability at a wide range of pressures using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. As the pressure increases, CO2 gas transforms into a supercritical fluid or liquid at ∼7.4 MPa depending on the environmental temperature. This transition leads to a substantial decrease of the interfacial tension between CO2 and reservoir brine (or pure water). However, the wettability of CO2/water/rock systems depends on the type of rock surface. Recently, we investigated the contact angle of CO2/water/silica systems with two different silica surfaces using MD simulations. We found that contact angle increased with pressure for the hydrophobic (siloxane) surface while it was almost constant for the hydrophilic (silanol) surface, in excellent agreement with experimental observations. Furthermore, we found that the CO2 thin films at the CO2-hydrophilic silica and CO2-H2O interfaces displayed a linear correlation, which can in turn explain the constant contact angle on the hydrophilic silica surface. In view of the literature and our study results, a few recommendations seem necessary to construct a molecular system suitable to study wettability with MD simulations. Future work should be conducted to determine the influence of brine salinity on the wettability of minerals with high cation exchange capacity.Mineral trapping is believed to be an extremely slow process, likely taking thousands of years. However, a recent pilot study demonstrated that CO2 mineralization occurs within 2 years in highly reactive basalt reservoirs. A first-principles MD study has also shown that carbonation reactions occur rapidly at the surface oxygen sites of a reactive mineral. We observed carbonate ions on both a newly cleaved quartz surface (without hydrolysis), and a basalt andesine surface after hydrolysis in a CO2-rich environment. Future work should consider the influence of water, gas impurities, and mineral cation type on carbonation. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025094727

Here, the concentrations of heavy metals, including Cu, Zn, Mn, Cd, Pb and As, and their distribution between the four phases was studied. Samples for analysis were taken from twelve sites of the Hengshi River, Guangdong Province, China, during the rainy and dry seasons. A new comprehensive ecological risk index (CERI) based on considering metal contents, pollution indices, toxicity coefficients and water categories is offered for prediction of potential risk on aquatic organisms. The results of comprehensive analysis showed that the highest concentrations of Cu, Zn and Mn of 6.42, 87.17 and 98.74 mg/L, respectively, in PW were comparable with those in water, while concentrations of Cd, Pb and As of 609.5, 2757 and 96.38 μg/L, respectively, were 2–5 times higher. The sum of the exchangeable and carbonate fractions of target metals in sediments followed the order of Cd > Mn > Zn > Pb > Cu > As. The distribution of heavy metals in phases followed the order of sediment > SS > water > PW, having the sum content in water and PW lower than 2% of total. The elevated ecological risk for a single metal and the phase were 34,585 for Cd and 1160 for water, respectively, implied Cd as a priority pollutant in the considered area. According to the CERI, the maximum risk value of 769.3 was smaller than 1160 in water, but higher than those in other phases. Out of considering the water categories and contribution coefficients, the CERI was proved to be more reliable for assessing the pollution of rivers with heavy metals. These results imply that the CERI has a potential of adequate assessment of multi-phase composite metals pollution. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Comprehensive ecological risk index; Experts scoring; Fraction analysis; Heavy metals; Multi-phase distribution","arsenic; cadmium; copper; heavy metal; lead; manganese; surface water; zinc; heavy metal; water pollutant; acid mine drainage; alluvial deposit; concentration (composition); heavy metal; risk assessment; river pollution; toxicity; absorption; Article; calculation; comprehensive ecological risk index; environmental impact assessment; environmental parameters; geochemistry; hydrolysis; mathematical analysis; particulate matter; pH; reliability; risk assessment; river; sediment; solubility; water flow; water pollution; water quality; analysis; aquatic species; chemistry; China; drug effects; ecology; environmental monitoring; mining; procedures; river; theoretical model; toxicity; water pollutant; China; Guangdong; Hengshi Basin; Aquatic Organisms; China; Ecology; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Metals, Heavy; Mining; Models, Theoretical; Risk Assessment; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015609670

The optimal respiratory control model, which has been studied earlier, was characterized to include a description of the neuromuscular drive P(t) as the control output and accurately derive the waveshapes of instantaneous airflow V˙(t), lung volume V(t) profiles, and breathing pattern, including total and alveolar ventilation, breathing frequency, tidal volume, inspiratory and expiratory duration, duty cycle, and arterial CO2 pressure. Simulations were performed under various respiratory resistive loads: no load (NL), inspiratory resistive load (IRL), expiratory resistive load (ERL), and continuous resistive load (CRL). The simulation results provide an extended view of breathing pattern and the respiratory signals of neural muscular driving pressure, airflow, and lung volume for rest and various specific cases with external dead space loading and/or CO2 inhalation. The results showed that an IRL generally resulted in a higher amplitude of P(t) and V(t), with more convex upward pressure waveshapes, a prolonged inspiratory duration, and a higher duty cycle (TI/T ≈ 0.55–0.56 at Rest, ≈ 0.54∼0.68 in Case 1, and ≈0.61∼0.69 in Case 3 during resistive loading) for the waveforms.

The experience of the Millennium drought in Australia (1996–2010) and water restrictions introduced during that time intervened to change everyday water practices in specific ways creating durable change in some practices and mutable change in others. Drawing on focus groups with 62 people, in three diverse Australian cities, a rich picture of diverse water practices emerges. Using a specific social practice framework we explore the key practices of garden watering and showering and tease out the elements in each – we discuss how and why there has been more innovation and change in garden practices than shower practices. We argue that sustained water restrictions drive material change in households and these material changes appear to be more effective in changing water use than transforming water saving competencies or meanings alone. Further, we show that the commitment and resistance to water saving has a spatial context – data from three different cities allowed us to see how location, climate and policy responses interweave with everyday practices. The implication of our research is that policy interventions should be 'fit for purpose' according to social practices in spatial context. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Consumption; Households; Social practices; Water","climate change; consumption behavior; drought; household expenditure; spatial data; water management; water planning; water use; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020299551

This includes Sweden in which it currently supplies around 50% of the electricity and particularly Norway where almost all electricity is generated from hydropower. In these countries, as well as many others, the provision of hydroelectricity enabled urban and rural development, industrialization and other core value-added activities. However, it was realized with significant environmental costs, particularly at the local level. Traditionally, there has been a divide in perceptions on hydropower production, in which stakeholders tend to box it either as an environmental hazard or as a socio-economic benefit. During the last century, these diverging perspectives have influenced political and regulatory approaches as well as the perceived role of hydropower at large. Different attempts to bridge this divide have been made. This is not least true in the present day, considering the role of hydropower as a low-carbon solution, and a balancing source to counter increased intermittency from new renewables into the energy system. These features of contributing to the global good of mitigating climate change need to be assessed against the potential negative environmental consequences on biological diversity, outdoor recreation and landscape perceptions at large. These concerns triggered social mobilization and even became instrumental in establishing environmental NGOs with the core focus of fighting hydropower projects. Contrasting and often conflicting opinions are still prevailing, as exemplified with the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). However, there are current signs and new knowledge available suggesting that we are moving into a new era of hydropower governance. A potential reconciliation of contrasting perceptions is pending, but there is strong inertia to change. We argue that the understanding of past political modes and regulatory approaches are essential to develop more sustainable hydropower governance systems fit for future societal and environmental needs. We currently have the benefit of drawing on lessons learned. This provides an opportunity to shape new governance systems that are more balanced in a way not experienced before. © 2017 by the authors.","Governance of water resources in regulated river basins; Integrated water resources management; The role of hydropower and reservoirs in climate change mitigation and adaptation","adaptive management; climate change; conflict management; electricity generation; environmental hazard; European Union; governance approach; hydroelectric power; industrialization; mitigation; nongovernmental organization; outdoor recreation; reservoir; river basin; socioeconomic impact; stakeholder; water management; water resource; Norway; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025647037

In this study, we estimated the trends and step changes in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) vertical column density (VCD) of SO2 from 2005 to 2015 over China measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). We show that these trends and step change years coincide with the effective date and period of the national strategy for energy development and relocation in northwestern China and the regulations in the reduction of SO2 emissions. Under the national regulations for the reduction of SO2 emissions in eastern and southern China, SO2 VCD in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) of southern China exhibited the largest decline during 2005&amp;ndash;2015 at a rate of ĝ'7ĝ€%ĝ€yrĝ'1, followed by the North China Plain (NCP) (ĝ'6.7ĝ€%ĝ€yrĝ'1), Sichuan Basin (ĝ'6.3ĝ€%ĝ€yrĝ'1), and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) (ĝ'6ĝ€%ĝ€yrĝ'1). The Mann&amp;ndash;Kendall (MK) test reveals the step change points of declining SO2 VCD in 2009 for the PRD and 2012&amp;ndash;2013 for eastern China responding to the implementation of SO2 control regulation in these regions. In contrast, the MK test and regression analysis also revealed increasing trends of SO2 VCD in northwestern China, particularly for several featured by growing SO2 VCD in those large-scale energy industry bases in northwestern China. The enhanced SO2 VCD is potentially attributable to increasing SO2 emissions due to the development of large-scale energy industry bases in energy-abundant northwestern China under the national strategy for the energy safety of China in the 21st century. We show that these large-scale energy industry bases could overwhelm the trends and changes in provincial total SO2 emissions in northwestern China and contribute increasingly to the national total SO2 emissions in China. Given that northwestern China is more ecologically fragile and uniquely susceptible to atmospheric pollution than the rest of China, increasing SO2 emissions in this part of China should not be overlooked and merit scientific research. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; industrial development; industrial emission; ozone; pollution monitoring; relocation; sulfur dioxide; sulfur emission; China; Guangdong; North China Plain; Sichuan Basin; Yangtze Delta; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026526907

This carbon is included in greenhouse gases. During production of iron and steel are generated carbon monoxide and greenhouse gases: methane, and carbon dioxide. Methane and carbon monoxide burn to carbon dioxide by secondary energy resources. By this means, the carbon footprint by the production of iron and steel has determined by the weight of carbon dioxide formed in this production. As results of analysis of the processes of manufacture of iron and steel, it has revealed that the tandem of blast furnace with electric arc furnace is characterized by a lower value of integrated emissions of CO2than the tandem of blast furnace with an oxygen converter. It was proposed to process of the cast iron made by one blast furnace, then in the oxygen converter, and, at last, in one or more electric arc furnaces. Moreover, the electric arc furnace is loaded by 30% of iron produced in blast furnace, and the remaining 70% are complemented by metal scrap. In the oxygen converter is loaded, the part of cast iron (75–85%), that remained after processing in the arc furnace. The converter is applied the metal scrap for full loading. Calculations of total emission of carbon dioxide for different triads of these units are made. Simultaneous use of oxygen converter with electric arc furnaces for cast iron smelting (obtained from one blast furnace) helps to reduce reliably the emission of carbon dioxide to 20% as it is follows from these calculations. This suggests that such a triad of used units conforms to green technology. Example of the use of mentioned triad is for a full load of the converter applied to metal scrap. The calculations total emissions of carbon dioxide for different triads of these units were performed. From these calculations it follows that the simultaneous use of oxygen converters after electric arc furnaces for smelting iron (obtained from one blast furnace), it helps to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide to 20%. This suggests that this triad of used units conforms to green technology. An example of using this triad is in the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, where along with the oxygen converter, electric arc furnaces with the use of locally produced electricity at burning fuel of secondary energy resources from units, in which the fuel is burnt. This practice can be recommended for a number of other metallurgical enterprises. © 2017, Allerton Press, Inc.","blast furnace; carbon footprint; cast iron; electric arc furnace; emission of carbon dioxide; oxygen converter; steel","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Carbon footprint; Carbon monoxide; Cast iron; Electric arcs; Electric furnace process; Electric furnaces; Energy resources; Environmental technology; Greenhouse gases; Iron; Iron scrap; Manufacture; Metals; Methane; Oxygen; Particulate emissions; Scrap metal; Smelting; Steel; Electric arc furnace; Green technology; Integrated emissions; Iron and steel works; Metallurgical enterprise; Oxygen converters; Simultaneous use; Total emissions; Blast furnaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036479162

Global viticulture covers more than 4.6 million hectares (ha) of land, with a major part of the acreage in the semi-arid Mediterranean part of the EU, and needs to adapt to the new policy environment. The aim of the study was to determine the product carbon footprint (PCF) of indigenous and introduced grape varieties through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) using as a case study 90 vineyards on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. PCF determination was based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) protocols for greenhouse gas emissions and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission factors, with a system boundary from the vineyard to the winery/market door. We took into account for the first time carbon stock changes in vineyard soil, as implemented in the Cool Farm Tool and simulated alternative fertilization/soil management strategies to reduce emissions and increase carbon sequestration. The Mediterranean table grape variety Soultanina (Thompson seedless) had the highest PCF at 0.846 kg CO2-equivalents per kg of grapes, followed by the two wine varieties, the globally popular Cabernet Sauvignon at 0.556 and the indigenous white variety Xynisteri at 0.283. Fertilizers and field energy use were the carbon hot spots for grapes. The modelled scenario for footprint mitigation showed that the PCF of all three varieties can decrease by 40–67% after applying locally produced animal manure and reducing tillage frequency. The PCF of indigenous Xynisteri can get close to zero. Validation of mitigation practices through field-research is an essential step for the compliance of viticulture with global GHG emissions mitigation targets. © 2017","Carbon balance; Carbon sequestration; Environmental impact; Sustainability; Viticulture","Agricultural implements; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Emission control; Environmental impact; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Landforms; Sustainable development; Wine; Carbon balance; Carbon sequestration; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; International organization for standardizations; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Product carbon footprints; Simulated alternatives; Viticulture; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019136421

Limited by scaling and data uncertainties, geographical allocation of carbon-emitting responsibilities or burdens at local or fine scales has not been well documented. In this regard, after estimating total carbon emissions from urban motor and metro transports, we proposed a multiproxy allocation system that included a series of transport-related demand and supply indicators. On the basis of urban high-resolution data, magnitudes of gridded proxies in fine scales were aggregated into each local administrative region (subdistrict and town) by a bottom-up approach. Then, weights of these indicators were calculated through an integration of Grey Relational Analysis with Fuzzy Logic. Finally, using the practical scenario of Wuhan (China), we allocated total carbon-emitting quantities from the Wuhan metropolis down to local units by using a top-down approach. Local carbon-emitting contributions and their variations were further identified and mapped from total, per capita, and per unit perspectives. We have not only shown this allocative approach to be effective and applicable, but have also depicted spatially similar patterns and evolutions under the three carbon-emitting indicators. These depictions include local inequality and polarization, core-peripheral structure, place-dependence on initial location, and spatial locking-in effect and diffusive trends along metro lines.

Results revealed that there was little comfort difference for the human body under two ventilation patterns in the street canyon.

We conducted the temporal trend analysis of atmospheric NH3 and NO2 on a national scale since 1980 based on emission data (during 1980-2010), satellite observation (for NH3 since 2008 and for NO2 since 2005) and atmospheric chemistry transport modeling (during 2008-2015).<br><br>Based on the emission data, during 1980-2010, significant continuous increasing trends in both NH3 and NO<i>x</i> were observed in REAS (Regional Emission inventory in Asia, for NH3 0.17 and for NO<i>x</i> 0.16 kg N haĝ'1 yrĝ'2) and EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, for NH3 0.24 and for NO<i>x</i> 0.17 kg N haĝ'1 yrĝ'2) over China. Based on the satellite data and atmospheric chemistry transport model (CTM) MOZART-4 (Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers, version 4), the NO2 columns over China increased significantly from 2005 to 2011 and then decreased significantly from 2011 to 2015; the satellite-retrieved NH3 columns from 2008 to 2014 increased at a rate of 2.37 % yrĝ'1. The decrease in NO2 columns since 2011 may result from more stringent strategies taken to control NO<i>x</i> emissions during the 12th Five Year Plan, while no control policy has focused on NH3 emissions. Our findings provided an overall insight into the temporal trends of both NO2 and NH3 since 1980 based on emission data, satellite observations and atmospheric transport modeling. These findings can provide a scientific background for policy makers that are attempting to control atmospheric pollution in China. Moreover, the multiple datasets used in this study have implications for estimating long-term Nr deposition datasets to assess its impact on soil, forest, water and greenhouse balance. © 2017 Auther(s).",,"ammonia; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric transport; emission; modeling; nitrogen dioxide; satellite data; temporal variation; trend analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027300891

The aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of different N fertilizer treatments of conventional urea, polymer-coated urea, ammonia sulfate, urease inhibitor (NBPT, N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide)-treated urea, and nitrification inhibitor (DCD, dicyandiamide)-treated urea on emissions of NH3 and GHGs from subtropical wheat cultivation. A field study was established in a Cancienne silt loam soil. During growth season, NH3 emission following N fertilization was characterized using active chamber method whereas GHG emissions of N2O, carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) were by passive chamber method. The results showed that coated urea exhibited the largest reduction (49%) in the EF of NH3-N followed by NBPT-treated urea (39%) and DCD-treated urea (24%) over conventional urea, whereas DCD-treated urea had the greatest suppression on N2O-N (87%) followed by coated urea (76%) and NBPT-treated urea (69%). Split fertilization of ammonium sulfate-urea significantly lowered both NH3-N and N2O-N EF values but split urea treatment had no impact over one-time application of urea. Both NBPT and DCD-treated urea treatments lowered CO2-C flux but had no effect on CH4-C flux. Overall, application of coated urea or urea with NPBT or DCD could be used as a mitigation strategy for reducing NH3 and N2O emissions in subtropical wheat production in Southern USA. © 2017","Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Methane; Nitrogen fertilization; Nitrous oxide","Air quality; Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Metabolism; Methane; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Silt; Soils; Tropics; Emission factors; Mitigation strategy; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrogen fertilization; Nitrous oxide; Regional air quality; Urease inhibitors; Wheat production; Urea; ammonia; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrification; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; subtropical region; sulfate; urea; wheat; Triticum aestivum; air pollutant; ammonia; carbon dioxide; fertilizer; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; soil; agriculture; air pollutant; analysis; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; procedures; soil; wheat; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Ammonia; Carbon Dioxide; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Triticum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015681383

The study area was analyzed by characteristics such as slope changes (S), direction and maximum length of the urban runoff (L), and soil use (runoff coefficient, Rc). The bioretention cell was designed by the calculation of variables such as drainage area (A), concentration time (Tc), rainfall intensity (i), maximum peak drained (Qmax), inlet and outlet runoff (Qa and Qout, respectively), temperature (T), evaporation (Ev), potential evapotranspiration (PEm), consumptive use (U) for tolerant plants to semi-arid climates, and soil infiltration capacity (Inf). To design the infiltration trench, only Tc, Qmax, and i were taken into account. The results showed that the designed bioretention cell could retain between 5.37% and 2.25% of runoff volume. As the efficiency of the bioretention cell can be defined by the need for additional irrigation, our results showed that the cell is inefficient in some of the dry months (November and December), even in years characterized by abundant rainfall. Besides, it was shown that the designed infiltration trench could store or infiltrate the water from typical rain events. Based on these results, it is the implementation of more Low-Impact Development (LID) for runoff management in the study area is recommended. © 2017 by the authors.","Bioretention cell; Infiltration trench; Self-irrigation; Urban runoff; Water conservation; Xeric climate","Cells; Cytology; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Rain; Runoff; Sewage; Water conservation; Bioretention cell; Concentration-time; Low impact development; Potential evapotranspiration; Rainfall intensity; Runoff coefficients; Urban runoff; Xeric climate; Infiltration; best management practice; design; drainage; infiltration; irrigation; moisture content; runoff; semiarid region; trench; water management; zone; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026363891

As a long-standing process in the past, present and future, climate change requires epistemological frames attuned to complex scales of time and place which are central to this special issue’s interest in planetary memory. In accordance with these dynamics, the novel suggests a definition of planetary memory in which remembrance is both human (and global) as well as more-than-human (exceeding the global, moving to the planetary). The novel is also explicitly concerned with imagining (or re-membering) the future as much as the past and present. Echoing the dynamics of the novel itself, the article works from the ground up, beginning with a consideration of the environmental contexts of Tennessee, Appalachia and the South, before moving to a wider sense of the planetary.

In addition, the optical spectra, color properties and technological performance of (Co,Zn)-karrooite compositions as new green ceramic pigments were also analyzed. XRD characterization revealed for the first time the high solid solubility of Zn2+ in MgTi2O5 karrooite at 1200 ºC (between 60 and 80 mol% per Mg or karrooite formula unit). In contrast, the reactivity and stabilization of karrooite phase decreased in the case of Co2+ doping. Interestingly, codoping with Zn2+ ions at high molar ratios (Zn:Mg ratio equal to 1:1) enhanced the reactivity and enabled the stabilization of (Co,Zn)-MgTi2O5 karrooite solid solutions, even with high Co2+ loadings (20 mol% per karrooite formula unit). The (Co,Zn)-MgTi2O5 pigments exhibited yellowish-green colors associated to Co2+ ions allocated in octahedral M1 and M2 sites of karrooite lattice, and becoming more intense and less yellow the higher the Co content. However, Zn2+ codoping produced less saturated green colors with similar green but lower yellowish hues. The obtained pigments were not stable enough within the tested ceramic glazes, giving rise to turquoise colorations due to cobalt leaching and incorporation into tetrahedral sites of the glassy phase.

Encouraging homeowners to prepare for the consequences of catastrophic flooding is imperative. This study aims to examine the ways in which individuals’ risk perceptions and socio-cultural characteristics co-determine the preparedness for flood hazards. It is based on a social survey about household arrangements that can reduce the economic losses arising from flooding and enhance community resilience. A total of 485 responses were solicited from homeowners in England and Wales. Results confirm that the intention to act is socially motivated. This indicates the need for addressing the role of social networks and engagement with local community in enhancing community resilience to flooding. On the other hand, the effect of risk-related considerations is complicated. Perceived severity of flood damage is associated with intended actions, whereas risk characteristics are not. This implies that although providing relevant risk information to the public is crucial, appealing to the feelings of fears and uncertainties is less likely to be effective in driving actions for managing flood risks than has been usually assumed. The findings have practical implications for policy-making and climate risk communication. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change; Community resilience; Flooding; Risk communication; Risk perception; Social capital","catastrophic event; climate change; communication; flooding; local participation; natural hazard; risk perception; social capital; England; United Kingdom; Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017502084

Instead of a triple crop scheme like other areas in the Delta, a prawn and rice rotational cultivation scheme was initiated to facilitate agricultural production in Kien Giang. In this paper, the ecosystem services (ES) generated from the agriculture ecosystem under the prawn and rice rotational crops (PRRC) were assessed using an integrated approach. The specific ES identified here include water and nutrition regulation in the soil together with climate regulation in favor of the cultivated crops. A multi-disciplinary approach including remote sensing, GIS, social surveys and statistical analysis was adopted to comprehensively evaluate the geographical, biophysical, economic and social aspects of the ES. Firstly, Landsat 8 images were processed with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NVDI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) to identify the areas cultivating PRRC. The accuracy of image classification was assessed by ground truthing and we found an 80% coincidence between the simulated results and the field observations. Then, the social survey was conducted using face to face interviews at 50 local households to collect data related to farming practices. Economic values of ecosystem services were obtained using the revised market methods by annual crop yields per unit area. The mean estimated value of ES provided through the PRRC was 1300 USD/ha/year (standard deviation of 600 USD/ha/year) which accounted for 38.1% and 59.4% of the averaged economic revenue and net benefit, respectively. The analysis of social survey data revealed the factors having the greatest effects on ecosystem services values were selling prices of prawn and farming experiences. Finally, results were synthesized with GIS to describe how ES values vary across the research area which facilitates effective communication of the importance of ES concepts to policy makers regarding land use planning and natural resources management decisions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change adaptation; Ecosystem services mapping; Integrated evaluation framework; Mekong delta; Prawn and rice rotational crops",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964794104

Many cities have started to define future strategies and plans to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Urban energy scenarios involve the consideration of a wide range of conflicting criteria, both socio-economic and environmental ones. Moreover, decision-makers (DMs) require proper tools that can support their choices in a context of multiple stakeholders and a long-term perspective. In this context, Multicriteria Spatial Decision Support Systems (MC-SDSS) are often used in order to define and analyze urban scenarios since they support the comparison of different solutions, based on a combination of multiple factors. The main problem, in relation to urban energy retrofitting scenarios, is the lack of appropriate knowledge and evaluation criteria. The latter are crucial for delivering and assessing urban energy scenarios through a MC-SDSS tool. The main goal of this paper is to analyze and test two different methods for the definition and ranking of the evaluation criteria. More specifically, the paper presents an on-going research study related to the development of a MC-SDSS tool able to identify and evaluate alternative energy urban scenarios in a long-term period perspective.

In particular, a people-oriented and place-based approach is advocated. Governments should endeavour to move beyond simply pledging to reduce carbon emission to a specific level by a certain year but to adopt a life cycle approach in guiding the planning and development of future cities. There may need to be a shift in the system with a different balance of transport modes. Moreover, the correct type and mix of transport modes need to be provided with respect to where people and their activities are. Moreover, it is necessary to explicitly recognize the value of travel for both economic and non-economic purposes. Building upon the existing literature, this paper proposes three new directions for planning TODs in future cities. Firstly, the built environment should be understood at both the neighbourhood and city scales. Secondly, the success of TODs needs to be judged not just by the public transit patronage but also by the share of walking and other urban planning and design features like greenery and vibrancy. Thirdly, it is neither possible nor desirable to have uniformly high density, diversity and same design in every TOD neighbourhood. Using Hong Kong as an example, five major types of TOD neighbourhoods are identified.

The variations tendency of GHG inventories were studied from 1949 to 2013 in China on the basis of first order decay (FOD) method, and the total estimated GHG was found to be increased from 0.36 to 72.4 Mt CO2-equiv in this work. Landfill was the main contributor for the GHG emissions, and the occupied percentage increased from 17% in 1979, to the peak value of 82% in 1999, and finally to 69.5% in 2013. The regional GHG division patterns were calculated every 5 years after 2003 due to the remarkable increase of MSW in past decades. East China was found to be the dominant region for GHG emissions, while the corresponding percentage decreased from 38.60% in 2003 to 30.75% in 2013. The percentage increased from 4.69% to 7.31%, as more MSW were landfilling in North West. The methane mitigation technologies, especially the soil cover and landfill gas collection-flaring, are the main contribution for CH4 reduction. The diversion alternatives for landfill are effective in the indirect GHG mitigation, and the reduction of MSW disposal is another critical part through the implementation of “pay-as-your-throw” and environmental protection tax. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","60 years; China; GHG emission inventory; Regional division; Waste sector","Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Land fill; Municipal solid waste; Soils; 60 years; China; First-order decays; GHG emission; Greenhouse gas emission inventories; Methane mitigation; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Regional divisions; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019266687

Hence, the biogeochemistry in bromeliad tanks remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the structure of bacterial and archaeal communities inhabiting the detritus within the tanks of two bromeliad species, Aechmea nudicaulis and Neoregelia cruenta, from a Brazilian sand dune forest. We used metagenomic sequencing for functional community profiling and 16S sequencing for taxonomic profiling. We estimated the correlation between functional groups and various environmental variables, and compared communities between bromeliad species. In all bromeliads, microbial communities spanned a metabolic network adapted to oxygen-limited conditions, including all denitrification steps, ammonification, sulfate respiration, methanogenesis, reductive acetogenesis and anoxygenic phototrophy. Overall, CO2 reducers dominated in abundance over sulfate reducers, and anoxygenic phototrophs largely outnumbered oxygenic photoautotrophs. Functional community structure correlated strongly with environmental variables, between and within a single bromeliad species. Methanogens and reductive acetogens correlated with detrital volume and canopy coverage, and exhibited higher relative abundances in N. cruenta. A comparison of bromeliads to freshwater lake sediments and soil from around the world, revealed stark differences in terms of taxonomic as well as functional microbial community structure. © 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"fresh water; archaeon; Brazil; Bromeliaceae; chemistry; classification; genetics; isolation and purification; microbiology; microflora; soil; Archaea; Brazil; Bromeliaceae; Fresh Water; Microbiota; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021235496

Fuel reduction treatments have been effective where fires coincide with treated areas. Fuel treatments also have the potential to reduce drought-mortality if tree density is uncharacteristically high, and to increase long-term carbon storage by reducing high-severity fire probability. Objective: Assess whether fuel treatments reduce fire intensity and spread and increase carbon storage under climate change. Methods: We used a simulation modeling approach that couples a landscape model of forest disturbance and succession with an ecosystem model of carbon dynamics (Century), to quantify the interacting effects of climate change, fuel treatments and wildfire for carbon storage potential in a mixed-conifer forest in the western USA. Results: Our results suggest that fuel treatments have the potential to ‘bend the C curve’, maintaining carbon resilience despite climate change and climate-related changes to the fire regime. Simulated fuel treatments resulted in reduced fire spread and severity. There was partial compensation of C lost during fuel treatments with increased growth of residual stock due to greater available soil water, as well as a shift in species composition to more drought- and fire-tolerant Pinus jeffreyi at the expense of shade-tolerant, fire-susceptible Abies concolor. Conclusions: Forest resilience to global change can be achieved through management that reduces drought stress and supports the establishment and dominance of tree species that are more fire- and drought-resistant, however, achieving a net C gain from fuel treatments may take decades. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).","Carbon; Climate change; Fuel treatments; Lake Tahoe Basin; Resilience; Simulation modeling; Wildfire","carbon sequestration; climate change; community composition; coniferous forest; disturbance; drought resistance; drought stress; ecosystem modeling; ecosystem resilience; fire management; forest ecosystem; global change; growth; landscape ecology; shade tolerance; simulation; soil water; wildfire; Lake Tahoe Basin; United States; Abies concolor; Coniferophyta; Pinus jeffreyi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989956098

However, rebound effects caused by energy efficiency improvements directly affect the realization of energy savings and emission reduction. This paper focuses on the main theory and methodology of direct and indirect rebound effects. Using 30 sets of provincial panel data and national input–output data for China from 2007, this paper builds a co-integrating equation, a panel error correction model, and an 8-sector energy-input–output model. We subsequently estimate the direct and indirect rebound effects of urban residential electricity use. The results indicate that in the long term the direct plus indirect partial rebound effect is 0.79; in the short term it is 0.78. Thus, the majority of the expected electricity reduction in Chinese urban residential energy consumption arising from efficiency improvement may be offset. These rebound effects impair the functioning of energy efficiency policies. Therefore, the Chinese government should not improve energy efficiency alone—they must also take into consideration the relevant energy-pricing reforms when formulating energy policies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","China; Direct rebound; Energy efficiency; Indirect rebound; Input–output model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960110405

However, data on EUE, net income, and GHG emissions across various tillage and crop residue (straw) treatments remains scarce. This study aimed to estimate these variables across different tillage and straw treatments used in summer maize production in a winter wheat-summer maize cropping system in China’s Loess Plateau. Tillage treatments included chisel plowing, no tillage, and moldboard plowing. These were studied both with straw returned to the soil, or removed. All activities and production processes were recorded. The results demonstrate that fertilizer especially nitrogen fertilizer, and to a lesser extent, the fuel used for tillage, sowing and harvesting, were the two major consumers of energy and producers of GHG emissions. These results indicated that the use of chisel plow or conducting no tillage with straw returned to the soil, can reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions, and improve the economic benefits of summer maize production in the region, compared with conventional moldboard plow tillage without straw (which is typically burned off). The results show that further improvements could be facilitated by improving the utilization of nitrogen fertilizer, returning straw to the soil, and reducing tillage. These practices can reduce GHG reductions, and improve EUE and farmers’ incomes. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Conservation tillage; Energy use efficiency; Net income; Summer maize","agricultural emission; alternative agriculture; crop production; crop residue; emission control; energy efficiency; energy market; greenhouse gas; income; input-output analysis; maize; plowing; sowing; tillage; China; Loess Plateau; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020698881

It is coming to us faster with larger impacts and bigger risks than even most climate scientists expected as recently as a few years ago. One particular worry is the disastrous consequence to agriculture and food security sectors in many parts of the world, particularly in developing countries. Adaptation is the only option to reduce the impacts of climate change. However, before planning adaptation policies or strategies to climate change, it is important to assess the impacts of climate change at regional and local scale to have scientific evidence that would guide the formulation of such policies or strategies. In this study the impacts of climate change on rain-fed maize (Zea Mays) production in the southern and western highlands sub-agro ecological zones of Tanzania are evaluated. High resolution climate simulations from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment_Regional Climate Models (CORDEX_RCMs) were used as input into the Decision Support System for Agro-technological Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate maize yield in the historical climate condition (1971–2000), present (2010–2039), mid (2040–2069), and end (2070–2099) centuries. Daily rainfall, solar radiations, minimum and maximum temperatures for the historical (1971–2000) climate condition and future climate projections (2010–2099) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5 were used to drive DSSAT. The impacts of climate change were assessed by comparing the average maize yields in historical climate condition against the average of simulated maize yields in the present, mid and end centuries under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Results of future maize yields estimates from DSSAT driven by individual RCMs under both RCP scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) differs from one RCM to another and from one scenario to another. This highlight the uncertainty associated with the projection. Results from the ensemble average of the yields indicated that maize yields will decline in future climate condition by 3.1 and 5.3% under RCP 4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. High decreases in maize yield of 9.6% are expected in the end centuries under RCP 8.5. The main reason for decline in maize yields during future climate is the increase in temperatures that will shorten the length of growing seasons. Seasonal minimum temperature and maximum temperatureare expected to increase by 1.84 and 1.53◦ C, respectively under RCP 4.5 and by about 2.72 and 2.2◦ C, respectively, under RCP 8.5. Therefore it is recommended that more studies need to be carried, especially by crop breeders to find maize varieties that can withstand the impacts of increased temperatures over southern and western highlands sub-agro ecological zones of Tanzania. © 2017 Luhunga.","Climate change; CORDEX; Crop modeling; Maize yields; Regional climate models",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028082843

We report here an investigation of the effects of four different preparations of oxide-derived electrocatalysts on their activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction, with particular attention given to the selectivity to C2+ products. All catalysts were tested for CO2 reduction in 0.1 M KHCO3 and 0.1 M CsHCO3 at applied voltages in the range from -0.7 to -1.0 V vs RHE. The best performing oxide-derived catalysts show up to ∼70% selectivity to C2+ products and only ∼3% selectivity to C1 products at -1.0 V vs RHE when CsHCO3 is used as the electrolyte. In contrast, the selectivity to C2+ products decreases to ∼56% for the same catalysts tested in KHCO3. By studying all catalysts under identical conditions, the key factors affecting product selectivity could be discerned. These efforts reveal that the surface area of the oxide-derived layer is a critical parameter affecting selectivity. A high selectivity to C2+ products is attained at an overpotential of -1 V vs RHE by operating at a current density sufficiently high to achieve a moderately high pH near the catalyst surface but not so high as to cause a significant reduction in the local concentration of CO2. On the basis of recent theoretical studies, a high pH suppresses the formation of C1 relative to C2+ products.

Properly quantifying the possible effects of climate change on water resources under different hydrological models is a great challenge in ungauged alpine regions. By using remote sensing data to support established models, this study aimed to reveal the effects of climate change using two models of hydrological processes including total water resources, peak flows, evapotranspiration, snowmelt and snow accumulation in the ungauged Hotan River Basin under future representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. The results revealed that stream flow was much more sensitive to temperature variation than precipitation change and increased by 0.9-10.0% according to MIKE SHE or 6.5-10.5% according to SWAT. Increased evapotranspiration was similar for both models with a range of 7.6-31.3%. The snow-covered area shrank from 32.5% to 11.9% between the elevations of 4200-6400 m, respectively, and snow accumulation increased when the elevation exceeded 6400 m above sea level (asl). The results also suggested that the fully distributed and semi-distributed structures of these two models strongly influenced the responses to climate change. The study proposes a practical approach to assess the climate change effect in ungauged regions. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; General circulation models; Hotan River Basin; Hydrologic model; Snow storage","Climate models; Digital storage; Evapotranspiration; Remote sensing; Rivers; Sea level; Snow; Stream flow; Water resources; Watersheds; General circulation model; Global climate changes; Hydrologic modeling; Hydrological process; Multi-model ensemble; River basins; Snow storage; Temperature variation; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027717248

Authoritative emission control actions are usually compelled to prevent the frequent air pollution episodes in megacities of China, thus the effects of pollution control measures and meteorological factors need differentiating. Strict control measures were implemented by local/regional authorities to reduce anthropogenic emissions for the 2014 Summer Youth Olympic Games (YOG) in Nanjing of eastern China, by restricting the coalcombustion, industrial activities, construction works, vehicles and barbecue. By comparing the air quality before, during, and after the YOG at 13 monitoring stations that scatter in urban, suburban and exurban areas, air pollution (represented by particulate matters and O3) were reduced effectively by emission control measures, especially in urban areas. Moreover, precipitation eliminates air pollution directly. The daily Air Quality Index (AQI, considering PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3) and local meteorological parameters (temperature, extreme wind speed, humidity, atmospheric pressure) show considerable correlations. Based on high-resolution data, these quantitative relationships could be adopted for air quality forecast and air pollution mitigation strategies. © by PSP.","Air pollution; Air quality forecast; Air quality index (AQI); Emission control measures; Meteorological condition; Urbanization","air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; climate conditions; coal combustion; construction; emission control; forecasting method; index method; industrial emission; meteorology; parameter estimation; pollution monitoring; traffic emission; urban area; urban atmosphere; urban pollution; China; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025075936

As a secular side effect of this focus on individual reading skills, the Protestant territories were the first to acquire high literacy rates, which subsequently fostered health, economic growth, and good governance. Here I argue that a similar priority focus on empowerment of all segments of all populations through education and health (sola schola et sanitate) is needed today for sustainable development. According to decades of research, education and health are essential prerequisites for ending poverty and hunger, for improving institutions and participation in society, for voluntary fertility declines and ending world population growth, for changing behavior and adoption of new and clean technologies, and for enhancing adaptive capacity to already unavoidable climate change. This approach avoids paternalistic imposition of development policies by focusing external aid on enabling people to help themselves, their families, and communities. Prioritizing education and health also helps move more industrialized, aging societies from a focus on material consumption to one on quality of life. Sola schola et sanitate suggests that well-being will increasingly be based on health, continued mental stimulation, and consumption of cultural products, rather than fossil fuels and materials. Thus, cognition-or brain power-can be viewed as the zero-emissions energy for sustainable development.","Education; Health; Reformation; Sustainable development goals; World population","aging; Article; behavior change; capital; climate change; community; economic development; education; family; hunger; income; learning curve; literacy; policy; population growth; poverty; priority journal; quality of life; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021732245

Accurate forecasting of occurrence of such air pollutionevents in advance can help the community to take action to abate emissions and would ultimatelybenefit the citizens. To improve the PM2.5 air quality model forecasts in China, we proposed abias-correction framework that utilized the historic relationship between the model biases andforecasted and observational variables to post-process the current forecasts. The framework consistsof four components: (1) a feature selector that chooses the variables that are informative to modelforecast bias based on historic data; (2) a classifier trained to efficiently determine the forecast analogs(clusters) based on clustering analysis, such as the distance-based method and the classificationtree, etc.; (3) an error estimator, such as the Kalman filter, to predict model forecast errors at monitoringsites based on forecast analogs; and (4) a spatial interpolator to estimate the bias correction overthe entire modeling domain. One or more methods were tested for each step. We applied fivecombinations of these methods to PM2.5 forecasts in 2014-2016 over China from the operational AiMaair quality forecasting system using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Allfive methods were able to improve forecast performance in terms of normalized mean error (NME)and root mean square error (RMSE), though to a relatively limited degree due to the rapid changingof emission rates in China. Among the five methods, the CART-LM-KF-AN (a Classification AndRegression Trees-Linear Model-Kalman Filter-Analog combination) method appears to have the bestoverall performance for varied lead times. While the details of our study are specific to the forecastsystem, the bias-correction framework is likely applicable to the other air quality model forecastas well. © 2017 by the authors.

However, ecosystem responses to soil erosion and deposition remain largely unclear in regard to microorganisms, which are the crucial drivers of biogeochemical cycles. Using integrated metagenomics technologies, we analysed microbial communities subjected to simulated soil erosion and deposition in a semiarid grassland of Inner Mongolia, China. As expected, soil total organic carbon and plant coverage were decreased by soil erosion, and soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was increased by soil deposition, demonstrating that field simulation was reliable. Soil microbial communities were altered (p <.039) by both soil erosion and deposition, with dramatic increase in Cyanobacteria related to increased stability in soil aggregates. amyA genes encoding α-amylases were specifically increased (p =.01) by soil deposition and positively correlated (p =.02) to DOC, which likely explained changes in DOC. Surprisingly, most of microbial functional genes associated with carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium cycling were decreased or unaltered by both erosion and deposition, probably arising from acceleration of organic matter mineralization. These divergent responses support the necessity to include microbial components in evaluating ecological consequences. Furthermore, Mantel tests showed strong, significant correlations between soil nutrients and functional structure but not taxonomic structure, demonstrating close relevance of microbial function traits to nutrient cycling. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","16S rRNA sequencing; functional traits; geochip 5.0; microbial community; soil deposition; wind erosion","carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; potassium; bacterium; chemistry; China; classification; grassland; microbiology; soil; Bacteria; Carbon; China; Grassland; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023620773

This original work conceptualizes US climate policy first and foremost as a question of innovation policy, with capital accumulation and market domination as its main drivers. It argues that US climate policy must be understood in the context of Washington's broader efforts over the past four decades to dominate and monopolize novel high-tech markets, and its use of immense amounts of state power to achieve this end. From this perspective, many elements of US climate politics that seem confusing or contradictory actually appear to have an obvious and consistent logic.

In this research potentials of biomass integration in agricultural processes were evaluated and all parts of their full life cycles were replaced with ecological processes of low impact. A method that covers global resource availabilities, life cycle chains and their emissions to final compartments on earth’ spheres in a detailed way is Sustainable Process Index. This footprint calculator accumulates the total resource use of a full life cycle of a process chain in one number of m2 area. Current typical conventional agricultural cropping processes shall be made comparable to a strongly sustainable ecological footprint which could be achieved if heavy footprint measures would be replaced by those with smaller impacts in natural cycles. The production of maize grain is evaluated to find out the ecological hotspots. A comparison of business as usual conventional farming practice and ecological/organic farming practice is carried out. The evaluation results confirmed that fossil fuel consumption and application of mineral fertilizers along with pesticides are the main ecological hotspots. The ecological footprint and carbon footprint showed a bandwidth of 24,731 to 10,690 m2/tonne and 88.5 and 22.6 kg carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne maize grain production respectively. The shift from conventional farming practice to organic farming and use of biogas as fuel showed an ecological footprint reduction potential ranging from 22% to 57% while the carbon footprint reduction potential ranges from 38% to 74%.

The proposed simplified synthesis strategy can help in overcoming the limitations of existing aqueous routes which produce GQDs with excitation dependent emission and of low quantum efficiency. Photoluminescence (PL) properties of GQDs have been studied in detail to understand the origin of emission. Assynthesized GQDs show excitation independent photoluminesce (PL) which suggests that the synthesized materials do not have any significant defects. Spectral analysis suggests that the PL emission of the well-defined GQDs originates mainly from the peripheral functional groups conjugated with carbon backbone planes. We also demonstrate a relatively longer PL lifetime (average lifetime of about 10 ns) of the synthesized GQDs determined by time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurement and this high lifetime suggests that the synthesized GQDs may be suitable for biomacromolecular probing.

This scenario has propelled work in the direction of utilization of CO2 by various methods. Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is one of the leading research areas that may be useful not only for the utilization of CO2 but also for the generation of green fuels and storage of renewable energy (solar or wind). However, the process is kinetically impeded and less selective toward a specific product and, therefore, requires efficient electrocatalysts. Much work has already been done in this field, and significant success has also been achieved. Hence, in this review paper, the potential of electrochemical reduction of CO2 for fuel generation is discussed, with special focus on electrocatalysts. The suitability of different electrocatalysts is addressed along with the possible scope for enhancing the efficiency of the process. WIREs Energy Environ 2017, 6:e244. doi: 10.1002/wene.244.

Updated relative risk estimates are now available for the same cohort based on an expanded study population with longer follow-up. Objectives: We estimated the global burden and spatial distribution of respiratory mortality attributable to long-term O3 exposure in adults ≥30 y of age using updated effect estimates from the ACS CPS-II cohort. Methods: We used GEOS-Chem simulations (2x2.5° grid resolution) to estimate annual O3 exposures, and estimated total respiratory deaths in 2010 that were attributable to long-term annual O3 exposure based on the updated relative risk estimates and minimum risk thresholds set at the minimum or fifth percentile of O3 exposure in the most recent CPS-II analysis. These estimates were compared with attributable mortality based on the earlier CPS-II analysis, using 6-mo average exposures and risk thresholds corresponding to the minimum or fifth percentile of O3 exposure in the earlier study population. Results: We estimated 1.04-1.23 million respiratory deaths in adults attributable to O3 exposures using the updated relative risk estimate and exposure parameters, compared with 0.40-0.55 million respiratory deaths attributable to O3 exposures based on the earlier CPS-II risk estimate and parameters. Increases in estimated attributable mortality were larger in northern India, southeast China, and Pakistan than in Europe, eastern United States, and northeast China. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the potential magnitude of health benefits of air quality policies targeting O3, health co-benefits of climate mitigation policies, and health implications of climate change-driven changes in O3 concentrations, are larger than previously thought. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

An algorithm to manage the microgrid via the demand-response strategy is proposed, accentuating the requirement that the total volume of energy produced from renewable sources is consumed. Thus, the system utilizes the maximum of renewable sources to reduce CO2 emissions. Another major benefit provided by the algorithm lies in applying the current weather forecast to predict the amount of energy in the grid; electricity can then be transferred between the local and the main backup batteries within the grid, and this option enables the control elements to prepare for a condition yet to occur.

Siderite occurs as veins cutting the Variscan basement and the overlying Lower Permian volcano-sedimentary cover (Collio Fm.), and as both veins and conformable stratabound orebodies in the Upper Permian (Verrucano Lombardo and Bellerophon Fms.) and Lower Triassic (Servino and Werfen Fms.) sedimentary sequences of the Lombardian and the Venetian Alps. All types of deposits show similar major- and rare-earth (REE)-element patterns, suggesting a common iron-mineralizing event. The compositions of coexisting siderite, Fe-rich dolomite and calcite suggest formation from hydrothermal fluids at relatively high temperature conditions (≥ 250 °C). Geochemical modelling, supported by REE analyses and by literature and new δ13C and δ18O isotopic data, suggests that fluids responsible for the formation of siderite in the Variscan basement and in the overlying Lower Permian cover were derived from dominant fresh water, which leached Fe and C from volcanic rocks (mainly rhyolites/rhyodacites) and organic carbon-bearing continental sediments. On the basis of U-Th-Pb microchemical dating of uraninite associated with siderite in the Val Vedello and Novazza deposits (Lombardian Alps), the onset of hydrothermalism is constrained to 275 ± 13 Ma (Early–Mid Permian), i.e., it was virtually contemporaneous to the plutonism and the volcanic-sedimentary cycle reported in the same area (Orobic Basin). The youngest iron-mineralizing event is represented by siderite veins and conformable orebodies hosted in Lower Triassic shallow-marine carbonatic successions. In this case, the siderite-forming fluids contained a seawater component, interacted with the underlying Permian successions and eventually replaced the marine carbonates at temperatures of ≥ 250 °C. The absence of siderite in younger rocks suggests an Early Triassic upper limit for the iron pulse in the Southern Alps, which would thus predate the Middle Triassic magmatism. Based on the overlap between hydrothermalism, extensional tectonics and, in part, magmatism, the genesis of siderite in the Southern Alps may be related to plutonic activity and/or magmatic underplating occurring since the Permian in a geodynamic scenario preluding the opening of the Neo-Tethys. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Early Permian; Early Triassic; Siderite; Stratabound deposits; Uranium; Vein deposits","geochemistry; hydrothermal fluid; ore body; Permian; rare earth element; siderite; Triassic; uranium; vein (geology); New Zealand; South Island; Southern Alps; Bellerophon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018410995

Although the effects of this impact have been widely investigated, efforts have been focused on large dams, so information about small reservoirs and their effects on ecosystem functioning is lacking. A recent collaborative project (IMPARIOS) addressed the effects of flow regulation by small impoundments on leaf-litter decomposition, a key function in low order streams which contributes greatly to the global carbon cycle. Flow regulation was found to affect ecosystem functioning reducing decomposition rate by altering shredders, but the magnitude of change varied among the different sub-climatic regions. The current project examined whether climatic variables modulate the effect of flow regulation on decomposition. For this, 19 bioclimatic variables were studied in relation to the leaf-litter decomposition rate and associated variables (sporulation rate and richness of aquatic hyphomycetes, and richness, density and biomass of total macroinvertebrates and shredders) in 17 streams impacted by regulation structures distributed in four sub-climatic regions within Spain. Overall, decomposition was slower below structures and climate influenced the magnitude of reduction.

We report here results of a pilot trial testing the effectiveness of a reporting and feedback intervention using the Survey of Organizational Research Climate (SOuRCe). Methods: We randomized 41 Veterans Health Administration (VA) facilities to a phone-based intervention designed to help research leaders understand their survey results (enhanced arm) or to an intervention in which results were simply distributed to research leaders (basic arm). Primary outcomes were (1) whether leaders took action, (2) whether actions taken were consistent with the feedback received, and (3) whether responses differed by receptivity to quality improvement input. Results: Research leaders from 25 of 42 (59%) VA facilities consented to participate in the study intervention and follow-up, of which 14 were at facilities randomized to the enhanced arm. We completed follow-up interviews with 21 of the 25 leaders (88%), 12 from enhanced arm facilities. While not statistically significant, the proportion of leaders reporting taking some action in response to the feedback was twice as high in the enhanced arm than in the basic arm (67% vs. 33%, p =.20). While also not statistically significant, a higher proportion of actions taken among facilities in the enhanced arm were responsive to the survey results than in the basic arm (42% vs. 22%, p =.64). Conclusions: Enhanced feedback of survey results appears to be a promising intervention that may increase the likelihood of responsive action to improve organizational climates. Due to the small sample size of this pilot study, even large percentage-point differences between study arms are not statistically distinguishable. This hypothesis should be tested in a larger trial. © 2017, This Article is not subject to U.S. Copyright Law.","organizational climate; randomized controlled trial; reporting and feedback; research integrity; survey; Veterans Affairs","comprehension; controlled study; ethics; feedback system; government; human; leadership; morality; organizational culture; personnel; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; research; research ethics; United States; veteran; Comprehension; Ethics, Research; Feedback; Humans; Leadership; Morals; Organizational Culture; Research; Research Personnel; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028767220

Use of oil products contributes ∼35% of global GHG emissions, and the oil industry itself consumes 3-4% of global primary energy. Because oil resources are becoming increasingly heterogeneous, requiring different extraction and processing methods, GHG studies should evaluate oil sources using detailed project-specific data. Unfortunately, prior oil-sector GHG analysis has largely neglected the fact that the energy intensity of producing oil can change significantly over the life of a particular oil project. Here we use decades-long time-series data from twenty-five globally significant oil fields (>1 billion barrels ultimate recovery) to model GHG emissions from oil production as a function of time. We find that volumetric oil production declines with depletion, but this depletion is accompanied by significant growth-in some cases over tenfold-in per-MJ GHG emissions. Depletion requires increased energy expenditures in drilling, oil recovery, and oil processing. Using probabilistic simulation, we derive a relationship for estimating GHG increases over time, showing an expected doubling in average emissions over 25 years. These trends have implications for long-term emissions and climate modelling, as well as for climate policy. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"climate effect; climate modeling; emission control; environmental policy; extraction method; greenhouse gas; local government; oil field; project assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021961379

While there is mounting evidence that increased plant community diversity can reduce the variability of ecosystem functions (such as primary productivity) in the face of environmental fluctuation, there has been little work testing whether this is true for intensively managed agricultural systems. Using statistical modeling techniques to fit environment–productivity relationships offers an efficient means of leveraging hard-won experimental data to compare the potential variability of different mixtures across a wide range of environmental contexts. We used data from two multiyear field experiments to fit climate–soil–productivity models for two pasture mixtures under intensive grazing—one composed of two drought-sensitive species (standard), and an eight-species mixture including several drought-resistant species (complex). We then used these models to undertake a scoping study estimating the mean and coefficient of variation (CV) of annual productivity for long-term climate data covering all New Zealand on soils with low, medium, or high water-holding capacity. Our results suggest that the complex mixture is likely to have consistently lower CV in productivity, irrespective of soil type or climate regime. Predicted differences in mean annual productivity between mixtures were strongly influenced by soil type and were closely linked to mean annual soil water availability across all soil types. Differences in the CV of productivity were only strongly related to interannual variance in water availability for the lowest water-holding capacity soil. Our results show that there is considerable scope for mixtures including drought-tolerant species to enhance certainty in intensive pastoral systems. This provides justification for investing resources in a large-scale distributed experiment involving many sites under different environmental contexts to confirm these findings. © 2017 The Authors.

It may affect the rates of combustion by altering mechanisms of chemical reactions, compared to the ones at low CO2 concentrations. Here, we investigate potential energy surfaces of the four elementary reactions in the CH3 + O2 reactive system in the presence of one CO2 molecule. In the case of reaction CH3 + O2 → CH2O + OH (R1 channel), van der Waals (vdW) complex formation stabilizes the transition state and reduces the activation barrier by ∼2.2 kcal/mol. Alternatively, covalently bonded CO2 may form a six-membered ring transition state and reduce the activation barrier by ∼0.6 kcal/mol. In case of reaction CH3 + O2 → CH3O + O (R2 channel), covalent participation of CO2 lowers the barrier for the rate limiting step by 3.9 kcal/mol. This is expected to accelerate the R2 process, important for the branching step of the radical chain reaction mechanism. For the reaction CH3 + O2 → CHO + H2O (R3 channel) with covalent participation of CO2, the activation barrier is lowered by 0.5 kcal/mol. The reaction CH2O + OH → CHO + H2O (R4 channel) involves hydrogen abstraction from formaldehyde by OH radical. Its barrier is reduced from 7.1 to 0.8 kcal/mol by formation of vdW complex with spectator CO2. These new findings are expected to improve the kinetic reaction mechanism describing combustion processes in supercritical CO2 medium.

This paper presents a robust tool to allow the integration of perception, concerns and impacts of different income groups in urban adaptation planning and governance, using the City of New York as a case study. Employing online interviews-A solid method to reach poorer households-and Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping, we compare impacts and adaptation perception to heat and simulate adaptation scenarios. Results reveal that lower income groups are more concerned about impacts of heat waves than middle- and high-income populations. All income groups see citizens more in charge of adaptation, although more people from the lower income groups regard it necessary to do much more to protect themselves, proportionately more people from the higher income groups think they are doing the right amount. The scenario analysis shows that, compared to investments in the water/electricity and health system, improvements in the transit system would yield the largest decrease in negative impacts during heat, benefitting all income groups jointly. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Climate governance; FCM (Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping); Heat wave; Income groups; New York City; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027513540

This carbon use efficiency (CUE) is affected by various abiotic conditions, including temperature and nutrient availability. Theoretically, the physiological costs of interspecific interactions should likewise alter CUE, yet the magnitude of these costs is untested. Here we conduct a microcosm experiment to quantify how interactions among wood-decay basidiomycete fungi alter growth, respiration and CUE across a temperature and nitrogen gradient. We show that species interactions induced consistent declines in CUE, regardless of abiotic conditions. Multispecies communities exhibited reductions in CUE of up to 25% relative to individual CUE, with this biotic effect being greater than the observed variation attributable to abiotic conditions.

As a result, climate-sensitive coastal policy instruments are critical for providing adequate adaptation options, including an option to allow coastal features to migrate inland. But the migration of coastal features is under threat due to extensive private armoring. This essay highlights specific regulatory instruments at the federal and state level dealing with hard armoring using Massachusetts as an example. It argues specific federal and state regulations legitimize and incentivize hard armoring over other coastal land use planning methods.

As these species distributions respond to rapid climate change, microrefugia may support local species persistence in the face of deteriorating climatic suitability. Recent focus on temperature as a determinant of microrefugia insufficiently accounts for the importance of hydrologic processes and changing water availability with changing climate. Where water scarcity is a major limitation now or under future climates, hydrologic microrefugia are likely to prove essential for species persistence, particularly for sessile species and plants. Zones of high relative water availability – mesic microenvironments – are generated by a wide array of hydrologic processes, and may be loosely coupled to climatic processes and therefore buffered from climate change. Here, we review the mechanisms that generate mesic microenvironments and their likely robustness in the face of climate change. We argue that mesic microenvironments will act as species-specific refugia only if the nature and space/time variability in water availability are compatible with the ecological requirements of a target species. We illustrate this argument with case studies drawn from California oak woodland ecosystems. We posit that identification of hydrologic refugia could form a cornerstone of climate-cognizant conservation strategies, but that this would require improved understanding of climate change effects on key hydrologic processes, including frequently cryptic processes such as groundwater flow. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; conservation; fog; groundwater; hydrologic niche; hydrologic refugia; microrefugia; refugia","climate change; fog; groundwater; hydrological response; niche; plant; refugium; water availability; California; climate; climate change; ecosystem; hydrology; plant; refugium; California; Climate; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Hydrology; Plants; Refugium",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017368385

There is a need to critically examine diverse climate change risks for indigenous peoples in theUnited States and the many structural barriers that limit their ability to adapt to climate change. This paper uses a sustainable climate adaptation framework to outline the context and the relationships of power and authority, along with different ways of knowing and meaning, to illustrate the underpinnings of some tribes' barriers to sustainable climate adaptation. The background of those structural barriers for tribes is traced, and then the case of water rights and management at the Wind River Reservation inWyoming is used to illustrate the interplay of policy, culture, climate, justice, and limits to adaptation. Included is a discussion about how the rulings of the BigHorn general stream adjudication have hindered tribal climate change adaptation by limiting the quantity of tribal reserved water rights, tying those rights to the sole purposes of agriculture,which undermines social and cultural connections to the land and water, and failing to recognizing tribal rights to groundwater. Future climate projections suggest increasing temperatures, and changes in the amount and timing of snowpack, along with receding glaciers, all of which impact water availability downstream. Therefore, building capacity to take control of land and water resources and preparing for climate change and drought at Wind River Reservation is of critical importance. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.",,"adaptive management; climate change; environmental policy; ethnic minority; nature-society relations; sustainability; water planning; water resource; United States; Wind River; Wyoming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020797996

Manaus, the largest city in the central Amazon Basin of Brazil, is in the process of changing its energy matrix for electricity production from fuel oil and diesel to natural gas over an approximately 10-year period, with a minor contribution by hydropower. Three scenarios of urban air quality, specifically afternoon ozone concentrations, were simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-Chem) model. The first scenario used fuel oil and diesel for electricity production, which was the reality in 2008. The second scenario was based on the fuel mix from 2014, the most current year for which data were available. The third scenario considered nearly complete use of natural gas for electricity production, which is the anticipated future, possibly for 2018. For each case, inventories of anthropogenic emissions were based on electricity generation, refinery operations, and transportation. Transportation and refinery operations were held constant across the three scenarios to focus on effects of power plant fuel switching in a tropical context. The simulated NOx and CO emissions for the urban region decrease by 89 and 55% respectively, after the complete change in the energy matrix. The results of the simulations indicate that a change to natural gas significantly decreases maximum afternoon ozone concentrations over the population center, reducing ozone by &gt; 70% for the most polluted days. The sensitivity of ozone concentrations to the fuel switchover is consistent with a NOx-limited regime, as expected for a tropical forest having high emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds, high water vapor concentrations, and abundant solar radiation. There are key differences in a shifting energy matrix in a tropical, forested environment compared to other world environments. Policies favoring the burning of natural gas in place of fuel oil and diesel have great potential for ozone reduction and improved air quality for growing urban regions located in tropical, forested environments around the world. © 2017 Author(s).

For 20 governance arrangements in European and North-American cities, the divisions of responsibilities and the underlying rationales of actors for those divisions were analysed and compared. Data were gathered through content analysis of over 100 policy documents, 97 in-depth interviews and 2 multi-stakeholder workshops. The comparative analysis reveals that local public authorities are the key actors, as they bear the majority of responsibilities for climate proofing their cities. In this stage of policy emergence, local authorities are clearly in the driving seat. It is envisaged that local public authorities need to more actively engage the different private actors such as citizens, civil society and businesses through governance networks along with the maturation of the policy field and the expected acceleration of climate impacts in the coming decades. © 2016 The Author(s).

Changes to agricultural practices can provide GHG abatement by maintaining or increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in soils or vegetation, or by decreasing N2O emissions. However, it can be difficult to identify practices that achieve net abatement because practices that increase SOC stocks may also increase N2O emissions from the soil. This study simulated the net on-farm GHG abatement and gross margins for a range of management scenarios on two grain farms from the western and southern grain growing regions of Australia using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model. The soils and practices selected for the study were typical of these regions. Increased cropping intensity consistently provided emissions reductions for all site-soil combinations. The practice of replacing uncropped or unmanaged pasture fallows with a winter legume crop was the only one of nine scenarios to decrease GHG emissions and increase gross margins relative to baseline practice at both locations over the 100-year simulation period. The greatest abatement was obtained by combining this practice with an additional summer legume crop grown for a short period as green manure. However, adding the summer legume decreased farm gross margins because the summer crop used soil moisture otherwise available to the following cash crop, thus reducing yield and revenue. Annual N2O emissions from the soil were an order of magnitude lower from sandy-well-drained soils at the Western Australian location (Dalwallinu) than at the other location (Wimmera) with clay soil, highlighting the importance of interactions between climate and soil properties in determining appropriate GHG abatement practices. Thus, greatest abatement at Dalwallinu was obtained from maintaining or increasing SOC, but managing both N2O emissions and SOC storage were important for providing abatement at Wimmera. © 2017 The Authors","APSIM model; Carbon dioxide equivalent CO2e; Global warming potential; Gross margins; Nitrous oxide emissions; Soil organic carbon sequestration","abatement cost; agricultural land; biophysics; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; cash cropping; financial policy; greenhouse gas; nitrous oxide; pollution control; soil carbon; soil moisture; soil organic matter; Australia; Victoria [Australia]; Wimmera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019380746

Climate station data are considered inadequate to produce such estimates, a viewpoint we challenge here. Using climate stations and topographic data, we developed three sets of large-domain (450 000 km²), fine-grain (50 m) temperature grids accounting for different levels of topographic complexity. Using these fine-grain grids and the Worldclim data, we fitted SDMs for 78 alpine species over Sweden, and assessed over- versus underestimations of local extinction and area of microrefugia by comparing modelled distributions at species' rear edges. Accounting for well-known topographic climate-forcing factors improved our ability to model fine-scale climate, despite using only climate station data. This approach captured the effect of cool air pooling, distance to sea, and relative humidity on local-scale temperature, but the effect of solar radiation could not be accurately accounted for. Predicted extinction rate decreased with increasing spatial resolution of the climate models and with increasing number of topographic climate-forcing factors accounted for. About half of the microrefugia detected in the most topographically complete models were not detected in the coarser SDMs and in the models calibrated from climate variables extracted from elevation only. Although major limitations remain, climate station data can potentially be used to produce fine-grain topoclimate grids, opening up the opportunity to model local-scale ecological processes over large domains. Accounting for the topographic complexity encountered within landscapes permits the detection of microrefugia that would otherwise remain undetected. Topographic heterogeneity is likely to have a massive impact on species persistence, and should be included in studies on the effects of climate change. © 2016 The Authors.

Nevertheless, in order to set up any strategy for water resources management in such regions, understanding the groundwater recharge variability is essential. This work is interested in examining the impact of rainfall on the aquifer system recharge in the Northern Gafsa Plain in Tunisia. The study is composed of two main parts. The first is interested in the analysis of rainfall spatial and temporal variability in the study basin while the second is devoted to the simulation of groundwater recharge. Rainfall analysis was performed based on annual precipitation data recorded in 6 rainfall stations over a period of 56 years (1960–2015). Potential evapotranspiration data were also collected from 1960 to 2011 (52 years). The hydrologic distributed model WetSpass was used for the estimation of groundwater recharge. Model calibration was performed based on an assessment of the agreement between the sum of recharge and runoff values estimated by the WetSpass hydrological model and those obtained by the climatic method. This latter is based on the difference calculated between rainfall and potential evapotranspiration recorded at each rainy day. Groundwater recharge estimation, on monthly scale, showed that average annual precipitation (183.3 mm/year) was partitioned to 5, 15.3, 36.8, and 42.8% for interception, runoff, actual evapotranspiration and recharge respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Actual evapotranspiration; Groundwater; Rainfall; Semi arid; Tunisia; WetSpass","aquifer; groundwater; hydrological modeling; potential evapotranspiration; rainfall; recharge; runoff; semiarid region; Gafsa; Tunisia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018354448

On a global scale, it is related to climate change and initiatives towards reduction of greenhouse gases, such as Paris Agreement Within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. According to the agreement, each county has its targets on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. By the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the share of greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector is about 25%, which is the largest share. In terms of practice, the greenhouse gases can be reduced by the consumption of energy on the consumer level. The existing end user's energy efficiency methodologies often focus on the aspects of the consumer unit efficiency rather than on the energy efficiency of the whole system. Losses in installations and efficiency of subsystems before and after the consumer unit could be considerable. Therefore, commonly, methods are not used for both load conservation and scheduling analysis. We propose an improved value stream mapping methodology to evaluate energy saving of the whole system, by elaborating the load scheduling method described in our previous paper. Therefore, we propose a method for finding losses in three different aspects: reduction of losses before the consumer unit, reduction of losses in the consumer unit and reduction of losses behind the consumer unit. The improved method is described through an experimental example in a boiler plant with a simple process for woodchip conveying and stocking. Finally, we compare the method with other energy efficiency and peak clipping evaluation methods. The benefits of the method are that it combines different load shaping strategies into one method for energy savings. © 2017 IEEE.","Demand side management; Energy conservation; Energy consumption; Energy efficiency; Load management","Climate change; Demand side management; Electric load management; Electric utilities; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Mapping; Scheduling; Consumption of energy; Evaluation methods; Load scheduling; Scheduling analysis; Unit efficiency; United nations framework convention on climate changes; United States environmental protection agency; Value stream mapping; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026764160

The results proved that our proposed index could reflect more spatial variation of human activities. It is also prominent in reducing the carbon modeling error at the inter-city level and distinguishing the emission heterogeneity at the intra-city level. Between 1995 and 2013, CO2 emissions increased significantly in China, but were distributed unevenly in space with high density emissions mainly located in metropolitan areas and provincial capitals. In addition to Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangzi River Delta and the Pearl River Delta, the Shandong Peninsula has become a new emission hotspot that needs special attention in carbon mitigation. The improved VANUI and its application to the carbon emission issue not only broadened our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fine-scaled CO2 emission, but also provided implications for low-carbon and sustainable development plans. © 2017 by the authors.","China; CO2 emissions; Nighttime light; Spatiotemporal pattern; Vegetation Adjust NTL Urban Index (VANUI)","Carbon dioxide; Population statistics; Sustainable development; China; CO2 emissions; Environmental issues; Night-time lights; Normalized difference vegetation index; Population densities; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Spatiotemporal patterns; Vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028353585

Here, we report the occurrence and physical properties of previously undetected CO2 inclusions that were identified in 3.36–3.47 Ga and 3.80–4.13 Ga zircon grains by confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy. Minimum P–T conditions of zircon formation were determined from the highest density of the inclusions, determined from the density-dependence of the Fermi diad splitting in the Raman spectrum and Ti-in-zircon thermometry. For both age periods, the CO2 densities and Ti-in-zircon temperatures correspond to high-grade metamorphic conditions (≥5 to ≥7 kbar/~670 to 770 °C) that are typical of mid-crustal regional metamorphism throughout Earth’s history. In addition, fully enclosed, highly disordered graphitic carbon inclusions were identified in two zircon grains from the older population that also contained CO2 inclusions. Transmission electron microscopy on one of these inclusions revealed that carbon forms a thin amorphous film on the inclusion wall, whereas the rest of the volume was probably occupied by CO2 prior to analysis. This indicates a close relationship between CO2 and the reduced carbon inclusions and, in particular that the carbon precipitated from a CO2-rich fluid, which is inconsistent with the recently proposed biogenic origin of carbon inclusions found in Hadean zircons from Jack Hills. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Carbon; CO2; Early Earth; Jack Hills; Zircon","carbon dioxide; early Earth; fluid inclusion; P-T conditions; regional metamorphism; zircon; Australia; Jack Hills; Western Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021930545

These include a highly idealized two-layer model seeded with point geostrophic vortices, an intermediate complexity GCM, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim) data. The domain of interest is the extratropics. Both the two-layer model and the GCM display a pronounced temporal variability in the zonally integrated meridional transport, with the largest values (or pulses) of zonally integrated transport being associated with extended regions of anomalously strong local heat transport. In the two-layer model these large-scale coherent transport regions, termed ""heat transport bands,"" are linked to densely packed baroclinic vortex pairs and can be diagnosed as low-wavenumber streamfunction anomalies. In the GCM they are associated with both the warm and cold sectors of midlatitude weather systems. Both these features are also found in ERA-Interim: the heat transport bands match weather systems and occur primarily in the storm-track regions, which in turn correspond to planetary-scale climatological streamfunction anomalies. The authors hypothesize that the temporal variability of the zonally integrated heat transport is partly linked to oscillatory variations in the storm-track activity but also contains a background red noise component. The existence of a pronounced variability in the zonally integrated meridional heat transport can have important consequences for the interplay between midlatitude dynamics and the energy balance of the high latitudes. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Atmosphere; Extreme events; Heat budgets/fluxes; Storm tracks; Transport","Atmospheric movements; Earth atmosphere; Heat transfer; Storms; Vortex flow; European centre for medium-range weather forecasts; Extreme events; Heat budgets/fluxes; Intermediate complexity; Meridional heat transports; Spatial and temporal variability; Storm track; Transport; Weather forecasting; atmospheric general circulation model; atmospheric transport; data set; energy balance; extreme event; heat budget; heat transfer; spatiotemporal analysis; storm track; vorticity; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023628917

Here, we analysed the early photosynthetic gas exchange responses in Nicotiana attenuata plants after wounding and elicitation with Manduca sexta oral secretions and the pathways regulating these responses. Elicitation with M. sexta oral secretions rapidly decreased photosynthetic carbon assimilation (AC) in treated and systemic (untreated, vascularly connected) leaves, which were associated with changes in stomatal conductance, rather than with changes in Rubisco activity and 1-5 ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate turnover. Phytohormone profiling and gas exchange analysis of oral secretion-elicited transgenic plants altered in phytohormone regulation, biosynthesis and perception, combined with micrografting techniques, revealed that the local photosynthetic responses were mediated by 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, while the systemic responses involved interactions among jasmonates, cytokinins and abscisic acid signalling mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase 4. The analysis also revealed a role for cytokinins interacting with mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 in CO2-mediated stomatal regulation. Hence, oral secretions, while eliciting jasmonic acid-mediated defence responses, also elicit 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid-mediated changes in stomatal conductance and AC, an observation illustrating the complexity and economy of the signalling that regulates defence and carbon assimilation pathways in response to herbivore attack. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","abscisic acid; CO2 regulation; gas exchange; herbivore perception; herbivore-associated elicitors and herbivore-especific responses; jasmonates; photosynthesis","assimilation efficiency; carbon; carbon dioxide; enzyme activity; gas exchange; herbivore; hormone; moth; organic acid; perception; photosynthesis; protein; secretion; stomatal conductance; tobacco; wounding; Manduca sexta; Nicotiana attenuata; 12-oxophytodienoic acid; carbon; cytokinin; mitogen activated protein kinase; plant protein; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; unsaturated fatty acid; animal; genetics; herbivory; Manduca; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; plant stoma; shoot; tobacco; transgenic plant; Animals; Carbon; Cytokinins; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Herbivory; Manduca; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Plant Shoots; Plant Stomata; Plants, Genetically Modified; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase; Tobacco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016611643

Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator of ecosystem function that represents the amount of productivity per unit mass of evapotranspiration (ET). Improving WUE of suburban ecosystem is significant to climate regulation by carbon sequestration and water consumption, especially for cities with severe water shortage like Beijing, the capital of China. Based on remote sensing data, this paper examined the spatial and temporal variations in WUE in Beijing's suburban region from 2002 to 2010. The results showed that the average annual WUE was 0.868 g C mm-1 m-2. It has large spatial variation with the minimum of 0.500 g C mm-1 m-2 in the Miyun District. During the study periods, the area with significant increasing trend of WUE was 63.2% of the total suburban region. In terms of ecosystem type, the value of WUE was following the sequence, deciduous coniferous forest (0.921g C mm-1 m-2) &gt; mixed forest (0.887g C mm-1 m-2) &gt; deciduous broadleaf forest (0.884 g C mm-1 m-2) &gt; shrubland (0.860 g C mm-1 m-2) &gt; evergreen coniferous forest (0.836 g C mm-1 m-2) &gt; grassland (0.830 g C mm-1 m-2). As ET was similar among the ecosystems, the difference in WUE was mainly due to the discrepancy of NPP. We found that NPP significantly correlated with the diversity of ecosystem type (represented by Shannon-Wiener index). Our results suggest that ecological engineering construction, scientific ecosystem type selection, ecosystem diversity improvement and drought-resistant species cultivation are conductive to improve ecosystem WUE in Beijing's suburban region. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Drought; Ecology; Efficiency; Environmental management; Forestry; Remote sensing; Soil conservation; Water resources; Water supply; Carbon sequestration; Ecological engineering; Ecosystem diversity; Ecosystem functions; Remote sensing data; Spatial and temporal variation; Spatial variations; Water-use efficiency; Ecosystems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029469523

Through analysing the climate responses of the three provincial-level governments at the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), the paper argues that the process of “experimentation under hierarchy” is relevant to understanding the evolving of the subnational climate regime in the YRD region. We find the preponderance of the central authorities in initiating national climate strategies and galvanising responses at the local level. Meanwhile, provincial governments have been able to leverage climate plans and actions to achieve their own gains. These findings suggest that any optimism about subnational climate activism in a Chinese setting has to be mixed with caution.

Biogenic habitats such as seagrass beds have the capacity to reduce CO2 concentration and potentially provide refugia from OA. Further, some seagrasses have been shown to increase their photosynthetic rate in response to enriched total CO2 (TCO2). Therefore, the ability of seagrass to mitigate OA may increase as concentrations of TCO2 increase. In this study, we exposed native Zostera marina and non-native Zostera japonica seagrasses from Padilla Bay, WA (USA) to various levels of irradiance and TCO2. Our results indicate that the average maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pmax) for Z. japonica as a function of irradiance and TCO2 was 3x greater than Z. marina when standardized to chlorophyll (360 ± 33 μmol TCO2 mg chl-1 h-1 and 113 ± 10 μmol TCO2 mg chl-1 h-1, respectively). Additionally, Z. japonica increased its Pmax ~50% when TCO2 increased from ~1,770 to 2,051 μmol TCO2 kg-1. In contrast, Z. marina did not display an increase in Pmax with higher TCO2, possibly due to the variance of photosynthetic rates at saturating irradiance within TCO2 treatments (coefficient of variation: 30-60%) relative to the range of TCO2 tested. Our results suggest that Z. japonica can affect the OA mitigation potential of seagrass beds, and its contribution may increase relative to Z. marina as oceanic TCO2 rises. Further, we extended our empirical results to incorporate various biomass to water volume ratios in order to conceptualize how these additional attributes affect changes in carbonate chemistry. Estimates show that the change in TCO2 via photosynthetic carbon uptake as modeled in this study can produce positive diurnal changes in pH and aragonite saturation state that are on the same order of magnitude as those estimated for whole seagrass systems. Based on our results, we predict that seagrasses Z. marina and Z. japonica both have the potential to produce short-term changes in carbonate chemistry, thus offsetting anthropogenic acidification when irradiance is saturating. © 2017 Miller, Yang and Love.","Mitigation; Ocean acidification; Photosynthetic potential; Seagrass; TCO2; Zostera japonica; Zostera marina",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025812724

The Table Mountain Group (TMG) Aquifer is one of the largest and most important aquifer systems in South Africa and is currently being considered as an alternative source of potable water for the City of Cape Town, a metropolis of over four million people. The TMG aquifer is a fractured rock aquifer hosted primarily in super mature sandstones, quartzites and quartz arenites. The groundwater naturally emanates from numerous springs throughout the cape region. One set of springs were examined to assess the source and residence time of the spring water. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes indicate that the spring water has not been subject to evaporation and in combination with Na/Cl ratios implies that recharge to the spring systems is via coastal precipitation. Although rainfall in the Cape is usually modelled on orographic rainfall, δ18O and δ2H values of some rainfall samples are strongly positive indicating a stratiform component as well. Comparing the spring water δ18O and δ2H values with that of local rainfall, indicates that the springs are likely derived from continuous bulk recharge over the immediate hinterland to the springs and not through large and/or heavy downpours. Noble gas concentrations, combined with tritium and radiocarbon activities indicate that the residence time of the TMG groundwater in this area is decadal in age with a probable maximum upper limit of ∼40 years. This residence time is probably a reflection of the slow flow rate through the fractured rock aquifer and hence indicates that the interconnectedness of the fractures is the most important factor controlling groundwater flow. The short residence time of the groundwater suggest that recharge to the springs and the Table Mountain Group Aquifer as a whole is vulnerable to climate change and reductions in regional precipitation. Any plans for large scale abstraction to supplement the City of Cape Town water supply would need to factor this into models of maximum sustainable yield. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Groundwater recharge; Noble gases; Residence times; Springs; Stable isotopes; Table Mountain Group Aquifer","Abstracting; Aquifers; Climate change; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Inert gases; Isotopes; Landforms; Potable water; Rain; Springs (components); Water supply; Fractured rock aquifers; Ground water recharge; Groundwater abstraction; Maximum sustainable yields; Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes; Residence time; Stable isotopes; Table mountain groups; Recharging (underground waters); aquifer; fractured medium; groundwater abstraction; groundwater resource; hydrogen isotope; hydrogeochemistry; noble gas; oxygen isotope; rainfall; recharge; residence time; spring water; stable isotope; sustainability; water supply; California; Cape Town; Paarl; South Africa; Table Mountain; Western Cape",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020240222

In this paper, this proposition is examined by conducting a field study in the rapidly developing city of Hyderabad, India. Urban agriculture trade-offs in water use, energy use and GHG emissions, nutrient uptake, and crop pathogen quality are evaluated, and irrigation waters of varying qualities (treated wastewater, versus untreated water and groundwater) are compared. The results are counter-intuitive, and illustrate potential synergies and key constraints relating to the food-energy-water-health (FEW-health) nexus in developing cities. First, when the impact of GHG emissions from untreated wastewater diluted in surface streams is compared with the life cycle assessment of wastewater treatment with reuse in agriculture, the treatment-plus-reuse case yields a 33% reduction in life cycle system-wide GHG emissions. Second, despite water cycling benefits in urban agriculture, only <1% of the nutrients are able to be captured in urban agriculture, limited by the small proportion of effluent divertible to urban agriculture due to land constraints. Thus, water treatment plus reuse in urban farms can enhance GHG mitigation and also directly save groundwater; however, very large amounts of land are needed to extract nutrients from dilute effluents. Third, although energy use for wastewater treatment results in pathogen indicator organism concentrations in irrigation water to be reduced by 99.9% (three orders of magnitude) compared to the untreated case, crop pathogen content was reduced by much less, largely due to environmental contamination and farmer behavior and harvesting practices. The study uncovers key physical, environmental, and behavioral factors that constrain benefits achievable at the FEW-health nexus in urban areas. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","FEW Nexus; greenhouse gas; infrastructure; life cycle; urban agriculture; wastewater reuse; wastewater treatment","Agriculture; Crops; Effluents; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Health; Irrigation; Life cycle; Nutrients; Reclamation; Wastewater reclamation; Water; Water conservation; Water supply; Water treatment; Environmental contamination; FEW Nexus; infrastructure; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Pathogen indicator organisms; Urban agricultures; Wastewater reuse; Wastewater treatment and reuse; Wastewater treatment; bioindicator; crop yield; energy planning; energy use; farm; food security; greenhouse gas; infrastructure; irrigation; life cycle analysis; nutrient dynamics; pathogen; public health; recycling; urban agriculture; wastewater treatment; water management; water quality; water use; Hyderabad [Telangana]; India; Telangana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025692542

The emergence of global, satellite-based forest monitoring systems, including Global Forest Watch (GFW) and FORMA, have great potential in aiding this endeavour. However, the accuracy of these systems has been questioned and their uncertainties are poorly constrained, both in terms of the spatial extent of forest loss and timing of change. Here, using annual time series of 5 m optical imagery at two sites in the Brazilian Amazon, we demonstrate that GFW more accurately detects forest loss than the coarser-resolution FORMA or Brazil's national-level PRODES product, though all underestimate the rate of loss.

However, because regulatory monitoring networks were not designed for epidemiological studies, the collected data may not provide sufficient spatial contrasts for assessing such associations. Our goal was to develop a monitoring design supplementary to the regulatory monitoring network in Seoul, Korea. This design focused on the selection of 20 new monitoring sites to represent the variability in PM2.5 across people’s residences for cohort studies. Methods: We obtained hourly measurements of PM2.5 at 37 regulatory monitoring sites in 2010 in Seoul, and computed the annual average at each site. We also computed 313 geographic variables representing various pollution sources at the regulatory monitoring sites, 31,097 children’s homes from the Atopy Free School survey, and 412 community service centers in Seoul. These three types of locations represented current, subject, and candidate locations. Using the regulatory monitoring data, we performed forward variable selection and chose five variables most related to PM2.5. Then, k-means clustering was applied to categorize all locations into several groups representing a diversity in the spatial variability of the five selected variables. Finally, we computed the proportion of current to subject location in each cluster, and randomly selected new monitoring sites from candidate sites in the cluster with the minimum proportion until 20 sites were selected. Results: The five selected geographic variables were related to traffic or urbanicity with a cross-validated R2 value of 0.69. Clustering analysis categorized all locations into nine clusters. Finally, one to eight new monitoring sites were selected from five clusters. Discussion: The proposed monitoring design will help future studies determine the locations of new monitoring sites representing spatial variability across residences for epidemiological analyses. © 2017 by the authors.

The newly discovered oilfields are mainly composed of ultra-low permeability reservoirs and tight reservoirs, which are difficult to be recovered. As a consequence, China faces the severe challenge of increasing or even maintaining oil production. There is an urgent need for a new method to enhance the oil recovery of old oilfields and producing rate of new reservoirs. Meanwhile, China's environmental problems have become increasingly serious. From 2008, China has exceeded the United States and become the country that emits the most greenhouse gases in the world. Therefore, the Chinese government encountered the huge pressures of society and politics. However, the practice has showed that carbon dioxide flooding cannot only improve oil recovery, but also achieve the goal of reducing the emission of carbon dioxide. This technique is the best way to decrease the emission of carbon dioxide under the current conditions of economy and technology. As a result, many giant companies, organizations, or governments have paid much attention to this technique. In China, as early as the mid-1960s, some laboratory experiments regarding carbon dioxide flooding were carried out in Shengli Oilfield and Daqing Oilfield. Furthermore, in the mid-1990s, some pilot tests were conducted in Daqing Oilfield, Jiangsu Oilfield, Zhongyuan Oilfield, and Shengli Oilfield. But because of shortage of natural resources of carbon dioxide and serious contradiction of gas channeling, this technique developed slowly. During the period of ""the eleventh five-year plan"", PetroChina discovered a natural gas reservoir that contains a large amount of carbon dioxide in Songliao Basin. Carbon dioxide gas was required to be separated and re-injected to the layers during the development of natural gas. For this reason, the government specially set up some projects including national level, corporation level, and oilfield level. Aiming at the characteristics of continental reservoir in China, these projects reemphasized the technique of carbon dioxide flooding. After nearly ten years of research, we have deepened two basic theories, which are suitable for Chinese continental sedimentary reservoir of CO2 miscible flooding theory and the storage mechanism of CO2 storage in the reservoir and saline layer. We also formed and developed six key technologies: The reservoir engineering technology of CO2 flooding and storage, CO2 flooding technology with high efficiency of injection and production, CO2 long distance pipeline and supercritical injection technology, treatment and cyclic gas injection technology of the produced fluid by CO2 flooding, monitoring and dynamic analysis and evaluation technology of CO2, and CO2 flooding and storage potential evaluation and strategic planning. Relevant research results supported the Black 59, Black 79, Black 46, and Yi 59 Blocks in Jilin Oilfield to build five kinds of demonstration area of CO2 storage and flooding, covering the geological reserves of 12 million 880 thousand tons, 69 gas injection wells groups. The cumulative gas injection was 970 thousand tons, which has increased 102 thousand tons oil. The annual oil production capacity reached 121 thousand tons. So it showed significant economic benefits. The annual CO2 storage capacity was 350 thousand tons, indicating a crucial social significance of greenhouse gas emissions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","China; CO2 EOR; CO2 storage","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Floods; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Injection (oil wells); Low permeability reservoirs; Mine flooding; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Oil fields; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Proven reserves; Reservoirs (water); Analysis and evaluation; Carbon dioxide flooding; China; CO2 EOR; CO2 storage; Long distance pipelines; Oil production capacity; Ultra-low permeability reservoirs; Oil well flooding",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050592604

Here, we assessed the effect of drought frequency on the ecophysiology and SNF rate of a common N2-fixing tree in eastern US forests. We grew Robinia pseudoacacia seedlings under the same mean soil moisture, but with different drought frequency caused by wet–dry cycles of varying periodicity. We found no effect of drought frequency on final biomass or mean SNF rate. However, seedlings responded differently to wet and dry phases depending on drought frequency. Under low-frequency droughts, plants fixed carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) at similar rates during wet and dry phases. Conversely, under high-frequency droughts, plants fixed C and N at low rates during dry phases and at high rates during wet phases. Our findings suggest that R. pseudoacacia growth is resistant to increased drought frequency because it employs two strategies – drought tolerance or drought avoidance, followed by compensation. SNF may play a role in both by supplying N to leaf tissues for acclimation and by facilitating compensatory growth following drought. Our findings point to SNF as a mechanism for plants and ecosystems to cope with drought. © 2017 The Authors.

Results of some water quality measurements are presented, showing that these lagoons have poor ecological status where they experience either a lack of flushing by the tide, or large amounts of anthropogenic inputs, or both. A vulnerability assessment is applied to the lagoons in question and this reveals a varying degree of threat from climate change to the operation and use of the lagoons. Our understanding of these systems suggests that a set of 1D hydrodynamic models, underpinned by an understanding of the local coastal sediment transport in each case, is appropriate, and could then be used to inform stakeholders and management in decision making. Integrated, broad-ranging management strategies must adapt to the realities of climate change in order to allow the sustainable use of these lagoons in providing economic benefits, ecosystem services, and elements of coastline protection for the benefit of the local and regional population and its economy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal lagoons; Flushing; Ghana; Vulnerability","Decision making; Ecology; Economics; Ecosystems; Lakes; Sediment transport; Sewage lagoons; Water quality; 1d hydrodynamic models; Coastal lagoons; Coastal sediment transport; Flushing; Ghana; Vulnerability; Vulnerability assessments; Water quality measurement; Climate change; anthropogenic effect; climate change; coast; coastal lagoon; coastal protection; coastal zone management; decision making; environmental assessment; flushing; hydrodynamics; integrated approach; management practice; one-dimensional modeling; stakeholder; vulnerability; water quality; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994476627

The results from this assessment will enhance the formation of robust policies that improve resilient livelihoods and the capacity to adapt to climate change and variability. This paper seeks to (i) reveal the farmers' perception on variation, change of rainfall, and temperature in the Tanzanian semi-arid area; (ii) depict meteorological evidence for the perceived rainfall and temperature changes; (iii) assess the policy perception and responses for the changing climate; and (iv) discuss the correlation between farmers' perception and meteorological data. Household surveys, informative interviews and discussions were employed during data collection. The Mann-Kendall Test and SPSS (version 20) were used for climate data analyses, while qualitative data were thematically analyzed. The results showed that from 1980 to 2015 the mean annual rainfall decreased ( R2 = 0.21) while temperature increased (R2 = 0.30). Even though majority farmers agreed with these results, they had not yet taken serious measures to curb the situation. Besides, Agricultural Policy has lightly addressed and enforced the implementations of adaptation strategies to reduce climate impacts and vulnerability. Thereby, creation of awareness and intensification of climate adaptation strategies is needed at both farm and policy level. © 2017 by the authors.","Agricultural production; Climate change adaptation; Climate models; Farmers' perception; Government policies; Semi-arid agro-ecological zones; Tanzania; Vulnerability","adaptive management; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural policy; climate change; climate modeling; computer simulation; farmers attitude; governance approach; meteorology; perception; policy implementation; rainfall; semiarid region; temperature; vulnerability; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027273948

Spatially downscaled historic (1971–2000) and future (2041–2070) climate datasets (rainfall and temperature) were downloaded from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP). Climate variables predicted by three regional climate models (RCMs) namely the Regional Climate Model Version3–Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (RCM3-GFDL), Regional Climate Model Version3–Third Generation Coupled Global Climate Model (RCM3-CGCM3), and Canadian Regional Climate Model–Community Climate System Model (CRCM-CCSM) were evaluated in this study. Gaussian and Gamma distribution mapping techniques were employed to remove the bias in temperature and rainfall data, respectively. Both the minimum and maximum temperatures across the study region in the future showed an upward trend, with the temperatures increasing in the range of 1.9 to 2.9 °C and 2.0 to 3.2 °C, respectively. All three climate models predicted a decline in rainfall within a range of 30 to 127 mm in majority of counties across the study region. In addition, they predicted an increase in the intensity of extreme rainfall events in the future. The frost-free season as predicted by the three models showed an increase by 2.6–3.4 weeks across the region, and the number of frost days declined by 17.9 to 30 %. Overall, these projections indicate considerable changes to the climate in the Texas Plains region in the future, and these changes could potentially impact agriculture in this region. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.",,"agriculture; air temperature; climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; climate variation; rainfall; regional climate; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962296765

This study develops a new bias correction approach using a three-layer feedforward neural network to reduce the biases of climate variables (temperature and precipitation) over northern South America. Air and skin temperature, specific humidity, and net longwave and shortwave radiation are used as inputs to the network for bias correction of 6-hourly temperature. Inputs to the network for bias correction of monthly precipitation are precipitation at lag 0, 1, 2, and 3 months, and also the standard deviation of precipitation from 3 × 3 neighbors around the pixel of interest. The climate model data are provided by the Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3). Results show that the trained artificial neural network (ANN) can improve the estimation error and correlation of the variables for both calibration and validation periods even when there is a low temporal consistency between the time series of the model data and targets. The developed model is also able to modify the probabilistic structure of the variables although the quantile-based information is not directly considered in the network. The ANN model outperforms linear regression, which is used for comparison purposes. The new method can be used to produce bias-corrected climate variables that can be used as forcing to hydrological and ecological models. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Bias; Climate models; General circulation models; Model errors; Model evaluation/performance; Neural networks","artificial neural network; climate modeling; data set; error correction; general circulation model; precipitation (climatology); sampling bias; temperature profile; weather forecasting; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023207182

However, a recent ban on coal mining in the Indian state of Meghalaya has created a huge problem for AEL. It is now considering opening trade routes to China and Indonesia. For that, it will need to consider both the short- and long-term factors related to its decision. It will need to take into consideration the cultural, economic and social factors in all three countries and trade accordingly. Tariff barriers and transportation costs will be a problem for AEL in the short run but in the long run, that may be overcome because of the experience effect arising from international business. Information and communication technology is also expected to have a huge impact.

In this light, this paper presents a framework for applying Bayesian updating to simulate decision-making, reaction patterns and updating of beliefs among farmers in a developing country, when faced with the complexity of adapting agricultural systems to climate change. We apply the approach to a case study from Ghana, where farmers seek to decide on the most profitable of three agricultural systems (dryland crops, irrigated crops and livestock) by a continuous updating of beliefs relative to realised trajectories of climate (change), represented by projections of temperature and precipitation. The climate data is based on combinations of output from three global/regional climate model combinations and two future scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) representing moderate and unsubstantial greenhouse gas reduction policies, respectively. The results indicate that the climate scenario (input) holds a significant influence on the development of beliefs, net revenues and thereby optimal farming practices. Further, despite uncertainties in the underlying net revenue functions, the study shows that when the beliefs of the farmer (decision-maker) opposes the development of the realised climate, the Bayesian methodology allows for simulating an adjustment of such beliefs, when improved information becomes available. The framework can, therefore, help facilitating the optimal choice between agricultural systems considering the influence of climate change. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Bayesian updating; Climate change; Monte Carlo simulation; Uncertainty","Agriculture; Climate models; Crops; Decision making; Developing countries; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Adaptation; Agricultural practices; Agricultural strategies; Bayesian methodology; Bayesian updating; Greenhouse gas reductions; Optimal decision making; Uncertainty; Climate change; adaptive management; agricultural practice; Bayesian analysis; climate change; climate modeling; complexity; decision making; developing world; environmental policy; farming system; greenhouse gas; Monte Carlo analysis; precipitation (climatology); simulation; uncertainty analysis; agricultural worker; climate change; crop; decision making; developing country; Ghana; greenhouse gas; human; livestock; Monte Carlo method; precipitation; uncertainty; agricultural land; agriculture; Bayes theorem; forecasting; growth, development and aging; Monte Carlo method; organization and management; procedures; temperature; theoretical model; uncertainty; Ghana; Agriculture; Bayes Theorem; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Decision Making; Farms; Forecasting; Ghana; Models, Theoretical; Monte Carlo Method; Temperature; Uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017018927

However, while accounts of urban climate change governance are growing, there is now a real need for further conceptual and empirical work to better understand processes of change and uptake across a range of climate change actions. Local Action on Climate Change examines how local climate change responses are emerging, being operationalized and evaluated within a range of geographical and socio-political contexts across the globe. Focussing on the role and potential of local governments, non-government organisations and community groups in driving transformative change, the authors analyse how local climate change responses have emerged and explore the extent to which they are or have the potential to be innovative or transformative in terms of governance, policy and practice change.

The reduction requires that sectors of the economy adapt to the new environmental policies in order to remain competitive on the global landscape, specially the energy producing and energy intensive sectors. This work is part of the REEEM project, financed by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation program. The objective of the project is to gain comprehensive understanding of the system-wide implications of energy strategies which focus on the transitions to a competitive low-carbon EU energy society, as described by the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan. This paper uses the results obtained from a REEEM pilot analysis to investigate two different pathways for carbon emission reduction: an EU-wide reduction of 80% versus a national reduction of the same amount on each member state of the EU-28 until 2050. The work assesses the significance of energy and CO2 costs for EU energy intensive industries. Through the evaluation of several indicators, such as competitiveness, carbon leakage, GDP growth and others it is possible to quantify the economic impacts of European climate policies in a global context. The idea behind is that policies have direct influence over energy prices and affect directly the energy intensive industries, as energy and electricity in particular make up a large share in manufacturing costs. Furthermore, suboptimal burden sharing within the EU is supposed to raise the electricity price and, thus, reduce the European competitiveness. A recursive-dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model with detailed specification of the energy sector is utilized for this analysis as it is capable of simulating and quantifying the macroeconomic effects of energy and environmental policy interventions in terms of economic costs, as well as the interaction of the different actors of the economy on a closed circular flow of income. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Commerce; Competition; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Environmental protection; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Power markets; Carbon emission reductions; Computable general equilibrium model; Energy intensive industries; Energy technologies; Energy-intensive sectors; Environmental policy; Innovation programs; Socio-economic impacts; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027184802

However, despite the high incidence of solar radiation on the Assalouyeh about 20 MJ/m2/day, technical points, and the economic benefits were not assessed in the region. The present study estimates the economic impacts resulting from the deployment of solar hot water systems in residential camp. Therefore, the feasibility study investigates the solar water heating as an alternative potential to reduce the electricity demand's peak.

However, their effectiveness is rarely evaluated. In Europe, after the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, a restrictive sanitary regulation (EC 1774/2002) prohibited the abandonment of dead livestock in extensive farming (extensive livestock) in the field, which led to negative consequences for scavengers. As an attempt to mitigate this negative impact, a new regulation was approved (EC 142/2011) to allow farmers to leave extensive livestock carcasses in the so-called ‘Protection areas for the feeding of necrophagous species of European interest’ (PAFs). Our general aims were to quantify (i) the proportion of breeding distribution of targeted scavenger species overlapping PAFs; (ii) the extensive livestock carrion biomass available inside PAFs; (iii) the proportion of breeding distribution of non-targeted scavenger species falling within PAFs; (iv) the overlap between the home range of vultures and PAFs, as well as the extent to which vultures move through different administrative units; and (v) the savings in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in relation to the pre-PAF scenario. After assessing the status of PAF implementation in every region of peninsular Spain, we analysed the large-scale spatial information of extensive livestock carrion availability and scavenger breeding distribution, movement data of GPS-tracked vultures, and the annual GHG emissions associated with the transport of livestock carcasses. Most regions established PAFs in their territories, although design criteria were variable. The breeding distribution of targeted species was better represented within PAFs than that of non-targeted species. The extensive livestock carrion biomass potentially available for scavengers within PAFs represented 34·9% of the annual extensive livestock biomass generated in peninsular Spain. The overlap between the home range of GPS-marked vulture populations and PAFs ranged between 63·4% and 100%. The minimum convex polygon of these and other GPS-tracked vulture populations in peninsular Spain encompassed 3–14 Spanish regions and 1–4 countries. Post-PAF there was a potential reduction of c. 55·7% of GHG emissions compared to pre-PAF. Synthesis and applications. The implementation of the new sanitary regulation by means of areas for the feeding of scavengers could mean an important improvement in scavenger conservation and a noteworthy reduction in greenhouse gas emissions: in Spain, extensive livestock carrion availability might increase to 33 474 t yr−1, and 43 344 t of CO2 eq. might be saved annually. However, we identified some gaps related to the distribution of endangered facultative scavengers. Moreover, given that vultures are highly mobile organisms, the design and management of these feeding areas should be coordinated at both the supra-regional and supra-national scales. © 2016 The Authors.

The AER acted as a passive form of air pollution control and reduced the particulate loading rate on filters in HVAC systems, thus reducing fan energy consumption. This paper discusses the design considerations that were accounted for in developing a full-scale AER device during a long-term performance assessment. A field assessment of a new full-scale AER device was performed at an urban commercial building in Dublin, Ireland. The results from two air handling units (AHUs), one Control-AHU and one AER-AHU (with an attached AER device), allowed for a comparison of energy consumption and filter lifespans. Particulate matter (PM) and energy consumption in both AHUs were monitored over time for each AER design. The full-scale AER device reduced PM concentration entering the HVAC system by 34% over the operational life cycle of a filter, reducing energy consumption by up to 14%. Alternatively the AER could be used to extend the lifespan of a filter by 75%. The size distribution of PM deposited on the AER and Control filters established that the device was more effective for coarser particles. Energy and filter savings can be achieved using this passive technique, which can translate to environmental, resource and economic savings in the building HVAC sector. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aspiration efficiency; Energy consumption; Filter life; Heating; Particulate matter; Pressure drop; Ventilation and air conditioning","Air conditioning; Air filters; Air pollution; Air pollution control; Bandpass filters; Climate control; Energy utilization; Heating; Office buildings; Passive filters; Pollution; Pollution control; Pressure drop; Aspiration efficiency; Design considerations; Filter life; Long term performance; Particulate air pollution; Particulate Matter; Reducing energy consumption; Ventilation and air conditioning; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021456369

The modelled maximum dispersal distances were mostly affected by dispersal syndrome of each species. The models reveal that 75% of species disperse up to 10 m, whilst 20% may disperse >100 m. Most species in this flora do not have any specific dispersal strategy, hence their inability to disperse >10 m. However, those species with longer modelled distances were dispersed by animals or wind (>600 and >140 m, respectively).

This study evaluated the success of the Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project in Durban, South Africa, by assessing ecological attributes. Measures of plant richness, diversity, vegetation structure, invasive alien plants (IAPs) and ecological processes were contrasted across a chronosequence of habitats under restoration (0-year-old, 3-year-old and 5-year-old) and compared with a reference forest habitat (remnant natural forest). Native tree species recruitment and vegetation structure increased with restoration age. Ecological processes, represented by the composition of pollination and seed dispersal traits in all of the habitats under restoration, were similar to the reference habitat. However, low tree density and an increase in IAP cover with an increase in restoration age were identified as threats to reforestation success. We recommend enrichment planting and an effective IAP management strategy to promote more rapid habitat restoration while reducing site maintenance costs. Enrichment planting should not only focus on increasing tree species density and richness, but also on the inclusion of species with missing pollination and seed dispersal categories. © 2017 by the authors.

This will pose severe problems for Arctic and sub-Arctic infrastructure dependent on maintaining low temperatures for structural integrity. This is the case for the economically important Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road (TCWR)—the world’s busiest heavy haul ice road, spanning 400 km across mostly frozen lakes within the Northwest Territories of Canada. In this study, future climate scenarios are developed for the region using statistical downscaling methods. In addition, changes in lake ice thickness are projected based on historical relationships between measured ice thickness and air temperatures. These projections are used to infer the theoretical operational dates of the TCWR based on weight limits for trucks on the ice. Results across three climate models driven by four RCPs reveal a considerable warming trend over the coming decades. Projected changes in ice thickness reveal a trend towards thinner lake ice and a reduced time window when lake ice is at sufficient thickness to support trucks on the ice road, driven by increasing future temperatures. Given the uncertainties inherent in climate modelling and the resultant projections, caution should be exercised in interpreting the magnitude of these scenarios. More certain is the direction of change, with a clear trend towards winter warming that will reduce the operation time window of the TCWR. This illustrates the need for planners and policymakers to consider future changes in climate when planning annual haulage along the TCWR. © 2016, The Author(s).",,"climate change; climate modeling; cold region; downscaling; future prospect; ice thickness; infrastructural development; temperature effect; warming; weather forecasting; Canada; Northwest Territories",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969921485

The PM2.5samples were characterized by their composition, focusing on trace elements, inorganic ions and organic and elemental carbon. The results of PM2.5concentrations ranged from 72 to 735 mgm-3, with the highest concentrations found for sources using biomass fuel, particularly Type B boilers, and the lowest values for diesel boilers. Further speciation of fine particulate matter (PM) showed significant levels of vanadium and nickel for boilers that use heavy fuel oil (bunker); 4886 and 1942 μgm-3, respectively. Copper and manganese were the most relevant metals for biomass burning sources, due to plant absorption from the soil. As for ion concentration, sulfate presented the highest concentrations for biomass boilers and furnaces, whereas chloride only presented the highest concentrations for furnaces. To complete the balance, organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC) analyses were made, in which biomass burning sources presented values five times higher than oil fuels. A Spearman's correlation analysis was made for the data set, revealing significant relationships between heavy metals, sulfate, and fine PM with respect to heavy fuel oil. For the biomass sources, the correlations pointed to K, Na, Mn and, in some cases, oxygen. © 2017 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Anions; Costa Rica; Elemental carbon; Heavy metals; Organic carbon; PM2.5",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010440903

Here, we investigated the biomass and production of component organisms within these two food webs, and compared them to those of mesozooplankton on a coral reef in Okinawa, Japan throughout four seasons in 2011–2012. The relative production of grazing (phytoplankton) and microbial (nano and microzooplankton) food webs were on average 39% (7–77%) and 37% (19–57%), respectively, of the food requirements of particle-feeding mesozooplankton. Carbon flows within this planktonic food web suggested that primary production from the grazing food web could not satisfy the nutritional demands of mesozooplankton, and that the microbial food web contributed a significant amount of nutrition to their diets. These results also show that the heterotrophic components of the microbial food web (nano and microzooplankton) and mesozooplankton consume the equivalent of the entire phytoplankton production (particulate net production) each day, while the microzooplankton were almost entirely eaten by higher trophic levels (mesozooplankton) each day. However, even the combined production from both the grazing and microbial food webs did not fulfill mesozooplankton food requirements in some seasons, explaining 26–53%, suggesting that detritus was used to compensate for nutritional deficiencies during these periods. Understanding the flow of energy throughout coral reefs requires a detailed accounting of pelagic sources and sinks of carbon. Our results provide such an assessment and indicate that detailed investigation on the origin and production of detritus is necessary to better understand pelagic trophodynamics in coral ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon demand; Coral reefs; Detritus; Grazing and microbial food webs; Trophic structure; Zooplankton","Ecology; Ecosystems; Nutrition; Phytoplankton; Plankton; Reefs; Coral reef; Detritus; Microbial food web; Trophic structure; Zooplankton; Food microbiology; biological production; carbon sink; coral reef; detritus; energy flow; food web; grazing; marine ecosystem; microbial activity; phytoplankton; plankton; primary production; trophic cascade; trophic interaction; trophic structure; zooplankton; Japan; Okinawa Islands; Okinawa [Ryukyu Islands]; Ryukyu Islands; Anthozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021395098

According to the proponents, REDD+ is an effective, efficient, and equitable mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Some scholars question this assumption, and some call for further analysis to understand how REDD+ can contribute to economic, environmental, and social goals, and what are the synergies and trade-offs between them. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the debate about whether REDD+ projects can be brought to accommodate economic (efficiency), environmental (effectiveness), and social (equity) concerns at the same time by drawing on own field results from a REDD+ project in Cambodia. The paper follows three tracks. The first is to develop and explain the conceptual and analytical framework for our empirical investigations. The second is to explain the field results. The third track is to discuss what general lessons can be learnt. Our case illustrates some of the mechanisms that are likely to work against the willingness and ability of REDD+ projects to ensure local people's net-gains, and the risk that effectiveness and equity will suffer if REDD+ projects rely solely on the private market. Our case thus indicates a tension between the objectives of creating financial value from carbon stored in trees through the private market, and environmental and social equity concerns. However, we call for more comparative studies of REDD+ projects, and hope our conceptual framework can assist such studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cambodia; Community forestry; Effectiveness; Efficiency; Equity; REDD+","carbon emission; climate change; community forestry; deforestation; emission control; Cambodia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019105375

In order to fill this knowledge gap, the present paper reports on the record of environmental changes in the Albian–Turonian neritic carbonates from the western South American domain in Peru. Owing to the very expanded and well-exposed sections in the Oyon region of central Peru, the OAE 1d and 2 intervals were sampled at high temporal resolution for both bulk micrite and bulk organic matter carbon isotopes, allowing us to compare the fingerprint of these two events between the northern and central Peruvian regions. This suggests the installation of two marked depositional modes: 1) the Albian–Turonian formation of a regional facies belt constituted by oyster-rich mixed siliciclastic-carbonate deposition along the western South America platform; 2) a restricted oligotrophic environment, characterized by the mass occurrence of Perouvianella peruviana and associated miliolids in central Peru during the late Cenomanian–Turonian. These observations advocate for the following scenario: Global warming during the late Albian–early Turonian resulted in humid climate on the western platform. This in turn caused enhanced chemical weathering rates on the Brazilian Shield, resulting in high runoff of nutrients onto the western platform. Nutrient runoff promoted the diversification of benthic oyster communities. Due to the uplift of the Marañon Massif and the installation of the Huarmey Trough, central Peru was isolated from the Pacific and from eastern deltaic influx of the Brazilian continental basement, allowing the local development of oligotrophic conditions during OAE 2. Furthermore, an increased influx of argillaceous sediment and reduced carbonate production is recorded in northern Peru at the onset of OAE 2, marked by a prominent negative shift in δ13C. This negative carbon-isotope excursion has also been identified in other sections in the Pacific domain and can be linked to an increase in isotopically light pCO2 induced by the formation of the Caribbean large igneous province. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbonates; Chemostratigraphy; Mid-Cretaceous; OAE1d; OAE2; Pacific; Peru","carbonate; chemostratigraphy; Cretaceous; ecosystem response; environmental change; global warming; large igneous province; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; siliciclastic deposit; subtidal environment; temporal analysis; Araba; Basque Country [Spain]; Oyon; Peru; Spain; Miliolina; Ostreidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016478555

However, rates of and controls on biomass production vary widely across temperate forests, particularly over successional timescales of decades and centuries. Biomass production in temperate forests is most often interpreted within the context of biotic or top-down controls, such as species composition or disturbance. However, there is need to investigate how bottom-up physiographic factors, such as landform attributes, drainage, and soil properties mediate biomass production. In order to investigate patterns, controls, and potentials for biomass production across spatial levels ranging from individual ecosystems, to landscapes, to entire regions, we synthesized long-term forest inventory datasets from the United States Great Lakes region, placed them in the context of a hierarchical ecological unit classification, and tested the influence of physiographic factors on biomass production rates and temporal trajectories across ecological levels. Key findings include: 1) At nearly all ecological levels, physiographic controls (e.g., soil texture, drainage class, water table depth) on soil moisture status are significant predictors of variation in biomass production rates, with mesic sites accumulating biomass more rapidly than xeric sites, which, in turn accumulate biomass more rapidly than hydric sites. 2) Aboveground live biomass can apparently continue to accumulate through 2–3 centuries of succession, exceeding 300–400 Mg ha−1 on mesic sites throughout the region. 3) Stand age distributions indicate that hydric sites are harvested least often, while the high production rates of mesic sites suggest they are most appropriate for frequent harvesting. 4) Median, 1st-quartile, and 3rd-quartile growth rates of individual ecosystems, landscapes, and ecoregional subsections and sections reveal ecological units in which forests may vary in their potential for increases or decreases in biomass production, e.g., due to management interventions, climate change, or disturbances. Specifically, some units have tightly constrained distributions, suggesting little capacity for change in production rates relative to observed medians, while other units have wide variation in biomass production rates, indicating the potential for relatively large increases or decreases in production. Altogether, the results of this analysis show that physiography exerts widespread, bottom-up controls on biomass production across the region of study, and can be used in spatially explicit frameworks to understand ecosystem functioning and inform scientific forest management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem classification; Landform; Natural drainage; Soil moisture status; Soil texture","Biomass; Classification (of information); Climate change; Ecosystems; Forestry; Groundwater; Lakes; Landforms; Moisture; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Soils; Aboveground live biomass; Biomass production rate; Ecosystem classification; Ecosystem functioning; Management interventions; Soil moisture status; Soil textures; Temporal trajectories; Ecology; abiotic factor; biological production; biomass; bottom-up control; classification; community composition; drainage; ecosystem function; forest ecosystem; forest inventory; growth rate; landform; soil moisture; soil texture; succession; top-down control; Biomass; Ecosystems; Forests; Harvesting; Moisture; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018768995

Responsible for this effect is the accumulation of photo-generated charge carriers at the semiconductor surface, modifying surface states and surface recombination. The effect has a negative impact on the exactness and comparability of photoluminescence intensity measurements, especially for measurements with long exposure times or repeated excitation on the same spot. We realized temporally stable photoluminescence intensity by using an AlN cap layer separating the studied AlGaN bulk layer from the crystal surface. We verified the temporal stability in temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements in vacuum and in ambient air.

The major element glass composition of this rhyolitic tephra is identical to the distal ‘S1’ tephra layer identified in the Yammoûneh palaeolake (Lebanon), in a marine sediment record from the SE Levantine basin and in the Sodmein Cave archaeological site in Egypt. The S1 tephra corresponds to the early Holocene ‘Dikkartın’ dome eruption of the Erciyes Dağ volcano in central Anatolia (Turkey) and has been dated in the marine record at 8830 ± 140 cal yr BP. We present new age estimates of the S1 tephra based on radiocarbon dating of terrestrial plant remains and pollen concentrates revealing ages of 8939 ± 83 cal yr BP in the Dead Sea sediments and 9041 ± 254 cal yr BP in Tayma. The precise date from the Dead Sea allows refining the early Holocene marine reservoir age in the SE Levantine Sea to ca. 320 ± 50 years.

We examine how core assumptions concerning the roles of the nation state, carbon markets and finance and technology in international climate policy are being challenged by the realities of how transitions in the energy systems are unfolding. Drawing on the critical region of sub-Saharan Africa, we examine the potential for international climate policy to foster new trajectories towards decarbonization. Policy relevance The international regime for climate policy has been in place for some twenty years. Despite significant changes in the landscape of energy systems and drivers of global GHG emissions over this time, the core principles and tools remain relatively stable–national governments, carbon markets, project-based climate finance and the transfer of technological hardware. Given the diversity of actors and drivers and the limited direct reach and influence of international climate policy, however, there is an urgent need to consider how the climate regime can best support the embryonic transitions that are slowly taking form around the world. To do this effectively requires a more nuanced understanding of the role of the state in governing these transitions beyond the notion of a cohesive state serving as rule-enforcer and transition manager. It also requires a broader view of technology, not just as hardware that is transferred, but as a set of practices and networks of expertise and enabling actors. Likewise, though markets have an important role to play as vehicles for achieving broader ends, they are not an end in themselves. Finally on finance, while acknowledging the important role of climate aid, often as a multiplier or facilitator of more ambitious private flows, it is critical to differentiate between the types of finance required for different transitions, many of which will not be counted under, or directed by, the climate regime. In sum, the (low-) carbon economy is being built in ways and in numerous sites that the climate regime needs to be cognizant of and engage with productively, and this may require fundamental reconsideration of the building blocks of the international climate regime. © 2016 The Author(s).

We show that for ∼1–3 days following compression region onset, the planet's main emission brightened. A duskside poleward region also brightened during compressions, as well as during shallow rarefaction conditions at the start of the program. The power emitted from the noon active region did not exhibit dependence on any interplanetary parameter, though the morphology typically differed between rarefactions and compressions. The auroras equatorward of the main emission brightened over ∼10 days following an interval of increased volcanic activity on Io. These results show that the dependence of Jupiter's magnetosphere and auroras on the interplanetary conditions are more diverse than previously thought. ©2017.

The observed growth rates are, however, not uniform in space and time, and the mechanistic drivers of these patterns remain poorly understood. Here we investigated spatio-temporal interactions between climatic conditions, xylem anatomical traits, and annual growth of 21 Betula nana L. individuals from western Greenland for the period 2001-2011. Structural equation modeling showed that summer precipitation and winter temperature are affecting annual growth positively. Furthermore, vessel lumen area and vessel grouping, which are related to water conductivity and hydraulic connectivity of the xylem, respectively, positively influenced annual growth. To optimize growth B. nana was thus able to adjust its water transporting system. Annual variation in vessel lumen area seemed to be driven mostly by spring and summer temperatures, whereas annual variation in vessel grouping was driven by winter temperature. Linear models did not reveal a pattern in the spatial variation of xylem anatomical traits across the sampled climatic gradient. However, growth was positively correlated with local variation in insolation. Our results suggest that B. nana can adjust its hydraulic capacity to annual fluctuations in climatic conditions in order to optimize its total radial stem growth rate. © 2017 Regents of the UniveRsity of Colorado.",,"Betula nana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028361495

The study also analyzes optimal combinations of renovation measures and HVAC system set points to maximize thermal comfort conditions and productivity of the building users. The productivity loss caused by unfavorable indoor thermal comfort conditions was integrated in the LCC analysis (15-year life-cycle period) of the study using an appropriate method to estimate the amount of lost performance of workers caused by the productivity loss. Simulation-based multi-objective optimization analysis was used as the research method of the study. Environmental impact of the renovation measures was studied by assessing the CO2 emissions of the delivered energy consumption.

Assembly line systems are widely utilized to assemble different types of products and in recent years, robots have become extensively utilized, replacing manual labor. This paper focuses on minimizing the carbon footprint for robotic assembly line systems, a topic that has received limited attention in academia. This paper is primarily focused on developing a mathematical model to simultaneously minimize the total carbon footprint and maximize the efficiency of robotic assembly line systems. Due to the NP-hard nature of the considered problem, a multi-objective co-operative co-evolutionary (MOCC) algorithm is developed to solve it. Several improvements are applied to enhance the performance of the MOCC for obtaining a strong local search capacity and faster search speed. The performance of the proposed MOCC algorithm is compared with three other high-performing multi-objective methods. Computational and statistical results from the set of benchmark problems show that the proposed model can reduce the carbon footprint effectively. The proposed MOCC outperforms the other three methods by a significant margin as shown by utilizing one graphical and two quantitative Pareto compliant indicators. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Co-evolutionary computation; Multi-objective optimization; Robotic assembly line balancing","Assembly; Assembly machines; Carbon footprint; Efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Robotics; Assembly line systems; Bench-mark problems; Co-evolutionary; Co-evolutionary algorithm; Limited attentions; Robotic assembly line balancing; Robotic assembly lines; Sustainable products; Robotic assembly",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019150642

In this paper, we describe experimental results showing the influence of CO2 trapping in amorphous water ice on the trapping efficiency of other gases, in particular, N2 and Ar. These gases were detected by ROSINA in situ measurements for the first time in comets. In the present experiments, gas mixtures with CO2 and water vapour were deposited on a cold surface at temperatures ranging between 30 and 60 K, in a thoroughly evacuated vacuum chamber. At these temperatures, the water ice is formed in amorphous state, and it is highly porous with gases trapped in the lattice. Upon heating, changes occur in the ice, and it passes from the amorphous to the crystalline structure. The gases trapped in the ice are released both during these structural changes and upon the sublimation of the ice. The trapping efficiency is determined by monitoring the fluxes of the released gases relative to water vapour during these stages. Here, we examine the behaviour of gas mixtures trapped in amorphous ice, in order to test whether CO2 inhibits or enhances the trapping efficiency of other volatiles. We find various behaviour patterns and present the results in the light of the in situ Rosetta measurements. © 2017 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.","instrumentation: spectrographs - comets: general - comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062915979

This has created an urgent need for highly efficient white-emitting LECs. Technologies have to be developed for realizing efficient white emission, suited to the simple structure of LEC devices. Utilizing exciplex emission is one means of obtaining white emission. In this chapter, the authors present an approach to obtaining white emission based on emission from exciplexes formed between a fluorescent conducting polymer (FCP) and aromatic amines. The exciplexes, which are complexes that can form between molecules in the excited state, emit light as electrons are transferred from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the FCP to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the amine. The exciplex emission includes longer wavelengths and is broader in spectrum than the excitonic emission of FCP, such that white light can be obtained by combining the two types of emissions. By using the right amine in the proper concentration, we were able to produce white emission with x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.33/0.31 and a color rendering index (CRI) of 80 with a device having only a single active layer. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Exciplex; Exciton; Fluorescent π-conjugated polymer; Ionic polyelectrolyte; White polymer-based light-emitting electrochemical cell","Amines; Conducting polymers; Conjugated polymers; Excited states; Excitons; Fluorescence; Molecular orbitals; Polyelectrolytes; Color rendering index; Exciplexes; Excitonic emission; Highest occupied molecular orbital; Ionic polyelectrolytes; Light-emitting electrochemical cell; Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital; Polymer light-emitting electrochemical cells; Electrochemical cells",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038003380

Phase 3 of the Air Quality Modeling Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII-3) is examining the contribution of intercontinental transport to regional air quality by applying regional-scale atmospheric models jointly with global models. We investigate methods for tracing O3 from global models within regional models. The CAMx photochemical grid model was used to track contributions from boundary condition (BC) O3 over a North American modeling domain for calendar year 2010 using a built-in tracer module called RTCMC. RTCMC can track BC contributions using chemically reactive tracers and also using inert tracers in which deposition is the only sink for O3. Lack of O3 destruction chemistry in the inert tracer approach leads to overestimation biases that can exceed 10 ppb. The flexibility of RTCMC also allows tracking O3 contributions made by groups of vertical BC layers. The largest BC contributions to seasonal average daily maximum 8 h averages (MDA8) of O3 over the US are found to be from the mid-troposphere (over 40 ppb) with small contributions (a few ppb) from the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere. Contributions from the lower troposphere are shown to not penetrate very far inland. Higher contributions in the western than the eastern US, reaching an average of 57 ppb in Denver for the 30 days with highest MDA8 O3 in 2010, present a significant challenge to air quality management approaches based solely on local or US-wide emission reductions. The substantial BC contribution to MDA8 O3 in the Intermountain West means regional models are particularly sensitive to any biases and errors in the BCs. A sensitivity simulation with reduced BC O3 in response to 20 % lower emissions in Asia found a near-linear relationship between the BC O3 changes and surface O3 changes in the western US in all seasons and across the US in fall and winter. However, the surface O3 decreases are small: below 1 ppb in spring and below 0.5 ppb in other seasons. © 2017 Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028411599

Wildlife species such as European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) cohabit urban neighborhoods and may serve as sentinels for these contaminants. In this novel approach, we use passive, personal-type air samplers to provide site-specific measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes, or BTEX), and account for the effects of confounding environmental factors when teasing out the responses to exposure.

This paper argues that rather than consensus, there is a conflict between urban climate policy and the need to reignite economic growth in the context of austerity urbanism, but also that we should not assume that challenges to neoliberal understandings of the ‘sensible’ will always be disregarded. Rather, urban climate policy can be progressed through partnership processes utilising ‘co-production’ techniques which entail significant agonistic, if not antagonistic, contestation. The argument is illustrated with a case study of climate policy making in the context of austerity urbanism in Liverpool, UK. While ‘low carbon’ is conceptualised by elite actors in Liverpool in neoliberal terms as a source of new low carbon jobs and businesses, with an emphasis on energy security and fuel poverty, this view is not unchallenged. The paper recounts how an ad hoc group of actors in the city came together to form a partnership advocating for more strategic decarbonisation, which should be progressed through a bid for the city to be European Green Capital. The disputes that emerged around this agenda suggest that in the context of austerity urbanism the need for cities to act to mitigate against dangerous climate change is not as uncontested as conceptions of the post-political suggest. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Climate change; low carbon transitions; partnership processes; the post-political condition; urban policy processes","carbon emission; climate change; emission control; environmental policy; neoliberalism; partnership approach; policy making; urban policy; England; Liverpool [England]; Liverpool [Liverpool (DST)]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025112009

This suggests that there is a wealth of highly transferable knowledge about the microbial ecology of human and non-human ecosystems that is currently being generated in parallel, but mostly in isolation from one another. I suggest that effectively sharing this knowledge could greatly help at more efficiently understanding and restoring human health and the functioning of ecosystems, which are currently under wide-spread pressure. I illustrate this by comparing the effects of nitrogen deposition on ecosystem carbon sequestration with unhealthy dietary habits and human disease. The deposition of N, a key nutrient for plant growth, may increase carbon sequestration (equivalent to obesity) through several mechanisms, including a reduction in the ability of soil microbes to process organic matter, which some argue could help mitigate climate change. However, this usually results in a degradation of ecosystem health and, thus, cannot represent a real solution. Similarly, human obesity is linked to an alteration of the composition and functioning of microbial communities inhabiting the gut, which is often attributed to unhealthy dietary habits, including ingesting high amounts of simple sugars and processed foods. Finally, I advocate for the explicit recognition of the many commonalities between the functioning of the gut and ecosystems and a broader multidisciplinary collaboration among experts in ecology and human health, including the engineering of soil microbial communities designed ad-hoc to restore ecosystem health. © 2017 Ochoa-Hueso.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Ecosystem health; Human health; Microbiome; Nitrogen deposition; Probiotics; Synbiotics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031719807

However, increasing feedstock scarcity (e.g. due to deforestation) coupled with the negative socio-economic and environmental outcomes of inefficient production and consumption technologies make it imperative to identify alternative energy solutions that benefit people without harming the environment. Indeed, tackling energy poverty is crucial to efforts aimed at meeting sustainable development goals at the household level. However, interventions aimed at reducing energy poverty must simultaneously seek solutions that might reduce people's carbon footprint. Carbon footprints, or the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions linked to particular activities, are associated with climate change and its impacts. Globally, calls have intensified to reduce the carbon footprint of energy use, including use of biomass fuels. Locally, climate change issues are increasingly seen as posing particular threats to already vulnerable communities. The present paper evaluates the carbon footprints of alternative biomass energy solutions for cooking, as one key aspect of their environmental performance. It compares the carbon footprints of firewood, charcoal, biogas, jatropha oil, and crop residue briquettes. The research focuses on selected technologies for biomass energy production and consumption in two case study sites in rural and urban contexts of Kenya and Tanzania. Carbon footprinting is applied as a methodological approach to evaluating technological options for sustainable development in developing economies undergoing rapid population growth, urbanization, and industrial development. Results indicate that the unimproved charcoal value chain has a big carbon footprint. The value chain for jatropha oil appears to hold the greatest potential for carbon footprint reductions, as long as the feedstock is grown in the form of hedges around plots. However, the limited yield potential of hedges calls into question the economic viability of this solution.

Such technology relies on the efficient selection of an MMC enriched in PHA-accumulating organisms. Fermented cheese whey, a protein-rich complex feedstock, has been used previously to produce PHA using the feast and famine regime for selection of PHA accumulating cultures. While this selection strategy was found efficient when operated at relatively low organic loading rate (OLR, 2 g-COD L−1 d−1), great instability and low selection efficiency of PHA accumulating organisms were observed when higher OLR (ca. 6 g-COD L−1 d−1) was applied. High organic loading is desirable as a means to enhance PHA productivity. In the present study, a new selection strategy was tested with the aim of improving selection for high OLR. It was based on uncoupling carbon and nitrogen supply and was implemented and compared with the conventional feast and famine strategy. For this, two selection reactors were fed with fermented cheese whey applying an OLR of ca. 8.5 g-COD L−1 (with 3.8 g-COD L−1 resulting from organic acids and ethanol), and operated in parallel under similar conditions, except for the timing of nitrogen supplementation. Whereas in the conventional strategy nitrogen and carbon substrates were added simultaneously at the beginning of the cycle, in the uncoupled substrates strategy, nitrogen addition was delayed to the end of the feast phase (i.e. after exogenous carbon was exhausted). The two different strategies selected different PHA-storing microbial communities, dominated by Corynebacterium and a Xantomonadaceae, respectively with the conventional and the new approaches. The new strategy originated a more efficient PHA-production process than the conventional one (global PHA productivity of 6.09 g-PHA L−1 d−1 and storage yield of 0.96 versus 2.55 g-PHA L−1 d−1 and 0.86, respectively). Dissociation between the feast to famine length ratio (F/F) and storage efficiency was shown to be possible with the new strategy, allowing selection of an efficient PHA-storing culture with complex feedstock under high organic loading rates. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cheese whey; Culture selection; Mixed microbial cultures (MMC); Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA)","Agricultural wastes; Efficiency; Feedstocks; Food supply; Productivity; Alternative technologies; Carbon and nitrogen; Cheese whey; High organic loading; Microbial communities; Mixed microbial culture; Organic loading rates; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Nitrogen; alcohol; carbon; carboxylic acid; nitrogen; phytohemagglutinin; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; carbon; nitrogen; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; Alcaligenaceae; Amaricoccus; Article; bacterium culture; Bacteroidetes; bioreactor; biotechnological production; Bosea; Brevundimonas; carbon source; cheese; Comamonadaceae; comparative study; controlled study; Corynebacterium; Devosia; Enterococcus; fermentation; fermented product; Firmicutes; Kurthia; Lactococcus; Lampropedia; Leucobacter; Leuconostoc; microbial community; nitrogen availability; nonhuman; open mixed microbial culture; Paracoccus; Phyllobacteriaceae; priority journal; Proteobacteria; Pseudoxanthomonas; Rhodobacter; Rhodobacteraceae; Taibaiella; Thermomonas; whey; Xanthomonadaceae; biomass; biosynthesis; biotechnology; metabolism; microbial consortium; microbiology; whey; Biomass; Bioreactors; Biotechnology; Carbon; Fermentation; Microbial Consortia; Nitrogen; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Whey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006070071

The lack of suitable sites and the high cost of waste treatment have persuaded many municipalities to implement a policy for integrated waste management, which includes measures such as, source reduction, reuse, recycling, composting and final disposal in landfill. This study examined the alternatives for composting of the organic waste generated in the city of Bauru, in the state of São Paulo, which does not have a composting plant, and analyzed the environmental impacts of seven scenarios: current situation, in which all organic waste is disposed at the landfill; dispatch of the organic waste generated in the city to the closest municipality having a composting plant; construction of a composting plant in Bauru; use of home composting for 10%, 25%, 60% and 90% of organic waste. The method consisted of literature review, data collection among the company responsible for the waste management in the municipality, and the Life Cycle Assessment of the scenarios through the software IWM-2 for the Life Cycle Inventory and Recipe2008 conversion factors for the following impact categories: climate change, ozone depletion, particulate matter formation, and human and freshwater toxicity. The results showed that home composting must be followed by a reduction in the organic waste collection days, in order to have a positive effect in the greenhouse emissions derived from transportation and collection. Also home composting has a greater potential to reduce carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per mass of waste composted in comparison with composting plants. The use of transfer station can have a positive effect on composting plants that are located in other municipalities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Composting; Home composting; LCA; LCI; Organic waste","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Composting; Environmental impact; Greenhouse effect; Land fill; Life cycle; Ozone layer; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Waste management; Wastes; Environmental analysis; Greenhouse emissions; Integrated waste management; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life Cycle Inventory; Literature reviews; Organic wastes; Particulate matter formations; Waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994824057

Among temperate and Mediterranean European countries that have seen an expansion of forest cover, Portugal stands out as the only case in which this trend has recently been reverted. In this study, we explicitly map and document the forest transition (FT) in the country over the period 1907–2006, and investigate when and where forest transition happened de facto, and which were the land use transition pathways that resulted from the shrublands, agriculture, and forest interplay dynamics. After thematic and geometric harmonization of land cover maps from 1907, 1955, 1970, 1990, and 2006, a cluster analysis established four typologies, and a transition matrix was constructed to assess land cover dynamics. We found that up to 1955, FT occurred simultaneously with agricultural expansion, as shrubland areas diminished. Afterwards, with the retraction of agricultural area and the consequential decoupling of forest management from local actors, FT gained momentum and expanded up to the 1990s. While during the first half of the 20th century, forest expansion followed the “Scarcity” and “State Policy” pathways fostered by local socio-ecological feedback loops, throughout the second half of the century forest transition was driven by exogenous socio-economic forces, following “Economic Development” and “Globalization” pathways. We show how, despite these forces, FT can be derailed by endogenous factors such as wildfires, which limited and in some areas even reverted the afforestation process, initiating a deforestation phase. Since the necessary conditions for FT (technology shift, urbanization, agriculture retraction and public afforestation programs) were available in mainland Portugal, we advance the hypothesis that critical wildfire risk governance deficits may have been responsible for arresting FT. Considering the critical role of forests and other wooded areas in supporting climate change mitigation and sustainable development, our work provides useful evidence and insights for public decision makers on previously unaddressed dimensions of FTT. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cluster analysis; Forest transition; Land cover change; Risk governance; Wildfire policy","cluster analysis; decision making; forest management; governance approach; land cover; land use change; risk assessment; wildfire; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019086560

It is based on the quantum aspects of the Joule-Lenz law for the dissipation of energy. For small energy intervals between quantum levels these intervals are coupled with the time intervals of the corresponding electron transitions in an extremely simple way. Consequently, the expressions for the emission intensity attain a very simple form. A somewhat more complicated formulae should be applied when the emission process between non-neighbouring electron levels is considered. The theory is thoroughly compared with the existent quantum-mechanical approach to the emission intensity in the case of the hydrogen atom. Here, because of an unknown electron population of the beginning quantum levels, solely the ratios of the emission intensities obtained for different pairs of electron transitions are studied. In average the ratios of the quantummechanical transition probabilities approach those obtained from the semiclassical non-probabilistic theory developed in the paper. A limitation of the semiclassical formalism is the degeneracy of the intensity ratios between the states having different angular momenta but belonging to the same energy differences obtained with the aid of the principal quantum numbers n and n′. However it looks that such degeneracy can take place also in the quantum-mechanical case on condition large n and n′ are taken to calculations.

Moench) is a C4 species sensitive to the cold spring conditions that occur at northern latitudes, especially when coupled with excessive light, and that greatly affect the photosynthetic rate. The objective of this study was to discover genes/genomic regions that control the capacity to cope with excessive energy under low temperature conditions during the vegetative growth period. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted for seven photosynthetic gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence traits under three consecutive temperature treatments: control (28°C/24°C), cold (15°C/15°C), and recovery (28°C/24°C). Cold stress significantly reduced the rate of photosynthetic CO2 uptake of sorghum plants, and a total of 143 unique genomic regions were discovered associated with at least one trait in a particular treatment or with derived variables. Ten regions on chromosomes 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 that harbor multiple significant markers in linkage disequilibrium (LD) were consistently identified in gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence traits. Several candidate genes within those intervals have predicted functions related to carotenoids, phytohormones, thioredoxin, components of PSI, and antioxidants. These regions represent the most promising results for future validation and with potential application for the improvement of crop productivity under cold stress. © The Author 2017.","Chlorophyll fluorescence; Cold; Genome-wide association study; Photoprotection; Photosynthesis; Sorghum","chlorophyll; chemistry; cold; cold shock response; genetic variation; genetics; genome-wide association study; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; single nucleotide polymorphism; sorghum; Chlorophyll; Cold Temperature; Cold-Shock Response; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Photosynthesis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sorghum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041262826

Most prior research has usually considered the energy consumption of buildings and transport separately, but urban energy use is better understood when both uses of energy are considered together. This paper introduces a new energy use metric that combines the energy consumption of both buildings and transport. Estimates are calculated from readily available data and the simplicity of the methodology enables its replicability. This is attractive for policy-makers and planners by delivering them tools of more direct control of local-level policies. Using a LSOA geographic level and mapping the results produces helpful insights into energy consumption patterns and how the two uses of energy can be combined to support mitigation measures. When applying the methodology to a case study in the United Kingdom, maps produced show, amongst other things, how rural commuter belts are disproportionately energy-hungry when assessed per capita. Urban living is revealed as most energy efficient at this level. The integrated modelling approach demonstrated here improves the understanding of consumption patterns to enable better planning of strategies to reduce energy demand and its negative impact. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Buildings; Energy consumption; GIS; Transport; Urban spaces","Buildings; Carbon; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Geographic information systems; Consumption patterns; Energy efficient; Integrated modelling approach; Mitigation measures; Transport; United kingdom; Urban spaces; Urban transport; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019967917

Major land use alteration at steep, highly erodible semi-arid islands accelerates the potential of soil erosion, runoff, and sedimentation stress to nearshore coral reefs during extreme rainfall events. The goal of this study was to assess spatio-temporal variation of sedimentation dynamics across nearshore coral reefs as a function of land use patterns, weather and oceanographic dynamics, to identify marine ecosystem conservation strategies. Sediment was collected at a distance gradient from shore at Bahia Tamarindo (BTA) and Punta Soldado (PSO) coral reefs at Culebra Island, Puerto Rico. Sediment texture and composition were analyzed by dry sieving and loss-on-ignition techniques, and were contrasted with environmental variables for the research period (February 2014 to April 2015). Rainfall and oceanographic data were analyzed to address their potential role on affecting sediment distribution with BEST BIO-ENV, RELATE correlation, and linear regression analysis. A significant difference in sedimentation rate was observed by time and distance from shore (PERMANOVA, p < 0.0100), mostly attributed to higher sediment exposure at reef zones closer to shore due to strong relationships with coastal runoff. Sedimentation rate positively correlated with strong rainfall events (Rho = 0.301, p = 0.0400) associated with storms and rainfall intensity exceeding 15 mm/h. At BTA, sediment deposited were mostly composed of sand, suggesting a potential influence of resuspension produced by waves and swells. In contrast, PSO sediments were mostly composed of silt-clay and terrigenous material, mainly attributed to a deforestation event that occurred at adjacent steep sub-watershed during the study period. Spatial and temporal variation of sedimentation pulses and terrigenous sediment input implies that coral reefs exposure to sediment stress is determined by local land use patterns, weather, and oceanographic dynamics. Comprehensive understanding of sediment dynamics and coastal ecosystem interconnectivity is fundamental to implement integrated and adaptive management strategies aimed to promote sustainable development at watershed andisland wide-scale to fully mitigate terrigenous sediment impact to marine ecosystems. Furthermore, decision-making processes and policy needs to address sedimentation stress in the context of future climate to reduce land-based threats and strengthen coral reef resilience. © 2017 Otaño-Cruz, Montañez-Acuña, Torres-López, Hernández-Figueroa and Hernández-Delgado.","Land use, near-shore coral reefs; Precipitation; Sediment composition; Sediment grain size; Sedimentation rate; Tropical semi-arid watershed",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027726668

Excess water pressure is one of the main factors that increases leakage in WDNs. Pressure management is an efficient and economically feasible method to reduce physical water losses in WDNs, and is generally achieved by installing pressure reducing valves (PRVs). Recently, pump as turbine (PAT) has become a viable option to replace PRVs. In this study, water losses reduction, power production potential, CO2 emissions reduction and payback period were investigated for Konyaalti WDN, which is composed of 18 district metered areas (DMAs), with implementation of PAT. Population, water demands and flow rates were forecasted for the years 2020, 2025 and 2035. A hydraulic modelling study was conducted to determine the optimum pressure levels to be maintained at the entrance of each DMA. Temporal and spatial variations of water pressure and excess water pressure levels were obtained for minimum and maximum water consumption periods. The investigation revealed that DMA-6 was the best site for implementation of PAT with a payback period of 0.85 year. Long-term analysis of hydraulic parameters (water demand, flow rate, excess water pressure) and evaluation of environmental benefits and payback period are necessary for optimal site selection of PAT. © 2017 Desalination Publications.

However, absorption and radiative emission is drastically reduced which hinders their applicability for practical devices. One way to address this challenge is to design plasmonic resonators that localize electric fields within or near the two-dimensional (2D) material to confine excitation fields and increase Purcell factors. Previous studies have successfully utilized this method for enhancing radiative emission in 2D-TMDCs by using large area plasmonic arrays that exhibit complex plasmonic interactions due to near and far-field couplings that take place over many periods. In this study, we demonstrate the photoluminescence enhancements in monolayer MoS2 under single Au nanoantennas which only exhibit near-field interactions. Here, the enhancements originate from excitation of near-field plasmons confined within 20 nm of monolayer MoS2 which yields a peak photoluminescence enhancement of 8-fold and an area corrected photoluminescence enhancement &gt;980 fold. Additionally, simulated enhancement trends are found to agree well with experimental results to understand the optimal design requirements. Our results will provide a better understanding of local emission enhancements in 2D materials over small areas of MoS2 that are essential for future applications of truly compact optoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional or reduced dimensionality materials. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Electric excitation; Electric fields; Layered semiconductors; Monolayers; Nanoantennas; Optoelectronic devices; Photoluminescence; Semiconductor devices; Band-gap semiconductors; Near field interactions; Photoluminescence enhancement; Plasmonic interactions; Plasmonic resonators; Radiative emissions; Thinning transitions; Two Dimensional (2 D); Plasmons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024837335

Landscape evolution is therefore largely controlled by climate-driven periglacial processes. The response of the frozen ground to late Quaternary warm and cold stages is preserved in permafrost sequences, and deducible by multi-proxy palaeoenvironmental approaches. Here, we analyse radiocarbon-dated mid-Wisconsin Interstadial and Holocene lacustrine deposits preserved in the Kit-1 pingo permafrost sequence combined with water and surface sediment samples from nine modern water bodies on Seward Peninsula (NW Alaska) to reconstruct thermokarst dynamics and determine major abiotic factors that controlled the aquatic ecosystem variability. Our methods comprise taxonomical diatom analyses as well as Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Our results show, that the fossil diatom record reflects thermokarst lake succession since about 42 14C kyr BP. Different thermokarst lake stages during the mid-Wisconsin Interstadial, the late Wisconsin and the early Holocene are mirrored by changes in diatom abundance, diversity, and ecology. We interpret the taxonomical changes in the fossil diatom assemblages in combination with both modern diatom data from surrounding ponds and existing micropalaeontological, sedimentological and mineralogical data from the pingo sequence. A diatom-based quantitative reconstruction of lake water рН indicates changing lake environments during mid-Wisconsin to early Holocene stages. Mineralogical analyses indicate presence of tephra fallout and its impact on fossil diatom communities. Our comparison of modern and fossil diatom communities shows the highest floristic similarity of modern polygon ponds to the corresponding initial (shallow water) development stages of thermokarst lakes. We conclude, that mid-Wisconsin thermokarst processes in the study area could establish during relatively warm interstadial climate conditions accompanied by increased precipitation due to approaching coasts, while still high continentality and hence high seasonal temperature gradients led to warm summers in the central part of Beringia. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Late Quaternary; Microalgae assemblages; Palaeoenvironments; Permafrost; Thermokarst","aquatic ecosystem; diatom; fossil record; frozen ground; lake water; microalga; paleoenvironment; permafrost; Quaternary; radiocarbon dating; taxonomy; tephra; thermokarst; Alaska; Seward Peninsula; United States; Wisconsin; Bacillariophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018428640

Research on the relationship between cities and climate change is now on the rise. The concept of Climate Sensitive Urban Design (CSUD) was coined with the awareness that city design must bring improvements to the urban environment besides economic, spatial, functional and aesthetic benefits and to tackle climate change issues in order to improve urban resilience. On the other hand, Urban Regeneration (UR) projects have a demonstrated potential to bring a significant contribution to the society, economy and environment of degraded urban areas and could facilitate the implementation of spatial policies that address climate change. At present, there are limited studies on Urban Regeneration efforts that possible contribution to climate change adaptation. Planners, architects and urban designers need to fully understand the opportunity provided by the Urban Regeneration process to implement the CSUD strategies. The authors argue that approaching Urban Regeneration with a Climate Sensitive design strategy would provide better integrated solutions. The application of the CSUD systems to an Urban Regeneration process have the potential to provide wider associated benefits, allowing urban designers and planners to creatively consider the form, function and design/aesthetic elements with an environmental approach. Through the review of case studies, the research presents the possible beneficial joint effects determined by the simultaneous application of Climate Sensitive Urban Design to an Urban Regeneration program with the aim to build urban resilience against the adverse impact of climate change. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Climate sensitive urban design; Ecological urban design; Urban design; Urban landscape design; Urban regeneration; Urban resilience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030245448

Compared with the luminescence intensity of Ca3Mg3Si4O14∶Eu2+phosphor without flux, the photoluminescence intensity increased by 70% when adding NH4Cl as flux. Furthermore, the emission intensity reduced by only 7.6% and 14% at 150 ℃ for Ca3Mg3Si4O14∶Eu2+ phosphor and commercial green phosphor. The Ca3Mg3Si4O14∶Eu2+ phosphor also possesses high thermal stability, and these luminescnce properties indicate that Ca3Mg3Si4O14∶Eu2+ phosphor is a promising green phosphor for use in solid-state white lighting. © 2017, Peking University Press.

A vast majority of countries have adopted reduction targets by 2030 in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). There are many alternative ways to analyze the fairness of national mitigation contributions. This article uses a model framework based on six equity principles of effort-sharing, to allocate countries’ reduction targets under global emissions scenarios consistent with meeting the Paris climate goals. It further compares these allocations with the NDCs. The analysis shows that most countries need to adopt more ambitious reduction targets by 2030 to meet 2 °C, and even more for 1.5 °C. In the context of 2 °C, the NDCs of the United States of America and the European Union lack ambition with respect to the approaches that emphasize responsibility; China's NDC projection falls short of satisfying any approach in 2030. In the context of 1.5 °C, only India, by implementing its most ambitious efforts by 2030, could be in line with most equity principles. For most countries, the NDCs would use most of their allowed emissions space for the entire 21 st century by 2030, posing a major challenge to transform to a pathway consistent with their fair contributions in the long-term. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Effort-sharing; Fairness; NDCs; Paris Agreement","Article; climate change; comparative study; developing country; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; human; land use; paris agreement goal; priority journal; United Nations; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019154732

More ocean and less ordinary road transportation will be adopted when environmental performance matters, and it is possible to greatly reduce the carbon emission while keeping the transportation cost not increase dramatically. However, there exist a tradeoff between emission reduction and the transportation cost.

The evaluation was conducted through proposing and testing indices for vulnerability (Climate Vulnerability Index – CVI) and adaptation (Current Adaptive Capacity Index – CACI) based on the assumption that a community is an active dynamic entity and has tremendous capability to address the impacts of climate change through an ability to make adjustments based on perceived experiences. Both CVI and CACI include the five forms of capital leading to sustainable livelihood, i.e. human, natural, financial, social and physical capital, and were assessed for each of these forms of capital based on the IPCC framework of vulnerability assessment and its three dimensions (exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity). Data for the analysis were collected from randomly selected households located away from district headquarters (ADH) and near district headquarters (NDH). Each dimension was measured based on associated socio-environment-specific indicators for assessing vulnerability and sustainability at community level. The results showed that ADH households had higher human capital and natural capital vulnerability than NDH households. In contrast, NDH households had higher social capital and financial capital vulnerability than ADH households. Overall, ADH households had greater vulnerability than NDH households. These results improve understanding of the environmental and socio-economic changes affecting rural livelihoods and the measures needed to address their specific vulnerabilities by addressing bottlenecks in education and training facilities for skill up-grading, increasing interaction opportunities through local functions and creating opportunities for income generation and effective market and farm linkages. An attempt was made to reduce the gap between bottom-up understanding and top-down policies by suggesting precautionary and ongoing adaptation practices for the communities studied, leading to effective and efficient addressal of vulnerabilities. Vulnerability in the study context was taken to mean externally driven change leading to disturbance in the human environment that could alter internal and external livelihood settings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bottom-up approach; Exposure; Household capital; Resilience","Ability testing; Grading; Sustainable development; Bottom up approach; Climate vulnerability indices; Education and training; Exposure; Household capital; Resilience; Sustainable livelihood; Vulnerability assessments; Climate change; adaptive management; bottom-up approach; capital; climate change; climate effect; environmental impact assessment; environmental indicator; household income; human capital; livelihood; natural capital; social capital; socioeconomic conditions; sustainability; vulnerability; Himalayas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018922001

In Thailand, the rising sea level exacerbates the vulnerability of coastal communities to changes in geographic conditions seriously affecting communities with low adaptive capacity and mostly dependent on natural resources. This paper identifies the potential vulnerability of coastal fishing communities which are prone to severe sea-level rises, like in the case of Laemsing District in Chanthaburi Province, Thailand. Climate simulation, Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing techniques were applied to quantify potential sea-level change (exposure), inundated areas and affected households (sensitivity). Adaptive capacity was analyzed in terms of social, human, institutional, economic, and natural conditions. Based on A1F1 (the worst case of future greenhouse gas emissions) and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies model EH (GISS-EH) best estimate for 2050, relative sea-level increase from 2000 would be 0.50 m, resulting in a loss of about 87.77 km of land and inundation of 2060 households. Opinions on alleviating vulnerability suggested that each condition of vulnerability is associated with two stages of development, urgent and medium. Laemsing District can face the serious effects of seawater inundation in the future. The results of this paper could be appropriately used as a reference for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into development policies and raising the awareness of stakeholders on how to cope with sea-level change and its impacts. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate model; Coastal fishing community; Inundation; Sea-level change; Thailand; Vulnerability","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; coastal zone; environmental effect; fishing community; flooding; GIS; natural resource; nature-society relations; remote sensing; sea level change; vulnerability; Central Region [Thailand]; Chanthaburi; Thailand; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026804133

IraD functions as an antiadapter protein that inhibits RssB-mediated degradation of RpoS, the general stress response and stationary-phase sigma factor of Escherichia coli. Here we identified a novel mechanism in which CsrA represses iraD translation via translational coupling. Expression studies with quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, Western blotting, and lacZ fusions demonstrated that CsrA represses iraD expression. Gel mobility shift, footprint, and toeprint studies identified four CsrA binding sites in the iraD leader transcript, all of which are far upstream of the iraD ribosome binding site. Computational modeling and RNA structure mapping identified an RNA structure that sequesters the iraD Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence. Three open reading frames (ORFs), all of which are translated, were identified in the iraD leader region. Two of these ORFs do not affect iraD expression. However, the translation initiation region of the third ORF contains three of the CsrA binding sites, one of which overlaps its SD sequence. Furthermore, the ORF stop codon overlaps the iraD start codon, a sequence arrangement indicative of translational coupling. In vivo expression and in vitro translation studies with wildtype and mutant reporter fusions demonstrated that bound CsrA directly represses translation initiation of this ORF. We further established that CsrA-dependent repression of iraD translation occurs entirely via translational coupling with this ORF, leading to accelerated iraD mRNA decay. IMPORTANCE CsrA posttranscriptionally represses gene expression associated with stationary-phase bacterial growth, often in opposition to the transcriptional effects of the stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS. We show that CsrA employs a novel regulatory mechanism to repress translation of iraD, which encodes an antiadapter protein that protects RpoS against proteolysis. CsrA binds to four sites in the iraD leader transcript but does not directly occlude ribosome binding to the iraD SD sequence. Instead, CsrA represses translation of a short open reading frame encoded upstream of iraD, causing repression of iraD translation via translational coupling. This finding offers a novel mechanism of gene regulation by the global regulator CsrA, and since RpoS can activate csrA transcription, this also highlights a new negative-feedback loop within the complex Csr and RpoS circuitry. © 2017 Park et al.","CsrA; IraD; RpoS; Translational control; Translational coupling","carrier proteins and binding proteins; messenger RNA; protein CsrA; protein IraD; RNA binding protein; sigma factor RpoS; unclassified drug; bacterial protein; bacterial RNA; CsrA protein, E coli; Escherichia coli protein; IraD protein, E coli; repressor protein; RNA binding protein; sigma factor; sigma factor KatF protein, Bacteria; transcription factor; Article; binding site; controlled study; gene; gene expression; in vitro study; in vivo study; iraD gene; open reading frame; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein binding; RNA structure; translation initiation; translation termination; Western blotting; Escherichia coli; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; protein synthesis; Bacterial Proteins; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Open Reading Frames; Protein Biosynthesis; Repressor Proteins; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Messenger; RNA-Binding Proteins; Sigma Factor; Transcription Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029143133

The objective of this research was to quantify N2O-N emissions from simulated open-lot beef cattle feedlot pens after rainfall. A recirculating-flow-through, non-steady state chamber system consisting of five 1-m2 steel pans was designed for quantifying emissions. A lid was placed sequentially on each pan, and headspace air was recirculated between the pan and a real-time N2O analyzer, measuring concentrations every 1 s. Air-dried manure (89.2% dry matter) from a commercial feedlot in the Texas Panhandle was placed in the pans and then 0, 6.3, 12.7, 25.4, or 50.8 mm of water was applied to simulate a one-time rainfall event. Emissions of N2O-N were monitored for 45 d, where two distinct episodes of N2O-N production were observed over time. The first N2O-N episode had a duration of 10 h and peaked 2 h after rainfall at a flux of 1.0 to 200 mg m-2 h-1. The second episode had a duration of 40 d and peaked 15 d after rainfall at a flux of 0.06 to 35 mg m-2 h-1. The second episode accounted for 69 to 91% of the cumulative N2O-N emitted over the 45-d period. Each millimeter of rainfall increased cumulative N2O-N emitted by 167.9 mg m-2 (r2 = 0.99, P &lt; 0.001). This rainfall vs. cumulative emissions relationship will be useful for modeling annual N2O-N emissions from open-lot beef cattle feedlots, and for assessing the effectiveness of best management practices for reducing feedlot GHG emissions. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.",,"Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Manures; Nitrogen oxides; Rain; Agricultural operations; Best management practices; Cumulative emissions; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Nitrous oxide emissions; Non steady-state; Recirculating flow; Simulated rainfall; Beef; ammonia; calcium; magnesium; nitrate; nitrogen; nitrogen dioxide; nitrous oxide; organic matter; organic nitrogen; phosphorus; potassium; rain; sulfur; methane; nitrous oxide; air temperature; ambient air; animal husbandry; Article; beef cattle; caliche; cattle farming; concentration (parameters); electric conductivity; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; feedlot; humidity; limit of quantitation; manure; mass; measurement precision; nitrous oxide emission; nitrous oxide gas analyzer; nonhuman; pH; quality control; simulation; soil; Texas; water content; air pollutant; animal; bovine; red meat; Air Pollutants; Animals; Cattle; Manure; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Red Meat; Texas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026306986

Another important feature of the controllers is that they have a multi-class nature: different classes of vehicles are considered and specific control actions are computed for each class. Since the controllers are based on a set of parameters that need to be tuned, the overall control framework also includes a module to properly determine the gains of the controllers. The simulation analysis reported in the paper shows the effectiveness of the proposed control framework and, in particular, the possibility of implementing control policies that are specific for each vehicle type. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Freeway networks; Integrated control; Predictive feedback controller; Ramp metering; Route guidance; Traffic emissions","Feedback; Highway traffic control; Integrated control; Traffic congestion; Feedback controller; Freeway networks; Ramp metering; Route guidance; Traffic emissions; Controllers; emission control; modeling; motorway; policy implementation; traffic congestion; traffic management; transportation policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019551623

Application of N fertilizer has tremendously increased the food production all over the world. The emissions of reactive nitrogen (Nr) from agricultural systems in the form of ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrates (NO3), and many organic N forms are altering the nitrogen cycle. The use of Nr is inefficient and leakages lead to human health impacts, diminished ecosystem services, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Loss of NH3 not only reduces the N-use efficiency but is also an indirect source of N2O emission. Ammonium aerosols contribute to fine particulate matter and regional haze concentrations in the atmosphere. N2O is a greenhouse gas responsible for global warming and climate change. NOx influences the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere through OH and nitrate and also influences the radiation budget of the atmosphere indirectly through O3 formation, representing about 10-15% of the total anthropogenic greenhouse effect. Nitrogen is the most widely used fertilizer nutrient in India and its consumption has increased over the years. Emission of N2O has increased over the years because of the increased N-fertilizer use as it contributes about 70% of the emission. The release of nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2) has accelerated during the past few decades primarily through increase in fossil fuel combustion. The ever-growing human population and its increased generation of sewage and industrial wastes have also increased the reactive nitrogen inputs to the environment. Agriculture offers promising opportunities for mitigating N2O emission and adapting to climate change. The adverse impacts of climate change and variability on crop yield could be compensated with efficient use of N. Yield reduction because of late sowing of rice as a result of delayed onset of monsoon can be compensated with higher application of N. However, this would mean additional application of N and may have side effects on the environment, which need to be evaluated. Because of the strong inter-relationship among N use, climate change, and food security, future N management strategies should be developed with a target of climate change mitigation and adaptation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The feasible innovative methods and technologies are in demand to overcome global warming. The three major concerns for the planet are related to energy, the environment, and food, and they can be solved through the use of microalgae if exploited in a well-balanced and cost-effective manner with synergistic approaches. Microalgal technologies are gradually realizing the potential of CO2 capture through mass cultivation using wastewater/flue gases, etc. Its biomass could be used as an energy feedstock (biodiesel, bioethanol, biohydrogen, biogas, etc.) integrated with high-value products such as PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acids), DHA (docosahexaenoic acids), pigments (phycobiliproteins), carotenoids, etc. In addition, there is a vast scope for making a complete biorefinery system initiating from cultivation of microalgae by utilizing wastewater and flue gases at nonfertile unutilized lands. Microalgal carbon fixation and carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) in global climate change scenarios are not yet fully understood for decision making on their adaptation, future community changes, feedback to global emissions and associated implications in ecosystems services. In addition, many facets of CCMs and carbon sequestration process needs to be investigated for the integrated carbon capture and biorefinery projects. In summary, they are one of the potential climate change mitigating biological agents available with a green approach for sustainable development. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We chose to study subarachnoid hemorrhage occurring in oceanic climate with deep variations focusing on partial oxygen volume (pO2) and patient history. Methods Seventy-one patients had been successively recruited from a single center 45 km from the Atlantic shore. Climate conditions had been analyzed from 72 hours before subarachnoid hemorrhage to 24 hours after. According to Dalton's law, climate conditions influence pO2, recalculated with Dupré's formula, and patient history analyzed and scored according to the induced oxidative stress. Results Subarachnoid hemorrhage risk is highest during spring and autumn, lowest between midnight and 6:00 a.m. Risk is highest after a period of atmospheric pressure higher than 1010 hPa (83%) and high pO2 and lowest for atmospheric pressure lower than 990 hPa and pO2 lower than 20.6. According to the medical history, 2 groups of patients could be identified: patients without history (22%), women (62%), high atmospheric pressure, and relatively lower pO2; and patients with a medical history, relatively lower atmospheric pressure, and higher pO2. Atmospheric pressure decreased significantly before disruption (994 hPa) but with a constant pO2. Subarachnoid hemorrhages during high atmospheric pressure were preceded by a decrease of pO2 despite a highly stable period of high atmospheric pressure. Discussion Atmospheric O2 changes and the subsequent oxidative stress could be the local ultimate trigger of subarachnoid hemorrhage that could result in the “ideal” fit of patient's health conditions with the meteorological environment. © 2017 National Stroke Association","atmospheric oxygen pressure; atmospheric pressure; intracranial cerebral aneurysm; pO2; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; weather","Article; atmospheric pressure; autumn; climate; climate change; female; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; medical history; meteorology; oxidative stress; oxygen tension; priority journal; sea; seasonal variation; spring; subarachnoid hemorrhage; adult; aged; Atlantic Ocean; climate; France; middle aged; risk assessment; risk factor; season; subarachnoid hemorrhage; time factor; very elderly; weather; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Atlantic Ocean; Atmospheric Pressure; Climate; Female; France; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Oxidative Stress; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Seasons; Subarachnoid Hemorrhage; Time Factors; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019747819

Volcanic ashfall layers (tephras) provide chronostratigraphic markers that can be used to estimate age offsets. We describe the first recorded occurrence of a visible tephra in a lacustrine sequence in the central Northwest Territories. The tephra, observed in Pocket Lake, near Yellowknife, is geochemically and stratigraphically attributed to the White River Ash east lobe (WRAe; 833–850 CE; 1117–1100 cal BP), which originated from an eruption of Mount Churchill, Alaska. We also observed the WRAe as a cryptotephra in Bridge Lake, 130 km to the NE, suggesting that records of this tephra are potentially widespread in CNT lakes. The identification of this tephra presents opportunities for use of the WRAe as a dating tool in the region and to quantify the magnitude of the FRE in order to correct radiocarbon age-depth models. Two well-dated sediment cores from Pocket Lake, containing a visible WRAe record, indicate a FRE of ~ 200 years at the time of the ash deposition, which matches closely with the estimated FRE of ~ 245 years at the lake sediment-water interface. Although additional results from other lakes in the region are required, this finding implies that FRE estimates for the late Holocene in the region, may be based either on down-core WRAe/radiocarbon age model offsets, or on radiocarbon dates obtained from the sediment-water interface. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Age-depth models; Cryptotephra; Lakes; Northwest Territories; Radiocarbon dating; Tephra","age; core analysis; deposition; depositional environment; depositional sequence; depth; Holocene; lacustrine deposit; lake; model test; radiocarbon dating; reservoir; sediment-water interface; tephra; volcanic ash; volcanic eruption; Alaska; Canada; Churchill; Manitoba; Northwest Territories; United States; Yellowknife",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017550851

Several studies have indicated that predominant methanogens of buffalo rumen are different from those in cattle. However, predominant genera of methanogens reported by individual studies varied primarily because of limited scope of sampling, sequencing of limited number of sequences and potential PCR bias in individual studies. In this study, the collective comparative diversity of methanogenic archaea in the rumen of cattle and buffaloes was examined by performing a meta-analysis of all the 16S rRNA (rrn) sequences deposited in GenBank. RESULTS: Ruminal methanogen sequences of buffalo were clustered into 900 species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and ruminal methanogen sequences of cattle were clustered into 1522 species level OTUs. The number of species-level OTUs shared between cattle and buffaloes was 229 (10.4% of all OTUs), comprising 1746 sequences (27% of the total 6447 sequences). According to taxonomic classification by three different classifiers, Methanobrevibacter was found to be the most predominant genus both in cattle (69–71% of sequences) as well as buffaloes (65.1–68.9% of sequences). Percentage of Methanomicrobium was much higher (P < 0.05) in the case of buffalo (18%) than that of cattle (4.5%). On the other hand, percentages of Methanosphaera- and Methanomassiliicoccus-like methanogens were much higher (P < 0.05) in cattle than in buffaloes. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that there is a substantial difference in community structure of ruminal methanogens of cattle and buffaloes. The study has also indicated that the percent of species-level operational taxonomic units shared between cattle and buffalo is very low, and thus host species-specific methane mitigation strategies need to be developed for cattle and buffaloes. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry","16S rDNA; archaea; buffalo; cattle; diversity; rumen","animal; archaeon; bovine; buffalo; classification; comparative study; genetics; growth, development and aging; intestine flora; isolation and purification; microbiology; phylogeny; rumen; Animals; Archaea; Buffaloes; Cattle; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Phylogeny; Rumen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007480731

Supplementation of biological processes with metals may result in improved performance, but high metal concentrations are often toxic to microorganisms. In this work, methanogenic enrichment cultures growing on H2/CO2 or acetate were supplemented with trace concentrations of nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), but no significant increase in methane production was observed in most of the tested conditions. However, high concentrations of these metals were detrimental to methanogenic activity of the cultures. Cumulative methane production (after 6 days of incubation) from H2/CO2 was 40% lower in the presence of 8 mM of Ni or 30 mM of Co, compared to controls without metal supplementation. When acetate was used as substrate, cumulative methane production was also reduced: by 18% with 8 mM of Ni and by 53% with 30 mM of Co (after 6 days of incubation). Metal precipitation with sulfide was further tested as a possible method to alleviate metal toxicity. Anaerobic sludge was incubated with Co (30 mM) and Ni (8 mM) in the presence of sulfate or sulfide. The addition of sulfide helped to mitigate the toxic effect of the metals. Methane production from H2/CO2 was negatively affected in the presence of sulfate, possibly due to competition of hydrogenotrophic methanogens by sulfate-reducing bacteria. However, in the enrichment cultures growing on acetate, biogenically produced sulfide had a positive effect and more methane was produced in these incubations than in similar assays without sulfate addition. The outcome of competition between methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria is a determinant factor for the success of using biogenic sulfide as detoxification method. © 2017 Paulo, Ramiro-Garcia, van Mourik, Stams and Sousa.","Anaerobic sludge; Heavy metals; Inhibition; Stimulation; Sulfate; Sulfide","cobalt; nickel; sulfate; sulfide; analytic method; Article; biological activity; controlled study; detoxification; enrichment culture; gene library; gene sequence; heavy metal poisoning; Methanobacterium formicicum; methanogenic bacterium; Methanosaeta concilii; Methanosarcina barkeri; microbial community; microbial metabolism; mineral supplementation; nonhuman; sludge",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025472307

In particular, a host of new paleoclimate records suggest that ENSO internal variability or other external forcings may have dwarfed the fairly modest ENSO response to precessional insolation changes simulated in climate models. Here, using fully coupled ocean-atmosphere model simulations, we show that accounting for a vegetated and less dusty Sahara during the mid-Holocene relative to preindustrial climate can reduce ENSO variability by 25%, more than twice the decrease obtained using orbital forcing alone. We identify changes in tropical Atlantic mean state and variability caused by the momentous strengthening of the West Africa Monsoon (WAM) as critical factors in amplifying ENSO's response to insolation forcing through changes in the Walker circulation. Our results thus suggest that potential changes in the WAM due to anthropogenic warming may influence ENSO variability in the future as well. © The Author(s) 2017.",,"anthropogenic effect; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate modeling; climate variation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Holocene; insolation; orbital forcing; paleoclimate; proxy climate record; Walker circulation; warming; Article; atmosphere; El Nino; Holocene; sea; sunlight; vegetation; Western Sahara; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Tropical); Sahara",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022222148

Electric vehicles indisputably bring benefits to their drivers and society in general, indirectly through global warming and greenhouse gas emissions mitigation and directly through financial savings and cleaner microclimate. However, integration of electric vehicle charging spots at home or work, especially fast charging stations and battery swapping stations, without prior analysis can have a negative effect on power system. In order to predict and eliminate power grid issues before they occur, a detailed analyses should be made through a common understanding of both transportation and recharging needs of electric vehicles' users and of the power grid constraints. Power and transportation system interdependency becomes of high value for correct placement and sizing of charging stations and for overall increase of social welfare. This paper analyzes electric vehicles charging needs at the basic level, through both the power system and the transportation system. An urban transmission and power grid in the vicinity of the Croatian capital Zagreb is used as a study case. Driving and electricity consumption curves are compared, locations for charging infrastructure are selected (fast charging spots and battery swapping station) and power grid's available capacity is defined. © 2017 Croatian Society MIPRO.",,"Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Microelectronics; Secondary batteries; Taxation; Transportation; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Available capacity; Charging infrastructures; Electric vehicle charging; Electricity-consumption; Environmental awareness; Fast charging stations; Financial savings; Transportation system; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027704291

The aim of the study was characterization of culturable hydrocarbon-degrading endophytic bacteria associated with Lotus corniculatus L. and Oenothera biennis L. collected in long-term petroleum hydrocarbon-polluted site using culture-dependent and molecular approaches. A total of 26 hydrocarbon-degrading endophytes from these plants were isolated. Phylogenetic analyses classified the isolates into the phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The majority of strains belonged to the genera Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, and Rhodococcus. More than 90% of the isolates could grow on medium with diesel oil, approximately 20% could use n-hexadecane as a sole carbon and energy source. PCR analysis revealed that 40% of the isolates possessed the P450 gene encoding for cytochrome P450-type alkane hydroxylase (CYP153). In in vitro tests, all endophytic strains demonstrated a wide range of plant growth-promoting traits such as production of indole-3-acetic acid, hydrogen cyanide, siderophores, and phosphate solubilization. More than 40% of the bacteria carried the gene encoding for the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase (acdS). Our study shows that the diversity of endophytic bacterial communities in tested plants was different. The results revealed also that the investigated plants were colonized by endophytic bacteria possessing plant growth-promoting features and a clear potential to degrade hydrocarbons. The properties of isolated endophytes indicate that they have the high potential to improve phytoremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon-polluted soils. © 2017, The Author(s).","Endophytic bacteria; Lotus corniculatus L; Oenothera biennis L; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Plant growth-promoting mechanisms; Plant-bacteria interactions","bacterium; colonization; contaminated land; endophyte; growth regulator; herb; isolated population; legume; microbial community; microbial ecology; petroleum hydrocarbon; phylogenetics; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lotus corniculatus; Oenothera biennis; Proteobacteria; Pseudomonas; Rhizobium; Rhodococcus; Stenotrophomonas; hydrocarbon; Actinobacteria; analysis; bioremediation; endophyte; growth, development and aging; Lotus (genus); metabolism; microbiology; Oenothera biennis; Poland; Proteobacteria; soil pollutant; symbiosis; Actinobacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Endophytes; Hydrocarbons; Loteae; Oenothera biennis; Poland; Proteobacteria; Soil Pollutants; Symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021779386

Few studies have investigated CH4 fluxes in subarctic heath ecosystems, and climate change-induced shifts in CH4 flux and the overall carbon budget are therefore largely unknown. Hence, there is an urgent need for long-term in situ experiments allowing for the study of ecosystem processes over time scales relevant to environmental change. Here we present in situ CH4 and CO2 flux measurements from a wet heath ecosystem in northern Sweden subjected to 16 years of manipulations, including summer warming with open-top chambers, birch leaf litter addition, and the combination thereof. Throughout the snow-free season, the ecosystem was a net sink of CH4 and CO2 (CH4 −0.27 mg C m−2 d−1; net ecosystem exchange −1827 mg C m−2 d−1), with highest CH4 uptake rates (−0.70 mg C m−2 d−1) during fall. Warming enhanced net CO2 flux, while net CH4 flux was governed by soil moisture. Litter addition and the combination with warming significantly increased CH4 uptake rates, explained by a pronounced soil drying effect of up to 32% relative to ambient conditions. Both warming and litter addition also increased the seasonal average concentration of dissolved organic carbon in the soil. The site was a carbon sink with a net uptake of 60 g C m−2 over the snow-free season. However, warming reduced net carbon uptake by 77%, suggesting that this ecosystem type might shift from snow-free season sink to source with increasing summer temperatures. ©2017.

Road pricing is an effective tool for reducing air pollution, as reflected currently urban road pricing outcomes (Singapore, London, Stockholm and Milan). A survey was conducted based on establishing a hypothetical urban road pricing system in Madrid (a random sample size n = 1298). We developed a forecast air pollution model with time series analysis to evaluate the consequences of possible air pollution decreases in Madrid. Results reveal that the hypothetical road pricing for Madrid could have highly significant effects on decreasing air pollution outside of the city and in the inner city during the peak operating time periods of maximum congestion (morning peak hours from 7:00 to 10:00 and evening peak hours from 18:00 to 20:00). Furthermore, this system could have significant positive effects on a shift toward using public transport and non-motorized modes inside the hypothetical toll zone. This reveals that the system has a high capacity to motivate a decrease in air pollution and impose more sustainable behavior for public transport users. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Congestion traffic; Road pricing","Air pollution; Atmospheric movements; Costs; Nonmotorized transportation; Pollution; Roads and streets; Surveys; Time series analysis; Traffic congestion; Traffic control; Transportation; Transportation charges; Air Pollution Modeling; Effective tool; Empirical studies; Non-motorized modes; Operating time; Public transport; Road pricing; Travel behaviors; Forecasting; atmospheric pollution; empirical analysis; forecasting method; price dynamics; public transport; road transport; sustainability; traffic congestion; travel behavior; urban area; England; Italy; Lombardy; London [England]; Madrid [Madrid (ADS/PRV)]; Madrid [Spain]; Milan; Milano [Lombardy]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Spain; Stockholm [Stockholm (CNT)]; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033369656

It is essential to conduct detailed analyses on the effect of physical parameterization schemes on regional climate simulation, to provide more reliable regional climate change information. In this paper, we evaluate the 25-year (1983–2007) summer monsoon climate characteristics of precipitation and surface air temperature by using the regional spectral model (RSM) with different physical schemes. The ensemble results using the reliability ensemble averaging (REA) method are also assessed. The result shows that the RSM model has the capacity to reproduce the spatial patterns, the variations, and the temporal tendency of surface air temperature and precipitation over eastern China. And it tends to predict better climatology characteristics over the Yangtze River basin and the South China. The impact of different physical schemes on RSM simulations is also investigated. Generally, the CLD3 cloud water prediction scheme tends to produce larger precipitation because of its overestimation of the low-level moisture. The systematic biases derived from the KF2 cumulus scheme are larger than those from the RAS scheme. The scale-selective bias correction (SSBC) method improves the simulation of the temporal and spatial characteristics of surface air temperature and precipitation and advances the circulation simulation capacity. The REA ensemble results show significant improvement in simulating temperature and precipitation distribution, which have much higher correlation coefficient and lower root mean square error. The REA result of selected experiments is better than that of nonselected experiments, indicating the necessity of choosing better ensemble samples for ensemble. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.",,"air temperature; downscaling; ensemble forecasting; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; summer; surface temperature; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976391708

We assessed the human and natural controls over aboveground tree biomass density in African dry tropical forests, using Zambia's first nationwide forest inventory. We identified predictors that best explain the variation in biomass density, contrasted anthropogenic and natural sites at different spatial scales, and compared sites with different stand structure characteristics and species composition. In addition, we evaluated the effects of different management and conservation practices on biomass density. Variation in biomass density was mostly determined by biotic processes, linked with both species richness and dominance (evenness), and to a lesser extent, by land use, environmental controls, and spatial structure. Biomass density was negatively associated with tree species evenness and positively associated with species richness for both natural and human-modified sites. Human influence variables (including distance to roads, distance to town, fire occurrence, and the population on site) did not explain substantial variation in biomass density in comparison to biodiversity variables. The relationship of human activities to biomass density in managed sites appears to be mediated by effects on species diversity and stand structure characteristics, with lower values in human-modified sites for all metrics tested. Small contrasts in carbon density between human-modified and natural forest sites signal the potential to maintain carbon in the landscape inside but also outside forestlands in this region. Biodiversity is positively related to biomass density in both human and natural sites, demonstrating potential synergies between biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. This is the first evidence of positive outcomes of protected areas and participatory forest management on carbon storage at national scale in Zambia. This research shows that understanding controls over biomass density can provide policy relevant inputs for carbon management and on ecological processes affecting carbon storage. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","aboveground biomass; biodiversity and ecosystem function; carbon management and conservation; Miombo woodlands; reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; spatial variability of biomass; variation partitioning","aboveground biomass; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem function; forest inventory; forest management; protected area; spatial variation; species diversity; species evenness; species richness; stand structure; tropical forest; woodland; Zambia; biodiversity; biomass; environment; environmental protection; forest; human activities; physiology; procedures; tree; Zambia; Biodiversity; Biomass; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; Forests; Human Activities; Trees; Zambia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021813109

It is important to understand how these products perform relative to each other and to ground observations. In this study, we extracted spring green-up onset dates (GUD) over the contiguous United States (CONUS) from six major land surface phenology (LSP) products: (1) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover Dynamics Phenology (MCD12Q2); (2) Vegetation Index and Phenology Multi-sensor Phenology (VIPPHENEVI2); (3) Global Long-Term Climate Modeling Grid Land Surface Phenology (CMGLSP); (4 and 5) North American Carbon Program (NACP) Phenology (MOD09Q1PEVI and MOD15PHN); and (6) USGS/EROS advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) phenology (AVHRRP). We characterized and compared the GUD data in these LSP products, and evaluated their accuracy using ground-based phenology observations [i.e., human observations of first leaf and sensor readings of gross primary productivity (GPP)] from the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) and AmeriFlux. The results revealed the consistencies and discrepancies of GUD estimates among LSP products. Intercomparison of the six products indicated that the root mean square error (RMSE) of these products range from 17.8 days to 31.5 days, whereas AVHRRP GUD has the lowest correlation and largest RMSE (∼30 days) relative to other products. When compared to ground observations, GUD estimates in six LSP products generally have RMSE values of ∼20 days and significant correlations (p < 0.001). For the products (MCD12Q2, AVHRRP, MOD09Q1PEVI, and MOD15PHN) available for comparisons in the short-term period (from 2001–2007), AVHRRP GUD presented relatively weaker correlations and a lower index of agreement (IOA), however, MCD12Q2 GUD showed overall slightly better consistencies with ground observations. In the two long-term products (CMGLSP and VIPPHENEVI2 from 1982–2013), CMGLSP exhibited stronger correlations, lower RMSE, and higher IOA with ground observations of the first leaf dates than VIPPHENEVI2 did. To our knowledge, our study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of phenology products using two independent ground-based datasets. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Evaluation; First leaf dates; Green-up onset date; Land surface phenology; Remote sensing","accuracy assessment; AVHRR; comparative study; ground-based measurement; land surface; MODIS; performance assessment; phenology; remote sensing; satellite sensor; spring (season); United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018361762

To assess the impact of socioeconomic factors on the pattern of air quality vairation and economical risks, concentrations of SO2, NO2, and PM10, industry genres, and meteorological conditions were selected in the Three Gorges Reservoir of Chongqing (TGRC) during 2006–2015. Results showed that air quality had improved to some extent, but atmospheric NO2 showed an increased trend during 2011–2015. Spatially, higher atmospheric NO2 extended to the surrounding area. The primary industry, especially for agriculture, had shown to be responsible for the remarkable increase of atmospheric NO2 (p &lt; 0.01) due to the direct burning of agricultural straws and the emission of livestock breeding. The improvement of regional industrial structure and industrialization benefited air pollutant reductions, but construction industries had inhibited the improvement of regional air quality. In the tertiary industry, the cargo industry at ports had significantly decreased atmospheric NO2 as a result of eliminating the obsoleted small ships. Contrarily, the highway transportation had brought more air pollutants. The relative humidity was shown to be the main meteorological factor, which had an extremely remarkable relation with atmospheric SO2 (p &lt; 0.01) and a significant correlation with atmospheric NO2 (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. In the future, the development of agriculture and livestock breeding would make regional air quality improvement difficult, and atmospheric SO2, NO2, and PM10 deposition would aggravate regional soil and water acidification and reactivate heavy metal in soil and sediment, further to pose a high level of ecological risk in the TGRC and other countries with reservoirs in the world. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Air quality; Meteorology; Socioeconomic factor; Temporal-spatial variation; Three Gorges Reservoir","agricultural emission; air quality; atmospheric pollution; cargo; industrial structure; industrialization; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; relative humidity; reservoir; socioeconomic impact; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Chongqing; Hubei; Three Gorges Dam; Three Gorges Reservoir; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; meteorological phenomena; particulate matter; socioeconomics; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Meteorological Concepts; Particulate Matter; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019587991

We conduct a systematic literature review to present an overview of how the peer-reviewed academic literature recommends fisheries management frameworks should respond to the climate change-driven uncertainty, vulnerability and risk facing resource bases. Our review identifies 21 different potential management responses. Adaptive management was the most commonly identified strategy, with institutional capacity development and input/output controls also frequently cited. We contrast our findings with illustrative cases characterizing management practice and outcomes in RFMOs, and argue that the ability of RFMOs to implement the climate change mitigation strategies identified in our review is a function of an organization's decision-making rules. We argue that consensus-based decision-making policies limit adaptiveness, and that a ‘responsiveness gap’ exists between consensus and majority-based decision-making frameworks. This gap will become more evident, and increase in importance, as the impacts of climate change shift from potential to kinetic. Considering that decision-making rules in RFMOs are unlikely to change, we argue that increased analytical effort concentrated on institutional contexts and member state interest complexes may promote adaptive management, expediting the pace at which scientific recommendations and findings inform policy and practise in RFMOs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive management; Climate change; Decision-making; Fisheries management; RFMOs","Climate change; Fisheries; Adaptive Management; Climate change mitigation; Decision-making frameworks; Fisheries management; Institutional capacities; Institutional contexts; RFMOs; Systematic literature review; Decision making; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; decision making; environmental policy; fishery management; literature review; management practice; organizational framework; vulnerability",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019956775

The special conditions of Mediterranean countries, with high dependency on energy imports and energy used mainly from fossil fuels, make these countries users of high carbon energy. On the other hand, the mild environmental conditions which do not need high energy demands in heating, together with the progressive abandonment of forest exploitation as fuel source, have provoked environmental problems, such as increased risk of forest fires. In view of the above arguments, the Mediterranean forest use becomes essential in order to reduce the risk fire as well as the dependence on energy imports of fossil fuels, and lower CO2 emissions. Nowadays, Biomass District Heating (BDH) is widely used in the North of Europe. The main objective of this work is to establish a methodology for renewable energy resources integration at small urban areas in Mediterranean countries till now with high-energy consumption, and to asses that this methodology could be applied in Mediterranean areas successfully, and the determination of forest needs. For this purpose, a case study is shown, so a BDH network to cover the energy demand in a small urban area in the south of Spain was studied. The study was done in three phases: energy demand survey, BDH calculations, and assessment of technology for both, savings costs and CO2 emissions. In this case, BDH system offers 100% of CO2 savings and 68.22% of fuel cost savings versus fossil fuels. Using BDH, CO2 emissions to the atmosphere have been reduced by 35 tonnes, which is the equivalent of the annual CO2 sequestration of 700 adult trees approximately. As main conclusion of this work, if used, the available forest biomass, it could be saved more than 68% of the current energy demand in the case study. For this small rural settlement of 3000 inhabitants, 4 ha of forest was found as forest biomass needs every year, this means a total of 40 ha as sustainable energy model based on Mediterranean pine forest. The finds of this work can be used as policy solution that has to be study in the whole Mediterranean areas with forest resources, in order to have more sustainable environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; District heating; Renewable energy policy; Small urban areas; Sustainability","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Deforestation; District heating; Energy management; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Environmental conditions; Environmental problems; Forest sustainability; High energy consumption; Mediterranean countries; Renewable energy policy; Sustainable environment; Urban areas; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019106072

The need for sustainable food security for our global population and the need for preserving the environment, namely natural and man-made ecosystems and landscapes, have created an increased need for integrated, participative and scalable solutions focusing the various levels of irrigation and nature water management, from the field crop to the catchment and basin scales. Meanwhile, challenges and issues relative to water management for agriculture and food have evolved enormously in the last 30 years and the role of active management of the components of the water cycle is assuming an increased importance since their dynamics are key to assure water use sustainability, mainly agriculture and natural ecosystems sustainability. However, different regions face context-specific challenges associated with water scarcity, climate, governance, and population requirements. The main and first challenge is producing enough food for a growing population, which is intimately related with challenges placed to agricultural water management, mainly irrigation management. This paper revises challenges and progress achieved in the last 30 years focusing on irrigated agriculture, mainly water management, and its contribution to food security and the welfare of rural communities. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change and uncertainty; Crop water requirements; Energy; Irrigation management; Participatory water governance; Reference evapotranspiration; Water management; Water scarcity","Agriculture; Competition; Crops; Ecology; Ecosystems; Environmental management; Food supply; Irrigation; Land use; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water management; Water resources; Water supply; Crop water requirements; Energy; Irrigation management; Reference evapotranspiration; Water governance; Water scarcity; Climate change; climate change; evapotranspiration; governance approach; irrigation; participatory approach; resource scarcity; water management; water use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020695121

In Central Asia, and in particular on the territory of Uzbekistan, a detailed assessment of glacier lakes and their evolution over time is, however lacking. For this reason we created the first detailed inventory of mountain lakes of Uzbekistan based on recent (2002–2014) satellite observations using WorldView-2, SPOT5, and IKONOS imagery with a spatial resolution from 2 to 10 m. This record was complemented with data from field studies of the last 50 years. The previous data were mostly in the form of inventories of lakes, available in Soviet archives, and primarily included localized in-situ data. The inventory of mountain lakes presented here, by contrast, includes an overview of all lakes of the territory of Uzbekistan. Lakes were considered if they were located at altitudes above 1500 m and if lakes had an area exceeding 100 m2. As in other mountain regions of the World, the ongoing increase of air temperatures has led to an increase in lake number and area. Moreover, the frequency and overall number of lake outburst events have been on the rise as well. Therefore, we also present the first outburst assessment with an updated version of well-known approaches considering local climate features and event histories. As a result, out of the 242 lakes identified on the territory of Uzbekistan, 15% are considered prone to outburst, 10% of these lakes have been assigned low outburst potential and the remainder of the lakes have an average level of outburst potential. We conclude that the distribution of lakes by elevation shows a significant influence on lake area and hazard potential. No significant differences, by contrast, exist between the distribution of lake area, outburst potential, and lake location with respect to glaciers by regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Debris flow; GIS; Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF); Glacier shrinkage; Lakes inventory; Mountain lakes; Outburst assessment; Remote sensing; Uzbekistan","Climate change; Geographic information systems; Glacial geology; Landforms; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Debris flows; Glacial lake outburst flood; Mountain lakes; Outburst assessment; Uzbekistan; Lakes; debris flow; flood; GIS; glacial lake; inventory; outburst; remote sensing; satellite data; shrinkage; air temperature; altitude; Article; climate change; glaciation; glacier; image processing; information center; information processing; lake; satellite imagery; Uzbekistan; article; climate; field study; flooding; glacier; human; human experiment; remote sensing; Uzbekistan; Uzbekistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015644888

Of these, the Athabasca oil sands region is the largest. As part of Environment and Climate Change Canada's program in support of the Joint Canada-Alberta Implementation Plan for Oil Sands Monitoring program, concentrations of trace elements in PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5ĝ€μm in diameter) were measured through two campaigns that involved different methodologies: A long-Term filter campaign and a short-Term intensive campaign. In the long-Term campaign, 24ĝ€h filter samples were collected once every 6 days over a 2-year period (December 2010-November 2012) at three air monitoring stations in the regional municipality of Wood Buffalo. For the intensive campaign (August 2013), hourly measurements were made with an online instrument at one air monitoring station; daily filter samples were also collected. The hourly and 24ĝ€h filter data were analyzed individually using positive matrix factorization. Seven emission sources of PM2. 5 trace elements were thereby identified: Two types of upgrader emissions, soil, haul road dust, biomass burning, and two sources of mixed origin. The upgrader emissions, soil, and haul road dust sources were identified through both the methodologies and both methodologies identified a mixed source, but these exhibited more differences than similarities. The second upgrader emissions and biomass burning sources were only resolved by the hourly and filter methodologies, respectively. The similarity of the receptor modeling results from the two methodologies provided reassurance as to the identity of the sources. Overall, much of the PM2. 5-related trace elements were found to be anthropogenic, or at least to be aerosolized through anthropogenic activities. These emissions may in part explain the previously reported higher levels of trace elements in snow, water, and biota samples collected near the oil sands operations. © 2017 Author(s).",,"aerosol; comparative study; concentration (composition); measurement method; monitoring system; oil sand; particulate matter; trace element; Alberta; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027019134

The increasing interest in extensive green roofs requires refined studies on their design and operation, and on the effects of their relevant parameters on green roof thermal performance. The effects of two design parameters, substrate thickness (ST) and conductivity of dry soil (CDS), and four operating parameters, leaf area index (LAI), leaf reflectivity (LR), stomatal resistance (SR), and moisture content (MC), were investigated using the green roof computer model developed by Sailor in 2008. The computer simulations showed that among the operating parameters, LAI has the largest effects on thermal performance while CDS is a more influential design parameter than ST. Experimental investigations of non-vegetated and sparsely vegetated green roofs in Melbourne were principally used to understand the effect of the substrate and enable better understanding of dominant heat transfer mechanisms involved. Investigated green roofs had three substrate thicknesses (100, 150 and 200 mm), and their performance was compared to a bare conventional roof. In contrast to the computer simulations, the experimental results for summer and winter showed the importance of MC and ST in reducing the substrate temperature and heat flux through the green roof. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change mitigation; Energy efficient buildings; Green roof; Heat flux; Parametric analysis; Substrate; Sustainable buildings and cities; Thermal performance","building; climate change; computer simulation; energy efficiency; environmental impact assessment; heat flux; heat transfer; irrigation system; Mediterranean environment; parameter estimation; performance assessment; roof; substrate; sustainable development; vegetation dynamics; Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027688890

Here we address this problem by applying, for the first time, spectro-electrochemical methods to core-only CIS and core/shell CIS/ZnS NCs. The application of an electrochemical potential enables us to reversibly tune the NC Fermi energy and thereby control the occupancy of intragap defects involved in exciton decay. The results indicate that, in analogy to copper-doped II-VI NCs, emission occurs via radiative capture of a conduction-band electron by a hole localized on an intragap state likely associated with a Cu-related defect. We observe the increase in the emission efficiency under reductive electrochemical potential, which corresponds to raising the Fermi level, leading to progressive filling of intragap states with electrons. This indicates that the factor limiting the emission efficiency in these NCs is nonradiative electron trapping, while hole trapping is of lesser importance. This observation also suggests that the centers for radiative recombination are Cu2+ defects (preexisting and/or accumulated as a result of photoconversion of Cu1+ ions) as these species contain a pre-existing hole without the need for capturing a valence-band hole generated by photoexcitation. Temperature-controlled photoluminescence experiments indicate that the intrinsic limit on the emission efficiency is imposed by multiphonon nonradiative recombination of a band-edge electron and a localized hole. This process affects both shelled and unshelled CIS NCs to a similar degree, and it can be suppressed by cooling samples to below 100 K. Finally, using experimentally measured decay rates, we formulate a model that describes the electrochemical modulation of the PL efficiency in terms of the availability of intragap electron traps as well as direct injection of electrons into the NC conduction band, which activates nonradiative Auger recombination, or electrochemical conversion of the Cu2+ states into the Cu1+ species that are less emissive due to the need for their ""activation"" by the capture of photogenerated holes. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Cu-related defect; CuInS2; Nanocrystal quantum dots; spectro-electrochemistry; temperature-dependent photoluminescence; trapping","Defects; Electron traps; Electrons; Excitons; Fermi level; Heavy metals; Inorganic compounds; Nanocrystals; Photoluminescence; CuInS2; Electrochemical conversion; Electrochemical modulation; Nanocrystal quantum dots; Non-radiative recombinations; Spectroelectrochemical methods; Temperature dependent photoluminescences; trapping; Electrochemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024379523

Coupling transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of the pea (Pisum sativum) rhizosphere, a suite of bioreporters has been developed in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv viciae strain 3841, and these detect metabolites secreted by roots in space and time. Fourteen bacterial lux fusion bioreporters, specific for sugars, polyols, amino acids, organic acids, or flavonoids, have been validated in vitro and in vivo. Using different bacterial mutants (nodC and nifH), the process of colonization and symbiosis has been analyzed, revealing compounds important in the different steps of the rhizobium-legume association. Dicarboxylates and sucrose are the main carbon sources within the nodules; in ineffective (nifH) nodules, particularly low levels of sucrose were observed, suggesting that plant sanctions affect carbon supply to nodules. In contrast, high myo-inositol levels were observed prior to nodule formation and also in nifH senescent nodules. Amino acid biosensors showed different patterns: a g-aminobutyrate biosensor was active only inside nodules, whereas the phenylalanine bioreporter showed a high signal also in the rhizosphere. The bioreporters were further validated in vetch (Vicia hirsuta), producing similar results. In addition, vetch exhibited a local increase of nod gene-inducing flavonoids at sites where nodules developed subsequently. These bioreporters will be particularly helpful in understanding the dynamics of root exudation and the role of different molecules secreted into the rhizosphere. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

To facilitate this competition, the European target model of electricity markets is the energy-only market. The main target of the three Energy Packages is to reap the benefits of free markets with competitive prices and energy efficiency, and to ensure increased transparency in retail markets to benefit consumers. However, the focus has shifted from increasing market efficiency to increasing security of supply and reduction of carbon emissions. To fulfil the European Union's climate policy objectives, it is necessary to implement low-carbon or carbon free technologies. Meanwhile, the periodically available renewable energy sources have appeared on the electricity market. In Europe, market-coupling is also underway, which is a great challenge both technically and economically. The development of technology has accelerated, and it is necessary to follow it by the regulatory environment; however, regulations cannot keep up with the fast changes. The Winter Package was released in November 2016, which contains numerous legislative proposals to create a better regulatory environment in Europe.

However, the same pattern can be the result of different genotypes inhabiting contrasting humidity conditions. To test if reduced growth and high carbohydrate storage are environmentally driven by drought, we examined the growth and non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations in singleprovenance stands of mature trees of Pinus contorta Douglas and Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex C. Lawson planted at contrasting humidity conditions (900 versus 300mm of annual precipitation) in Patagonia, Chile. Individual tree growth was measured for each species and at each location as mean basal area increment of the last 10 years (BAI10), annual shoot elongation for the period 2011-14, and needle length for 2013 and 2014 cohorts. Additionally, needle, branch, stem sapwood and roots were collected from each sampled tree to determine soluble sugars, starch and total NSC concentrations. The two species showed lower mean BAI10 and 2013 needle length in the dry site; P. ponderosa also had lower annual shoot extension for 2011 and 2014, and lower 2014 needle length, in the dry than in the mesic site. By contrast, NSC concentrations of all woody tissues for both species were either similar or higher in the dry site when compared with the mesic site. Patterns of starch and sugars were substantially different: starch concentrations were similar between sites except for roots of P. ponderosa, which were higher in the dry site, while sugar concentrations of all woody tissues in both species were higher in the dry site. Overall, our study provides evidence that reduced growth along with carbon (C) accumulation is an environmentally driven response to drought. Furthermore, the significant accumulation of low-molecular weight sugars in the dry site is compatible with a prioritized C allocation for osmoregulation. However, since this accumulation did not come at the expense of reduced starch, it is unlikely that growth was limited by C supply in the dry site. © 2017 The Author.","Carbon dynamics; Climate change; Conifers; Drought; Osmoregulation; Patagonia","arid region; basal area; biochemical composition; carbohydrate; carbon flux; climate change; concentration (composition); coniferous tree; drought stress; growth; humidity; osmoregulation; physiological response; phytochemistry; provenance; root; shoot growth; starch; sugar; weight; Chile; Patagonia; Coniferophyta; Pinus contorta; Pinus ponderosa; carbohydrate metabolism; Chile; climate; growth, development and aging; humidity; metabolism; ponderosa pine; tree; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Chile; Climate; Humidity; Pinus ponderosa; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031931765

Which of these fates occur and in what proportion has important implications for the electromagnetic transient associated with the mergers and the expected gravitational wave (GW) signatures, which in turn depend on the high density equation of state (EOS). Here we combine relativistic calculations of NS masses using realistic EOSs with Monte Carlo population synthesis based on the mass distribution of NS binaries in our Galaxy to predict the distribution of fates expected. For many EOSs, a significant fraction of the remnants are NSs or supramassive NSs. This lends support to scenarios in which a quickly spinning, highly magnetized NS may be powering an electromagnetic transient. This also indicates that it will be important for future GW observatories to focus on high frequencies to study the post-merger GW emission. Even in cases where individual GW events are too low in signal to noise to study the post merger signature in detail, the statistics of how many mergers produce NSs versus BHs can be compared with our work to constrain the EOS. To match short gamma-ray-burst (SGRB) X-ray afterglow statistics, we find that the stiffest EOSs are ruled out. Furthermore, many popular EOSs require a significant fraction of ∼60%-70% of SGRBs to be from NS-BH mergers rather than just binary NSs. © 2017. The American Astronomical Society.

This latter is one, or probably the main, reason that pushes the development of HEVs and electric vehicles (EVs). A secondary advantage of HEVs could be to protect the clutch components from overheating problems. For this reason, the electric motor (EM) contribution to reduce overheating of clutch material during the slipping phase has been investigated in this paper. As well known, thermal issue is one of the most important aspects which affect automotive dry clutch systems. In fact, if the clutch material reaches a temperature of 250-300 Celsius degree it could suffer permanent damage as well as to produce a burnt smell perceived by car passengers. Thus, in this paper vehicle launch simulations have been carried out to highlight how the intervention of the electric motor can effectively reduce thermal field during the slipping phase by avoiding to reach critical values. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Clutches; Electric motors; Intelligent mechatronics; Traction motors; Vehicles; Critical value; Dry clutches; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy density; Permanent damage; Thermal damage; Thermal field; Wide diffusion; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028761656

This leads to distinct scaling of the collective coherent emitter-field coupling vs the free space decay as a function of the emitter number. In particular, for subradiant states, the effective cooperativity increases much faster than the typical linear N scaling for independent emitters.

Reducing energy use spans a broad range of technical issues and spatial scales: from building to districts, from cities to rural areas, and from energy power plants to electricity grids. In this frame, the challenge of enhancing energy efficiency can be understood as an extremely relevant topic for planning at the municipal level. Nevertheless, recent studies provide evidence that significant gaps exist in the enhancement of energy efficiency within municipal boundaries. The present research recognises that a comprehensive assessment of municipal energy performances is an essential starting point to facilitate local planning in enhancing energy efficiency. However, how can this challenge be translated into practice and applied to the implementation of local planning? As new models result from the transformation of existing ones, the development of a methodology associated with a case study in Portugal was deemed the most appropriate approach to contribute to knowledge in these fields. The primary objective of this study is to move toward more integrated process of planning for energy efficiency, supporting the definition of priorities and strategies to address energy saving improvements at municipal level. The assessment process involves a statistical analysis that using Geographical Information System, is combined and translated into spatial models to determine needs and set priorities within a Municipal Master Plan review. Based on this top-down approach, it becomes clear that energy efficiency is a cross-cutting issue interrelated with a blend of various disciplines: geography, spatial planning, urbanism, architecture, and civil engineering. The results enable us to understand why municipalities should be called upon to enhance energy efficiency by first looking at a comprehensive energy performance assessment. Embracing the whole municipal territory rather than only urban areas, is key to articulate energy efficiency and geographical, social, environmental and economic factors that are at the core of local planning. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; GIS; Local planning; Municipal energy performances; Municipal master plan review; Spatial models","Carbon; Energy conservation; Geographic information systems; Regional planning; Urban planning; Comprehensive assessment; Comprehensive energy; Energy performance; Local planning; Low-carbon societies; Master plan; Municipal boundaries; Spatial models; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020686772

This is to ensure the minimum supply of biofuels in the domestic market and meet an “indicative target” of 20% blending for biofuels. This policy change will raise concerns about greenhouse gas emissions from land-use changes (LUC) that would be incurred by accelerated production of the biofuel feedstock.

Temperature sensitivity of phenology might be greater in colder, higher latitude sites than in warmer regions, in part because small changes in temperature constitute greater relative changes in thermal balance at colder sites. To test this hypothesis, we examined up to 20 years of phenology data for 47 tundra plant species at 18 high-latitude sites along a climatic gradient. Across all species, the timing of leaf emergence and flowering was more sensitive to a given increase in summer temperature at colder than warmer high-latitude locations. A similar pattern was seen over time for the flowering phenology of a widespread species, Cassiope tetragona. These are among the first results highlighting differential phenological responses of plants across a climatic gradient and suggest the possibility of convergence in flowering times and therefore an increase in gene flow across latitudes as the climate warms. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Arctic; Cassiope tetragona; climate change; climatic gradient; flowering; International Tundra Experiment; latitude; tundra","air temperature; climate change; cold region; environmental gradient; flowering; latitude; phenology; plant; tundra; Arctic; Cassiope tetragona; climate change; cold; plant development; season; temperature; tundra; Climate Change; Cold Temperature; Plant Development; Seasons; Temperature; Tundra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012068022

Results indicate that the current EU climate policy configuration makes GHG reduction more costly than needed. The mitigation targets for 2030 could be achieved at least cost through the implementation of a comprehensive cap-and-trade system instead of the actual emission market segmentation. Moreover, the economic argument on counterproductive overlapping regulation is not corroborated by our results.

In an attempt to help mitigate climate change, these depleted formations are being considered for their long-term CO2 storage potential. Because of the variability in mineral and structural composition from one formation to the next (even within the same region), it is imperative to understand the adsorption behavior of CH4 and CO2 in the context of specific conditions and pore surface chemistry, i.e., relative total organic content (TOC), clay, and surface functionality.This study examines two Eagle Ford shale samples, both recovered from shale that was extracted at depths of approximately 3800 m and having low clay content (i.e., less than 5%) and similar mineral compositions but distinct TOCs (i.e., 2% and 5%, respectively). Experimentally validated models of kerogen were used to the estimate CH4 and CO2 adsorption capacities. The pore size distributions modeled were derived from low-pressure adsorption isotherm data using CO2 and N2 as probe gases for micropores and mesopores, respectively. Given the presence of water in these natural systems, the role of surface chemistry on modeled kerogen pore surfaces was investigated. Several functional groups associated with surface-dissociated water were considered. Pressure conditions from 10 to 50 bar were investigated using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations along with typical outgassing temperatures used in many shale characterization and adsorption studies (i.e., 60 and 250 °C). Both CO2 and N2 were used as probe gases to determine the total pore volume available for gas adsorption spanning pore diameters ranging from 0.3 to 30 nm. The impacts of surface chemistry, outgassing temperature, and the inclusion of nanopores with diameters of less than 1.5 nm were determined for applications of CH4 and CO2 storage from samples of the gas-producing region of the Eagle Ford Shale. At 50 bar and temperatures of 60 and 250 °C, CH4 adsorption increased across all surface chemistries considered by 60% and 2-fold, respectively. In the case of CO2, the surface chemistry played a role at both 10 and 50 bar. For instance, at temperatures of 60 and 250 °C, CO2 adsorption increased across all surface chemistries by 6-fold and just over 2-fold, respectively. It was also found that at both 10 and 50 bar, if too low an outgassing temperature is used, this may lead to a 2-fold underestimation of gas in place. Finally, neglecting to include pores with diameters of less than 1.5 nm has the potential to underestimate pore volume by up to 28%. Taking into consideration these aspects of kerogen and shale characterization in general will lead to improvements in estimating the CH4 and CO2 storage potential of gas shales. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027394130

Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) in combination with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) has been used as a powerful tool for the characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in WWTPs. However, a recent work has revealed the drawback of PARAFAC analysis, i.e., overestimating the component number. A novel method, parallel factor framework-clustering analysis (PFFCA), has been developed in our earlier work to resolve this drawback of PARAFAC. In the present work, both PARAFAC and PFFCAwere used to analyze the EEMs of water samples from a full-scale WWTP from a practical application point of view. The component number and goodness-offit from these two methods were compared and the relationship between the relative score change of component and the actual concentration was investigated to evaluate the estimation error introduced by both methods. PFFCA score and actual concentration exhibited a higher correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.870) compared with PARAFAC (R2&lt;0.771), indicating that PFFCA provided a more accurate relative change estimation than PARAFAC. The results suggest that use of PARAFAC may cause confusion in selecting the component number, while EEM-PFFCA is a more reliable alternative approach for monitoring water quality in WWTPs.[Figure not available: see fulltext]. © 2017, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Excitation-emission matrix (EEM); Parallel factor (PARAFAC); Parallel factor framework-clustering analysis (PFFCA); Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)","Batch reactors; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Factor analysis; Fluorescence; Matrix algebra; Organic compounds; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater treatment; Water quality; Water treatment plants; Clustering analysis; Excitation emission matrices; Fluorescence excitation emission matrix; Municipal wastewater treatment; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; PARAFAC; Sequencing batch reactors; Wastewater treatment plants; Chemicals removal (water treatment)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021657096

To explore more effective emission abatement strategies in industrial cities, a case study was conducted in Baotou to evaluate the current national control measures. The total emissions of SO2 NOX, PM2.5 and NMVOC (non-methane volatile organic compounds) in Baotou were 211.2 Gg, 156.1 Gg, 28.8 Gg, and 48.5 Gg, respectively in 2013, and they would experience a reduction of 30.4%, 26.6%, 15.1%, and 8.7%, respectively in 2017 and 39.0%, 32.0%, 24.4%, and 12.9%, respectively in 2020. The SO2, NOX and PM2.5 emissions from the industrial sector would experience a greater decrease, with reductions of 37%, 32.7 and 24.3%, respectively. From 2013 to 2020, the concentrations of SO2, NO2, and PM2.5 are expected to decline by approximately 30%, 10% and 14.5%, respectively. The reduction rate of SNA (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium) concentrations was significantly higher than that of PM2.5 in 2017, implying that the current key strategy toward controlling air pollutants from the industrial sector is more powerful for SNA. Although air pollution control measures implemented in the industrial sector could greatly reduce total emissions, constraining the emissions from lower sources such as residential coal combustion would be more effective in decreasing the concentration of PM2.5 from 2017 to 2020. These results suggest that even for a typical industrial city, the reduction of PM2.5 concentrations not only requires decreases in emissions from the industrial sector, but also from the low emission sources. The seasonal variation in sulfate concentration also showed that emission from coal-burning is the key factor to control during the heating season. © 2016","Air pollutants; CMAQ; Emission abatement strategies; Emission inventory","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Air quality; Coal combustion; Pollution; Pollution control; Reduction; Sulfur dioxide; Volatile organic compounds; Air pollutants; Air pollution prevention; Air quality improvement; CMAQ; Emission abatement; Emission inventories; Non-methane volatile organic compounds; Residential coal combustions; Industrial emissions; abatement cost; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; emission inventory; environmental economics; industrial emission; particulate matter; Baotou; China; Nei Monggol; air pollutant; nitrogen oxide; particulate matter; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; China; city; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; evaluation study; heating; housing; industry; particulate matter; prevention and control; statistics and numerical data; total quality management; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Policy; Heating; Housing; Industry; Nitrogen Oxides; Particulate Matter; Quality Improvement; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010383595

Through changing the amount ratio of PEG-1500 to AA in the synthesis, we can obtain PEG-CNDs with different functions. For example, due to the thermosensitivity of PEG-1500, the as-prepared PEG1-CNDs exhibit unique temperature sensitivity when the mass ratio of PEG-1500 to AA is 24:1. A reversible change of PEG1-CNDs from the solid state to transparent solution with increasing temperature can be repeated several times. The optical transmittance signal of PEG1-CNDs linearly responds to temperature in the range of 20-65 °C. Besides, while the amount ratio of PEG-1500 to AA is 12:1, the obtained PEG2-CNDs lose thermal sensitivity and form a stable and fluorescent solution at room temperature. The emission of PEG2-CNDs can be quenched by Fe3+, while with the addition of paracetamol (PAR), the fluorescence is recovered because of forming chelates between Fe3+ and PAR. Under the optimized conditions, the linear range of PAR obtained is 0.03-30 μM with a detection limit of 13 nM.

This case study illustrates the exploration process associated with the Guhlen discovery in Brandenburg State, northeastern Germany, from early stage 2D seismic interpretation to a full rock physics study. The first exploration well was drilled in 2012 based on 2D seismic data into a low permeability, hydrocarbon bearing carbonate reservoir. In order to test a hypothesis that seismic could be used as a tool to identify areas of better porosity within the target interval; a 3D seismic survey was acquired. Once processed and interpreted, a pre-stack inversion was performed that identified undrilled areas of low acoustic impedance and Vp/Vs, which were interpreted to represent good porosity areas based on log data analysis.

In A. vinelandii the synthesis of this polymer is regulated by the Gac/Rsm post-transcriptional regulatory system, in which the RsmA protein binds to the mRNA of the biosynthetic algD gene, inhibiting translation. In several Pseudomonas spp. the two-component system CbrA/CbrB has been described to control a variety of metabolic and behavioural traits needed for adaptation to changing environmental conditions. In this work, we show that the A. vinelandii CbrA/CbrB two-component system negatively affects alginate synthesis, a function that has not been described in Pseudomonas aeruginosa or any other Pseudomonas species. CbrA/CbrB was found to control the expression of some alginate biosynthetic genes, mainly algD translation. In agreement with this result, the CbrA/CbrB system was necessary for optimal rsmA expression levels. CbrA/CbrB was also required for maximum accumulation of the sigma factor RpoS. This last effect could explain the positive effect of CbrA/CbrB on rsmA expression, as we also showed that one of the promoters driving rsmA transcription was RpoS-dependent. However, although inactivation of rpoS increased alginate production by almost 100 %, a cbrA mutation increased the synthesis of this polymer by up to 500 %, implying the existence of additional CbrA/CbrB regulatory pathways for the control of alginate production. The control exerted by CbrA/CbrB on the expression of the RsmA protein indicates the central role of this system in regulating carbon metabolism in A. vinelandii. © 2017 The Authors.","AlgD translation; Alginate; Azotobacter; CbrA; RsmA","algd protein; alginic acid; bacterial protein; cbra protein; cbrb protein; complementary DNA; genomic DNA; gusa protein; messenger RNA; restriction endonuclease; rsma protein; rsmz2 protein; sigma factor RpoS; transfer RNA; unclassified drug; alginic acid; bacterial protein; flavoprotein; glucuronic acid; hexuronic acid; transcription factor; Article; Azotobacter vinelandii; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; carbon metabolism; DNA isolation; DNA sequence; Escherichia coli; genetic background; genetic complementation; intracellular signaling; mutagenesis; mutation; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phenotype; plasmid; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; protein processing; regulatory mechanism; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; synthesis; transposon; Western blotting; Azotobacter vinelandii; biosynthesis; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; metabolism; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Alginates; Azotobacter vinelandii; Bacterial Proteins; Flavoproteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Glucuronic Acid; Hexuronic Acids; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018388927

Previous studies suggested that the δ13C of the net land-atmosphere CO2 flux (δsource) varies seasonally as stomatal conductance of plants responds to vapor pressure deficit of air (VPD). We studied the variation of δsource at seven sites across the United States representing forests, grasslands, and an urban center. Using a two-part mixing model, we calculated the seasonal δsource for each site after removing background influence and, when possible, removing δ13C variation of nonlocal sources. Compared to previous analyses, we found a reduced seasonal (March–September) variation in δsource at the forest sites (0.5‰ variation). We did not find a consistent seasonal relationship between VPD and δsource across forest (or other) sites, providing evidence that stomatal response to VPD was not the cause of the global, coherent seasonal pattern in δsource. In contrast to the forest sites, grassland and urban sites had a larger seasonal variation in δsource (5‰) dominated by seasonal transitions in C3/C4 grass productivity and in fossil fuel emissions, respectively. Our findings were sensitive to the location used to account for atmospheric background variation within the mixing model method that determined δsource. Special consideration should be given to background location depending on whether the intent is to understand site level dynamics or regional scale impacts of land-atmosphere exchange. The seasonal amplitude in δ13C of land-atmosphere CO2 exchange (δsource) varied across land cover types and was not driven by seasonal changes in vapor pressure deficit. The largest seasonal amplitudes of δsource were at grassland and urban sites, driven by changes in C3/C4 grass productivity and fossil fuel emissions, respectively. Mixing model approaches may incorrectly calculate δsource when background atmospheric observations are remote and/or prone to anthropogenic influence. ©2017. American Geophysical Union.

Growing interest in the protection of these essential yet vulnerable coastal ecosystems, as well as recognition of their capacity to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide, has led to the need for rapid and accurate quantification of location-specific coastal blue carbon stocks. This study provides allometric equations for the calculation of aboveground dry biomass based on plant height for 18 salt marsh species from Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. The 18 plant species were also analyzed for carbon and nitrogen content to determine the appropriate carbon conversion factor to use for blue carbon calculations. The salt marsh plants had an average of 1.2 ± 0.4% nitrogen and 41.1 ± 5.5% carbon. With the exception of Batis maritima, which had a carbon content of only 23.4%, carbon content for all other species ranged from 33.4–47.1%. The four most succulent plant species in this study contained an average of 33.3 ± 7.0% carbon, while the nine graminoid species contained 44.4 ± 2.0% carbon.

In reef-building corals, the engineers of these ecosystems, this nutrient recycling is facilitated by a constant exchange of nutrients between the animal host and endosymbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae), bacteria, and other microbes. Due to the complex interactions in this so-called coral holobiont, it has proven difficult to understand the environmental limitations of productivity in corals. Among others, the micronutrient iron has been proposed to limit primary productivity due to its essential role in photosynthesis and bacterial processes. Here, we tested the effect of iron enrichment on the physiology of the coral Pocillopora verrucosa from the central Red Sea during a 12-day experiment. Contrary to previous reports, we did not see an increase in zooxanthellae population density or gross photosynthesis. Conversely, respiration rates were significantly increased, and microbial nitrogen fixation was significantly decreased. Taken together, our data suggest that iron is not a limiting factor of primary productivity in Red Sea corals. Rather, increased metabolic demands in response to iron enrichment, as evidenced by increased respiration rates, may reduce carbon (i.e., energy) availability in the coral holobiont, resulting in reduced microbial nitrogen fixation. This decrease in nitrogen supply in turn may exacerbate the limitation of other nutrients, creating a negative feedback loop. Thereby, our results highlight that the effects of iron enrichment appear to be strongly dependent on local environmental conditions and ultimately may depend on the availability of other nutrients. © 2017 The Authors.

Indonesia is one of the largest CO2 emitters, because in 2014, Indonesia's non-renewable energy accounted for 88% of total electricity generation. Its composition does not support government's ambition to slash CO2 emissions by 29% by 2030 if Indonesia continues to build new fossil-base power generation in the future. Furthermore, to reduce CO2 by 29% Indonesia needs to create at least 16 GW new 'carbon-free' power plants by 2030. Based on geographical location/position of Indonesia, current structure of the country energy system lacks base load and energy resources, Indonesia should require a special energy mix design to achieve that target. This paper examines sustainability factors, barriers and technology characteristics of nuclear power and renewables. The analysis indicated clearly that nuclear power and renewables each have important role to be a part of the energy mix design in Indonesia to reduce CO2 emissions. The paper demonstrates that nuclear power is an effective and logical option to be the baseload supply of electricity and renewables for local electricity supply in geographically isolated regions without access to large electric grids, for examples some rural area in Sumatera, Kalimantan, Nusa Tenggara, Sulawesi and Papua. © 2017 IEEE.","CO2 emissions; Energy mix; Nuclear; Renewables","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Energy policy; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Nuclear energy; Population statistics; CO2 emissions; Ecological requirements; Energy mix; Geographical locations; Nuclear; Rapid population growth; Renewables; Technology characteristics; Nuclear fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030162329

A novel aspect of this work is that it is focused on methods other than those involving the pursuit of environmental agreements with other jurisdictions to reduce leakage. In other words, the focus is on unilateral measures to reduce such leakage. A number of different approaches including the proper selection of the type of policy instrument and policy ramp up, improved targeting of polluting activities, targeting lifecycle emissions and adoption of additional leakage-specific policies that complement the main policy have been suggested in specific yet different policy arenas. There does not, however, appear to be an understanding of the common and distinct features of the different types of responses and the multiple approaches that might be appropriate in any specific policy context. To this end, this article synthesizes and differentiates the different approaches based on whether leakage is being mitigated ex ante or in media res and at the national or provincial level, on the tangibility of policy makers’ efforts to control leakage, on the level of burden placed on regulated polluters, and on the required level of precision in the estimates of leakage.

We find that a significant intrinsic Beff was present in all Type 1 AGNs in our sample. Moreover, we do not see strong differences in intrinsic Beff slopes in different types of AGNs, which probably have different physical properties such as inclination, broad line region (BLR) geometry, or accretion rate. Additionally, we find that the intrinsic Beff was not connected with the global Beff, which, instead, could not be detected in the broad Hα or Hβ emission lines. In the case of NGC 4151, the detected variation of the Beff slope could be due to the change in the site of line formation in the BLR. Finally, the intrinsic Beff might be caused by the additional optical continuum component that is not part of the ionization continuum. © ESO, 2017.","Galaxies: active; Galaxies: Seyfert; Quasars: emission lines; Quasars: general","Electromagnetic wave emission; Active galactic nuclei; Broad line region; Galaxies : active; Galaxies: seyfert; Ionization continuum; Optical continuum; Quasars: emission line; Quasars: general; Galaxies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022189789

Modern highways play a vital role in increasing the agglomeration benefits of commuters by reducing the travel time, emission levels, fuel consumption, travel fatigue, etc. With the recent progresses on intelligent transport systems (ITS) and vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET), new revolutionizing highway transportation solution proposals are getting released at rapid pace. Vehicular platooning is an emerging research area which tackles common traffic problems via cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) techniques by keeping minimal inter vehicular distances using autonomous methods. In this paper, we select the Southern Expressway (E01 Expressway) located in Sri Lanka as our study region and propose a cooperative vehicle platooning solution which performs better on selected comparison parameters than the non-cooperative methods. Since experimenting our solution directly on real traffic environments will introduce significant disturbances in usual traffic flow, we have followed the simulation procedure for evaluations. For our study, we have used PLEXE an open source simulation framework which extends VEINS vehicular network simulator and SUMO microscopic traffic simulator features.

Provisioning of part of this biomass by dedicated biomass crops becomes an option. This chapter presents yields and cost levels that can be reached in Europe with different perennial crops in different climatic, soil, and management situations. The AquaCrop model developed by FAO was used and fed with phenological parameters per crop and detailed weather data to simulate the crop growth in all European NUTS3 regions. Yield levels were simulated for a maximum and a water limited yield situation and further converted to match with low, medium, and high input management systems. Low input systems are suitable for the lower quality soils often characterized as ""marginal"" because of their low suitability to be used for annual (rotational) cropping. In addition, suitability maps specific per crop were prepared according to important limiting factors such as killing frost, length of growing season, and slope. The cost productions were assessed with an activity-based costing (ABC) model, developed to assess the roadside Net Present Value (NPV) cost per ton of biomass. The yield, crop suitability, and cost simulation results were then combined to identify the best performing crop-management mix per region. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

India is a major developing economy and the economic growth is driven by ever-increasing consumption of energy. Coal is the only fossil fuel that is available in abundance in India and contributes to the major share of the total primary energy supply (TPES) in the country. Owing to the large unmet demand for affordable energy, primarily driven by the need for infrastructure development and increasing incomes and aspirations of people, as well as the energy security concerns, India is expected to have continued dependence on coal. Coal is not only the backbone of the electric power generation, but many major industries like cement, iron and steel, bricks, fertilizers also consume large quantities of coal. India has very low carbon emissions (∼ 1.5 tCO2 per capita) as compared to the world average (4.7 tCO2 per capita) and the developed world (11.2 tCO2 per capita). Although the aggregate emissions of the country are increasing with the rising population and fossil energy use, India has a very little contribution to the historical GHG accumulation in the atmosphere linked to the climate change problem. However, a large fraction of the Indian society is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change - due to its geographical location, large dependence on monsoon-based agriculture and limited technical, financial and institutional capacity. Today, India holds a large potential to offer cost-effective carbon mitigation to tackle the climate change problem. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is the process of extraction of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) from industrial and energy related sources, transport to storage locations and long-term isolation from the atmosphere. It is a technology that has been developed in recent times and is considered as a bridging technology as we move towards carbon-neutral energy sources in response to the growing concerns about climate change problem. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is being considered as a promising carbon mitigation technology, especially for large point sources such as coal power plants. Gasification of coal helps in better utilization of this resource offering multiple advantages such as pollution prevention, product flexibility (syngas and hydrogen) and higher efficiency (combined cycle). It also enables the capture of CO2 prior to the combustion, from the fuel gas mixture, at relatively lesser cost as compared to the post-combustion CO2 capture. CCS in gasification projects is considered as a promising technology for cost-effective carbon mitigation. Although many projects (power and non-power) have been announced internationally, very few large-scale projects have actually come up. This paper looks at the various aspects of CCS applications in gasification projects, including the technical feasibility and economic viability and discusses an Indian perspective. Impacts of including CCS in gasification projects (e.g. IGCC plants) have been assessed using a simulation tool. Integrated Environmental Control Model (IECM) - a modelling framework to simulate power plants - has been used to estimate the implications of adding CCS units in IGCC plants, on their performance and costs. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbonization; Cement industry; Climate change; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal deposits; Coal gasification; Coal storage; Combustion; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economics; Electric power generation; Energy security; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Consumption of energy; Developing economies; Environmental control; Geographical locations; Global climate changes; Infrastructure development; Institutional capacities; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028067812

The metallurgical, microstructural and mechanical properties investigation of four types of DMW joints between SA508Gr.3Cl.1 (low alloy steel) and SS304LN (stainless steel) using an intermediate layer of Ni-Fe alloy in buttering as a graded composition have been carried out. The graded compositions and carbon diffusivities governs the microstructure in buttering deposits and that could directly affect the mechanical properties of the weld joints. These behaviours were investigated and explained in connection with the microstructural features those were changed due to mixed (graded) weld chemistry. The weld chemistry variations due Ni-Fe layer have significantly affects the distortion behaviour of the joints. The graded composition and associated carbon diffusivities due to Ni-Fe layers have confirmed the positive changes in the yield strength mismatch behaviour, plastic instability strength, tensile properties, interfacial properties and metallurgical properties. The measure of yield strength ratio has been modified in accordance to the distinctive regions in the dissimilar metal joints.

Even at early points in a monitoring program, identifying climate covariates of population density can suggest vulnerabilities to future change. Monitoring landbird populations in parks during the breeding season brings the added benefit of allowing a comparative approach to inference across a large suite of species with diverse requirements. For example, comparing resident and migratory species that vary in exposure to non-park habitats can reveal the relative importance of park effects, such as those related to local climate. We monitored landbirds using breeding-season point-count data collected during 2005–2014 in three wilderness areas of the Pacific Northwest (Mount Rainier, North Cascades, and Olympic National Parks). For 39 species, we estimated recent trends in population density while accounting for individual detection probability using Bayesian hierarchical N-mixture models. Our analyses integrated several recent developments in N-mixture modeling, incorporating interval and distance sampling to estimate distinct components of detection probability while also accommodating count intervals of varying duration, annual variation in the length and number of point-count transects, spatial autocorrelation, random effects, and covariates of detection and density. As covariates of density, we considered metrics of precipitation and temperature hypothesized to affect breeding success. We also considered effects of park and elevational stratum on trend. Regardless of model structure, we estimated stable or increasing densities during 2005–2014 for most populations. Mean trends across species were positive for migrants in every park and for residents in one park. A recent snowfall deficit in this region might have contributed to the positive trend, because population density varied inversely with precipitation-as-snow for both migrants and residents. Densities varied directly but much more weakly with mean spring temperature. Our approach exemplifies an analytical framework for estimating trends from point-count data, and for assessing the role of climatic and other spatiotemporal variables in driving those trends. Understanding population trends and the factors that drive them is critical for adaptive management and resource stewardship in the context of climate change. © 2017 Ray et al.","Avian trends; Bayesian hierarchical models; Climate change; Detection probability; Monitoring; Mount Rainier National Park; North Cascades National Park Service Complex; Olympic National Park; Point-count analysis; Population density; Special Feature: Science for Our National Parks’ Second Century",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026916661

The most notable types of renewable energies are solar energy and wind energy, whose popularity comes from their prominent features such as cost-effectiveness, stability and easy utilization. The objective of this paper is to perform a technical–economic analysis on combined utilization of solar and wind power in two cities of Qom and Yazd, to conduct a feasibility study on the construction of clean energy producing power plants in these locations. To achieve this objective, we first gather the required data from the national meteorological organization, and then use Homer software to perform technical and economic analyses on the two considered sites. Solar and wind analyses on Qom and Yazd show that both cities have great potential in solar energy generation, but wind speed data indicate that only Qom has the wind characteristics appropriate for wind power generation. Overall, these results indicate that investments on solar energy sector of both cities will be economically justified, but only Qom has the wind characteristics required to make investments on its wind energy sector economic. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 1194–1207, 2017. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog","feasibility study; Homer software; renewable energy; solar and wind energy; technical–economic analysis","Cost effectiveness; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Planning; Solar energy; Wind; Wind effects; Wind power; Feasibility studies; Homer softwares; Renewable energies; Solar and wind energies; Technical-economic analysis; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011048600

Anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM) is recognized as a strong regulator of marine methane emissions and appreciation of AOM’s importance in freshwater is growing. In spite of this renewed interest, recent work and reactive-transport modeling results we present in this paper point to unresolved pathways for AOM. Comparison of recent observations from a eutrophic reservoir, Lacamas Lake, with predictions of a 1D steady-state model of water column methane dynamics indicates that high rates of methane oxidation measured via bottle assays cannot be explained with conventional electron acceptors (O2, NO2 −, NO3 −, SO4 2−, Mn4+, and Fe3+). Reactive-transport modeling suggests that solute oxidant concentrations at the thermocline would have to be around 10 times higher than observed to explain the measured methane consumption. Organic acids—a major constituent of organic matter—may account for part of this unexplained AOM given their abundance in eutrophic systems, although the details of these pathways remain elusive (e.g., which species are involved, seasonal renewal of reduced species, contribution of particulate versus dissolved phases). We point to several observations consistent with organic acid-mediated AOM, both in Lacamas Lake and in other systems. Nevertheless, direct evidence of this pathway is still lacking and testing for this remains an important direction for future work. To this end, we identify several new avenues of research that would help quantify the role of organic acid-mediated AOM relative to other electron acceptors. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Anaerobic; AQDS; Lake; Methane oxidation; Organic acids; Reactive transport modeling","air-water interaction; anoxic conditions; biogeochemical cycle; lacustrine environment; methane; organic acid; organic matter; oxidation; reactive transport; reservoir",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021847195

These are typically applied to land, however, a critical comparison of their impact on soil quality and carbon (C) cycling is lacking. To address this, we generated biochar (450 °C) and wood ash (870 °C) from the same mixed hardwood feedstock and added it to an agricultural grassland at comparable rates under both laboratory and field conditions (10 t ha−1 and 571 kg ha−1 for BC and WA, respectively). We hypothesized that alkaline, nutrient-rich wood ash would stimulate microbial activity, resulting in the loss of soil organic matter (SOM), while biochar which is recalcitrant to microbial attack would promote the stabilization of native SOM. The effects on the soil microbial community and soil C and N cycling were determined over 1 year. Overall, biochar promoted soil quality by enhancing nutrient availability (P and K), moisture retention and increasing soil C content. However, it was also associated with an increase in below-ground CO2 loss. As plant productivity was unaffected and laboratory incubations of biochar with 14C-labelled SOM showed no indication of priming, we deduce that this CO2 originates from the biochar itself. This is supported by the lack of effect of biochar on soil N cycling, microbial biomass and community structure. Wood ash had almost no effect on either soil quality or vegetation quality (yield and foliar nutrient content) under field conditions but did induce negative SOM priming under both laboratory and field conditions. We conclude that when applied at field-relevant rates, neither amendment had a detrimental effect on native SOM cycling. While wood ash promotes the retention of native SOM, biochar may be a better strategy for enhancing SOM levels because of its intrinsic recalcitrant character, however, this needs to be offset against the reduced amount of energy derived from pyrolysis in comparison to incineration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Black carbon; Charcoal; Life cycle assessment; Nutrient cycling; PLFA","Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Carbon dioxide; Charcoal; Forestry; Incineration; Life cycle; Nutrients; Organic compounds; Productivity; Pyrolysis; Soils; Stabilization; Wood; Agricultural grasslands; Black carbon; Grassland productivity; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Nutrient availability; Nutrient cycling; PLFA; Soil microbial community; Hardwoods; biological production; black carbon; carbon cycle; charcoal; comparative study; fatty acid; grassland; life cycle analysis; microbial activity; nutrient availability; nutrient cycling; soil organic matter; soil quality; wood ash; Ash; Carbon Black; Charcoal; Life Cycle Assessment; Organic Matter; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016274535

Monitored parameters include all, or some of the following: partial pressure of CO2 of the water (pCO2w) and air, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA), and pH. Any combination of at least two of the aforementioned parameters can be used to calculate the others. In this study at the Gray's Reef (GR) mooring in the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) we: examine the internal consistency of pCO2w from underway cruise, moored autonomous time series, and calculated from bottle samples (DIC-TA pairing); describe the seasonal to interannual pCO2w time series variability and air-sea flux (FCO2), as well as describe the potential sources of pCO2w variability; and determine the source/sink for atmospheric pCO2.

Polarization measurements of dust grains aligned with the magnetic field direction are an established technique for tracing largescale field structures. In this paper we present a case study to investigate the conditions that need to be met to detect a characteristic magnetic field substructure that is embedded in such a large-scale field. A helical magnetic field with a surrounding hourglass-shaped field is expected from theoretical predictions and self-consistent magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to be present in the specific case of protostellar outflows. Hence, such an outflow environment is the perfect environment for our study. Methods. We present synthetic polarization maps in the infrared and millimeter regime of simulations of protostellar outflows. The simulations were performed with the newly developed radiative transfer and polarization code POLARIS. The code is the first to include a self-consistent description of various alignment mechanisms such as the imperfect Davis-Greenstein (IDG) and the radiative torque (RAT) alignment. We investigated the effects of the grain size distribution, inclination, and applied alignment mechanism. Results. We find that the IDG mechanism cannot produce any measurable polarization degree (≥1%), whereas the RAT alignment produced polarization degrees of a few percent. Furthermore, we developed a method for identifying the origin of the polarization. We show that the helical magnetic field in the outflow can only be observed close to the outflow axis and at its tip, whereas in the surrounding regions the hourglass field in the foreground dominates the polarization. Furthermore, the polarization degree in the outflow lobe is lower than in the surroundings, in agreement with observations. We also find that the orientation of the polarization vector flips around at about a few hundred micrometers because of the transition from dichroic extinction to thermal re-emission. In order to avoid ambiguities when interpreting polarization data, we therefore suggest to observe in the far-infrared and millimeter regime. The actual grain size distribution has only little effect on the emerging polarization maps. Finally, we show that it is possible to observe the polarized radiation emerging from protostellar outflows with ALMA. © ESO 2017.","Galaxies: ISM; ISM: jets and outflows; Methods: numerical; Radiative transfer; Techniques: polarimetric","Dust; Grain size and shape; Magnetic fields; Magnetism; Magnetohydrodynamics; Numerical methods; Radiative transfer; Rats; Size distribution; Stars; Galaxies: ISM; Grain size distribution; ISM: jets and out flow; Magnetic field direction; Methods: numericals; Polarization measurements; Self-consistent description; Techniques: polarimetric; Polarization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023640407

Particle introduced through outdoor air supply (OA) system was the most significant contributor to indoor PM2.5. In most cases, the OA systems of the six office buildings could not provide enough protection for staff. The first reason was the insufficient filtration efficiency of the OA system for PM2.5 due to filter bypass and design shortage. The tested filtration efficiency of the OA system for PM2.5 ranged from 17.0 ± 0.9% to 55.7 ± 2.8%. The gaps between the tested and rated filtration efficiencies ranged from 4.4% to 26.3%. The gaps between the rated and required filtration efficiencies ranged from 7.4% to 64.5%. The second reason was the superfluous outdoor air supply rate. The outdoor air supply rates per staff could reach 7.5 L/s to 12.8 L/s with the operating OA systems, much higher than the ASHRAE guideline. Five control strategies (including higher level filters, minimum outdoor air supply rates, portable air cleaners and combinations of these options) were proposed for HVAC system to reduce indoor PM2.5 concentration level to 35 μg/m3. The reduced indoor PM2.5 exposure per power under strategy 2 (minimum outdoor air supply rate + higher level filters) was the highest in all cases. The total energy consumption of HVAC systems under strategy 2 was only 42%-71% of the current energy consumption. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Commercial office building; Control strategy; Energy consumption; Filtration efficiency; Indoor PM2.5 exposure","Air cleaners; Climate control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Office buildings; Passive filters; Chinese cities; Concentration levels; Control strategies; Energy-saving control; Filtration efficiency; Fine particles; Indoor PM2.5 exposure; Total energy consumption; Air filters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020049522

Projections show increasing mean temperatures by up to 4.5 °C compared to pre-industrial by the end of this century across LAC. Associated physical impacts include altered precipitation regimes, a strong increase in heat extremes, higher risks of droughts and increasing aridity. Moreover, the mean intensity of tropical cyclones, as well as the frequency of the most intense storms, is projected to increase while sea levels are expected to rise by ~0.2–1.1 mm depending on warming level and region. Tropical glacier volume is found to decrease substantially, with almost complete deglaciation under high warming levels. The much larger glaciers in the southern Andes are less sensitive to warming and shrink on slower timescales. Runoff is projected to be reduced in Central America, the southern Amazon basin and southernmost South America, while river discharge may increase in the western Amazon basin and in the Andes in the wet season. However, in many regions, there is uncertainty in the direction of these changes as a result of uncertain precipitation projections and differences in hydrological models. Climate change will also reduce agricultural yields, livestock and fisheries, although there may be opportunities such as increasing rice yield in several LAC countries or higher fish catch potential in the southernmost South American waters. Species range shifts threaten terrestrial biodiversity, and there is a substantial risk of Amazon rainforest degradation with continuing warming. Coral reefs are at increasing risk of annual bleaching events from 2040 to 2050 onwards irrespective of the climate scenario. These physical and biophysical climate change impacts challenge human livelihoods through, e.g., decreasing income from fisheries, agriculture or tourism. Furthermore, there is evidence that human health, coastal infrastructures and energy systems are also negatively affected. This paper concludes that LAC will be severely affected by climate change, even under lower levels of warming, due to the potential for impacts to occur simultaneously and compound one another. © 2015, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank.","Development; Global change; Poverty; Projections; Scenarios; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945572030

Case studies demonstrate that complex terrain, which accounts for more than 50% of Earth's land surface, can affect ecological processes associated with land-atmosphere carbon fluxes. However, no studies have addressed the role of complex terrain in mediating ecophysiological responses of land-atmosphere carbon fluxes to climate variables. We synthesized data from AmeriFlux towers and found that for sites in complex terrain, responses of ecosystem CO2 fluxes to temperature and precipitation are organized according to terrain slope and drainage area, variables associated with water and energy availability. Specifically, we found that for tower sites in complex terrain, mean topographic slope and drainage area surrounding the tower explained between 51% and 78% of site-to-site variation in the response of CO2 fluxes to temperature and precipitation depending on the time scale. We found no such organization among sites in flat terrain, even though their flux responses exhibited similar ranges. These results challenge prevailing conceptual framework in terrestrial ecosystem modeling that assumes that CO2 fluxes derive from vertical soil-plant-climate interactions. We conclude that the terrain in which ecosystems are situated can also have important influences on CO2 responses to temperature and precipitation. This work has implications for about 14% of the total land area of the conterminous U.S. This area is considered topographically complex and contributes to approximately 15% of gross ecosystem carbon production in the conterminous U.S. ©2017.

Despite the major role played by large-scale mining (LSM) in the mineral sector, artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) also participates in the mining market and plays a crucial social role mainly in developing countries through assuring livelihoods for a great number of people. Both LSM and ASM can cause negative environmental and health impacts. Certification has been in focus for the LSM, following good practices and standards especially to improve health and safety performance. For ASM these issues still constitute a challenge. In some successful cases as corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports demonstrate, health, safety, and environment (HSE) impacts have been addressed through cooperation between LSM and ASM, which can benefit communities as a whole. A question guiding our research was whether there is potential for ASM gold mining certification to be a tool for achieving a win-win outcome within the gold mining sector, and for mercury emission reduction as proposed by the Minamata Convention. Brazilian ASM certification could become a market trend that would receive support from LSM towards the use of cleaner technologies and mining industry better practices? To answer that overarching question, our methodology included a review of CSR reports produced by LSM operating in Brazil and a comparison to their CSR initiatives worldwide. Field interviews with ASM miners were also undertaken. The results from LSM and ASM cooperation are classified with regard to types of initiatives to improve good practices guidance and promotion of sustainable development partnerships. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Artisanal and small-scale mining; ASM; Certification; Corporate social responsibility; Large-scale mining; LSM; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028033088

Several synthetic jet fuels have been developed including sustainable biokerosene, a low-carbon fuel. Over the last years, the technical feasibility as well as the compatibility of alternative jet fuels with today's planes has been proven However, when burning a jet fuel, the exhaust gases are a mixture of many species, going beyond CO2 and water (H2O) emissions, with nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) including aromatic species and further precursors of particles and soot among them. These emissions have an impact on the local air quality as well as on the climate (particles, soot, contrails). Therefore, a detailed knowledge and understanding of the emission patterns when burning synthetic aviation fuels are inevitable. In the present paper, these issues are addressed by studying numerically the combustion of four synthetic jet fuels (Fischer-Tropsch fuels). For reference, two types of crude-oil-based kerosene (Jet A-1 and Jet A) are considered, too. Plug flow calculations were performed by using a detailed chemical-kinetic model validated previously. The composition of the multicomponent jet fuels was imaged by using the surrogate approach. Calculations were done for relevant temperatures, pressures, residence times, and fuel equivalence ratios φ. Results are discussed for NOx, CO as well as for benzene and acetylene as major soot precursors. According to the predictions, the NOx and CO emissions are within about ±10% for all fuels considered, within the parameter range studied: T = 1800 K, T = 2200 K; 0.25 ≤ φ ≤ 1.8; p = 40 bar; t = 3 ms. The aromatics free GtL (gas to liquid) fuel displayed higher NOx values compared to Jet A-1/A. In addition, synthetic fuels show slightly lower (better) CO emission data than Jet A-1/A. The antagonist role of CO and NOx is apparent. Major differences were predicted for benzene emissions, depending strongly on the aromatics content in the specific fuel, with lower levels predicted for the synthetic aviation fuels. Acetylene levels show a similar, but less pronounced, effect.

Which genus expands most into tundra landscapes will determine ecosystem properties. We show that Alnus and Salix shrubs segregate thermal space (elevation × insolation) and colonize tundra landscapes differently in response to climate warming, thereby replacing different tundra types. Vegetative change estimated from repeat photography should account for hill-slope. Methodologically, slope determines surface area estimated from orthophotos as projected pixel area times secant of pixel slope. Ecologically, the change in thermally responsive vegetative area is sensitive to terrain steepness, scaling as the cosecant of hill-slope, so that studies should expect more shrub expansion in areas of shallow slopes than steep slopes. Repeat aerial photography in Alaska's Chugach Mountains from 1972 to 2012 orthorectified on a high-resolution lidar digital elevation model indicated tall Salix was rare in 1972 and colonized warmer slopes by 2012. Tall Alnus colonized steeper, cooler slopes both by 2012 and by 1972. Salix and forest colonized similar thermal space. Colonization probability for both shrub genera was maximized at intermediate elevations. Alnus colonization adjacent to dwarf-shrub tundra was twenty times as likely as Salix colonization. Salix colonization adjacent to low-shrub/herbaceous tundra was three times as likely as Alnus colonization. Replacement of dwarf-shrub tundra by Alnus and of low-shrub/herbaceous communities by Salix will affect herbivores and soil properties. Good agreement between observations of plant functional type and multinomial predictions in a thermal space defined by elevation and insolation suggested that these two variables were sufficient for forecast modelling. Spatially explicit, climate-driven generalized linear multinomial and random forest classification models in available thermal space forecast surface areas of forest, Alnus, Salix and tundra over a range of warming, modelled as upward shifted isotherms, including expected IPCC scenarios. Both modelling approaches indicated that shrubs may respond nonlinearly to warming. Synthesis. The provision of taxon-specific coefficients for climate-driven, spatially explicit models using high-resolution digital elevation models is necessary for accurately forecasting vegetative change due to climate warming in montane and arctic regions. © 2017 The Authors.

Therefore, we tested how relevant EAs (SO42-, NO3-, Fe3+, Mn4+, O2) affect CH4 production and oxidation in the sediments of two shallow boreal lakes. The changes induced to microbial communities by the addition of Fe3+ and Mn4+ were studied using next-generation sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA and methyl-coenzyme M reductase (mcrA) genes and mcrA transcripts. Putative anaerobic CH4-oxidizing archaea (ANME-2D) and bacteria (NC 10) were scarce (up to 3.4% and 0.5% of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes, respectively), likely due to the low environmental stability associated with shallow depths. Consequently, the potential anaerobic CH4 oxidation (0-2.1 nmol g-1dry weight (DW)d-1) was not enhanced by the addition of EAs, nor important in consuming the produced CH4 (0.6-82.5 nmol g-1DWd-1). Instead, the increased EA availability suppressed CH4 production via the outcompetition of methanogens by anaerobically respiring bacteria and via the increased protection of organic matter from microbial degradation induced by Fe3+ and Mn4+. Future studies could particularly assess whether anaerobic CH4 oxidation has any ecological relevance in reducing CH4 emissions from the numerous CH4-emitting shallow lakes in boreal and tundra landscapes. © FEMS 2017.

The impacts of coastal flooding are also expected to increase in the future as a consequence of global climate change and sea-level rise. This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of the potential risks raised by storm surge and sea-level rise on multiple coastal targets (i.e., population, buildings, infrastructures, agriculture, natural and semi-natural environments and cultural heritage) in the Northern Adriatic coast in Italy. Through the assessment of hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk, a Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology allowed identifying and prioritizing hot-spot risk areas and targets requiring particular attention for the definition of adaptation strategies. Hazard scenarios were based on the analysis of tide gauge data (elaborated with the Joint Probability Method) and of different sea-level rise projections for the year 2100. Geographical-information analysis was then used to characterize vulnerability patterns of exposed natural and human systems and to make a spatial ranking of risks. Maps produced for the worst scenario showed that beaches are the target at higher risk (with more than 90% of the surface in the higher relative risk class) due to the low elevation and high proximity to the coastline. Also cultural heritage (i.e., villas, historical buildings and roads) and wetlands are highly threatened by storm surge flooding. The relative risks will be lower (i.e., between 25% and 40% of their surface/length in the higher relative risk class) for most of the other receptors (i.e., local roads, railways, natural and semi-natural environments and agricultural areas), including population and buildings that are mostly classified in lower risk classes. The overall results of the assessment, including maps and risk metrics, can be useful to rise the attention of coastal managers about the need to adapt to climate change, developing climate-proof policies and programs for the sustainable management of coastal zones. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change; Joint probability method; Regional risk assessment; Sea-level rise; Storm surge","adaptive management; climate change; coastal zone management; environmental policy; flood damage; flooding; global climate; hazard assessment; risk assessment; sea level change; storm surge; Adriatic Coast [Italy]; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019249543

These so-called megaprojects have allowed Gulf governments to both brand their nations globally and compete regionally and internationally with other global economic centers. However, as oil-rich Gulf countries have attempted to diversify their revenue stream away from fossil fuels, a new urban typology has emerged in their capitals to facilitate the transition to the knowledge-intensive economy. In continuity with previous research on megaprojects in the Gulf and Asian countries, we have called this new typology Knowledge Megaprojects (KMs). In this paper, by using as a reference point for comparisons the existing literature on knowledge developments in the West, we set to exemplify KMs in the Gulf region by analyzing the case of Education City—a large knowledge campus being developed by the Qatari government in Doha. One main result of this study is that KMs replicate the same shortcomings of other more mundane, extravagant megaprojects and thus are unlikely to provide the right urban setting to foster a sustainable transition to the post-carbon economy in the Gulf. © 2017 The Society of Urban Technology.","Gulf Region; International Branch Campus; Knowledge megaprojects; knowledge-based urban development; post-carbon economy","development project; education; government; knowledge; nation state; urban development; urban economy; Qatar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019072492

Existing literature, however, often focuses on single measures without considering that policies are usually bundles of different measures addressing multiple non-marketed goods and services. Thus, interaction effects of a set of policies in a given policy mix may influence the cost-effectiveness of single measures. Recently, Swiss agricultural policy was redesigned using the Tinbergen rule as its basis, i.e., a single measure for each policy goal, including additional targeted direct payments. This facilitates testing for interaction effects of multiple targeted AEMs. Here we use a social-ecological, agent-based modelling framework to assess interaction effects of these agricultural policies while accounting for climate change impacts in our analysis. The results from our case study in a mountain region show that ecosystem service provision increases with targeted payments. However, interaction effects of the different targeted policies affect the provision levels of all goods and services. In particular, changes at the extensive margin, i.e., the total amount of land that is under production, largely determine the amount of ecosystem services provided. Thus, climate change driven productivity increases and policies that keep land in production may substantially support the provision of non-marketed goods and services in marginal agricultural production regions with a high potential for land abandonment. Consequently, the effectiveness of targeted policy measures should also consider changes at the extensive margin and be assessed in the context of bundles or portfolios of different policy measures. © 2017","Agent-based modelling; Agri-environmental measures; Biodiversity conservation; Ecosystem services; Mountain region; Non-marketed goods and services; Targeting","agricultural policy; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; computer simulation; ecosystem service; mountain; targeting; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018763019

Lakes, in response to these changes, are experiencing increases in both summer temperatures and ice-free days. We used continuous records of lake surface temperature and air temperature to create statistical models of daily mean lake surface temperature to assess thermal changes in mountain lakes. These models were combined with downscaled climate projections to predict future thermal conditions for 27 high-elevation lakes in the southern Rocky Mountains. The models predict a 0.25°Cdecade-1 increase in mean annual lake surface temperature through the 2080s, which is greater than warming rates of streams in this region. Most striking is that on average, ice-free days are predicted to increase by 5.9 days decade-1, and summer mean lake surface temperature is predicted to increase by 0.47°Cdecade-1. Both could profoundly alter the length of the growing season and potentially change the structure and function of mountain lake ecosystems.

In DJ, Uintah, and FV, 72-83% of total measured emissions were from 20% of the well pads, while in UGR the highest 20% of emitting well pads only contributed 54% of total emissions. The total mass of methane emitted as a percent of gross methane produced, termed throughput-normalized methane average (TNMA) and determined by bootstrapping measurements from each basin, varied widely between basins and was (95% CI): 0.09% (0.05-0.15%) in FV, 0.18% (0.12-0.29%) in UGR, 2.1% (1.1-3.9%) in DJ, and 2.8% (1.0-8.6%) in Uintah. Overall, wet-gas basins (UGR, DJ, Uintah) had higher TNMA emissions than the dry-gas FV at all ranges of production per well pad. Among wet basins, TNMA emissions had a strong negative correlation with average gas production per well pad, suggesting that consolidation of operations onto single pads may reduce normalized emissions (average number of wells per pad is 5.3 in UGR versus 1.3 in Uintah and 2.8 in DJ).

Due to the fluctuating nature of RESs, it is necessary to install more wind and photovoltaics (PVs) generation in terms of nominal power than would otherwise be required in order to ensure that the power demand can always be met. In a near fully RES-based energy system, there will be times when there is an inadequate conventional load to meet the overcapacity of RESs, which will lead to demand regularly being exceeded and thereby a surplus. One approach to making productive use of this surplus, which would lead to a holistic transformation of all sectors, is ""sector coupling"" (SC). This paper describes the general principles behind this concept and develops a working definition intended to be of utility to the international scientific community. Furthermore, a literature review provides an overview of relevant scientific papers on the topic. Due to the challenge of distinguishing between papers with or without SC, the approach adopted here takes the German context as a case study that can be applied to future reviews with an international focus.

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), perhaps the most utilized VI, has countless applications across ecology, forestry, agriculture, wildlife, biodiversity, and other disciplines. Calculating satellite derived NDVI is not always straight-forward, however, as satellite remote sensing datasets are inherently noisy due to cloud and atmospheric contamination, data processing failures, and instrument malfunction. Readily available NDVI products that account for these complexities are generally at coarse resolution; high resolution NDVI datasets are not conveniently accessible and developing them often presents numerous technical and methodological challenges. We address this deficiency by producing a Landsat derived, high resolution (30 m), long-term (30+ years) NDVI dataset for the conterminous United States. We use Google Earth Engine, a planetary-scale cloud-based geospatial analysis platform, for processing the Landsat data and distributing the final dataset. We use a climatology driven approach to fill missing data and validate the dataset with established remote sensing products at multiple scales. We provide access to the composites through a simple web application, allowing users to customize key parameters appropriate for their application, question, and region of interest. © 2017 by the authors.","Google Earth Engine; Landsat; NDVI; Phenology; Remote sensing; Surface reflectance; Vegetation index","Biodiversity; Data handling; Ecology; Ecosystems; Engines; Forestry; Image segmentation; Remote sensing; Satellites; Google earths; LANDSAT; NDVI; Phenology; Surface reflectance; Vegetation index; Vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028421970

However, the mechanism of FDH catalysis is currently under debate, and whether the primary Mo coordination sphere remains saturated or one of the ligands dissociates to allow direct substrate binding during turnover is disputed. Herein, we describe how oxidation-state-dependent changes at the active site alter its inhibitor binding properties. Using protein film electrochemistry, we show that formate oxidation by EcFDH-H is inhibited strongly and competitively by N3-, OCN-, SCN-, NO2-, and NO3-, whereas CO2 reduction is inhibited only weakly and not competitively. During catalysis, the Mo center cycles between the formal Mo(VI) - S and Mo(IV) - SH states, and by modeling chronoamperometry data recorded at different potentials and substrate and inhibitor concentrations, we demonstrate that both formate oxidation and CO2 reduction are inhibited by selective inhibitor binding to the Mo(VI) - S state. The strong dependence of inhibitor-binding affinity on both Mo oxidation state and inhibitor electron-donor strength indicates that inhibitors (and substrates) bind directly to the Mo center. We propose that inhibitors bind to the Mo following dissociation of a selenocysteine ligand to create a vacant coordination site for catalysis and close by considering the implications of our data for the mechanisms of formate oxidation and CO2 reduction. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Binding energy; Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Chronoamperometry; Electron affinity; Escherichia coli; Ligands; Oxidation; Reduction; Substrates; Binding properties; Coordination sites; Coordination sphere; Formate dehydrogenase; Inhibitor concentration; Reversible reduction; Selective inhibitors; Strong dependences; Molybdenum compounds; carbon dioxide; formate dehydrogenase; selenocysteine; coordination compound; formate dehydrogenase; formic acid derivative; molybdenum; Article; binding affinity; catalysis; chemical model; concentration (parameters); electrochemistry; enzyme active site; enzyme binding; IC50; oxidation; reduction (chemistry); substrate concentration; binding site; chemistry; enzyme active site; enzymology; Escherichia coli; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; Binding Sites; Carbon Dioxide; Catalytic Domain; Coordination Complexes; Escherichia coli; Formate Dehydrogenases; Formates; Molybdenum; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026297709

Recent interactome findings suggested that HPr interacts with several carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, but whether HPr plays a regulatory role was unclear. Here, we provide evidence that HPr interacts with a large number of proteins in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate HPr-dependent allosteric regulation of the activities of pyruvate kinase (PykF, but not PykA), phosphofructokinase (PfkB, but not PfkA), glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (NagB), and adenylate kinase (Adk). HPr is either phosphorylated on a histidyl residue (HPr-P) or non-phosphorylated (HPr). PykF is activated only by non-phosphorylated HPr, which decreases the PykF Khalf for phosphoenolpyruvate by 10-fold (from 3.5 to 0.36 mM), thus influencing glycolysis. PfkB activation by HPr, but not by HPr-P, resulted from a decrease in the Khalf for fructose-6-P, which likely influences both gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. Moreover, NagB activation by HPr was important for the utilization of amino sugars, and allosteric inhibition of Adk activity by HPr-P, but not by HPr, allows HPr to regulate the cellular energy charge coordinately with glycolysis. These observations suggest that HPr serves as a directly interacting global regulator of carbon and energy metabolism and probably of other physiological processes in enteric bacteria. © 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Amino acids; Amino sugars; Chemical activation; Enzymes; Escherichia coli; Metabolism; Pathology; Phosphorylation; Praseodymium compounds; Allosteric inhibition; Allosteric regulation; Energy metabolism; Global regulators; Phosphoenolpyruvates; Phosphofructokinase; Phosphotransferase system; Physiological process; Boron compounds; 6 phosphofructokinase; bacterial protein; glycogen phosphorylase; histidine phosphorylatable phosphocarrier protein; pyruvate kinase; unclassified drug; 6 phosphofructo 2 kinase; adenylate kinase; bacterial protein; Escherichia coli protein; glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase; histidine; hybrid protein; isoenzyme; isomerase; phosphocarrier protein HPr; phosphoenolpyruvate sugar phosphotransferase; pyruvate kinase; recombinant protein; allosteric site; Article; binding affinity; energy metabolism; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme binding; enzyme inhibition; enzyme kinetics; Escherichia coli; gluconeogenesis; glycolysis; isomerization; nonhuman; oxidation; pH; priority journal; protein binding; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; steady state; agonists; allosterism; binding site; chemistry; energy metabolism; enzymology; Escherichia coli; genetics; glycolysis; metabolism; molecular model; phosphorylation; protein conformation; protein domain; protein processing; proteomics; Adenylate Kinase; Aldose-Ketose Isomerases; Allosteric Regulation; Bacterial Proteins; Binding Sites; Energy Metabolism; Enzyme Activation; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Glycolysis; Histidine; Isoenzymes; Models, Molecular; Phosphoenolpyruvate Sugar Phosphotransferase System; Phosphofructokinase-2; Phosphorylation; Protein Conformation; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Proteomics; Pyruvate Kinase; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Recombinant Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028396680

This paper develops a comprehensive econometric study on the main drivers of national emissions intensity in emerging countries in East Asia. This regional focus responds to their pivotal position in global economic growth and remarkable trends in carbon emissions intensity. The main hypothesis of this paper is that the nature of economic growth has a major effect on carbon intensity trends that deserves some attention. Accordingly, the novelty of this paper is to examine the contribution of “intensive” and “extensive” GDP growth for carbon intensity abatements. Labour productivity is revealed to be the main factor responsible for major carbon intensity reductions by Asian Dragons. Whereas household energy per capita and industrial energy per worker contributed in the opposite direction. Consequently, intensity targets may become “meaningless” for real climate action contributions if they do not take into account labour productivity trends. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions intensity; China; Energy intensity, climate change; Intensive GDP growth; Labour productivity","Developing countries; Economic analysis; Economics; Productivity; Carbon emissions; China; Energy intensity; GDP growth; Labour productivities; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; developing world; economic growth; energy efficiency; environmental economics; environmental policy; global economy; Gross Domestic Product; household energy; labor productivity; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033240324

This infrastructure was created in 2013 and follows the ETOILE and ARCHADE projects; it is presently funded by public money. Ten teams, from different scientific background, using a wide range of approaches, participate in radiobiology researches upon protons and carbon ion therapy in comparison with photons used in classical radiation oncology. These approaches combine the use of multiple biological models of radioresistant tumors and healthy tissue critical for treatment tolerance. Thus, the determinants of the radioresistance of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSSC), high-grade gliomas, sarcomas including chondrosarcomas and the ubiquitous endothelial cells and fibroblasts are studied. Multiple methodological approaches are implemented. In particular, these include: the extraction of tumor stem cell populations and their radiobiological comparison with the differentiated tumor cells; the studies in hypoxic and normoxic conditions; the development and the use of models of 3D cell cultures that highlight important differences in cell behaviors; the cell biology with the analysis of typical neoplastic mechanisms such as invasive and cell migration processes, as well as late recovery of irradiated tumor cells that reenter proliferation; the molecular biochemistry with analysis of resistance signaling pathways, telomerase regulation and genomic analysis of predictors of radioresistance in retrospective and prospective series of patients (gliomas, HNSSC, sarcomas) and finally the oxidative stress, genotoxicity and inflammatory measurements in normal human cells at early and late times after irradiation. This work allows a better understanding of the mechanisms of cellular and tumor radioresistance, normal tissue toxicity, but they also enable pre-clinical and clinical approaches. Thus, experimental approaches of combinations of pharmacological treatments acting on the identified resistance or toxicity mechanisms with the different types of radiation studied are developed. The comparison between stem cells and differentiated cells is very interesting in this respect. This information, combined with phenomenological data on survival and relative biological effectiveness (RBE), contributes to the adjustment and parameterization of bio-mathematical predictive models of the cellular response such as the Nanox model. This work enables, on the one hand, to suggest hypotheses of clinical trials aimed at acting on tumor radioresistance; and, on the other hand, to integrate into studies associated with prospective transnational clinical research protocols, comparing carbontherapy vs. photon or proton radiotherapy, in collaboration with the European carbontherapy centers, in particular the Heidelberg Ion Therapy (HIT) in Germany and Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica (CNAO) in Italy.

We propose an innovative and robust climate-matching method that is suitable to link cities’ current and future climates. Of the 100 cities investigated, 70 have at least one twin climate region, and 39 have a twin climate city. The case-study revealed a highly significant similarity for temperature variables and heat-related indices, but a less significant similarity for precipitation variables.

As a starting point to implement mitigation and adaptation measures to climate change, a regional greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory is needed. So far, the only regional GHG inventories available are limited to the territorial emissions of those production activities which are expected to cause major environmental degradation. An alternative approach has been followed here to quantify all the on-site (direct) and embodied (indirect) GHG emissions related to all Galician production and consumption activities. The carbon footprint (CF) was calculated following the territorial life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology for data collection, that combines bottom-up and top-down approaches. The most up-to-date statistical data and life cycle inventories available were used to compute all GHG emissions. This case study represents a leap of scale when compared to existing studies, thus addressing the issue of double counting, which arises when considering all the production activities of a large region. The CF of the consumption activities in Galicia is 17.8 ktCO2e/year, with 88% allocated to Galician inhabitants and 12% to tourist consumption. The proposed methodology also identifies the main important contributors to GHG emissions and shows where regional reduction efforts should be made. The major contributor to the CF of inhabitants is housing (32%), followed by food consumption (29%).

In reality, the passenger seeking strategies are mostly empirical and substantially vary among taxi drivers. From the history taxi data, the top performing taxi drivers can earn 25% more than the ones with mediocre seeking strategy in the same period of time. A better strategy not only helps taxi drivers earn more with less effort, but also reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions. It is interesting to examine the influential factors in passenger seeking strategies and find algorithms to guide taxi drivers to passenger hotspots with the right timing. With the abundant availability of history taxicab traces, the existing methods of doing taxi business have been radically changed. This paper focuses on the problem of mining efficient operation strategies from a large-scale history taxi traces collected over one year. Our approach presents generic insights into the dynamics of taxicab services with the objective of maximizing the profit margins for the concerned parties. We propose important metrics, such as trip frequency, hot spots, and taxi mileage, and provide valuable insights toward more efficient operation strategies. We analyze these metrics using techniques, such as Newton’s polynomial interpolation and Gamma distribution, to understand their dynamics. Our strategies use the real taxicab traces from the city of Changsha (P.R.China), may predict the taxi rides at different times by 90.68% per day, and increase the taxi drivers income levels up to 19.38% by controlling appropriate mileage per trip and following the route across more urban hot spots. © 2017 IEEE.","Hot-spot metric; Taxi operation strategy; Trip frequency; Trip mileage","Data mining; Industry; Profitability; Recommender systems; Hot spot; Mobile communications; Public transportation; Taxi operation; Time frequency analysis; Trip frequency; Trip mileage; Taxicabs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028930639

Long-term analyses based on dendrochronological techniques applied to shrubs have linked this phenomenon to climate change. However, the multi-stemmed structure of shrubs makes them difficult to sample and therefore leads to non-uniform sampling protocols among shrub ecologists, who will favor either root collars or stems to conduct dendrochronological analyses. Through a comparative study of the use of root collars and stems of Betula glandulosa, a common North American shrub species, we evaluated the relative sensitivity of each plant part to climate variables and assessed whether this sensitivity is consistent across three different types of environments in northwestern Québec, Canada (terrace, hilltop and snowbed). We found that root collars had greater sensitivity to climate than stems and that these differences were maintained across the three types of environments. Growth at the root collar was best explained by spring precipitation and summer temperature, whereas stem growth showed weak and inconsistent responses to climate variables. Moreover, sensitivity to climate was not consistent among plant parts, as individuals having climate-sensitive root collars did not tend to have climate-sensitive stems. These differences in sensitivity of shrub parts to climate highlight the complexity of resource allocation in multi-stemmed plants. Whereas stem initiation and growth are driven by microenvironmental variables such as light availability and competition, root collars integrate the growth of all plant parts instead, rendering them less affected by mechanisms such as competition and more responsive to signals of global change. Although further investigations are required to determine the degree to which these findings are generalizable across the tundra biome, our results indicate that consistency and caution in the choice of plant parts are a key consideration for the success of future dendroclimatological studies on shrubs. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Betula glandulosa; climate sensitivity; dendrochronology; dwarf birch; shrub densification; subarctic; tundra","climate change; deciduous tree; dendrochronology; root; sensitivity analysis; shrub; stem; subarctic region; tundra; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Betula glandulosa; Betula nana; Arctic; Canada; climate; climate change; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; plant development; plant root; Quebec; tundra; Arctic Regions; Canada; Climate; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Plant Development; Plant Roots; Quebec; Tundra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017397461

These glasses, found near the town of Pica at four localities separated by up to 70 km, are neither fulgurites, nor volcanic glasses, nor metallurgical slags related to anthropic activity, but show close similarities to other glasses that have been previously attributed to large airbursts created by meteoroids entering the Earth's atmosphere. The glasses are restricted to specific Late Pleistocene terrains: paleo-wetlands and soils rich in organic matter with SiO2-rich plant remains, salts and carbonates. 14C dating and paleomagnetic data indicate that the glasses were formed during at least two distinct periods. This rules out the hypothesis of a single large airburst as the cause of surface melting. Instead, burning of organic-rich soils in dried-out grassy wetlands during climate oscillations between wet and dry periods can account for the formation of the Pica glasses. Large oases did indeed form in the hyperarid Atacama Desert due to elevated groundwater tables and increased surface discharge during the Central Andean Pluvial Event (roughly coeval with the Mystery interval and Younger Dryas).

Spins are polarized beyond Boltzmann equilibrium using spin-selective optical excitation of the no-phonon bound exciton transition resulting in N = 3.6 × 1013 unpaired spins in the ensemble. We observe a normal mode splitting of the spin-ensemble-cavity polariton resonances of 2g √ N = 580 kHz (where each spin is coupled with strength g) in a cavity with a quality factor of 75 000 (γ ≪ κ ≈ 60 kHz, where γ and κ are the spin dephasing and cavity loss rates, respectively). The spin ensemble has a long dephasing time (T* 2 = 9 μs) providing a wide window for viewing the dynamics of the coupled spin-ensemble-cavity system. The free-induction decay shows up to a dozen collapses and revivals revealing a coherent exchange of excitations between the superradiant state of the spin ensemble and the cavity at the rate g √ N. The ensemble is found to evolve as a single large pseudospin according to the Tavis-Cummings model due to minimal inhomogeneous broadening and uniform spin-cavity coupling. We demonstrate independent control of the total spin and the initial Z projection of the psuedospin using optical excitation and microwave manipulation, respectively. We vary the microwave excitation power to rotate the pseudospin on the Bloch sphere and observe a long delay in the onset of the superradiant emission as the pseudospin approaches full inversion. This delay is accompanied by an abrupt p-phase shift in the peusdospin microwave emission. The scaling of this delay with the initial angle and the sudden phase shift are explained by the Tavis-Cummings model.","Mesoscopics; Quantum physics; Strongly correlated materials","Dielectric devices; Excitons; Microwaves; Phase shift; Phonons; Photoexcitation; Boltzmann equilibrium; Inhomogeneous broadening; Mesoscopics; Microwave excitations; Quantum physics; Strong-coupling regime; Strongly correlated materials; Super-radiant emissions; Spin dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025133688

NHOs are formally derived by appending an alkylidene (CR2) unit onto an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), and their pronounced ylidic character leads to high nucleophilicity and soft Lewis basic character at the ligating carbon atom. These olefinic donors can also be structurally derived from imidazole, triazole, and thiazole-based heterocyclic carbenes and, as a result, have highly tunable electronic and steric properties.In this Account, we will focus on various synthetic routes to imidazole-2-ylidene derived NHOs (sometimes referred to as deoxy-Breslow intermediates) followed by a discussion of the electron-donor ability of this structurally tunable ligand group. It should be mentioned that NHOs have a close structural analogy with Breslow-type intermediates, N-heterocyclic ketene aminals, and β-azolium ylides; while these latter species play important roles in advancing synthetic organic chemistry, discussion in this Account will be confined mostly to imidazole-2-ylidene derived NHOs. In addition, we will cover selected examples from the literature where NHOs and their anionic counterparts, N-heterocyclic vinylenes, are used to access reactive main group species not attainable using traditional ligands. Added motivation for these studies comes from the emerging number of low coordinate main group element based compounds that display reactivity once reserved for precious metal complexes (such as H-H and C-H bond activation). Moreover, NHOs are versatile precursors to new mixed element (P/C and N/C), and potentially bidentate, ligand constructs of great potential in catalysis, where various metal oxidation states and coordination environments need to be stabilized during a catalytic cycle. The most active area of recent growth for NHOs is their use as nucleophiles to promote efficient organocatalytic transformations, including transesterification, carbonyl reduction, and the conversion of CO2 into value added products. Polyesters have also been generated through the NHO-promoted ring-opening polymerization of lactones, and the highly tunable nature of NHO organocatalysts allows for the rapid screening and enhancement of catalytic performance. Therefore, the growing utility of NHOs in the realm of organic and polymer chemistry can be viewed as evidence of the widespread impact of N-heterocyclic olefins on the chemical community. It is hoped that through this Account others will join this flourishing research domain and that the rapid recent growth of NHO chemistry is sustained for the foreseeable future. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027457674

To determine whether the beneficial effects of litter treatment can be extended to the next growing seasons, litter-treated seedlings were outplanted to four sites with different environmental conditions: forest clear-cut (S1), area formerly polluted by emissions from nitrogen fertilizer plant (S2), abandoned agricultural land (S3) and coastal sand dunes (S4). Seedlings grown in mineral nursery soil without litter amendment served as controls. Height and survival of seedlings were measured over three consecutive years after outplanting. At the end of the third growing season, the mycorrhizal status of seedlings was assessed using DNA-based identification techniques. Litter treatment during the nursery phase significantly improved the height of seedlings at the end of the first growing season at all tested sites. In the second and third growing seasons after outplanting, the heights of litter treated seedlings remained greater compared to control seedlings at three of the four sites; however, at the abandoned agricultural site (S3), significantly lower growth of litter-treated seedlings was observed. After the third growing season, the differences in seedling heights at the forest clear-cut (S1) and the site formerly polluted by nitrogen (S2) were not statistically significant. Survival of all outplanted seedlings varied by season and study site, but litter treated seedlings showed a clear tendency towards enhanced survival. Three years after outplanting, the survival rates of litter-treated seedlings ranged from approximately 81% at S4 to 96% at S2; for control seedlings, survival rates ranged from 63% at S4 to 81% at S3. At sites S1, S2 and S4, the survival of litter-treated seedling was significantly higher. There was a substantial transformation in ECM community composition with low persistence of suilloid mycorrhizas for both litter-treated and control seedlings three years after outplanting.

Specifically, we examined the hypothesised mediational role of motivation regulations in the climate–emotion relationship. We also tested a sequence in which emotions were assumed to be predicted by the motivational climate dimensions and then served as antecedents to variability in motivation regulations. Participants (N = 494) completed a multi-section questionnaire assessing targeted variables. Structural equation modelling (SEM) revealed that a perceived task-involving climate was a positive predictor of autonomous motivation and of the impact of functional anger, and a negative predictor of the intensity of anxiety and dysfunctional anger. Autonomous motivation was a partial mediator of perceptions of a task-involving climate and the impact of functional anger. An ego-involving climate was a positive predictor of controlled motivation, and of the intensity and impact of functional anger and the intensity of dysfunctional anger. Controlled motivation partially mediated the relationship between an ego-involving climate and the intensity of dysfunctional anger.

With the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions of the transport systems, the evolution of railway systems is toward environmental sustainability and energy efficiency. In this paper, a study about the use of energy harvesting to integrate the powering system of trains is presented. Currently available technologies are analyzed and photovoltaic systems are selected being technologically mature, since until now only big solar plants are considered as energy source for railways, and few studies have investigated solutions local to the trains. However, these studies date back to the early 2000s when photovoltaic technology was not sufficiently mature for this field of application. Taking advantage from the technology evolution the presented evaluation show by simulation that the electricity production can be increased until 400% with respect to the early 2000s. Furthermore, simulation results show that new power optimization solutions based on micro-inverters and on decoupling the PV modules of a string allow overcoming the limitation due to not optimal panel orientation on the train roof, train movement and shadows, increasing the production from 2 to 25%. The proposed approach can make the railway system more attractive for users sensitive to environmental issues and can promote intermodal connections with other green solutions for urban and local transport. © 2017 IEEE.","energy harvesting; photovoltaic systems; Railways systems","Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Photovoltaic cells; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Electricity production; Environmental issues; Environmental sustainability; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaic technology; Railways systems; Technology evolution; Transportation system; Transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030246349

Under this program, offsets are tradable credits representing real, verifiable, quantifiable, enforceable, permanent, and additional reductions or removals of GHG emissions. This paper focuses on the permanence and additionality standards for offset credits as defined and operationalized in California's Compliance Offset Protocol for U.S. Forest Projects. Drawing on a review of the protocol, interviews, current offset projects, and existing literature, we discuss how additionality and permanence standards relate to project participation and overall program effectiveness. Specifically, we provide an overview of offset credits as compliance instruments in California's cap-and-trade program, the timeline for a forest offset project, and the factors shaping participation in offset projects. We then discuss the implications of permanence and additionality at both the project and program levels. Largely consistent with previous work, we find that stringent standards for permanent and additional project activities can present barriers to participation, but also, that there may be a trade-off between project quality and quantity (i.e. levels of participation) when considering overall program effectiveness. We summarize what this implies for California's forest offset program and provide suggestions for improvements in light of potential program diffusion and policy learning. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Additionality; California; Carbon offsets; Climate change; Forest management; Permanence","biomass allocation; climate change; credit provision; environmental economics; forest management; greenhouse gas; instrumentation; literature review; participatory approach; policy making; questionnaire survey; trade-off; California; environmental policy; exhaust gas; forest; program effectiveness; program evaluation; reforestation; Review; standardization; California; environmental protection; forest; forestry; California; United States; carbon; California; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forestry; Forests",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018976240

This method applied in Suralaya Power Plant, Indonesia. However, the boiler where supposed to use low rank coal (LRC), but at a given time must be mixed with medium rank coal (MRC) from another unit because of lack of LRC coal. Accordingly to the situation, the study about choosing the right position of LRC and MRC in the burner elevation must be investigated. The composition of coal is 70%LRC / 30%MRC where MRC will be placed at the lower (A &amp; C - Case I)) or higher (E &amp; G - Case II) elevation as the cases in this study. The study is carried out using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. The simulation with original case (100%LRC) has a good agreement with the measurement data. As the results, MRC is more recommended at the burner elevation A &amp; C rather than burner elevation E &amp; G because it has closer temperature (880?K) compared with 100%LRC and has smaller local heating area between upper side wall and front wall with the range of temperature 1900 - 2000?K.

But first we need to understand and develop strategies for anchoring single molecules to such electrodes. Here, for the first time we present a systematic theoretical study of transport properties using four different modes of anchoring zinc-porphyrin monomer, dimer, and trimer molecular wires to graphene electrodes. These involve either amine anchor groups, covalent C - C bonds to the edges of the graphene, or coupling via Ï€-Ï€ stacking of planar polyaromatic hydrocarbons formed from pyrene or tetrabenzofluorene (TBF). Ï€-Ï€ stacked pyrene anchors are particularly stable, which may be advantageous for forming robust single-molecule transistors. Despite their planar, multiatom coupling to the electrodes, pyrene anchors can exhibit both destructive interference and different degrees of constructive interference, depending on their connectivity to the porphyrin wire, which makes them attractive also for thermoelectricity. TBF anchors are more weakly coupled to both the graphene and the porphyrin wires and induce negative differential conductance at finite source-drain voltages. Furthermore, although direct C - C covalent bonding to the edges of graphene electrodes yields the highest electrical conductance, electron transport is significantly affected by the shape and size of the graphene electrodes because the local density of states at the carbon atoms connecting the electrode edges to the molecule is sensitive to the electrode surface shape. This sensitivity suggests that direct C - C bonding may be the most desirable for sensing applications. The ordering of the low-bias electrical conductances with different anchors is as follows: direct C - C coupling &gt; Ï€-Ï€ stacking with the pyrene anchors &gt; direct coupling via amine anchors &gt; Ï€-Ï€ stacking with TBF anchors. Despite this dependency of conductances on the mode of anchoring, the decay of conductance with the length of the zinc-porphyrin wires is relatively insensitive with the associated attenuation factor β lying between 0.9 and 0.11 Å-1. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","attenuation factor; covalent/anchor; graphene electrode; porphyrin; Single molecule electronics","Anchors; Carbon; Dimers; Electric conductance; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electron transport properties; Electron tunneling; Graphite electrodes; Molecules; Porphyrins; Pyrene; Wire; Zinc; Zinc compounds; Attenuation factors; Constructive interference; covalent/anchor; Graphene electrodes; Negative differential conductance; Polyaromatic hydrocarbons; Single-molecule electronics; Single-molecule transistor; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027156496

Feasibility analysis is done by doing fuel cost analysis of two cases, i.e., simple hybrid vehicle and hybrid vehicle equipped with solar module and increased battery energy storage capacity for a specific round trip distance between two cities, i.e., Rawalpindi and Islamabad in comparison with feasibility of third case, i.e., proposed solar electric car model. The solar module selection along with desired number of batteries with charging and discharging time and motor power required to carry five persons weight (70 kg each) is calculated for third case. Moreover, total carbon dioxide emission analysis has been carried out from car material production to its assembly, manufacturing solar module and nickel metal hydride battery for each case. The annual carbon dioxide emitted from fuel in first two cases relative to electric outlet in third case for specific distance has been analyzed. On large scale, emission analyses for hundred cars of each case have been done at 100 km distance.

In this study, temporal dynamics of GW-SW interaction were investigated under climate change. A case study was chosen for a study area along the Kiskatinaw River in Mainstem sub-watershed of the Kiskatinaw River Watershed, British Columbia, Canada. A physically based and distributed GW-SW interaction model, Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA), was used. Two different greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios (i.e., A2: heterogeneous world with self-reliance and preservation of local identities, and B1: more integrated and environmental friendly world) of SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) from Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were used for climate change study for 2020–2040. The simulation results showed that climate change influences significantly the temporal patterns of GW-SW interaction by generating variable temporal mean groundwater contributions to streamflow. Due to precipitation variability, these contributions varied monthly, seasonally, and annually. The mean annual groundwater contribution to streamflow during 2020–2040 under the A2 and B1 scenarios is expected to be 74.5% (σ = 2%) and 75.6% (σ = 3%), respectively. As compared to that during the base modeling period (2007–2011), the mean annual groundwater contribution to streamflow during 2020–2040 under the A2 and B1 scenarios is expected to decrease by 5.5% and 4.4%, respectively, due to the increased precipitation (on average 6.7% in the A2 and 4.8% in the B1 scenarios) and temperature (on average 0.83 °C in the A2 and 0.64 °C in the B1 scenarios).

While the emissions footprint reflects the pressure that consumption exerts on the planet's climate, the labour footprint represents the employment that is created across the globe associated with the demand for products and services. This paper has a two-fold objective. First, it focuses on analysing the behaviour over time, drivers, and sectoral and regional composition of both UK's footprints. Second, it explores the relationship between both measures by estimating the elasticity between the growth of emissions and employment embodied in imports. The results show that around half of the emissions associated with UK consumption were generated outside its borders, while only 40% of total employment was domestic. This has important policy implications. Reducing UK's imports can contribute to cut both its footprints, generating less emissions abroad and more employment opportunities within. However, cutting imports is challenging, since this would require a lengthy and difficult process of structural transformation. The UK could contribute to curb emissions outside its borders, while safeguarding development overseas, by offering increased support to emission-intensive trade partners in the form of technology transfer and financial aid. © 2017 by the authors.

In grassland-based livestock systems, soil carbon sequestration might be a potential sink to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) balance. Nevertheless, there is no commonly shared methodology. In this work, the GHG emissions of small-scale mountain dairy farms were assessed using the LCA approach. Two functional units, kg of Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM) and Utilizable Agricultural Land (UAL), and two different emissions allocations methods, no allocation and physical allocation, which accounts for the co-product beef, were considered. Two groups of small-scale dairy farms were identified based on the Livestock Units (LU) reared: &lt;30 LU (LLU) and &gt;30 LU (HLU). Before considering soil carbon sequestration in LCA, performing no allocation methods, LLU farms tended to have higher GHG emission than HLU farms per kg of FPCM (1.94 vs. 1.59 kg CO2-eq/kg FPCM, P ≤ 0.10), whereas the situation was reversed upon considering the m2 of UAL as a functional unit (0.29 vs. 0.89 kg CO2-eq/m2, P ≤ 0.05). Conversely, considering physical allocation, the difference between the two groups became less noticeable. When the contribution from soil carbon sequestration was included in the LCA and no allocation method was performed, LLU farms registered higher values of GHG emission per kg of FPCM than HLU farms (1.38 vs. 1.10 kg CO2-eq/kg FPCM, P ≤ 0.05), and the situation was likewise reversed in this case upon considering the m2 of UAL as a functional unit (0.22 vs. 0.73 kg CO2-eq/m2, P ≤ 0.05). To highlight how the presence of grasslands is crucial for the carbon footprint of small-scale farms, this study also applied a simulation for increasing the forage self-sufficiency of farms to 100%. In this case, an average reduction of GHG emission per kg of FPCM of farms was estimated both with no allocation and with physical allocation, reaching 27.0% and 28.8%, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon sequestration; Forage self-sufficiency; Grassland; LCA; Mountain; Small-scale dairy farm","carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; dairy farming; environmental impact assessment; fat; grassland; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; milk production; mitigation; mountain region; soil carbon; agricultural land; animal experiment; Article; carbon allocation; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; climate change; dairy product; dairying; environmental impact; forage; grassland; grazing; life cycle assessment; livestock; manure; milk production; nonhuman; principal component analysis; sheep farming; stocking density; animal; carbon footprint; grassland; greenhouse effect; Animals; Carbon Footprint; Carbon Sequestration; Dairying; Farms; Grassland; Greenhouse Effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016483504

The maximum average UHI intensity is found to be 2.8 °C in winter and 1.7 °C in summer, reaching 4.3 °C at street level. Simulations performed with EnergyPlus indicate that the UHI intensity increases the sensible cooling load of residential buildings by around 18%–28%, depending on UHI intensity, amount of solar gains and cooling set point.

Severe socio-economic and environmental problems occur due to open dumping of major fraction of MSW. Anaerobic digestion is a sustainable waste management strategy to manage organic fraction of MSW (OFMSW). In order to evaluate the feasibility of this strategy, a mechanistic model was developed using a steady state anaerobic digestion model which was modified using improved Chen-Hashimoto kinetic equations. It was applied to treat OFMSW generated in open dumping site at Karadiyana in Sri Lanka. The daily MSW arrival to the site is 550 tons/day and input OFMSW slurry to the anaerobic bioreactor contained of total solids 70 g/l, volatile solids 55.6 g/l, carbohydrates 58.5%, proteins 13% and lipids 3%. According to the mechanistic model, minimum payback period of 1.79 years was achieved when anaerobic bioreactor operated in continuously fed mode at operating temperature of 40°C and hydraulic retention time of 11.28 days. The volatile solid reduction efficiency of 76.62%, methane yield of 0.26 m3 per kg of volatile solids added, electricity generation of 10.31 W per kg of OFMSW per day and carbon dioxide generation of 0.21 kg per kg of OFMSW were achieved at these optimized process conditions.

In Spain a complete guild of edaphic specialists, most of them threatened, occurs in gypsum outcrops, but how these species will respond to climate change has received little attention. Methods A reciprocal sowing experiment was performed to determine the extent of local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in five gypsophytes with contrasting distributions along a climate gradient. Germination, seedling growth and survival were recorded during a 4-year period. Key Results Plants responded plastically according to their positions along the regional climate gradient, as well as locally between matched locations. All species exhibited highly plastic responses and stress-tolerant behaviours, especially in terms of seedling survival during summer drought. However, no evidence of local adaptation was detected in any of the locations, where local individuals never performed better than those from other sites. In some sites, both germination and seedling recruitment were higher irrespective of parent plant origin. Conclusions The lack of local adaptation to drought displayed at the regeneration stage indicates limited capacity for in situ genetic response to new climate scenarios. Nevertheless, a plastic response along the climatic gradient does suggest a wider species-level capacity to enable these edaphic specialists to cope with increasing aridity over coming decades. © The Author 2017.

Laparoscopic surgery is performed in the treatment of colorectal and appendiceal cancer, and PC from diverse origin in selected patients. HIPEC management by laparoscopic approach after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) completed locoregional treatment of PC, and may be feasible and safe after appropriate patient selection. Objective: Development of an experimental model of HIPEC by laparoscopic approach, with CO2 recirculation. Clinical translation in two patients with PC and low peritoneal cancer index. Material and methods: We performed CRS in a porcine model of 5 pigs (35–38 kg) by laparoscopic approach. Laparoscopic HIPEC by CO2 recirculation system was performed; laparoscopic access was used for catheter input and output placement (Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 for 60 min at 42 °C). The experimental variables were: blood gases, haemodynamic and intra-abdominal and central temperature. Clinical model application was performed in three cases with PC from colorectal origin. Results: No statistically significant differences was found in blood gases, haemodynamic or temperature in the experimental study. In clinical study, there were no technical complications during laparoscopic-HIPEC approach, and we observed no changes in haemodynamic variables during the procedure. Conclusions: CRS and HIPEC laparoscopic model by CO2 recirculation system is safe and feasible technique in selected patients, that include low PC index, local and accessible tumour recurrences or high-risk of PC tumours. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","minimally invasive cytoreduction; minimally invasive HIPEC; Peritoneal carcinomatosis","carbon dioxide; mitomycin; paclitaxel; antineoplastic antibiotic; carbon dioxide; mitomycin; abdominal pressure; adult; aged; animal experiment; animal model; appendix cancer; Article; blood gas; cancer prognosis; carcinomatous peritonitis; case report; catheter; colloid carcinoma; colon cancer; core temperature; cytoreductive surgery; feasibility study; female; hemicolectomy; hemodynamics; human; hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy; laparoscopic surgery; laparotomy; male; middle aged; minimally invasive surgery; nonhuman; omentectomy; ovary metastasis; patient safety; Peritoneal Cancer Index; peritonectomy; peritoneum cancer; peritoneum metastasis; pneumoperitoneum; porcine model; statistical analysis; surgical technique; translational research; treatment outcome; animal; blood; blood gas analysis; laparoscopy; minipig; multimodality cancer therapy; pathophysiology; peritoneum tumor; pig; thermotherapy; Adult; Aged; Animals; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Blood Gas Analysis; Carbon Dioxide; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Mitomycin; Peritoneal Neoplasms; Swine; Swine, Miniature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017011659

In this literature review, we summarize findings published since 1950 regarding avian responses to air pollution and discuss knowledge gaps that could be addressed in future studies. We find consistent evidence for adverse health impacts on birds attributable to exposure to gas-phase and particulate air pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), smoke, and heavy metals, as well as mixtures of urban and industrial emissions. Avian responses to air pollution include respiratory distress and illness, increased detoxification effort, elevated stress levels, immunosuppression, behavioral changes, and impaired reproductive success. Exposure to air pollution may furthermore reduce population density, species diversity, and species richness in bird communities. © 2017 The Author(s).

Papers providing projections of future heat-related mortality were critically reviewed with a focus on the use of climate model data. Some best practice guidelines are proposed for future research. Methods The electronic databases Web of Science and PubMed/Medline were searched for papers containing a quantitative estimate of future heat-related mortality. The search was limited to papers published in English in peer-reviewed journals up to the end of March 2017. Reference lists of relevant papers and the citing literature were also examined. The wide range of locations studied and climate data used prevented a meta-analysis. Results A total of 608 articles were identified after removal of duplicate entries, of which 63 were found to contain a quantitative estimate of future mortality from hot days or heat waves. A wide range of mortality models and climate model data have been used to estimate future mortality. Temperatures in the climate simulations used in these studies were projected to increase. Consequently, all the papers indicated that mortality from high temperatures would increase under a warming climate. The spread in projections of future climate by models adds substantial uncertainty to estimates of future heat-related mortality. However, many studies either did not consider this source of uncertainty, or only used results from a small number of climate models. Other studies showed that uncertainty from changes in populations and demographics, and the methods for adaptation to warmer temperatures were at least as important as climate model uncertainty. Some inconsistencies in the use of climate data (for example, using global mean temperature changes instead of changes for specific locations) and interpretation of the effects on mortality were apparent. Some factors which have not been considered when estimating future mortality are summarised. Conclusions Most studies have used climate data generated using scenarios with medium and high emissions of greenhouse gases. More estimates of future mortality using climate information from the mitigation scenario RCP2.6 are needed, as this scenario is the only one under which the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2C or less could be realised. Many of the methods used to combine modelled data with local climate observations are simplistic. Quantile-based methods might offer an improved approach, especially for temperatures at the ends of the distributions. The modelling of adaptation to warmer temperatures in mortality models is generally arbitrary and simplistic, and more research is needed to better quantify adaptation. Only a small number of studies included possible changes in population and demographics in their estimates of future mortality, meaning many estimates of mortality could be biased low. Uncertainty originating from establishing a mortality baseline, climate projections, adaptation and population changes is important and should be considered when estimating future mortality. © 2017 Sanderson et al.

Burials at the site present unexpectedly high variability in δ13C (-8‰ to-16‰) and δ15N (10‰ to 24‰) values in their skeletal tissues, implying highly diverse diets. There are two possible explanations for this variability: The first is diachronic change in diet while the second involves synchronic sociocultural distinctions. To distinguish between them a radiocarbon (14C) dating program (n=23) was initiated. The presumed importance of marine foods adds the complication of a marine reservoir effect. To address this problem, paired 14C dates were obtained on human bone and camelid textiles from nine graves. The results fall into two groups, one showing an average offset of 117±9 14C yr, and the other no statistically significant offsets. We conclude that the contribution of marine foods to bone collagen at Pica 8 was less than previously supposed. Other factors must be invoked to account for the unusually high human δ15N values at the site. Manuring crops with sea-bird guano emerges as a probable explanation. No relationship with chronology is seen implying the presence of considerable diversity in diets and hence lifeways within the Pica 8 community. © 2017 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona.","Atacama Desert; marine reservoir effect; stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes","anthropology; carbon isotope; collagen; diet; marine environment; nitrogen isotope; radiocarbon dating; sampling; seabird; skeletal remains; stable isotope; Atacama Desert; Chile; Tarapaca; Aves; Camelidae; Pica (bird)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026525437

A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is employed and evaluated against concentrations measured during the last part of winter season at a monitoring station located in the study area. Aerodynamic and deposition effects of trees are jointly considered, which has only been done in few recent studies. Specifically, the impact on NOx concentration of: (a) tree-foliage; and (b) introducing new vegetation in a tree-free street is analyzed considering several deposition velocities and Leaf Area Densities (LAD) to model deciduous and evergreen vegetation. Results show that the higher the LAD, the higher the deposition (concentration reduction) and the blocking aerodynamic effect (concentration increase). Regardless of foliage or deposition rates, results suggest the predominance of aerodynamic effects which induce concentration increases up to a maximum of 7.2%, while deposition induces concentration decreases up to a maximum of 6.9%. The inclusion of new trees in one street modifies the distribution of pollutant, not only in that street, but also in nearby locations with concentration increase or decrease. This finding suggests that planting trees in street with traffic as an air pollution reduction strategy seems to be not appropriate in general, highlighting the necessity of ad hoc studies for each particular case to select the suitable location of new vegetation. © 2017 by the authors.","Aerodynamic and deposition; CFD; Street vegetation; Tree scenarios; Urban planning","Aerodynamics; Computational fluid dynamics; Deposition rates; Forestry; Nitrogen oxides; Urban planning; Vegetation; Aerodynamic effect; Airborne pollutants; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Concentration reduction; Deposition velocities; Monitoring stations; Pollution reduction; Tree scenarios; Air pollution; aerodynamics; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; computational fluid dynamics; concentration (composition); neighborhood; nitrogen oxides; tree planting; urban planning; vegetation; Navarra; Pamplona; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026292634

With an experimental approach, we aimed to understand how plant community diversity (through different plant litter mixtures) and climate change (through decreased precipitation) may impact microbial abundance and diversity and affect C and N cycling in a Mediterranean shrubland. Along a natural plant diversity gradient, we manipulated the amount of precipitation and followed leaf litter decomposition during one year. We found that multi-species litter mixtures had higher microbial abundance, lower bacterial diversity and higher fungal diversity than predicted from single-species litter. In addition, C and N release increased with increasing litter species richness. Microbial abundance and diversity were positively, but weakly, correlated to the litter mixture effects on C and N release. Drier conditions increased microbial diversity but had no effect on microbial abundance. The net release of N from decomposing litter was lower with reduced precipitation irrespective of litter species richness and composition, while that of C was higher or lower depending on litter species composition. The relationships between microbial communities and litter mixture effects on C and N release were altered under drier conditions. Our data provide clear evidence that microbial decomposers and the processes they drive, respond to changing plant community diversity and composition in a Mediterranean shrubland. We highlighted the importance of Quercus coccifera that appears to be a key species in shaping microbial communities and driving synergistic effects on C and N release more than the three other shrub species. Our study also suggests that shifts in the plant community composition may have stronger impacts on litter decomposition and nutrient cycling than relatively subtle changes in precipitation as simulated in our study. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity-functioning relationship; Climate change; Litter decomposition; Mediterranean shrubland; Microbial community; Relative mixture effect","Biodiversity; Carbon; Decomposition; Digital storage; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Microorganisms; Mixtures; Ecosystem functioning; Experimental approaches; Leaf litter decomposition; Litter decomposition; Microbial communities; Microbial decomposers; Mixture effects; Shrublands; Climate change; abundance; biodiversity; carbon cycle; climate change; ecosystem function; fungus; leaf litter; Mediterranean environment; microbial community; nutrient cycling; plant community; shrubland; species diversity; species richness; Bacteria (microorganisms); Quercus coccifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017448072

This paper assesses the temporal patterns in stroke episodes in a city in Northern Spain during a 12-year period and analyzes the possible effects that atmospheric pollutants and meteorological variables may have on stroke on a daily scale. Our results show that there is an increase in stroke admissions (r = 0.818, p = 0.001) especially in patients over 85 years old. On a weekly scale, the number of hospital admissions due to stroke remains stable from Monday to Friday, whereas it abruptly decreases during the weekends, reaching its minimum values on Sunday (p &lt; 0.005); however, mortality in patients admitted to the hospital is higher on Sundays than on other days of the week. Finally, a statistically significant positive correlation between the number of stroke hospital admissions and NO2 levels (p = 0.012) and an inverse correlation with relative humidity (p = 0.032) were found. The analysis of the relationship between ischemic strokes and atmospheric circulation shows a higher frequency of the former in Santander with enhanced negative air pressure anomalies over western Spain; the fact that under these conditions the region studied registers very low values of relative humidity is in line with the aforementioned inverse correlation, which has not been described elsewhere in the literature.

The three global change scenario classes (Conventional Worlds, Barbarization, and Great Transitions) and four European scenarios (Economy First, Fortress Europe, Policy Rules, and Sustainability Eventually) were downscaled using the drivers-pressures-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework. The scenarios that emerged, i.e., Global Markets, Self-sufficient Economies, Tyranny of Climate Governance, and Sustainable Use of Ecosystem Services, show that pragmatism can have either a propitious role or pernicious role in scenario analysis. Instead of being truly honest brokers, scenario producers are likely to manipulate, reconstruct, and change scientific knowledge to avoid socially and politically undesired trajectories. We showed by mathematical optimization that scenario users are likely to miss the Sustainable Use of Ecosystem Services scenario if they search within the pragmatic decision space which optimally justifies the two pre-existing global policies: climate policy and economic growth. We conclude that pernicious pragmatism leads to “the trap of the day”—a tendency of both users and producers of scenarios to use pre-existing policy agendas and scientific narratives as a pretext to promote their own objectives instead of being open to transformation in science and policy. © 2016, Springer Japan.","Climate change; DPSIR; Ecosystem services; Exploratory qualitative scenarios; Land-use; Science-policy interactions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994715867

At the time of LVT151012, the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) was pointing at a region of the sky coincident with the high localization probability area of the event and thus permitted us to search for its electromagnetic counterpart (both prompt and afterglow emission). The imaging instruments on board INTEGRAL (IBIS/ISGRI, IBIS/PICsIT, SPI, and the two JEM-X modules) have been exploited to attempt the detection of any electromagnetic emission associated with LVT151012 over three decades in energy (from 3 keV to 8 MeV). The omni-directional instruments on board the satellite, i.e., the SPI-ACS and the IBIS/Veto, complemented the capabilities of the IBIS/ISGRI and IBIS/PICsIT for detections outside their imaging field of view in order to provide an efficient monitoring of the entire LVT151012 localization region at energies above 75 keV. We did not find any significant transient source that was spatially and/or temporally coincident with LVT151012, obtaining tight upper limits on the associated hard X-ray and γ-ray radiation. For typical spectral models, the upper limits on the fluence of the emission from any 1 s counterpart of LVT151012 ranges from Fγ = 3.5 × 10-8 erg cm-2 (20-200 keV), within the field of view of the imaging instruments, to Fγ = 7.1 × 10-7 erg cm-2 (75-2000 keV), considering the least favorable location of the counterpart for a detection by the omni-directional instruments. These results can be interpreted as a tight constraint on the ratio of the isotropic equivalent energy released in the electromagnetic emission to the total energy of the gravitational waves: E75-2000 keV/EGW 4.4 × 10-5. Finally, we provide an exhaustive summary of the capabilities of all instruments on board INTEGRAL to hunt for γ-ray counterparts of gravitational wave events, exploiting both serendipitousand pointed follow-up observations. This will serve as a reference for all future searches. © ESO, 2017.","Black hole physics; Gravitational waves; Instrumentation: Detectors; X-rays: Bursts","Astrophysics; Electromagnetic dispersion; Electromagnetic wave emission; Gamma rays; Gravitational effects; Gravity waves; X rays; Black Hole physics; Efficient monitoring; Electromagnetic emissions; Gamma ray radiation; Imaging instruments; Instrumentation: detectors; International gamma-ray astrophysics laboratories; X-rays: bursts; X ray detectors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022330380

Here we present measurements from a new in situ flux observation system designed for use on a small, low-flying aircraft that was deployed over the North Slope of Alaska during August 2013. The system combines a small methane instrument based on integrated cavity output spectroscopy (ICOS) with an air turbulence probe to calculate methane fluxes based on eddy covariance. We group surface fluxes by land class using a map based on LandSat Thematic Mapper (TM) data with 30 m resolution. We find that wet sedge areas dominate the methane fluxes with a mean flux of 2.1 μg m-2 s-1 during the first part of August. Methane emissions from the Sagavanirktok River have the second highest at almost 1 μg m-2 s-1. During the second half of August, after soil temperatures had cooled by 7 °C, methane emissions fell to between 0 and 0.5 μg m-2 s-1 for all areas measured. We compare the aircraft measurements with an eddy covariance flux tower located in a wet sedge area and show that the two measurements agree quantitatively when the footprints of both overlap. However, fluxes from sedge vary at times by a factor of 2 or more even within a few kilometers of the tower demonstrating the importance of making regional measurements to map out methane emissions spatial heterogeneity. Aircraft measurements of surface flux can play an important role in bridging the gap between ground-based measurements and regional measurements from remote sensing instruments and models. © 2017 Author(s).",,"airborne survey; atmospheric chemistry; eddy covariance; in situ measurement; methane; permafrost; soil temperature; Alaska; Arctic; North Slope; Sagavanirktok River; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024407020

A prominent example of this trend is REDD+, which turns terrestrial carbon in the global South into fictitious commodities that can be sold for profit. In this paper, we conceptualise REDD+ as a form of ‘inclusive’ neoliberal conservation, highlighting how neoliberalism has embraced notions of good governance, local ownership, social safeguards and active citizenship when promoting global conservation markets. While demonstrating the genuine efforts by project proponents to practice ‘inclusion’, we highlight their limits due to larger structural inequalities and demonstrate how the commodification of carbon inevitably causes new forms of inclusion and exclusion to local forest users. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in two forest-dependent villages in the Lindi Region of Tanzania, where two different REDD+ projects were underway, we show how material and discursive powers shaped ‘inclusive’ strategies to market forest-carbon. We then locate these strategies, concerned with the commodification of forest-carbon, within a historical field of power struggles and local politics over forest resources, strongly evidenced in contestations around establishing community-based forest management. We argue that a sharp disjuncture operated between the ‘inclusive’ strategies to market forest-carbon and the historical dimensions and power relations within the area; resulting in new forms of inclusions and exclusions, both in and outside rural villages. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","community forest management; neoliberal conservation; politics natural resource governance; REDD+; Tanzania",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026361756

Forty-one fires were examined using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) data set. Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) constituents exhibited the highest percent change increase. The sharpest enhancements were for the volatile (OC1) and semivolatile (OC2) OC fractions, suggestive of secondary organic aerosol formation during plume transport. Of the noncarbonaceous constituents, Cl, P, K, NO3 −, and Zn levels exhibited the highest percent change. Dust was significantly enhanced in wildfire plumes, based on significant enhancements in fine soil components (i.e., Si, Ca, Al, Fe, and Ti) and PMcoarse (i.e., PM10–PM2.5). A case study emphasized how transport of wildfire plumes significantly impacted downwind states, with higher levels of fine soil and PMcoarse at the downwind state (Arizona) as compared to the source of the fires (California). A global model (Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System, NAAPS) did not capture the dust influence over California or Arizona during this case event because it is not designed to resolve dust dynamics in fires, which motivates improved treatment of such processes. Significant chloride depletion was observed on the peak EC day for almost a half of the fires examined.

Some of it is due to energy consumption inside buildings, which depends on building use and human behaviour, both of which are very heterogeneous in most urban areas. Urban canopy parametrisations (UCP), such as the Town Energy Balance (TEB), parametrise the effect of the buildings on the urban surface energy balance. They contain a simple building energy model. However, the variety of building use and human behaviour at grid point scale has not yet been represented in state of the art UCPs. In this study, we describe how we enhance the Town Energy Balance in order to take fractional building use and human behaviour into account. We describe how we parametrise different behaviours and initialise the model for applications in France. We evaluate the spatio-temporal variability of the simulated building energy consumption for the city of Toulouse.

This is especially so where a large percentage of the global supply is grown in a single geographical region. Fortunately, there is often considerable spatial heterogeneity in the vulnerability to climate change within affected regions, implying that local production losses could be compensated through intensification and expansion of production elsewhere. However, this requires that site-level actions are integrated into a regional approach to climate change adaptation. We discuss here such a regional approach for cocoa in West Africa, where 70 % of global cocoa supply originates. On the basis of a statistical model of relative climatic suitability calibrated on West African cocoa farming areas and average climate projections for the 2030s and 2050s of, respectively, 15 and 19 Global Circulation Models, we divide the region into three adaptation zones: (i) a little affected zone permitting intensification and/or expansion of cocoa farming; (ii) a moderately affected zone requiring diversification and agronomic adjustments of farming practices; and (iii) a severely affected zone with need for progressive crop change. We argue that for tropical agricultural commodities, larger-scale adaptation planning that attempts to balance production trends across countries and regions could help reduce negative impacts of climate change on regional economies and global commodity supplies, despite the institutional challenges that this integration may pose. © 2016, The Author(s).","Adaptation planning; Climate change vulnerability; Crop change; Diversification; Intensification; Theobroma cacao; Zoning","adaptive management; agricultural diversification; agricultural intensification; agricultural production; climate change; cocoa; coffee; commodity; geographical region; heterogeneity; nature-society relations; spatial distribution; tropical region; vulnerability; zonation; West Africa; Coffea; Theobroma cacao",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960435393

However EIA laws have also been neglected by many decision-makers who have been underestimating its impact on RE development and the stifling potential they possess. As a consequence, apart from acknowledging the shortcomings of the systems currently in place, few governments momentarily have concrete plans to reform their EIA laws. By looking at recent EIA streamlining efforts in two industrialized regions that underwent major transformations in their energy sectors, this paper attempts to assess how such reform efforts can act as a means to support the balancing of environmental protection and climate change mitigation with socio-economic challenges. Thereby this paper fills this intellectual void by identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the Japanese EIA law by contrasting it with the recently revised EIA Directive of the European Union (EU). This enables the identification of the regulatory provisions that impact RE development the most and the determination of how structured EIA law reforms would affect domestic RE project development. The main focus lies on the evaluation of regulatory streamlining efforts in the Japanese and EU contexts through the application of a mixed-methods approach, consisting of in-depth literary and legal reviews, followed by a comparative analysis and a series of semi-structured interviews. Highlighting several legal inconsistencies in combination with the views of EIA professionals, academics and law- and policymakers, allowed for a more comprehensive assessment of what streamlining elements of the reformed EU EIA Directive and the proposed Japanese EIA framework modifications could either promote or stifle further RE deployment. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Environmental Impact Assessment Law; European Union; Japan; Renewable energy; Streamlining","Climate change; Decision making; Energy policy; Environmental impact assessments; Environmental regulations; Laws and legislation; Climate change mitigation; Environmental impact assessments (EIA); European union; Japan; Renewable energies; Renewable energy projects; Semi structured interviews; Streamlining; Environmental impact; climate change; decision making; energy resource; environmental protection; European Union; governance approach; renewable resource; socioeconomic status; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019210173

However, carbon gains in second-growth forests are threatened by non-permanence, i.e. release of carbon into the atmosphere from clearing or disturbance. The benefits of second-growth forests require long-term persistence on the landscape, but estimates of carbon potential rarely consider the spatio-temporal landscape dynamics of second-growth forests. In this study, we used remotely sensed imagery from a landscape in the Peruvian Amazon to examine patterns of second-growth forest regrowth and permanence over 28 years (1985-2013). By 2013, 44% of all forest cover in the study area was second growth and more than 50% of second-growth forest pixels were less than 5 years old. We modeled probabilities of forest regrowth and clearing as a function of landscape factors. The amount of neighboring forest and variables related to pixel position (i.e. distance to edge) were important for predicting both clearing and regrowth. Forest age was the strongest predictor of clearing probability and suggests a threshold response of clearing probability to age. Finally, we simulated future trajectories of carbon sequestration using the parameters from our models. We compared this with the amount of biomass that would accumulate under the assumption of second-growth permanence. Estimates differed by 900 000 tonnes, equivalent to over 80% of Peru's commitment to carbon sequestration through 'community reforestation' under the Paris Agreement. Though the study area has more than 40 000 hectares of second-growth forest, only a small proportion is likely to accumulate significant carbon. Instead, cycles between forest and non-forest are common. Our results illustrate the importance of considering landscape dynamics when assessing the carbon sequestration potential of second-growth forests. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","climate change mitigation; land-use dynamics; Peruvian Amazon; remote sensing; secondary forest","Climate change; Dynamics; Land use; Pixels; Probability; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sequestration potential; Climate change mitigation; Land use dynamics; Peruvian amazons; Remotely sensed imagery; Second-growth forests; Secondary forests; Forestry; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; clearcutting; climate change; environmental modeling; forest cover; forest management; imagery; international agreement; land use change; pixel; reforestation; regrowth; remote sensing; secondary forest; spatiotemporal analysis; tropical forest; Amazonas [Peru]; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025584062

Since we use a fully coupled Earth system model, our results include a range of feedbacks, such as the response of marine DMS production to the additional changes in temperature and sea ice cover. Our results are broadly consistent with the findings of a previous study that employed an offline model set-up. Assuming a medium (strong) sensitivity of DMS production to pH, we find an additional transient global warming of 0.30 K (0.47 K) towards the end of the 22nd century when DMS emissions are reduced by 7.3 Tg S yr-1 or 31 % (11.5 Tg S yr-1 or 48 %). The main mechanism behind the additional warming is a reduction of cloud albedo, but a change in shortwave radiative fluxes under clear-sky conditions due to reduced sulfate aerosol load also contributes significantly. We find an approximately linear relationship between reduction of DMS emissions and changes in top of the atmosphere radiative fluxes as well as changes in surface temperature for the range of DMS emissions considered here. For example, global average Ts changes by -0. 041 K per 1 Tg S yr-1 change in sea-air DMS fluxes. The additional warming in our model has a pronounced asymmetry between northern and southern high latitudes. It is largest over the Antarctic continent, where the additional temperature increase of 0.56 K (0.89 K) is almost twice the global average. We find that feedbacks are small on the global scale due to opposing regional contributions. The most pronounced feedback is found for the Southern Ocean, where we estimate that the additional climate change enhances sea-air DMS fluxes by about 9 % (15 %), which counteracts the reduction due to ocean acidification. © Author(s) 2017.",,"air-sea interaction; albedo; amplification; clear sky; climate change; climate feedback; climate modeling; dimethylsulfide; emission inventory; flux measurement; global warming; ice cover; ocean acidification; pH; sea ice; shortwave radiation; surface temperature; Antarctica; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027265744

However, mountain OC dynamics are poorly quantified. We quantified OC storage in subalpine lake deltas in the Washington Central Cascades and Colorado Front Range with the objectives of determining the magnitude of transient carbon storage and understanding the differences in storage between the two ranges. We used field, laboratory, and GIS techniques to determine the magnitude of and controls on the subalpine lake delta OC pool in 26 subalpine lake deltas. Soil moisture, soil texture, mean basin slope, and delta valley confinement are significantly correlated with soil carbon on deltas. Average soil OC concentration on subalpine lake deltas ranges from 3 to 41%, and stocks range from 140 to 1256 Mg C/ha. Surprisingly, the carbon content of subalpine lake deltas is not significantly different between the two regions, despite stark contrasts in their climate, vegetation, and total ecosystem carbon stocks. We present a conceptual model that invokes geomorphic and biogeochemical processes to suggest that carbon is more likely to reach subalpine lake deltas from the upstream basin in the Colorado Front Range compared with the Washington Central Cascades, thus accounting for the similarity in OC storage between the two regions despite differences in total ecosystem carbon stocks and climate. This points to a complex interaction among carbon production, transport, and stability in each region, and supports the idea that geomorphic and biogeochemical processes determine the magnitude of transient OC storage more strongly than primary productivity or climate.

These private standards hold considerable promise but suffer to different degrees from certain weaknesses, notably a lack of transparency, a low level of ambition and concerns about data reliability. This article examines these deficiencies together with the reasons for them, and assesses the role that law could play in addressing them. It argues that the conditions may be present for the mitigation of shipping's GHG emissions to become a site of 'hybrid' governance, combining private standards and state/supra-state law in a productive way. © The Author 2017.

PtRu/C and Ru/C catalysts were used in gas diffusion cathodes for the reduction of humidified CO2. An IrRuOx catalyst was used for the oxygen evolution from liquid water at the anode. This electrochemical reactor employed a perfluorosulfonic acid membrane electrolyte separator (Nafion®) and it was operated in a temperature range from 30 °C to 95 °C. The cathode catalysts were characterized by well-dispersed metal nanoparticles (2 nm mean particle size) on a carbon black support. Electrochemical polarization tests were carried out in the presence of CO2 or with humidified inert gas for comparison. The results evidenced that direct CO2 reaction on the catalysts surface was essentially occurring at low cell voltages (&lt;1.6 V), whereas the occurrence of water splitting (hydrogen evolution) was largely prevailing at high cell voltages.

There is convincing evidence that PM, almost regardless of source, has detrimental health effects. An important issue in health impact assessments is what metric, indicator and exposure response function to use for different types of PM. The aim of this study is to describe sectorial contributions to PM exposure and related premature mortality for three Swedish cities: Gothenburg, Stockholm and Umea. Exposure is calculated with high spatial resolution using atmospheric dispersion models. Attributed premature mortality is calculated separately for the main local sources and the contribution from long‐range transport (LRT), applying different relative risks. In general, the main part of the exposure is due to LRT, while for black carbon, the local sources are equally or more important. The major part of the premature deaths is in our assessment related to local emissions, with road traffic and residential wood combustion having the largest impact. This emphasizes the importance to resolve within‐city concentration gradients when assessing exposure. It also implies that control actions on local PM emissions have a strong potential in abatement strategies. © 2017 by the authors.

However, cities typically lack comprehensive data on total life cycle impacts of various conventional and alternative fueled vehicles (AFV) considered for fleet purchase. The City of Houston, Texas, has been a leader in incorporating hybrid electric (HEV), plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV), and battery electric (BEV) vehicles into its fleet, but has yet to adopt any natural gas-powered light-duty vehicles. The City is considering additional AFV purchases but lacks systematic analysis of emissions and costs. Using City of Houston data, we calculate total fuel cycle GHG and air pollutant emissions of additional conventional gasoline vehicles, HEVs, PHEVs, BEVs, and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles to the City's fleet. Analyses are conducted with the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model. Levelized cost per kilometer is calculated for each vehicle option, incorporating initial purchase price minus residual value, plus fuel and maintenance costs. Results show that HEVs can achieve 36% lower GHG emissions with a levelized cost nearly equal to a conventional sedan. BEVs and PHEVs provide further emissions reductions, but at levelized costs 32% and 50% higher than HEVs, respectively. CNG sedans and trucks provide 11% emissions reductions, but at 25% and 63% higher levelized costs, respectively.

This paper uses the countervailing powers framework to explore the role of state public health agencies as arbiters of quality and safety, specifically through their efforts to encourage physicians to follow evidence-based recommendations for screening for hereditary cancers. Social scientists have often viewed actions by the state to regulate cost, quality, or safety as a threat to physician autonomy. This paper draws on case studies from two US states—Michigan and Connecticut—to better understand the specific role of state public health agencies, and especially whether their activities to encourage adherence to evidence-based recommendations bolster or subvert the interests of other parties in the healthcare arena. We find that lacking authority to compel provider to follow evidence-based recommendations, they improvised ways to foster compliance voluntarily, for example, by emphasizing the role of the physician as gatekeeper, thus affirming the importance of physician autonomy and clinical judgment. Both states also used public health surveillance data to make rare diseases visible and illustrate gaps between recommendations and practice. Finally, they both showed that following evidence-based recommendations could align the professional and market interests of healthcare stakeholders. Both states employed similar strategies with similar effects, despite substantial differences in the regulatory climate and organizational capacity. Taken as a whole, their activities orchestrated a countervailing response that checked the profit-seeking motives of commercial laboratories. Our findings demonstrate that rather than eroding physician autonomy, state action to monitor healthcare quality and encourage adherence to evidence-based recommendations can actually reinforce physician authority. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Countervailing powers; Evidence-based medicine; Genetic testing; Health care quality; Professional autonomy; Public health organizations; Public health policy; United States","autonomy; health care; health worker; public health; Article; breast cancer; cancer screening; evidence based medicine; genetic screening; health care cost; health care planning; health care policy; health care quality; health economics; health promotion; health survey; human; medical sociology; ovary cancer; physician; professional practice; protocol compliance; public health service; United States; Connecticut; evidence based practice; government; legislation and jurisprudence; Michigan; organization and management; physician; preventive health service; private sector; procedures; public health service; standards; trends; Connecticut; Michigan; United States; Pyronia tithonus; Connecticut; Diagnostic Services; Evidence-Based Practice; Genetic Testing; Humans; Michigan; Physicians; Private Sector; Professional Autonomy; Public Health Practice; State Government; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020746656

A major portion (68–81%) of the urban waste of Bangladesh is composed of food waste, which produce CH4 as they decompose anaerobically. The trends of waste generation indicate a growing rate of 0.1343 million tonnes per year. This study estimates that greenhouse gases (GHGs) of 1.29 million tonnes CO2 equivalent (CO2e) is emitted annually because of composting. This study also estimates that CH4 generated from existing solid waste is 250.95 million tonnes CO2e and 2.89 million USD could be saved as part of energy production through recovery of CH4 from landfill. The existing waste management policy neither includes any waste to energy recovery targets, nor does it explain any recycling or reuse targets. Besides, there are no provisions for incentives for waste minimization. Hence, this study proposes to formulate a comprehensive waste management policy considering reduction of greenhouse gas by reviewing existing laws on waste management system.

In this paper, we estimate Tibet's energy consumption using limited online documents, and we calculate the 2014 energy-related and process-related CO2 emissions of Tibet and its seven prefecture-level administrative divisions for the first time. Our results show that 5.52 million tons of CO2 were emitted in Tibet in 2014; 33% of these emissions are associated with cement production. Tibet's emissions per capita amounted to 1.74 tons in 2014, which is substantially lower than the national average, although Tibet's emission intensity is relatively high at 0.60 tons per thousand yuan in 2014. Among Tibet's seven prefecture-level administrative divisions, Lhasa City and Shannan Region are the two largest CO2 contributors and have the highest per capita emissions and emission intensities. The Nagqu and Nyingchi regions emit little CO2 due to their farming/pasturing-dominated economies. This quantitative measure of Tibet's regional CO2 emissions provides solid data support for Tibet's actions on climate change and emission reductions. © 2017 The Authors.","Cities; CO2 emisions; Energy Consumption; Tibet","administrative system; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cement; climate change; emission control; energy use; industrial development; China; Lhasa; Nyingchi; Xizang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029081865

The response of past societies to climatic variability, particularly in terms of water management, can provide useful insights into the timing and scale of response to future events. We present a regional case study from South India to illustrate the influence of climate on shaping the rise and economic prosperity of the Chola Kingdom from 850 to 1280 ce – a period approximately coinciding with the Medieval Climatic Anomaly. An investigation of instrumental and proxy climatic data sets between 500 and 2010 ce indicates that the period between ~850 and ~1300 ce, a time of frequent El Niño-like conditions, was associated with a substantial increase in North-East Indian monsoon rainfall (NEIMR), whereas South-West Indian monsoon rainfall (SWIMR) suffered substantial deficits. The spatial pattern and chronology of water harvesting infrastructure development under Chola rule indicate that these features were concentrated in the NEIMR-receiving regions of southeastern India and that their construction peaked during El Niño-dominated intervals. Overall, enhanced NEIMR conditions and adaptation strategies practiced in the Chola’s territory, combined with less favorable climatic conditions over the neighboring kingdoms, appears to have underpinned the well-documented political and economic strengths of the Chola superpower. We infer that the water management infrastructure promoted by the Chola rulers helped to buffer the consequences of climatic extremes in later history, whether droughts (e.g. the El Niño-related mega-drought of 1876–1878) or floods (because the reservoirs can contain surplus runoff).

Modern technologies enable bioenergy to be used with increased efficiencies and reduced pollution and smoke which can also improve the health of women. Some of the most promising and available bioenergy technologies that provide solutions for a wide range of village applications with optimization potential to suit local conditions are described. The use of bioenergy in an integrated and holistic manner to accelerate the development of villages and ways to maximize its impacts by addressing the issues in preparing local plans for large-scale application have been discussed. Parameters for selecting technologies, equipment, and power plants (also as renewable hybrid units) which can transform villages in a socially, economically, and ecologically sustainable manner have been described. The experience of designing, building and operating power plants, energy services, and related equipment in rural areas have been summarized on the basis of results of a large number of test, pilot and commercial demonstration projects in rural areas of developing countries, especially India.

The high carbonate content of the target zone enables effective fracture stimulations, but the well performance along the Utica trend is variable; some strong producers are edged out by modest or low producing wells. Each well performance depends on how accurately horizontal drilling and multistage fracturing have been executed in the shale play. The efficiency of fracturing depends on many factors, but brittleness is one of the most important ones. However, there is no universally accepted indicator of brittleness. For the present study, mechanical as well as mineralogical attempts have been made to extract the brittleness information for the Utica play. While an attempt is made to determine brittleness from mechanical rock physics parameters (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) derived from seismic data, the available XRD data and regional petrophysical modelling make it possible to determine the brittleness index based on mineralogical data and thereafter be derived from seismic data. © 2017 SEG.",,"Brittleness; Elastic moduli; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Gas industry; Geophysical prospecting; Horizontal wells; Infill drilling; Plasticity; Seismic waves; Carbonate content; Drilling fracturing; Effective fracture; Fracture stimulation; Low producing wells; Mechanical; Multistage fracturing; Oil and Gas Industry; Shale plays; Well performance; Seismic response",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120338486

During massive rural-urban migration, population and pollutant emissions from RTC have evolved in terms of magnitude and geographic distribution, which was thought to worsen PM2.5 levels in cities but has not been quantitatively addressed. We quantify the temporal trends and spatial patterns of migration to cities and evaluate their associated pollutant emissions from RTC and subsequent health impact from 1980 to 2030. We show that, despite increased urban RTC emissions due to migration, the net effect of migration in China has been a reduction of PM2.5 exposure, primarily because of an unequal distribution of RTC energy mixes between urban and rural areas. After migration, people have switched to cleaner fuel types, which considerably lessened regional emissions. Consequently, the national average PM2.5 exposure concentration in 2010 was reduced by 3.9 mg/m3 (90% confidence interval, 3.0 to 5.4 μg/m3) due to migration, corresponding to an annual reduction of 36,000 (19,000 to 47,000) premature deaths. This reduction was the result of an increase in deaths by 142,000 (78,000 to 181,000) due to migrants swarming into cities and decreases in deaths by 148,000 (76,000 to 194,000) and 29,000 (15,000 to 39,000) due to transitions to a cleaner energy mix and lower urban population densities, respectively. Locally, however, megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai experienced increases in PM2.5 exposure associated with migration because these cities received massive immigration, which has driven a large increase in local emissions. © Copyright 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved.",,"Energy utilization; Geographical distribution; Pollution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Rural areas; Confidence interval; Exposure concentration; Fine particulate matter; PM2.5 concentration; Pollutant emission; Transportation energy consumption; Urban and rural areas; Urban population; Particles (particulate matter); article; China; controlled study; death; energy consumption; human; migrant; population migration; rural area; urban population; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034105429

However, their effect on carbon exchange in different ecosystems has not been well evaluated. Understanding how biochar affects carbon exchange from agricultural soil is essential for clarifying the contribution of biochar management to the carbon budget. We performed a laboratory and a two-year field experiment to investigate the short- and medium-term effects of biochar application on CO2 emissions from semiarid farmland. There was no statistically significant alteration in the cumulative CO2 emissions from the mixture of soil with biochar alone, while the emissions increased significantly with additional nitrogen amendment over the 46-day experimental period. Over the two-year experimental period, the cumulative CO2 emissions from the field experiment decreased in the biochar-amended treatment, and the effects were significant at high application rates (20 and 30 t·ha−1 ) relative to the control in the MS. The seasonal CO2 dynamics were strongly dependent on soil temperature, with a higher correlation with the temperature at a depth of 10cm than with the temperature at a depth of 0cm. Soil temperature, rather than soil water content, was the major environmental factor controlling the soil carbon exchange in the semiarid farmland of the Loess Plateau. In general, biochar additions enhanced aboveground dry matter accumulation in both the early and late stages of maize growth. The results suggested that biochar amendment was a preferable management practice to help maintain or increase carbon sequestration for this region with lower CO2 emissions and higher dry matter production over a longer period. © 2017 by the authors.

This paper analyzed the effects of evolutionary behaviors of REDD+ implementers and donors with respect to environmental service payments. Within a theoretical analysis framework, the evolutionary stable strategies of the implementers and donors under different contractual payments for ecosystem services (PES) scenarios are analyzed to explore contractual REDD+ payments through evolutionary game models. On this basis, anon-parametric local regression approach is used to analyze arrange of market-based contractual PES schemes in five REDD+ countries (Congo, Brazil, Ecuador, Nepal and Uganda). The results show the following: First, when the opportunity costs are less than the environmental benefits, some middle and high income developing countries are sufficiently incentivized to conserve forests, even without formal contractual PES scheme. This conservation occurs regardless of whether the industrialized countries will pay for the ecosystem services. Second, when the opportunity costs are greater than the environmental benefits, developing countries will generally not take the initiative to conserve forests when industrialized countries do not pay for the associated ecosystem services. Third, when there are enough contractual PES fines, developing countries will conserve forests, and the industrialized countries will pay for the ecosystem services. Finally, contractual PES fines are related to the costs of reducing emissions. Nepal has the largest marginal effect, and Uganda has the smallest. These results have implications for REDD+ program design and implementation: market-based contractual PES scheme should be given priority to regulate behavior of industrialized countries and developing countries in the PES scheme. Developing a targeted and differentiated contractual PES scheme requires an accounting of emission reduction costs in different countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Deforestation; Evolutionary game; Non-parametric local regression; Payments for ecosystem service; REDD+","Commerce; Cost reduction; Costs; Deforestation; Developing countries; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Forestry; Virtual reality; Environmental development; Evolutionary games; Evolutionary stable strategies; Industrialized countries; Local regression; Payments for ecosystem services; Payments for ecosystem services (PES); REDD; Ecosystems; deforestation; degradation; design method; developing world; economic development; ecosystem service; emission control; environmental protection; incentive; regression analysis; sustainable development; willingness to pay; Brazil; Congo; Ecuador; Nepal; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018632229

First, driving condition data of hybrid electric buses are collected and analyzed, and three typical working conditions are selected. Second, the torque distribution control strategy is investigated based on the instantaneous optimization algorithm. The objective function of the instantaneous equivalent fuel consumption is derived. The process of solving the objective function is attributed to linear programming problem of the nonlinear objective function. The SIMULINK model of instantaneous torque distribution strategy is established based on equivalent fuel consumption. On this basis, the SIMULINK model of the function which can be integrated into the vehicle control model is established. Then, considering the actual driving conditions of the bus, the vehicle control strategy model is established in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment, and the vehicle model established by the cruise software. Finally, the vehicle model is simulated under three representative working conditions. The main contribution of this paper is the optimized torque distribution control strategy to control hybrid electric bus's energy distribution and reduce emissions. The strategy can be obtained by combining the logic threshold torque distribution control strategy, along with the optimal engine torque and motor torque, which can be obtained by solving the objective function of instantaneous equivalent fuel consumption. Results show that compared with the logic threshold value torque distribution control strategy, the energy control strategy of the instantaneous optimization algorithm can further reduce gas consumption and maintain the state of charge value balance of the power battery. © 2013 IEEE.","driving condition; instantaneous optimization; logic threshold value; Parallel hybrid electric bus; torque distribution control strategy","Buses; Charging (batteries); Computer circuits; Control system synthesis; Electric batteries; Fuels; Hybrid vehicles; Linear programming; MATLAB; Optimization; Secondary batteries; Torque; Vehicles; Driving conditions; Equivalent fuel consumption; Linear programming problem; MATLAB/Simulink environment; Nonlinear objective functions; Parallel hybrids; Threshold-value; Torque distribution control; Battery management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028501623

The structure and function of CBR1 and CBR3 are also compared. In addition, the formation of chiral alcohols from CBR1 reduction and MIST coverage are reviewed. Expert Opinion: As CBR1 is an emerging enzyme in drug discovery and development, much research is needed to further understand its role in drug metabolism and disposition. In vitro-in vivo correlation for CBR1-mediated clearance is mostly unknown. Selective CBR1 inhibitors and substrates are not well enough characterized for reaction phenotyping of the CBR1 pathway.

Mars experienced widespread volcanism in the past and volcanic emissions should have included reducing gases, such as H2 and CO, as well as sulfur-bearing gases. Using a one-dimensional photochemical model, we consider whether plausible volcanic gas fluxes could have switched the redox-state of the past martian atmosphere to reducing conditions. In our model, the total quantity and proportions of volcanic gases depend on the water content, outgassing pressure, and oxygen fugacity of the source melt. We find that, with reasonable melt parameters, the past martian atmosphere (∼3.5 Gyr to present) could have easily reached reducing and anoxic conditions with modest levels of volcanism, &gt;0.14 km3 yr−1, which are well within the range of estimates from thermal evolution models or photogeological studies. Counter-intuitively we also find that more reducing melts with lower oxygen fugacity require greater amounts of volcanism to switch a paleo-atmosphere from oxidizing to reducing. The reason is that sulfur is more stable in such melts and lower absolute fluxes of sulfur-bearing gases more than compensate for increases in the proportions of H2 and CO. These results imply that ancient Mars should have experienced periods with anoxic and reducing atmospheres even through the mid-Amazonian whenever volcanic outgassing was sustained at sufficient levels. Reducing anoxic conditions are potentially conducive to the synthesis of prebiotic organic compounds, such as amino acids, and are therefore relevant to the possibility of life on Mars. Also, anoxic reducing conditions should have influenced the type of minerals that were formed on the surface or deposited from the atmosphere. We suggest looking for elemental polysulfur (S8) as a signature of past reducing atmospheres. Finally, our models allow us to estimate the amount of volcanically sourced atmospheric sulfate deposited over Mars’ history, approximately ∼106–109 Tmol, with a spread depending on assumed outgassing rate history and magmatic source conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Atmosphere chemistry; Mars atmosphere; Photochemistry; Sulfur; Volcanism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014732555

Protobind lignin (produced by soda pulping of a wheat straw) was characterized by thermogravimetry, calorimetry (for glass transition temperature and heat of pyrolysis reactions), in situ 1H NMR (for the analysis of the mobility of protons upon lignin thermal conversion), and solution-state 13C and 31P NMR (determination of functional groups in lignin). In situ rheology reveals the real-time viscoelastic behavior of lignin as a function of temperature. Upon heating, lignin undergoes softening, through glass transition overlapped with depolymerization, and is followed by the solidification of the softened material by cross-linking reactions. The lignin residues were quenched within the rheometer at the midpoint temperatures of softening and solidification regions and were further analyzed by elemental analysis, GPC-UV of acetylated THF soluble fractions, FTIR, solid 13C NMR, and laser desorption ionization (LDI) combined with very high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). We present the first report on lignin biochars analysis by LDI-HRMS. NMR and FTIR analyses provide the evolution of functional moieties in lignin residues. 13C NMR, GPC-UV, and LDI FTICRMS analyses depict the depolymerization mechanism combined with cross-linking and demethoxylation reactions.

The most widely used inducible promoter for diatoms is for nitrate reductase, however, nitrogen metabolism is tied into diverse aspects of cellular function, and the induction response is not necessarily robust. Silicon limitation offers a means to eliminate energy and metabolic flux into cell division processes, with little other detrimental effect on cellular function, and a protein expression system that works under those conditions could be advantageous. Results: In this study, we evaluate a number of promoters for recombinant protein expression induced by silicon limitation and repressed by the presence of silicon in the diatoms Thalassiosira pseudonana and Cyclotella cryptica. In addition to silicon limitation, we describe additional strategies to elevate recombinant protein expression level, including inclusion of the 5' fragment of the coding region of the native gene and reducing carbon flow into ancillary processes of pigment synthesis and formation of photosynthetic storage products. We achieved yields of eGFP to 1.8% of total soluble protein in C. cryptica, which is about 3.6-fold higher than that obtained with chloroplast expression and ninefold higher than nuclear expression in another well-established algal system. Conclusions: Our studies demonstrate that the combination of inducible promoter and other strategies can result in robust expression of recombinant protein in a nuclear-based expression system in diatoms under silicon limited conditions, separating the protein expression regime from growth processes and improving overall recombinant protein yields. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cyclotella cryptica; Diatom; Fatty acid synthesis inhibition; Inducible promoter; Protein expression; Silicon transporter; Silicon-limitation; Thalassiosira pseudonana; Transformation","algal protein; enhanced green fluorescent protein; green fluorescent protein; oxidoreductase; phytoene dehydrogenase; recombinant protein; silicon; antagonists and inhibitors; biosynthesis; chemistry; chloroplast; diatom; fluorescence microscopy; gene vector; genetics; metabolism; promoter region; Algal Proteins; Chloroplasts; Diatoms; Genetic Vectors; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Oxidoreductases; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Recombinant Proteins; Silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027532209

Using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and satellite-derived PM2.5 data, sulfate and ammonium levels were estimated over China from 2004 to 2014. A comparison of the satellite-estimated dataset with model simulations based on ground measurements obtained from the literature indicated our results are more accurate. Using satellite-derived PM2.5 data with a spatial resolution of 0.1 × 0.1°, we further presented finer satellite-estimated sulfate and ammonium concentrations in anthropogenic polluted regions, including the NCP (the North China Plain), the SCB (the Sichuan Basin) and the PRD (the Pearl River Delta). Linear regression results obtained on a national scale yielded an r value of 0.62, NMB of -35.9%, NME of 48.2%, ARB_50% of 53.68% for sulfate and an r value of 0.63, slope of 0.67, and intercept of 5.14 for ammonium. In typical regions, the satellite-derived dataset was significantly robust. Based on the satellite-derived dataset, the spatial-temporal variation of 11-year annual average satellite-derived SO42- and NH4+ concentrations and time series of monthly average concentrations were also investigated. On a national scale, both exhibited a downward trend each year between 2004 and 2014 (SO42-: -0.61%; NH4+: -0.21%), large values were mainly concentrated in the NCP and SCB. For regions captured at a finer resolution, the inter-annual variation trends presented a positive trend over the periods 2004-2007 and 2008-2011, followed by a negative trend over the period 2012-2014, and sulfate concentrations varied appreciably. Moreover, the seasonal distributions of the 11-year satellite-derived dataset over China were presented. The distribution of both sulfate and ammonium concentrations exhibited seasonal characteristics, with the seasonal concentrations ranking as follows: winter &gt; summer &gt; autumn &gt; spring. High concentrations of these species were concentrated in the NCP and SCB, originating from coal-fired power plants and agricultural activities, respectively. Efforts to reduce sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions have yielded remarkable results since the government has adopted stricter control measures in recent years. Moreover, ammonia emissions should be controlled while reducing the concentration of sulfur, nitrogen and particulate matter.

Increasing numbers of cities are creating climate adaptation plans and strategies, and a wide range of international organizations are developing tools and programs to promote and support further planning, despite the fact that the few studies to date that have evaluated adaptation planning have found it to be ineffective: focused more on broad visions than specific actions. To understand why cities continue to engage in adaptation planning, what benefits planners anticipate, and whether these benefits can be achieved through vision-oriented strategies as well as action-based plans, this study reports on a qualitative case study of the creation and adoption of the 2011 London, United Kingdom, Climate Change Adaptation Strategy. Results from interviews with participants and stakeholders indicate the London Strategy was consciously developed as a vision-setting strategy and was successful in: raising awareness of cross-sectoral risks, coordinating pre-existing adaptation efforts, validating stakeholder engagement, providing political authorization for use of resources and personnel, and creating continuity of purpose across changing political administrations. To accurately capture these benefits in other urban adaptation planning efforts will require a new evaluation approach.

Consideration is given to producing and injecting low concentration hydrogen admixtures, synthetic methane, or hydrogen/synthetic methane mixtures. Predictions based on time series data for wind generation and electricity demand indicate that excess renewable electricity levels will reach about 40 MW and 45 GW h per annum by 2020, and that it is desirable to achieve a progression in power-to-gas capacity in the preceding period. The findings are indicative for regions transitioning from medium to high renewable power penetrations. To capture an increasing proportion of the growing amount of excess renewable electricity, the following recommendations are made: implement a 4 MW hydrogen admixture plant and hydrogen buffer of 600 kg in 2018; then in 2020, implement a 17 MW hybrid system for injecting hydrogen and synthetic methane (with a hydrogen storage capacity of at least 400 kg) in conjunction with a bio-methane injection plant.

This study explores how an individual's perception of climate change impacts may influence their support for adaptation actions. Results of a survey of the U.S. public (n = 653) indicates that individuals who believe climate change impacts are unlikely to happen or will primarily affect other people in other places are less likely to be concerned about climate change impacts and less likely to support climate adaptation. However, an individual's support for climate change adaptation measures is not influenced by their perception of when climate change impacts will occur even when taking into account concern for climate impacts. Critical for policy-makers, a belief that climate adaptation measures will not be effective attenuates the relationship between psychological distance, concern for climate change impacts, and adaptation policy measures. Our results indicate that to effectively communicate about climate change, policy-makers should emphasize that: (i) climate change impacts are occurring, (ii) that their constituents are being affected now, or will be in the future, and (iii) communicate that adaptation measures can be effective in addressing risks associated with climate change impacts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change adaptation; Climate change impacts; Climate change policy; Climate communications; Psychological distance","adaptation; African American; American Indian; Article; Asian American; attitude; climate change; environmental policy; European American; human; major clinical study; priority journal; psychological aspect; public opinion; public policy; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018509377

The present paper presents the results of the petrological study carried out on the lignites of the Saurashtra basin. For this purpose samples were collected from lower and upper lignite seams from the Surkha lignite mine of Bhavnagar, Saurashtra. These samples were subjected to detailed petrographic analysis (both maceral and microlithotype). The study reveals that these lignites are dominantly composed of huminite group macerals while liptinite and inertinite group macerals occur in subordinate amounts. These lignites have attained a thermal maturity up to 0.28-0.30 percent vitrinite reflectance (VRr) which classifies them as ‘low rank C’ coals. Moreover, Bhavnagar lower lignite seam shows relatively less gelification as compared to the upper seam which suffered relatively more biochemical degradation. These lignites are characterized by high gelification index (GI) and low tissue preservation index (TPI). With the help of petrography based facies models an attempt has been made to reconstruct the environment of the paleomire of these lignites. © 2017, Geological Society of India.",,"coal seam; Eocene; lignite; maceral; mire; paleoenvironment; petrography; petrology; thermal maturity; vitrinite reflectance; Arabian Sea; Bhavnagar; Gujarat; India; Saurashtra Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025099090

Coastal floods, droughts, wildfires, strong wind, hail, excessive heat, extreme cold, and heavy snow events all had detectable effects. Attention was reliably higher directly after events began, compared to directly before. Financial damage associated with the weather events had a positive and significant effect on attention, although the effect was small. The abnormality of each weather event’s occurrence compared to local historical activity was also a significant predictor. In particular and in line with past research, relative abnormalities in temperature (local warming) generated attention to climate change.

Some of the key factors that affect the risks to urban areas include climate change, the densification of assets within cities and the general expansion of urban areas. In this paper, we examine and compare quantitatively the impact of climate change and recent urban development patterns on the exposure of four European cities to pluvial flooding. In particular, we investigate the degree to which pluvial floods of varying severity and in different geographical locations are influenced to the same extent by changes in urban land cover and climate change. We have selected the European cities of Odense, Vienna, Strasbourg and Nice for analyses to represent different climatic conditions, trends in urban development and topographical characteristics. We develop and apply a combined remote-sensing and flood-modelling approach to simulate the extent of pluvial flooding for a range of extreme precipitation events for historical (1984) and present-day (2014) urban land cover and for two climate-change scenarios (i.e. representative concentration pathways, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Changes in urban land cover are estimated using Landsat satellite imagery for the period 1984-2014. We combine the remote-sensing analyses with regionally downscaled estimates of precipitation extremes of current and expected future climate to enable 2-D overland flow simulations and flood-hazard assessments. The individual and combined impacts of urban development and climate change are quantified by examining the variations in flooding between the different simulations along with the corresponding uncertainties. In addition, two different assumptions are examined with regards to the development of the capacity of the urban drainage system in response to urban development and climate change. In the ""stationary"" approach, the capacity resembles present-day design, while it is updated in the ""evolutionary"" approach to correspond to changes in imperviousness and precipitation intensities due to urban development and climate change respectively. For all four cities, we find an increase in flood exposure corresponding to an observed absolute growth in impervious surfaces of 7-12% during the past 30 years of urban development. Similarly, we find that climate change increases exposure to pluvial flooding under both the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The relative importance of urban development and climate change on flood exposure varies considerably between the cities. For Odense, the impact of urban development is comparable to that of climate change under an RCP 8.5 scenario (2081-2100), while for Vienna and Strasbourg it is comparable to the impacts of an RCP 4.5 scenario. For Nice, climate change dominates urban development as the primary driver of changes in exposure to flooding. The variation between geographical locations is caused by differences in soil infiltration properties, historical trends in urban development and the projected regional impacts of climate change on extreme precipitation. Developing the capacity of the urban drainage system in relation to urban development is found to be an effective adaptation measure as it fully compensates for the increase in run-off caused by additional sealed surfaces. On the other hand, updating the drainage system according to changes in precipitation intensities caused by climate change only marginally reduces flooding for the most extreme events. © Author(s) 2017.",,"Drainage; Floods; Precipitation (meteorology); Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Urban growth; Climate change scenarios; Extreme precipitation events; Flood hazard assessment; Geographical locations; Precipitation extremes; Precipitation intensity; Remote sensing analysis; Urban drainage systems; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027894521

In particular, finance ministries are important, since they control the public budget and address environmental issues from a perspective different from environmental actors. The role of finance ministries is especially salient in the European Union's (EU) Emissions Trading System (ETS), which has been subject to interventions to keep up the falling emission allowance price. The price of ETS allowances has dropped to a tenth of the expected price. The drop led to proposals for intervening in the ETS, including postponing the auctioning of emission allowances and structural reform. While the Netherlands and Denmark supported such intervention, Germany blocked an EU decision on the subject for months. To investigate whether the role of finance ministries explains the differences in government positions, this article analyses these three Member States. The analysis shows that finance ministries were involved in the policy processes and reluctantly supported intervening in the ETS. This position was due more to the desire to have a functioning ETS with minimal state intervention than to the fiscal impact of such intervention, as this impact was clouded in uncertainty. However, the finance ministries were not decisive in determining government positions, which were instead determined by the political orientation of the government (in Germany and the Netherlands) and by previous commitments to ambitious EU emission reduction targets (in Denmark). The analysis underlines the importance of studying the role of finance ministries and their different objectives (fiscal, macroeconomic) in environmental policy-making.

But what happens if a country is already a forest sink, absorbing more carbon than it is emitting? This phenomenon has been observed for a number of tropical countries already. We first demonstrate, from data derived from two rounds of the national forest inventory, that this is also the case for Mexico. Despite the fact that quite high rates of deforestation are occurring, on balance this is more than compensated for by the overall process of sequestration by forests that remain forests. We then analyze key documents from 25 countries which indicate that very little attention has been paid to the implications of this forest enhancement process in REDD+ planning. We consider what it means for national REDD+ approaches, focusing on three key elements(1) what kind of baseline would be required under these conditions, to take into account natural forest growth levels; (2) what kinds of REDD+ activities at local level would be most suitable, given that there may be considerable scope for enhancing natural recovery rates of forests in degraded areas and (3) what kind of monitoring system could be developed to check whether these activities do indeed result in additional carbon savings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Degradation; Emissions versus removals; Forest enhancement; Reference levels; Sink; Splitting the difference","Carbon; Degradation; Forest degradation; International policies; Monitoring system; National forest inventories; Reference levels; Sink; Splitting the difference; Tropical countries; Deforestation; Degradation; Forest Management; Removal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016508657

These countries are known to be most vulnerable to weather anomalies, and ENSO thereby has the potential to influence their economic growth. In this study, we investigate the effect of ENSO on economic growth in 69 developing countries, using annual data from 1961 to 2015. We find regime-dependent nonlinearity in the growth response to ENSO shocks. An El Niño event, equivalent to a 1 °C deviation in sea surface temperatures in the Niño3.4 region of the equatorial Pacific, results in one-to-two percent annual growth reduction during the El Niño regime, but the effect is absent during the La Niña regime. In addition, we find that the effect of El Niño is twice-as-large in the tropics relative to temperate areas, and particularly pronounced in Africa and Asia-Pacific. The findings of this study have two important implications. From the modeling standpoint, we find that the growth impacts of ENSO shocks are nonlinear, and vary across regions and climatic zones. From the policy-making standpoint, our findings suggest opportunities for short-term adjustments to climate shock management and international aid programs, depending on the existing state and the intermediate-term patterns of the ENSO cycle. © 2017","Climate shocks; Developing countries; Economic growth; El Niño Southern Oscillation; Nonlinear effect","developing world; economic growth; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; international aid; nature-society relations; nonlinearity; policy making; sea surface temperature; Africa; Asia; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Equatorial)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026223218

This article analyzes past and emerging experiments with carbon market mechanisms in Thailand and Vietnam, in the context of their domestic political economies and the shifting dynamics of the global climate governance regime. Drawing from thirty-three in-depth interviews and document analysis, I show the changing roles of government, the private sector, civil society, and donor and multilateral actors in these countries. Moreover, the article identifies key factors that may play roles in the further—and more synergistic—development of carbon market mechanisms: the generation of domestic demand for carbon credits; building and keeping human capacity and adequate data; creating space for civil society; ensuring coordination within the government and between sectors, notably the energy sector; and establishing further linkages with regional (Asian) and global carbon market mechanisms, such as those in China, Japan, and South Korea. These findings suggest that market-based mechanisms with high social and environmental integrity are one of the options that countries in the Global South have to achieve low-carbon development in the post-Paris climate change regime. © 2017 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"credit provision; emission control; emissions trading; global climate; governance approach; greenhouse gas; international agreement; market system; political economy; synergism; China; Japan; South Korea; Thailand; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026876801

Fluidized bed combustion technology can be considered as a promising and viable option to recover thermal power from lignin-rich residues of a second-generation bioethanol production plant. This work aims at investigating the combustion of lignin-rich residues with coal in a pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed combustor (FBC). An experimental campaign was carried out to study gaseous and particulate emissions and thermal regimes during the combustion of mixtures of coal with 30%w of lignin-rich residues varying bed temperature, excess air and fluidization velocity. A few experimental tests were carried out for comparison using only coal, a mixture of coal with 40%w of lignin-rich residues and a mixture of coal with 20%w of wood chips. The analysis of the experimental results mainly highlights that: 1) the gaseous emissions did not significantly change with respect to coal or to reference biomass-coal mixture at least until the content of lignin-rich residues in the mixture was 30–40%w; 2) the particulate emissions increased with the percentage of residues content, but, at the same, the particulate carbon concentration was significantly reduced. Bottom bed particles were analyzed at the end of each experiments, highlighting the absence of agglomerates. However, a significant enrichment of metals like Fe, Mg, Na, Ca and K, most of them probably coming from the ash of lignin-rich residues, was observed when the FBC was operated under conditions which emphasize ash accumulation inside the bed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Fine particles characterization; Gaseous and particulate emissions; Metal enrichment; Second-generation bioethanol","Air; Bioethanol; Bubble formation; Chemical reactors; Coal; Coal combustion; Ethanol; Fluidization; Fluidized bed combustors; Fluidized beds; Lignin; Mixtures; Particulate emissions; Waste incineration; Wood products; Bubbling fluidized bed combustors; Bubbling fluidized bed reactor; Experimental campaign; Fine particles; Fluidization velocity; Metal enrichment; Particulate carbon; Second generation bioethanol; Fluidized bed combustion; calcium; carbon; coal; iron; lignin; magnesium; potassium; sodium; air fluidized bed; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; combustion; concentration (parameters); controlled study; fluidization; fluidized bed reactor; gas flow; moisture; particle size; particulate matter; residue analysis; steady state; thermal analysis; Emission; Ethanol; Particles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007572007

The closed model fully couples the hydraulics, heat transfer, and compressibility of carbon dioxide, and then the wellbore flow field is presented and analyzed based on field application. The results show that the pressure change of carbon dioxide is 36.7% smaller than that of water along the annulus in the study case. Carbon dioxide changes into supercritical state when the depth equals 700 m ∼830 m in the tubing, and it could maintain in supercritical state in the whole annulus. Both the pressure profile and the temperature profile are highly coupled with the physical properties of carbon dioxide. The density of carbon dioxide is large enough to drive downhole motors and its capacity is much larger than that of air in the wellbore. The pressure increases lightly with increasing mass flow rate in the annulus; however, it is significantly and positively impacted by the outlet pressure. The influence of outlet pressure on temperature profile is negligible in the tubing. The inlet temperature could not impact the pressure profile in the annulus, and its influence on temperature profile mainly lies in the shallow section of the tubing. It is newly validated that supercritical carbon dioxide drilling is more suitable for the exploitation of unconventional reservoirs with narrow pressure windows. The results could lay a theoretical foundation for practical application. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","coiled tubing drilling; heat transfer; hydraulics calculation; pressure profile; supercritical carbon dioxide","Boreholes; Carbon dioxide; Drilling rigs; Flow fields; Heat transfer; Hydraulics; Oil field equipment; Pressure; Reservoirs (water); Supercritical fluid extraction; Temperature control; Underbalanced drilling; Coiled tubing drilling; Hydraulics calculations; Pressure and temperature profiles; Pressure profiles; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Temperature profiles; Theoretical foundations; Unconventional reservoirs; Coiled tubing; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; compressibility; drilling; flow field; heat transfer; numerical model; P-T conditions; pressure field; temperature profile; well logging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018853644

This paper applies a power-mapping technique, Multilevel Stakeholder Influence Mapping (MSIM), to stakeholders in Ghana's agricultural adaptation policy regime. The method provides a quantitative influence score and visual map for actor groups active-in or affected-by the policy process, from the differentiated perspectives of national, regional, and local-level respondents. MSIM, as applied here, seeks to determine the underlying power structure of the adaptation regime and provides insight in to two key power-laden themes: stakeholder participation and multilevel institutional design. Results indicate that when taken collectively (the views of national, regional and local respondents combined) Ghana's adaptation regime is considered bipolar and elite-centred in its power distribution. A distinguishable ‘adaptation establishment’ or dominant group of power holders made up of technical government and international agencies can be identified. Meanwhile, political groups, the private sector, civil society, and universities are considered to wield substantially less power in the regime. Differentiated perspectives (i.e. national, regional or local respondents alone) reveal that several potential cross-level bridging institutions are not considered influential at all operational levels. Farmers, traditional authorities, and the District Assembly, for example, are all considered highly influential from the perspective of local-level respondents, but their counterpart agencies at the national level are not considered influential by policymakers there. Contrary to the hyper-politicized nature of climate change adaptation at international levels, Ghana's policy regime would benefit from increased participation from political agents, as well as from traditional authorities and farmers. These actor groups can help reverse the a-political nature of the adaptation regime, improve power pluralism across actor groups and levels, and facilitate cross-level cooperation between formal and informal institutions crucial to adaptation success. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; agriculture; climate change; Ghana; influence; policy; power","adaptive management; agricultural policy; climate change; environmental policy; participatory approach; policy making; power relations; quantitative analysis; stakeholder; vegetation mapping; visual analysis; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963623316

Implications for ocean ecosystems include shifts in microbial community structure and subsequent modifications to nutrient pathways. Studying how predicted future temperature and CO2 conditions will impact the biogeochemistry of the ocean is important because of the ocean's role in regulating global climate. We determined how elevated temperature and CO2 affect uptake rates of nitrate, urea, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) by 2 size classes (0.7-5.0 and &gt;5.0 μm) of a microbial assemblage collected from coastal California, USA. This microbial community was incubated for 10 d using an ecostat continuous culture system that supplied the microorganisms with either nitrate or urea as the dominant nitrogen source. Biomass parameters, nutrient concentrations, and uptake rates were measured throughout the experiment. In all treatments, urea uptake rates were greater than nitrate, and larger microorganisms had higher uptake rates than smaller microorganisms. Uptake rates of urea and DIC within both size fractions were higher at elevated temperature, and uptake rates of nitrate by smaller microorganisms increased with elevated CO2. These findings suggest that the rate at which nutrients cycle in temperate coastal waters will increase as temperature and CO2 levels rise and that the effect will vary between nitrogen substrates and different microorganisms. © Inter-Research 2017.","CO2; DIC; Microbial communities; Nitrate; Southern California Bight; Temperature; Uptake; Urea","biological uptake; carbon dioxide; community structure; dissolved inorganic carbon; global climate; marine ecosystem; microbial community; nitrate; nutrient cycling; temperature effect; urea; California; Pacific Ocean; Southern California Bight; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027698148

The accuracy of these models is vital, not only for understanding and predicting air quality globally, but also since they are used to quantify the contribution of ozone in the troposphere and lower stratosphere to climate change, where its greenhouse effect is largest. We briefly describe available northern mid-latitude ozone measurements, which include representative and reliable data from European sites that extend back to the 1950s. We use the SOCOLv3 (Solar Climate Ozone Links version 3) global chemistry-climate model to investigate the individual terms of the tropospheric ozone budget. These include: inflow from the stratosphere, dry deposition, and chemical formation and destruction. For 1960 to 2000 SOCOLv3 indicates a tropospheric ozone increase at 850 hPa over the Swiss Alps (Arosa) of 17 ppb, or around 30%. This increase is smaller than that seen in the surface ozone measurements but similar to other chemistry-climate models, including those with more complex NMVOC (Non Methane Volatile Organic Compound) schemes than SOCOLv3's. It is likely that the underestimated increase in tropospheric ozone could be explained by issues in the underlying emissions inventories used in the model simulations, with ozone precursor emissions, particularly NOx (NO + NO2), from the 1960s being too large. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Long-term ozone changes; Model evaluation; Ozone; SOCOL; Troposphere","Air quality; Budget control; Climate models; Greenhouse effect; Nitrogen compounds; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Troposphere; Volatile organic compounds; Chemistry-climate models; Emissions inventory; Model evaluation; Non-methane volatile organic compounds; Ozone changes; Ozone measurements; SOCOL; Tropospheric ozone; Climate change; air quality; atmospheric chemistry; climate change; emission inventory; long-term change; midlatitude environment; ozone; stratosphere; troposphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029826844

Like chlorinated pesticides previously, global climate change is widely considered to be one of the most important environmental challenges of our time. Over the past 30 yr, climate scientists and modelers have shown that greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 cause radiative forcing (climate forcing) and lead to increased global temperatures. Despite significant climate change research efforts worldwide, the climate science community has overlooked potential problems associated with chemical contaminants, in particular how climate change could magnify the ecological consequences of their use and disposal. It is conceivable that the impacts of legacy or new chemical contaminants on wildlife and humans may be exacerbated when climate changes, especially if global temperatures rise as predicted. This lack of attention to chemical contaminants represents an opportunity for environmental toxicologists and chemists to become part of the global research program, and our objective is to highlight the importance of and ways for that to occur.

Technological advancements along with mobile phones and web platforms can aid bicyclists while considering and planning their routes. Moreover, the vast data that can be generated, and thus collected, from smartphones can provide a database that can be used to develop a systematic evaluation of potential routes and provide meaningful information to the bicyclists. Several of these technologies are based on self-monitoring efforts and sharing experiences among bicyclists but they do not provide a systematic and objective evaluation of the infrastructure. Throughout the world, transportation agencies are promoting bicycling as a serious alternative transportation option, since it provides health benefits and reduces carbon emissions and congestion. It is imperative then that transportation agencies can provide an appropriate infrastructure in order to encourage the continued growth of bicycling. The current technological tools can aid in data collection but what is currently lacking is a systematic, objective review of such information that a transportation agency can use aiming to assess existing infrastructure and develop an action plan to complete and improve it.

By using a combined phenotypic and genomic approach, we assessed evidence of adaptation capacity in Eucalyptus loxophleba ssp. lissophloia, a mallee eucalypt important for restoration and oil production in Western Australia. Assessment of leaf traits in nine wild populations across a rainfall gradient showed that two traits were correlated with long-term moisture availability. Populations in more arid environments had lower specific leaf area and lower stomatal conductance, consistent with a stable plastic or adaptive response. Other leaf size and shape traits were correlated with short-term climate variables, suggesting a dynamic plastic response. Genome-wide scans with 4851 DArTseq markers and outlier analysis detected 50 markers showing signals of disruptive selection, consistent with local adaptation. Sixteen markers showed allele frequencies correlated with aridity; three were also associated with differences in stomatal conductance. Multivariate analysis and marker-environment associations signalled secondary directions of adaptation associated with maximum temperatures and soil phosphorus. We suggest that adaptation and acclimation are both likely determinants of functional phenotype in E. loxophleba, and argue that aridity is a critical driver of adaptation in this widespread species. © 2017 The Linnean Society of London.","Climate resilience; DArTseq markers; Genome-wide scan; Leaf traits; Local adaptation; Population genomics; Widespread species","acclimation; ecosystem resilience; environmental gradient; environmental response; environmental restoration; evergreen tree; genetic analysis; genetic marker; genomics; leaf; leaf area; local adaptation; moisture; phenotype; population genetics; rainfall; semiarid region; stomatal conductance; water availability; wild population; Australia; Western Australia; Eucalyptus loxophleba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019725595

This study presents fluxes based on sediment porewater measurements from different water depths of five deep lakes of differing trophic states. In meso- to eutrophic lakes F red was directly proportional to the total organic carbon mass accumulation rate (TOC-MAR) of the sediments. TOC-MAR and thus F red in eutrophic lakes decreased systematically with increasing mean hypolimnion depth (z H), suggesting that high oxygen concentrations in the deep waters of lakes were essential for the extent of organic matter mineralization leaving a smaller fraction for anaerobic degradation and thus formation of reduced compounds. Consequently, F red was low in the 310-m deep meso-eutrophic Lake Geneva, with high O2 concentrations in the hypolimnion. By contrast, seasonal anoxic conditions enhanced F red in the deep basin of oligotrophic Lake Aegeri. As TOC-MAR and z H are based on more readily available data, these relationships allow estimating the areal O2 consumption rate by reduced compounds from the sediments where no direct flux measurements are available. © 2017 Author(s).",,"accumulation rate; anoxic conditions; biomineralization; bottom water; eutrophic environment; flux measurement; hypolimnion; lacustrine deposit; organic carbon; oxygen consumption; sediment chemistry; total organic carbon; Lake Geneva",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023193377

This is due, in part, to the time required to generate estimates of the maximum rate of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco) carboxylation (Vc,max) and the maximal rate of electron transport (Jmax) from the response of photosynthesis (A) to the CO2 concentration inside leaf air spaces (Ci). To relieve this bottleneck, we developed a method for rapid photosynthetic carbon assimilation CO2 responses [rapid A–Ci response (RACiR)] utilizing non-steady-state measurements of gas exchange. Using high temporal resolution measurements under rapidly changing CO2 concentrations, we show that RACiR techniques can obtain measures of Vc,max and Jmax in ~5 min, and possibly even faster. This is a small fraction of the time required for even the most advanced gas exchange instrumentation. The RACiR technique, owing to its increased throughput, will allow for more rapid screening of crops, mutants and populations of plants in natural environments, bringing gas exchange into the phenomic era. © 2017 The Authors Plant, Cell & Environment Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","A–Ci; C3; carboxylation; CO2; gas exchange; phenotyping; photosynthesis","assimilation efficiency; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); enzyme; enzyme activity; gas exchange; phenotype; photosynthesis; carbon dioxide; metabolism; phenotype; photosynthesis; Populus; Carbon Dioxide; Phenotype; Photosynthesis; Populus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014022966

The usual goal of these navigators is to take the user in less time or distance to a destination. However, the global use of navigators in a given city could lead to traffic jams as they have a highly biased preference for some streets. From a general point of view, spreading the traffic throughout the city could be a way of preventing jams and making a better use of public resources. We propose a way of calculating alternative routes to be assigned by these devices in order to foster a better use of the streets. Our experimentation involves maps from OpenStreetMap, real road traffic, and the microsimulator SUMO. We contribute to reducing travel times, greenhouse gas emissions, and fuel consumption. To analyze the sociological aspect of any innovation, we analyze the penetration (acceptance) rate which shows that our proposal is competitive even when just 10% of the drivers are using it. © 2017 ACM.","Application; Evolutionary algorithm; Real world; Road traffic; Smart city; Smart mobility","Applications; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Roads and streets; Smart city; Traffic congestion; Alternative routes; Global use; Public resources; Real roads; Real-world; Road traffic; Traffic jams; Evolutionary algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026356863

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships while in port based on annual data from Port of Gothenburg, Port of Long Beach, Port of Osaka and Sydney Ports. Port call statistics including IMO number, ship name, berth number and time spent at berth for each ship call, were provided by each participating port. The IMO numbers were used to match each port call to ship specifications from the IHS database Sea-web. All data were analysed with a model developed by the IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute for the purpose of quantifying GHG emissions (as CO2-equivalent) from ships in the port area. Emissions from five operational modes are summed in order to account for ship operations in the different traffic areas. The model estimates total GHG emissions of 150,000, 240,000, 97,000, and 95,000 tonnes CO2 equivalents per year for Gothenburg, Long Beach, Osaka, and Sydney, respectively. Four important emission-reduction measures are discussed: reduced speed in fairway channels, on-shore power supply, reduced turnaround time at berth and alternative fuels. It is argued that the potential to reduce emissions in a port area depends on how often a ship revisits a port: there it in general is easier to implement measures for high-frequent liners. Ships that call 10 times or less contribute significantly to emissions in all ports. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; Greenhouse gas emissions; On-shore power supply; Port; Ship pollutants; Slow steaming","Alternative fuels; Beaches; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Greenhouse gases; Ships; Turnaround time; Emission reduction; Environmental researches; Operational modes; Port; Port of long beaches; Shore power; Slow steaming; Transport sectors; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy efficiency; exhaust emission; greenhouse gas; port; California; Canada; Cape Breton Island; Goteborg; Honshu; Japan; Kinki; Long Beach [California]; Nova Scotia; Osaka [Kinki]; Sweden; Sydney [Cape Breton Island]; United States; Vastra Gotaland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019772494

Despite many studies on far-from-equilibrium dissolution, little is known about the detailed mechanisms responsible for calcite dissolution in seawater. In this paper, we dissolve 13C-labeled calcites in natural seawater. We show that the time-evolving enrichment of δ13C in solution is a direct measure of both dissolution and precipitation reactions across a large range of saturation states. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer profiles into the 13C-labeled solids confirm the presence of precipitated material even in undersaturated conditions. The close balance of precipitation and dissolution near equilibrium can alter the chemical composition of calcite deeper than one monolayer into the crystal. This balance of dissolution–precipitation shifts significantly toward a dissolution-dominated mechanism below about Ω = 0.7. Finally, we show that the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) increases the dissolution rate across all saturation states, and the effect is most pronounced close to equilibrium. This finding suggests that the rate of hydration of CO2 is a rate-limiting step for calcite dissolution in seawater. We then interpret our dissolution data in a framework that incorporates both solution chemistry and geometric constraints on the calcite solid. Near equilibrium, this framework demonstrates a lowered free energy barrier at the solid–solution interface in the presence of CA. This framework also indicates a significant change in dissolution mechanism at Ω = 0.7, which we interpret as the onset of homogeneous etch pit nucleation. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

In terms of carbon footprint, transportation is among the major contributors of high carbon intensity in the urban area. This study was conducted to reduce the carbon footprint contributed by the transportation sector in Penang Island by emphasizing the use of public buses. Secondary school students were the target group for this study. They were asked to report their daily travel behaviour and fuel consumption in a travel journal. The fuel consumption data from the travel journal were used to calculate each individual's carbon emission level. After the analyses, the value of carbon emissions was revealed to the students. Next, they were encouraged to use public transport in a motivation session and were asked to record their fuel consumption in the travel journal once again.

A paucity of environmental monitoring prior to development raises questions about baseline conditions in freshwater systems in the region and ecological responses to industrial activities. Further, climatic changes prompt questions about the relative roles of climate and industry in shaping aquatic ecosystems through time. We use aquatic bioindicators from multiple trophic levels, concentrations of petrogenic contaminants (dibenzothiophenes), and spectrally-inferred chlorophyll-a preserved in well-dated sediments of a closed-basin, shallow lake ~ 50 km away from the main area of industry, in conjunction with climate observations, to assess how the biotic assemblages of a typical AOSR lake have changed during the past ~ 75 years. We examine the contributions of the area's stressors in structuring aquatic communities. Increases in sedimentary measures of petrogenic contaminants provide clear evidence of aerial contaminant deposition from local industry since its establishment, while climate records demonstrate consistent warming and a recent period of reduced precipitation. Quantitative comparisons of biological assemblages from before and after the establishment of regional industry find significant (p < 0.05) differences; however, the magnitude and overall timing of the changes are not consistent with a threshold-type shift in response to the onset of regional industry. Rather, biotic assemblages from multiple trophic levels suggest transitions to an increasingly complex benthic environment and relatively warmer waters, which, like the increasing trends in inferred primary production, are consistent with a changing climate. These findings highlight the important role of climate conditions in regulating primary production and structuring aquatic communities in these shallow systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Athabasca Oil Sands Region; Chironomid; Cladoceran; Diatom; Paleolimnology; Shallow lake","Antennas; Aquatic ecosystems; Aquatic organisms; Contamination; Deposition; Impurities; Lake pollution; Lakes; Oil fields; Oil sands; Paleolimnology; Athabasca oil sands; Chironomid; Cladoceran; Diatom; Shallow lakes; Climate change; chlorophyll a; dibenzothiophene derivative; polonium; polycyclic aromatic compound; atmospheric deposition; bioindicator; climate change; community response; environmental monitoring; hydrological response; lake water; oil industry; pollution effect; trophic environment; air pollution; aquatic environment; Article; benthos; Canada; Chironomidae; cladoceran; climate change; concentration (parameters); Crustacea; diatom; habitat; indicator organism; industry; lake; paleolimnology; precipitation; quantitative analysis; radiometric dating; sediment; tar sand; trophic level; warming; Alberta; animal; biota; Cladocera; environmental monitoring; oil and gas field; water pollutant; Alberta; Athabasca Oil Sands; Canada; Bacillariophyta; Chironomidae; Alberta; Animals; Biota; Canada; Chironomidae; Cladocera; Climate Change; Diatoms; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Lakes; Oil and Gas Fields; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015405015

It is important to determine which parameter errors should be reduced to improve the simulation ability of soil carbon. It is essential to determine the most sensitive parameter combination. In this study, a new flexible approach is employed to identify the most sensitive parameter combination based on the conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation related to parameter (CNOP-P) using the Lund-Potsdam-Jena model. The CNOP-P is a type of parameter error that triggers the upper bound of uncertainty in a numerical simulation and prediction, for which a nonlinear effect can be reported. To compare the sensitivity of parameter combinations, the one-at-a-time (OAT) approach is also applied to determine the sensitivity of each parameter. Using the CNOP-P approach, parameter errors can really cause large simulation errors for soil carbon throughout an entire study region (2674.69 g C/m2). Results show the most sensitive parameter combinations of soil carbon are different for five plant functional types (PFTs). For all cases, fair (fraction of decomposed litter emitted as CO2 to the atmosphere) and finter (fraction of soil-bound decomposed litter entering intermediate soil carbon pool) comprise the most sensitive parameter combination for boreal needle-leaved evergreen trees, boreal needle-leaved summergreen trees, temperate broadleaved summergreen trees, temperate broadleaved evergreen trees, and C3 perennial grass. For C3 perennial grass under semi-arid conditions, the hydrology process is also critical in the uncertainty of simulated soil carbon. The most sensitive parameter combination using the new flexible approach is different to that of the top rank of sensitivity of each parameter when employing the CNOP-P and OAT methods, which implies that a nonlinear effect of the parameter combination is crucial for determining the sensitive parameter combination. The sensitivity of the parameter combination is dependent on the PFTs and climate condition. Among factors causing the uncertainty of simulated soil carbon, the fast-decomposing soil carbon pool plays the main contribution. It is considered that the physical process involved in the fast-decomposing soil carbon pool needs to be improved as a priority compared to other physical processes to enhance the simulation ability of soil carbon. © 2017 Sun and Mu.","Conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation related to parameter (CNOP-P); Model parameter errors; Sensitivity of parameter combination; Soil carbon; Uncertainty analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028760177

Methods: We measured CO2 efflux from bryophyte-covered and bryophyte-removed soil surface in two subalpine ecosystems: a conifer dominated forest and an ericaceous dominated shrubland, on the east edge of Tibetan Plateau. In addition, soil temperature (Tsoil), soil water content (SWC), total soil organic C (SOC), dissolved organic C (DOC) and microbial community structure were measured as possible drivers of the bryophyte-effects. Results: Bryophyte removal resulted in reduced floor (bryophyte + soil) and mineral soil CO2 efflux, SOC, DOC, microbial biomass C (MBC) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentrations, and caused a change in soil microbial community in the two ecosystems. The higher soil CO2 emissions from the bryophyte-covered, relative to the bare soil, was not caused by the changes in Tsoil and SWC, rather, it was consistent with the higher SOC, DOC, MBC and/or the PLFAs contents in the plots with bryophytes. Conclusion: Our results highlight bryophytes are regulators of soil C efflux in subalpine ecosystems. Incorporating the effects of bryophytes will help improve the accuracy of current ecosystem C cycling models. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Bryophyte; Microbial biomass; PLFAs; Soil respiration; Subalpine coniferous forest; Subalpine shrubland","bare soil; biomass; bryophyte; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; community structure; coniferous forest; dissolved organic carbon; fatty acid; forest edge; microbial activity; microbial community; shrubland; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil respiration; soil surface; subalpine environment; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; bryophytes; Coniferophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018291854

Condition monitoring of mechanical structures in the BFG power plant is of vital importance to guarantee their safety and efficient operations. In this paper, we describe the detection of crack growth of bladed machinery in the BFG power plant via vibration measurement combined with an enhanced spectral correction technique. This technique enables high-precision identification of amplitude, frequency, and phase information (the harmonic information) belonging to deterministic harmonic components within the vibration signals. Rather than deriving all harmonic information using neighboring spectral bins in the fast Fourier transform spectrum, this proposed active frequency shift spectral correction method makes use of some interpolated Fourier spectral bins and has a better noise-resisting capacity. We demonstrate that the identified harmonic information via the proposed method is of suppressed numerical error when the same level of noises is presented in the vibration signal, even in comparison with a Hanning-window-based correction method. With the proposed method, we investigated vibration signals collected from a centrifugal compressor. Spectral information of harmonic tones, related to the fundamental working frequency of the centrifugal compressor, is corrected. The extracted spectral information indicates the ongoing development of an impeller blade crack that occurred in the centrifugal compressor. This method proves to be a promising alternative to identify blade cracks at early stages. © 2017 by the authors.","Bladed machinery; Blast furnace gas; Centrifugal compressor; Crack detection; Power plant; Spectral correction; Structural health monitoring","Bins; Blast furnaces; Centrifugal compressors; Centrifugation; Compressibility of gases; Condition monitoring; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Fast Fourier transforms; Gas compressors; Harmonic analysis; Machinery; Numerical methods; Power plants; Structural health monitoring; Blast furnace gas; Harmonic components; Mechanical structures; Phase information; Spectral correction; Spectral correction technique; Spectral information; Working frequency; Crack detection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027355621

Several studies have addressed changes of soil C stocks in rubber plantations; however, estimates of total ecosystem C stocks and their temporal changes in rubber plantations have been inadequately studied. This study calculated C stocks in soil, biomass, litter, and dry rubber (latex), and estimated the total ecosystem C stocks of rubber plantations in an age sequence of 3–, 7–, 9–, 21–, 27–, and 34-year-old in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. The total C stocks in rubber plantations ranged from 150.3 to 283.7 Mg C ha−1, with a mean of 213.4 Mg C ha−1. The plantations ≤ 9-year-old had significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) total C stocks than those older than 9 years. Carbon stocks in soil (mass equivalent) were between 107.1–170.5 Mg C ha−1 and in living biomass were between 2.8–95.7 Mg C ha−1, representing the largest and the second largest C components in a rubber plantation ecosystem. Neglect of dry rubber C stock resulted in an underestimate of 7.8%–14.2% of the total C stock in the rubber plantations older than 9 years, which was much larger than the contribution of litter C stock (less than 2%). © 2017 Soil Science Society of China","age sequence; carbon sequestration; dry rubber; Hevea brasiliensis; litter","Hevea brasiliensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027342929

We present an empirical document-by-document textual content analysis and comparison of 187 climate change communications from ExxonMobil, including peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed publications, internal company documents, and paid, editorial-style advertisements ('advertorials') in The New York Times. We examine whether these communications sent consistent messages about the state of climate science and its implications - specifically, we compare their positions on climate change as real, human-caused, serious, and solvable. In all four cases, we find that as documents become more publicly accessible, they increasingly communicate doubt. This discrepancy is most pronounced between advertorials and all other documents. For example, accounting for expressions of reasonable doubt, 83% of peer-reviewed papers and 80% of internal documents acknowledge that climate change is real and human-caused, yet only 12% of advertorials do so, with 81% instead expressing doubt. We conclude that ExxonMobil contributed to advancing climate science - by way of its scientists' academic publications - but promoted doubt about it in advertorials. Given this discrepancy, we conclude that ExxonMobil misled the public. Our content analysis also examines ExxonMobil's discussion of the risks of stranded fossil fuel assets. We find the topic discussed and sometimes quantified in 24 documents of various types, but absent from advertorials. Finally, based on the available documents, we outline ExxonMobil's strategic approach to climate change research and communication, which helps to contextualize our findings. © 2017 The Author(s).

Most studies concerning the treatment of periodontitis have primarily take into account the Gram-negative bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis, because it is a prominent component of the oral microbiome and a successful colonizer of the oral epithelium. Here, we focus our attention on the study of the carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) encoded in the genome of this pathogen as a possible drug target. Carbonic anhydrases are a superfamily of metalloenzymes, which catalyze the simple but physiologically crucial reaction of carbon dioxide hydration to bicarbonate and protons. Bacterial CAs have attracted significant attention for affecting the survival, invasion, and pathogenicity of many microorganisms. The P. gingivalis genome encodes for two CAs belonging to β-CA (PgiCAβ) and γ-CA (PgiCAγ) families. These two enzymes were cloned, heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified to homogeneity. Moreover, they were subject to extensive inhibition studies using the classical CA inhibitors (sulfonamides and anions) with the aim of identifying selective inhibitors of PgiCAβ and PgiCAγ to be used as pharmacological tools for P. gingivalis eradication. © 2017 by the authors.

We modeled the impacts of changing climatic variables on forest growth, optimal harvest age, and land expectation value (LEV) for 11 representative slash pine sites in the Southeastern U.S. under two alternative climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and 8.5). Our coupled modeling approach incorporated the 3-PG biological process model, a generalized carbon sequestration economic model, and Pressler's indicator rate formula to determine relative changes in prices, timber and carbon production. We generally found weak impacts of CC on slash pine LEVs and optimal harvest ages, but our results were sensitive to site productivity and location. CC increased LEVs in sites with low productivity for both RCPs. While a 1 °C increase led to the greatest LEV increase in Northeastern sites with low and moderate forest productivity conditions, Southeastern sites showed the greatest decreases in LEV. Higher (lower) future land values would shorten (lengthen) the current harvest age for slash pine. Changes in the rate of carbon and stumpage prices had the greatest impact on the rate of marginal economic revenues of slash pine. © 2017 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umeå","3-PG; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Economic vulnerability; Harvest age; LEV","Economics; Forestry; Harvesting; Productivity; 3-PG; Biological process; Carbon sequestration; Climatic variables; Economic vulnerability; Forest productivity; Land expectation value; Site productivity; Climate change; carbon sequestration; climate change; economic impact; forestry production; harvesting; plantation forestry; price dynamics; valuation; vulnerability; Carbon; Chelation; United States; Pinus elliottii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020722305

The H2 lost from the chondrite parent bodies as a result of Fe oxidation would have been isotopically very light, enriching any residual water in D. The extents of the D enrichments will have depended on the fractions of water consumed and the temperatures during Fe oxidation. Here we have estimated the likely ranges of water consumed by Fe oxidation in the CI, CM, CR and LL parent bodies, as well as the likely range of changes in water H isotopic compositions this would have produced. We first used Fe XANES to determine the Fe valences of bulk meteorite powders in Orgueil (CI1), a number of CMs and CRs that experienced varying degrees of alteration, and Semarkona (LL3.00). The total ranges of bulk Fe valences we obtained were: Orgueil 2.77, CMs 2.40–2.63, CRs 1.46–2.54, and Semarkona 2.10. Combining previous estimates of the present water/OH contents of our samples with the present bulk Fe valences and an estimated range of initial bulk Fe valences, we estimate the likely ranges of fractional water losses to have been: Orgueil 15–26%, Semarkona 73–83%, CMs 23–48%, and CRs 39–62%. The associated maximum and minimum changes in the H isotopic compositions of the remaining water were estimated assuming the equilibrium H2-H2O isotopic fractionation factor, Rayleigh fractionation of the H2, and oxidation temperatures of 0–200 °C. Using previous estimates of the water H isotopic compositions in the chondrites, the ranges of estimated δD values for the initial chondritic waters are: Orgueil −672‰ to −422‰, CMs −676‰ to −493‰, CRs −527‰ to −56‰, and Semarkona −527‰ to 154‰. The CI, CM, CR and ordinary chondrites all accreted water with similar H isotopic compositions that were distinct from the compositions of comets or Saturn's moon Enceladus. Thus, the carbonaceous chondrites are unlikely to have come from comets or from bodies that were scattered into the Asteroid Belt from comet forming regions by orbital migration of the giant planets. If the carbonaceous chondrites did form in the outer Solar System, as some models predict, it was probably not beyond 7 AU. However, based on water isotopic compositions at present it is equally plausible that the carbonaceous chondrites formed in the inner Solar System. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"chondrite; iron; isotopic composition; meteorite; oxidation; water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019967749

It demonstrates how a success narrative came to dominate presentations about the project as a multi-win involving not only climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation, but also benefits for local people and poverty reduction. Based on repeated fieldwork using qualitative methods, we find that there is lack of evidence to substantiate the success claims. These claims are in particular based on the assertion that a component of ‘conservation agriculture’ was successfully implemented as compensation for forest enclosure. Gaps between claims and evidence are often exhibited in the scholarship on political ecologies of conservation in Africa, as well as by observers of development aid projects. But how can such gaps be explained? We suggest taking the interests of the actors behind the project as a point of departure, including how individuals as well as organisations have stakes in marketing a success narrative. Furthermore, we argue that an unsubstantiated success narrative of an aid project can be maintained only when there is a lack of structures to ensure independent and adequate examinations of the project by evaluators and researchers. In this case, Norway was the funder of the project, and as the dominant funder of REDD, the Norwegian government has a particular interest in reproducing REDD success narratives, since the credibility of the country’s climate mitigation policy depends on REDD being a success. In addition, the case study demonstrates how ‘success projects’ emerge in the wake of new development fads. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agriculture; climate change mitigation; Conservation; development aid; forest; Norway; political ecology; REDD; Tanzania",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026391723

We defined a modelling framework for calculation of the carbon pools and fluxes along the forest energy and wood product supply chains over 200 years for three forest management alternatives (FMA): 1) a traditionally managed European beech forest, as a business-as-usual case, 2) an energy poplar plantation, and 3) a set-aside forest left unmanaged for long-term storage of carbon. We calculated the cumulative net carbon emissions (CCE) and carbon parity times (CPT) of the managed forests relative to the unmanaged forest. Energy poplar generally had the lowest CCE when using coal as the reference fossil fuel. With natural gas as the reference fossil fuel, the CCE of the business-as-usual and the energy poplar was nearly equal, with the unmanaged forest having the highest CCE after 40 years. CPTs ranged from 0 to 156 years, depending on the applied model assumptions. CCE and CPT were especially sensitive to the reference fossil fuel, material alternatives to wood, forest growth rates for the three FMAs, and energy conversion efficiencies. Assumptions about the long-term steady-state levels of carbon stored in the unmanaged forest had a limited effect on CCE after 200 years. Analyses also showed that CPT was not a robust measure for ranking of carbon mitigation benefits. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Carbon emissions; Carbon parity time; Forest carbon storage; Sensitivity analyses","carbon; coal; fossil fuel; natural gas; bioenergy; biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; deciduous forest; deciduous tree; emission control; forest management; fossil fuel; growth rate; natural gas; sensitivity analysis; set-aside; wood; alternative energy; Article; atmosphere; beech; biomass; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; carbon utilization; combustion; energy; energy conversion; energy yield; forest management; fossil energy; monoculture; plantation; sensitivity analysis; wood; atmosphere; environmental protection; forest; Fagus sylvatica; Atmosphere; Biomass; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Fossil Fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016029291

However, to date, consumer adoption has been limited by range anxiety and lack of familiarity with the technology. Understanding the effects of ambient temperature on electric vehicle efficiency is relevant for improving vehicle performance, enabling widespread consumer adoption and ensuring beneficial environmental outcomes. Using real-world fleet data from the Tesla Model S, vehicle efficiency is observed across a range of trip characteristics, regional climates, and ambient temperatures. The data suggest that low-temperature penalties to vehicle efficiency are mostly confined to short-distance drives, limiting the impacts on useful range experienced by the driver. Drivers are also able to adapt behaviors in response to anticipated range needs. Lastly, average efficiency impacts of climate are moderate (10% or less), as very low temperature conditions strongly affect only a small subset of trips. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Climate models; Digital storage; Efficiency; Electric automobiles; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Vehicle performance; Vehicles; Average efficiencies; Consumer adoptions; Environmental outcome; Low temperatures; Reducing emissions; Regional climate; Vehicle efficiency; Very low temperatures; Temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028603735

The Kluane Lake region in particular has been identified previously as an analogue for Late Pleistocene eastern Beringia. All topsoils have higher average total nitrogen δ15N and organic carbon δ13C than plants from the same sites with a positive shift occurring with depth in two soil profiles analyzed. All plants analyzed have an average whole plant δ13C of −27.5 ± 1.2 ‰ and foliar δ13C of –28.0 ± 1.3 ‰, and average whole plant δ15N of −0.3 ± 2.2 ‰ and foliar δ15N of –0.6 ± 2.7 ‰. Plants analyzed here showed relatively smaller variability in δ13C than δ15N. Their average δ13C after suitable corrections for the Suess effect should be suitable as baseline for interpreting diets of Late Pleistocene herbivores that lived in eastern Beringia. Water availability, nitrogen availability, spacial differences and intra-plant variability are important controls on δ15N of herbaceous plants in the study area. The wider range of δ15N, the more numerous factors that affect nitrogen isotopic composition and their likely differences in the past, however, limit use of the modern N isotopic baseline for vegetation in paleodietary models for such ecosystems. That said, the positive correlation between foliar δ15N and N content shown for the modern plants could support use of plant δ15N as an index for plant N content and therefore forage quality. The modern N isotopic baseline cannot be applied directly to the past, but it is prerequisite to future efforts to detect shifts in N cycling and forage quality since the Late Pleistocene through comparison with fossil plants from the same region. © 2017 Tahmasebi et al.

At the same time, the high rates of deposition of unconsolidated metal oxides from terrigenous origin may also promote metal-reducing microbial activity. To investigate the eventual coupling between the iron and sulfur cycles in these environments, shallow sediment cores (< 50 cm) across various channels and levees in the Congo River deep-sea fan (~5000 m) were profiled using a combination of geochemical methods. Interestingly, metal reduction dominated suboxic carbon remineralization processes in most of these sediments, while dissolved sulfide was absent. In some ‘hotspot’ patches, however, sulfate reduction produced large sulfide concentrations which supported chemosynthetic-based benthic megafauna. These environments were characterized by sharp geochemical boundaries compared to the iron-rich background environment, suggesting that FeS precipitation efficiently titrated iron and sulfide from the pore waters. A companion study demonstrated that methanogenesis was active in the deep sediment layers of these patchy ecosystems, suggesting that sulfate reduction was promoted by alternative anaerobic processes. These highly reduced habitats could be fueled by discrete, excess inputs of highly labile natural organic matter from Congo River turbidites or by exhumation of buried sulfide during channel flank erosion and slumping.

We consider that deviation from an agreement can occur accidentally because of phenomena such as natural disasters, even if the agreement is sustained as a weakly renegotiation-proof equilibrium. If an IEA signatory deviates accidentally, it fails to achieve its emission abatement target. In the repeated game, a cooperative relationship among signatories is sustained by a strategy that prescribes rules of cooperation and punishment for deviation. We present a new strategy, called Regional Cooperative, which integrates accidental deviations into an IEA. Our model reveals that punishing countries tend to revoke the punishment of deviators and return to cooperation if an accidental deviator increases its abatement volume. That is, the abatement efforts of the accidental deviator can lead to renegotiation. The Regional Cooperative strategy motivates the accidental deviator to try to engage in abatement and the punishing countries to restart cooperation by renegotiation. We conclude that social welfare loss by punishment is prevented through renegotiation in cases of accidental deviation. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","International environmental agreements; Natural disaster; Renegotiation-proof; Repeated game; Subgame perfect equilibrium; Trans-boundary pollution","Climate change; Environmental regulations; Pollution control; International environmental agreements; Natural disasters; Renegotiation-proof; Repeated games; Trans-boundary pollution; Disasters; environmental protection; international agreement; international cooperation; natural disaster; regional policy; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001850175

This study evaluated trends in precipitation extremes from 1985 to 2014 in the Kelantan River Basin (KRB), Malaysia. Forty-one climate stations that had &lt;10% missing data, and which passed the data quality control and homogeneity tests were selected. Trends of 14 precipitation extreme indices recommended by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices that related to duration, threshold, absolute, relative and percentile indices were analysed using the Mann–Kendall and Sen's tests. Generally, most of the regional precipitation extremes' indices had increased trends, except the consecutive dry days and consecutive wet days, which are quite consistent with global scale trends studies. On a monthly scale, the maximum 5-day precipitation amount (Rx5d) had increasing trends in January (34.91 mm decade−1) and December (13.96 mm decade−1), by field significance at 95% confidence level. For spatial context, most of the stations with significant trends were distributed in the south-western (mountainous) and northern (near-coastal) regions. In the Tropics, the KRB's extremes indices trends had a similar pattern to the West Pacific, Indian Ocean and Caribbean regions, but were different from Western Thailand, the South China Sea and the North Inter-tropical Convergence Zone, showing that trends of precipitation extreme events are different regionally. Overall, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Multivariate El-Niño Southern Oscillation Index, Indian Ocean Dipole and Madden-Julian Oscillation had a significant relationship with all precipitation extremes' indices, and they are contributors to climate changes in this basin. © 2016 Royal Meteorological Society","climate; extreme; Kelantan; Malaysia; precipitation; rainfall; trend; tropical","Atmospheric pressure; Climatology; Precipitation (chemical); Precipitation (meteorology); Quality control; Rain; Tropics; Watersheds; Climate; Extreme; Kelantan; Malaysia; Trend; Tropical; Climate change; climate change; climate variation; expert system; extreme event; precipitation intensity; rainfall; regional climate; trend analysis; tropical meteorology; Kelantan; Kelantan Basin; Malaysia; West Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008252594

Annual PM2. 5 was up to 6 times the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in some megacities in northern China. Annual PM2. 5 was higher in northern than southern cities, and higher in inland than coastal cities. In a few cities with data longer than a decade, PM2. 5 showed a slight decrease only in the second half of the past decade, while carbonaceous aerosols decreased, sulfate (SO42ĝ') and ammonium (NH4+) remained at high levels, and nitrate (NO3ĝ') increased. The highest seasonal averages of PM2. 5 and its major chemical components were typically observed in the cold seasons. Annual average contributions of secondary inorganic aerosols to PM2. 5 ranged from 25 to 48 %, and those of carbonaceous aerosols ranged from 23 to 47 %, both with higher contributions in southern regions due to the frequent dust events in northern China. Source apportionment analysis identified secondary inorganic aerosols, coal combustion and traffic emission as the top three source factors contributing to PM2. 5 mass in most Chinese cities, and the sum of these three source factors explained 44 to 82 % of PM2. 5 mass on annual average across China. Biomass emission in most cities, industrial emission in industrial cities, dust emission in northern cities and ship emission in coastal cities are other major source factors, each of which contributed 7-27 % to PM2. 5 mass in applicable cities.<br><br> The geographical pattern of scattering coefficient (<i>b</i>sp) was similar to that of PM2. 5, and that of aerosol absorption coefficient (<i>b</i>ap) was determined by elemental carbon (EC) mass concentration and its coating. <i>b</i>sp in ambient condition of relative humidity (RH) Combining double low line 80 % can be amplified by about 1.8 times that under dry conditions. Secondary inorganic aerosols accounted for about 60 % of aerosol extinction coefficient (<i>b</i>ext) at RH greater than 70 %. The mass scattering efficiency (MSE) of PM2. 5 ranged from 3.0 to 5.0 m2 gĝ'1 for aerosols produced from anthropogenic emissions and from 0.7 to 1.0 m2 gĝ'1 for natural dust aerosols. The mass absorption efficiency (MAE) of EC ranged from 6.5 to 12.4 m2 gĝ'1 in urban environments, but the MAE of water-soluble organic carbon was only 0.05 to 0.11 m2 gĝ'1. Historical emission control policies in China and their effectiveness were discussed based on available chemically resolved PM2. 5 data, which provides the much needed knowledge for guiding future studies and emissions policies. © 2017 Author(s).",,"aerosol property; ammonium; annual variation; atmospheric chemistry; carbon; chemical composition; extinction coefficient; particulate matter; relative humidity; sulfate; urban atmosphere; China",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020444844

It is believed that these events arise in a hot electron-positron plasma that remains trapped within the closed magnetic field lines. We developed a simple radiative transfermodel to simulate magnetar flare emission in the case of a steady trapped fireball. After dividing the fireball surface in a number of plane-parallel slabs, the local spectral and polarization properties are obtained integrating the radiative transfer equations for the two normal modes. We assume that magnetic Thomson scattering is the dominant source of opacity, and neglect contributions from second-order radiative processes, although double-Compton scattering is accounted for in establishing local thermal equilibrium in the fireball atmospheric layers. The observed spectral and polarization properties as measured by a distant observer are obtained by summing the contributions from the patches that are visible for a given viewing geometry by means of a ray-tracing code. The spectra we obtained in the 1-100 keV energy range are thermal and can be described in terms of the superposition of two blackbodies. The blackbody temperature and the emitting area ratio are in broad agreement with the available observations. The predicted linear polarization degree is, in general, greater than 80 per cent over the entire energy range and should be easily detectable by new-generation X-ray polarimeters, such as IXPE, XIPE and eXTP. © 2017 The Authors.","Polarization; Radiative transfer; Scattering; Stars: magnetars; Techniques: polarimetric; X-rays: bursts",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037724142

Both human and animal studies associate exposure to diesel exhaust with inflammatory lung effects, cardiovascular effects, and an increased risk of lung cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has evaluated diesel exhaust as carcinogenic to humans. Yet national or regional limit values for controlling occupational exposure to diesel exhaust are rare. In recent decades, stricter emission regulations have led to diesel technologies evolving significantly, resulting in changes in exhaust emissions and composition. These changes are also expected to influence the health effects of diesel exhaust. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on the health effects of diesel exhaust and the influence of new diesel technologies on the health risk. It discusses the relevant exposure indicators and perspectives for setting occupational exposure limit values for diesel exhaust, and outlines directions for future research.

Here, we characterize an emerging, critical approach to researching climate change and community in neoliberal contexts, focusing attention principally on the global north, where this body of research has emerged. This work recognizes communities as sites of contestation, difference, tension, and distinction, in which action on climate change can be designed to meet a range of political and public ends. It aims to uncover the political and social context for community action on climate change, to be alert to the power relations inside and outside of communities, and to the context of neoliberalism, including individualism, the will to quantify, and competition. Furthermore, research in this space is committed to understanding both the lived experience of the messy empirical worlds we encounter, and the potential agency coalescing in community responses to climate change. Much of the work to date, discussed here, has focused on communities working on climate change mitigation in the global north, in which the idea of community as a space for governance is gaining traction. We also comment on the positioning of these arguments in the context of long-standing debates in the fields of ‘community-based’ development, natural resource management, and adaptation in the global South. This discussion establishes a foundation from which to progress learning across fields and geopolitical boundaries, furthering critical thinking on ‘community.’ WIREs Clim Change 2017, 8:e463. doi: 10.1002/wcc.463.

Poterba argues that the incidence of energy/environmental taxes across households is better appreciated if the relative tax burdens are measured against total expenditure, interpreted as a proxy for lifetime income, instead of annual income. This way, however, since the distribution of total expenditure is structurally more uniform, the incidence of energy price increases is always less regressive than when annual income is used. This outcome is often taken to lessen the relevance of equity concerns regarding carbon pricing. Almost twenty-five years after Poterba (1991a), Piketty (2014) revived the idea that wealth is a dimension of economic welfare constituting an increasingly important source of inequality. We show that omitting wealth in measuring ability to pay means underestimating the regressivity of carbon pricing and its inequity towards younger people.

The relative roles of local influences (i.e. boundary conditions) and morphodynamic influences (i.e. emergent properties) remain unclear. Chronostratigraphic and sedimentological analyses were conducted on two pairs of linear dunes exhibiting different spatial patterning in the Strzelecki Desert of central Australia. It was hypothesized that morphodynamic influences, via pattern-coarsening, would mean that dunes from the simpler pattern, defined in terms of the frequency of defects (i.e. junctions and terminations), would be more mature, older landforms. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating of full-depth, regularly-sampled profiles was used to establish accumulation histories for the four dunes, and supported by sedimentological analysis to investigate possible compositional differences and similarities between the dunes. Whilst three of the dunes (the two more simply-patterned dunes, and one of the more complex dunes) have accumulation histories beginning between ~ 100 ka and 150 ka, and document sporadic net accumulation throughout the last interglacial/glacial cycle to the late Holocene, one of the dunes (with relatively complex patterning) reveals that the majority of the dune accumulation (> 7 m) at that site occurred during a relatively short window at ~ 50 ka. There is no clear sedimentological reason for the different behaviour of the younger dune. The data suggest that small-scale and essentially stochastic nature of the aeolian depositional/erosional system can overprint any large-scale morphodynamic controls. The concept of dating landscape change by pattern analysis is thus not supported by this study, and would require very careful interpretation of the scales being considered. This further suggests caution when interpreting dune chronostratigraphies palaeoenvironmentally, as different dunes are able to respond very differently to the same external stimulus (e.g. climate). In the case studied here, a mechanism is proposed to account for the rapid accumulation of the anomalous dune by avulsion of the local aeolian accumulation from one dune ridge to another. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"boundary condition; chronostratigraphy; climate change; dune field; dune formation; landscape change; luminescence dating; morphodynamics; sedimentology; Australia; South Australia; Strzelecki Desert",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017581212

There is a lack of studies on the comparison of biogeographical regions in Europe in terms of plant responses to climate. We examined the flowering phenology of plant species to identify the spatio-temporal patterns in their responses to environmental variables over the period 1970–2010. Data were collected from 12 countries along a 3000-km-long, North–South transect from northern to eastern Central Europe. Biogeographical regions of Europe were covered from Finland to Macedonia. Robust statistical methods were used to determine the most influential factors driving the changes of the beginning of flowering dates. Significant species-specific advancements in plant flowering onsets within the Continental (3 to 8.3 days), Alpine (2 to 3.8 days) and by highest magnitude in the Boreal biogeographical regions (2.2 to 9.6 days per decades) were found, while less pronounced responses were detected in the Pannonian and Mediterranean regions. While most of the other studies only use mean temperature in the models, we show that also the distribution of minimum and maximum temperatures are reasonable to consider as explanatory variable. Not just local (e.g. temperature) but large scale (e.g. North Atlantic Oscillation) climate factors, as well as altitude and latitude play significant role in the timing of flowering across biogeographical regions of Europe. Our analysis gave evidences that species show a delay in the timing of flowering with an increase in latitude (between the geographical coordinates of 40.9 and 67.9), and an advance with changing climate. The woody species (black locust and small-leaved lime) showed stronger advancements in their timing of flowering than the herbaceous species (dandelion, lily of the valley). In later decades (1991–2010), more pronounced phenological change was detected than during the earlier years (1970–1990), which indicates the increased influence of human induced higher spring temperatures in the late twentieth century. © 2017, ISB.","Beginning of flowering; Biogeographical regions; Climate change; Europe; Robust regression; Shifting trend","angiosperm; Europe; flower; physiology; season; temperature; Europe; Flowers; Magnoliopsida; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013213805

In marine coastal sediments, MOHCB are particularly subjected to extreme fluctuating conditions due to redox oscillations several times a day as a result of mechanical (tide, waves and currents) and biological (bioturbation) reworking of the sediment. The adaptation of MOHCB to the redox oscillations was investigated by an experimental ecology approach, subjecting a hydrocarbon-degrading microbial community to contrasting oxygenation regimes including permanent anoxic conditions, anoxic/oxic oscillations and permanent oxic conditions. The most ubiquitous MOHCB, Alcanivorax and Cycloclasticus, showed different behaviors, especially under anoxic/oxic oscillation conditions, which were more favorable for Alcanivorax than for Cycloclasticus. The micro-diversity of 16S rRNA gene transcripts from these genera revealed specific ecotypes for different oxygenation conditions and their dynamics. It is likely that such ecotypes allow the colonization of distinct ecological niches that may explain the success of Alcanivorax and Cycloclasticus in hydrocarbon-contaminated coastal sediments during oil-spills. © 2017 Terrisse, Cravo-Laureau, Noël, Cagnon, Dumbrell, McGenity and Duran.","Active microbial communities; Experimental ecology; High throughput sequencing; Hydrocarbon degradation; Micro-diversity; Microbial ecology; Oil spill; Oligotyping",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027707287

Here, we present a carbon-budget model for transgressive barrier islands that includes a dynamic carbon-storage term, driven by backbarrier-marsh width, and a carbon-export term, driven by ocean and backbarrier shoreline erosion. To examine the impacts of storms, human disturbances and the backbarrier setting of a transgressive barrier island on carbon budgets and reservoirs, the model was applied to sites at Core Banks and Onslow Beach, NC, USA. Results show that shoreline erosion and burial of backbarrier marsh from washover deposition and dredge-spoil disposal temporarily transitioned each site into a net exporter (source) of carbon. The magnitude of the carbon reservoir was linked to the backbarrier setting of an island. Carbon reservoirs of study sites separated from the mainland by only backbarrier marsh (no lagoon) decreased for over a decade because carbon storage could not keep pace with erosion. With progressive narrowing of the backbarrier marsh, these barriers will begin to function more persistently as carbon sources until the reservoir is depleted at the point where the barrier welds with the mainland. Undeveloped barrier islands with wide lagoons are carbon sources briefly during erosive periods; however, at century time scales are net carbon importers (sinks) because new marsh habitat can form during barrier rollover. Human development on backbarrier saltmarsh serves to reduce the carbon storage capacity and can hasten the transition of an island from a sink to a source. © 2017 The Authors.","barrier island; carbon; erosion; overwash; saltmarsh; transgression","anthropogenic effect; barrier island; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; saltmarsh; shoreline; shoreline change; storm damage; transgression; washover; North Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026406202

To do so it offers a contribution to the state-of-The-Art by taking into account transient NOx emissions. This control strategy is split in two layers. The first layer, which computes the operating points optimal in steady-state conditions is based on the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS). During transient phases, a second control layer allows to reduce pollutant peaks by smoothing the engine torque trajectory. This second layer is based on a physical modeling of NOx formation.

These new steels help the transportation sector, including the automotive sector, to achieve the goals of increased passenger safety and reduced emissions. With increasing tensile strengths, certain steels exhibit an increased sensitivity towards hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The ability to characterize the material's sensitivity in an asdelivered condition has been developed and accepted (SEP1970), but the complexity of the stress states that can induce an embrittlement together with the wide range of applications for high-strength steels make the development of a standardized test for HE under in-service conditions extremely challenging. Some proposals for evaluating the material's sensitivity give an advantage to materials with a low starting ductility. Despite this, newly developed materials can have a higher original elongation with only a moderate reduction in elongation due to hydrogen.

In 2014, 17.5 million people were displaced by climate-related disasters, ten times more than the 1.7 million displaced by geophysical hazards. What is causing the increase in natural disasters and what effect does it have on the economy? Climate Change and Natural Disasters sends three messages: human-made factors exert a growing influence on climate-related disasters; because of the link to anthropogenic factors, there is a pressing need for climate mitigation; and prevention, including climate adaptation, ought not to be viewed as a cost to economic growth but as an investment. Ultimately, attention to climate-related disasters, arguably the most tangible manifestation of global warming, may help mobilize broader climate action. It can also be instrumental in transitioning to a path of low-carbon, green growth, improving disaster resilience, improving natural resource use, and caring for the urban environment. Vinod Thomas proposes that economic growth will become sustainable only if governments, political actors, and local communities combine natural disaster prevention and controlling climate change into national growth strategies. When considering all types of capital, particularly human capital, climate action can drive economic growth, rather than hinder it. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis.

In 2014, we held six workshops across estuaries along the Pacific coast of North America with over 150 participants to evaluate resource managers' perceived level of understanding of climate change science, where they obtain information, how they use this knowledge, and their preparedness for incorporating climate change into their management decisions. We found that most resource managers understood the types of climate change impacts likely to occur in their estuaries, but often lacked the scientific information to make decisions and plan effectively. Managers stated that time, money, and staff resources were the largest obstacles in their efforts. Managers identified that they learned most of their information from peers, scientific journals, and the Internet and indicated that sea-level rise was their greatest concern. There was, however, variation in managers' levels of readiness and perceived knowledge within and among workshop locations. The workshops revealed that some regions don't have the information they need or the planning capacity to effectively integrate climate change into their management, with eight out of fifteen site comparisons showing a significant difference between their level of preparedness (F5,26 = 6.852; p = 0.0003), and their willingness to formally plan (F5,26 = 12.84; p = 0.000002). We found that Urban estuaries were significantly different from Mixed Use and Rural estuaries, in having access to information and feeling more prepared to conduct climate change planning and implementation (F2,29 = 17.34; p = 0.00001). To facilitate climate change preparedness more comprehensive integration of science into management decisions is essential. © 2017","Collaboration; Sea-level rise; Wetlands; Workshops","Decision making; Estuaries; Human resource management; Information management; Managers; Sea level; Technical presentations; Wetlands; Climate change adaptation; Climate change impact; Collaboration; Comprehensive integrations; Management decisions; Scientific information; Scientific journals; Sea level rise; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; coastal wetland; coastal zone management; decision making; environmental planning; estuary; implementation process; participatory approach; perception; resource management; rural area; sea level change; urban area; Pacific Coast [North America]; Pacific Coast [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014127500

The findings indicate that local governments can significantly contribute to building resilience and adapting to climate-related hazards, however a number of factors such as the attitudes of local governments on climate change, environmental activism, and the recent experiences of climate-related disasters are instrumental for shaping a better local response.

This is achieved with a suitably engineered coupling to a dissipative cold reservoir usually formed by an electromagnetic mode. In the field of cavity electro- and optomechanics, the electromagnetic cavity naturally serves as a cold reservoir for the mechanical mode. Here, we realize the opposite scenario and engineer a mechanical oscillator cooled close to its ground state into a cold dissipative reservoir for microwave photons in a superconducting circuit. By tuning the coupling to this dissipative mechanical reservoir, we demonstrate dynamical backaction control of the microwave field, leading to stimulated emission and maser action. Moreover, the reservoir can function as a useful quantum resource, allowing the implementation of a near-quantum-limited phase-preserving microwave amplifier. Such engineered mechanical dissipation extends the toolbox of quantum manipulation techniques of the microwave field and constitutes a new ingredient for optomechanical protocols. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

This function of the soil is likely to be affected by extreme weather events that are expected to be more frequent and severe in the future. We conducted an experiment from March 2014 to March 2015 to test the effects of extreme drought on composition of the bacterial community and decomposition of plant tissue with soil microclimate variables such as soil temperature and moisture. Precipitation was excluded for a 5-month period by transparent roofs. To follow organic matter decomposition, we used the tea bag method. Soil samples were taken to determine the effects of extreme drought on the bacterial community 6 months after the dry period (mid-term). Drought plots were drier (P &lt; 0.001) and warmer (P &lt; 0.001) than control plots as a consequence of the extreme drought treatment. The permanova test showed that the dry period altered soil bacterial communities accordingly (Fpermanova = 10.36, P = 0.002). However, there was no significant difference between the control and drought-treated plots 6 months after the dry period in terms of bacterial alpha diversity. Furthermore, rates of organic matter decomposition in the control plots were significantly larger by an average of 93.7% than in the drought plots. The results also indicated that soil temperature and moisture had significant effects on decomposition. Overall, the findings demonstrate clearly the response of soil bacteria and soil function to experimental drought. The strong effect of changes in precipitation and increasing temperature on mass loss suggests that extreme weather events, such as extreme droughts, can markedly change the composition of soil bacterial communities and processes of decomposition. This effect is expected to be more pronounced during dry periods of increasing severity and frequency. Highlights: We studied the effects of extreme drought on plant tissue decay and soil bacterial diversity. Microbial degradation of organic matter was followed by the novel tea bag method. Changes in soil microclimate altered bacterial community structure and decomposition. Microbiota and soil function were markedly affected by extreme weather events like droughts. © 2017 British Society of Soil Science",,"bacterium; biodegradation; decomposition; drought; experimental study; extreme event; microbial community; microclimate; plant; precipitation (climatology); soil microorganism; soil moisture; soil organic matter; soil temperature; species diversity; thermal decomposition; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019546296

We apply it to reconnection in strong current-aligned magnetic guide fields. Such guide fields participate only passively in reconnection, which occurs in the antiparallel components to both sides of the guide-field-aligned current sheets with current carried by kinetic Alfvén waves. Reconnection generates long (the order of hundreds of electron inertial scales) electron exhaust regions at the reconnection site X point, which are extended perpendicular to the current and the guide fields. Exhausts contain a strongly density-depleted hot electron component and have properties similar to electron holes. Exhaust electron momentum space distributions are highly deformed, exhibiting steep gradients transverse to both the reconnecting and guide fields. Such properties suggest application of the ECMI mechanism with the fundamental ECMI X-mode emission beneath the nonrelativistic guide field cyclotron frequency in localized source regions. An outline of the mechanism and its prospects is given. Potential applications are the kilometric radiation (AKR) in auroral physics, solar radio emissions during flares, planetary emissions and astrophysical scenarios (radiation from stars and compact objects) involving the presence of strong magnetic fields and field-aligned currents. Drift of the exhausts along the guide field maps the local field and plasma properties. Escape of radiation from the exhaust and radiation source region still poses a problem. The mechanism can be studied in 2-D particle simulations of strong guide field reconnection which favours 2-D, mapping the deformation of the electron distribution perpendicular to the guide field, and using it in the numerical calculation of the ECMI growth rate. The mechanism suggests also that reconnection in general may become a source of the ECMI with or without guide fields. This is of particular interest in extended turbulent plasmas where reconnection serves as an integral dissipation mechanism of turbulent energy in myriads of small-scale current filaments. © 2017 Author(s).","Radio science (waves in plasma); solar physics astrophysics and astronomy (radio emissions)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028535273

However, its potential for tourism, especially sustainable tourism, remains under-researched. This article examines the utilisation of social marketing by tourism businesses. A search strategy identified 14 behavioural change programmes that involved tourism businesses. Half of these programmes label themselves social marketing; the others tend to be part of corporate social responsibility efforts, using a form of corporate social marketing (CSM). Most programmes seek to encourage pro-environmental behaviours in tourists, tourism businesses and other stakeholders including suppliers. Although tourism businesses can develop social marketing programmes alone, typically they collaborate with public and non-profit agencies as partners and sponsors. The strength of the tie between the promoted behaviour and the sale of a company's product varies considerably. It is suggested that social marketing can make significant contributions to environmentally sustainable tourism. However, this research also suggests that social marketing is not a substitute for, but rather an essential complement to, technological and regulatory approaches to climate change. Changing behaviour is a long process: without a long-term commitment from private sector companies, CSM programmes will fail to achieve behavioural change goals. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Behavioural change; corporate social marketing; corporate social responsibility; public–private partnership; social marketing campaigns; sustainable consumption","business; corporate social responsibility; ecotourism; marketing; public-private partnership; tourism market",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992092057

To develop the above natural gas reservoirs efficiently and economically, the phase characteristics of formation water and gas mixtures with different CO2 content are simulated. The solubility measurements were undertaken with pure CH4, pure CO2 and 5 groups of gas mixtures with different CO2 content. The CO2 content of gas mixtures is 10.72%, 20.74%, 26.66%, 50.33% and 70.42%, respectively. Moreover, the samples belong to a typical high CO2 containing gas reservoir fluids since they do not contain C7+ component. Based on the cubic-plus-association equation of state (CPA EoS), and by estimating the binary interaction parameters through fitting the experimental data on mutual solubility of formation water and gas mixtures, the association schemes of water and CO2 in predicting the solubilities are evaluated. Here, CO2 is modeled as a non-self-associating component and a selfassociating component with the association sites of 2B, 3B and 4C. And the 2B, 3B and 4C scheme where we assume that all atoms in the water are likely to form hydrogen bonds. It is shown that a good correlation is obtained for water and CO2 system when CO2 is considered as non-self-association fluid (the solvation) while water is regarded as 4C scheme.

However, there still lacks fundamental understanding of the role of the vacancies in semiconductor materials. Herein, the g-C3N4 nanosheets with tunable nitrogen vacancies are prepared as the photocatalysts for H2 evolution and CO2 reduction to CO. On the basis of both experimental investigation and DFT calculations, nitrogen vacancies in g-C3N4 induce the formation of midgap states under the conduction band edge. The position of midgap states becomes deeper with the increasing of nitrogen vacancies. The g-C3N4 nanosheets with the optimized density of nitrogen vacancies display about 18 times and 4 times enhancement for H2 evolution and of CO2 reduction to CO, respectively, as compared to the bulk g-C3N4. This is attributed to the synergistic effects of several factors including (1) nitrogen vacancies cause the excitation of electrons to midgap states below the conduction band edge, which results in extension of the visible light absorption to photons of longer wavelengths (up to 598 nm); (2) the suitable midgap states could trap photogenerated electrons to minimize the recombination loss of photogenerated electron-hole pairs; and (3) nitrogen vacancies lead to uniformly anchored small Pt nanoparticles (1-2 nm) on g-C3N4, and facilitate the electron transfer to Pt. However, the overintroduction of nitrogen vacancies generates deeper midgap states as the recombination centers, which results in deterioration of photocatalytic activities. Our work is expected to provide new insights for fabrication of nanomaterials with suitable vacancies for solar fuel generation. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","g-C3N4; Midgap states; Nitrogen vacancy; Photocatalysis","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Conduction bands; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Electrons; Light; Light absorption; Nanosheets; Nitrogen; Photocatalysis; Platinum; Semiconductor doping; Semiconductor materials; Experimental investigations; g-C3N4; Graphitic carbon nitrides; Midgap states; Nitrogen vacancies; Photocatalytic activities; Photocatalytic performance; Photogenerated electrons; Vacancies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027070382

Therefore, knowledge on future changes in irrigation demand in the context of climate change is very important for long-term planning and management of water resources of the region. This paper investigated the changes in irrigation water demand in an intensive irrigated area of Malaysia under climate change scenario. Global circulation models (GCMs) outputs are downscaled using statistical downscaling model (SDSM) to project the future changes in rainfall and temperature at local scale. The irrigation water demand estimation model known as CROPWAT is calibrated and validated with historical data and then used to project the future changes in irrigation demand under SDSM projected climatic condition. The results show that temperature and rainfall in the area will increase by 0.2° C and 4% per decade, respectively over the time period 2020-2099. The changes in climate will reduce irrigation water demand at a rate of 0.9% per decade in the area. However, the irrigation demand will be much more variable in future, and therefore, the major challenge in water resources management will be to handle the uncertainty. It is expected that the seasonal and annual variations in irrigation demand projected by the study will help in operating reservoirs and sustainable management of water resources in the region in the context of climate change. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Climate change; CROPWAT; Downscaling; Irrigation demand","Irrigation; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Water; Water management; Water resources; Water supply; Climate change scenarios; CROPWAT; Down-scaling; Global circulation model; Paddy cultivated areas; Statistical downscaling model (SDSM); Sustainable management; Water resources management; Climate change; climate change; downscaling; irrigation; modeling; sustainability; water demand; water management; water resource; water use; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018913969

The scientific goal is to measure specific key variables from the biosphere, hydrosphere, pedosphere, and geosphere related to two global problems of significant societal relevance: food security and human health. The key variables comprise land and sea surface radiation temperature and emissivity, surface moisture, thermal inertia, evapotranspiration, soil minerals and grain size components, soil organic carbon, plant physiological variables, and heat fluxes. The retrieval of this information requires a TIR imaging system with adequate spatial and spectral resolutions and with day-night following observation capability. Another challenge is the monitoring of temporally high dynamic features like energy fluxes, which require adequate revisit time. The suggested solution is a sensor pointing concept to allow high revisit times for selected target regions (1–5 days at off-nadir). At the same time, global observations in the nadir direction are guaranteed with a lower temporal repeat cycle (>1 month). To account for the demand of a high spatial resolution for complex targets, it is suggested to combine in one optic (1) a hyperspectral TIR system with ~75 bands at 7.2–12.5 _m (instrument NEDT 0.05 K–0.1 K) and a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 60 m, and (2) a panchromatic high-resolution TIR-imager with two channels (8.0–10.25 µm and 10.25–12.5 µm) and a GSD of 20 m. The identified science case requires a good correlation of the instrument orbit with Sentinel-2 (maximum delay of 1–3 days) to combine data from the visible and near infrared (VNIR), the shortwave infrared (SWIR) and TIR spectral regions and to refine parameter retrieval. © 2017 by the authors.

While there is much research at the national and regional levels on the energy implications of water supply (the urban water-energy ‘nexus’), there is relatively little at the city scale. This literature is further diminished when attempting to account for the climate impact of urban water systems. A study of the urban water-energy-climate nexus is presented for México City. It is shown that 50% of México City water comes from a local aquifer with a further 30% deriving from energy-intensive surface sources which are pumped over considerable topography. The water supply system consumes 90% of the water system energy demand, and is responsible for the majority (90%) of the CO2e emissions. In the wastewater sector, 80–90% is discharged with no or little treatment, with correspondingly low energy demand. The small fraction that is treated accounts for the majority of energy use in the wastewater sector. This study shows the uncertainty in energy demand and CO2e emissions when reliant on secondary data which considerably over/under-estimate energy use compared with primary data. This has implications when assessing energy and carbon budgets. Three water savings options are assessed for their impact on energy and CO2e emissions reductions. Considerable reductions in water supply volumes and concomitant energy consumption and CO2e emissions are possible. However the extent of implementation, and the effectiveness of any implemented solutions depend on financing, institutional backing and public support.

Children with motor delays (with and without disabilities) lack the motor skills necessary to participate in games and physical activity, and tend to spend more time as onlookers than do their peers. As such, intervention programs are crucial in promoting motor skill development of children with motor delays. While mastery climate (MC) interventions have shown to positively impact children’s motor performance, what is unknown is the impact of cognitive strategies used by children within these climates. Furthermore, although vigorous play seems to be related to the development of gross motor skills, it is still unknown if children with and without disabilities would benefit from exercise play (EP) interventions. Purpose: This study examined the effects of MC and EP interventions on the motor skill development and verbal recall (VR) of children with motor delays. The sample included children with and without disabilities. Research designs: One hundred and thirty-eight children from 27 urban public schools were referred to the present study. Children were assessed using the Test of Gross Motor Development second edition (TGMD-2) and a VR checklist. Sixty-four children (18 with disabilities and 46 without) met the inclusion criteria, which was a score less than the fifth percentile on the TGMD-2. Participants were randomly assigned to the MC or EP 14-week interventions emphasizing gross motor skill practice. Data collection and analysis: Children were assessed at pre- and post-intervention. A 2 (groups) × 2 (disability) × 2 (time) analyses of variance with repeated measures on the last factor was conducted. Change scores, t-test comparisons on the delta scores and Cohen’s D were also calculated. Results: The MC group demonstrated significant and positive changes over the intervention period. Further, the MC group showed superior locomotor and object control performance and higher recall of verbal cues (p ≤.05) at post-intervention compared to the EP group. Children with and without disabilities within the MC showed similar patterns of improvement. The EP intervention did not demonstrate significant improvements. Conclusion: Children with and without disabilities showed improvements in motor skills and VR when exposed to an MC, incorporating the six TARGET structures. These structures included (a) providing feedback and encouragement, providing opportunities for decision-making and establishing personal goals, (b) including parents in the recognition of children’s achievements, (c) creating opportunities to experience leadership and self-pacing, (d) guiding children to use verbal cues and modeling when practicing gross motor skills, and (e) providing demonstrations and teaching children to self-monitor their performance. Instruction is therefore seen as critical to learning gross motor skills, as demonstrated from the findings. Although there were opportunities for vigorous play within the EP intervention, the children did not show improvements in motor performance or VR. These findings suggest that new trends in teacher education physical education to prioritize physical activity over good motor skill instruction may not be advantageous for children in the early years, and should be reconsidered. © 2016 Association for Physical Education.","exercise play intervention; Fundamental motor skills; mastery climate intervention; motor development; verbal recall",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990228327

The molecule has been the subject of recent increased interest as a consequence of the so-called <q>mystery of CCl4</q>, the discrepancy between atmospheric observations and reported production and consumption. Surface measurements of CCl4 atmospheric concentrations have declined at a rate almost 3 times lower than its lifetime-limited rate, suggesting persistent atmospheric emissions despite the ban. In this paper, we study CCl4 vertical and zonal distributions in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (including the photolytic loss region, 70-20ĝhPa), its trend, and its stratospheric lifetime using measurements from the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS), which operated onboard the ENVISAT satellite from 2002 to 2012.

At the lowest altitudes sounded by MIPAS, we find trends consistent with those determined on the basis of long-term ground-based measurements (ĝ'10 to ĝ'13ĝpptvĝdecadeĝ'1). For higher altitudes, the trend shows a pronounced asymmetry between the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and the magnitude of the decline rate increases with altitude. We use a simplified model assuming tracer-tracer linear correlations to determine CCl4 lifetime in the lower stratosphere. The calculation provides a global average lifetime of 47 (39-61) years, considering CFC-11 as the reference tracer. This value is consistent with the most recent literature result of 44 (36-58) years. © 2017 Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028616564

I unravel the complexity of rebound in an international context, for which purpose the distinction between national and international rebound is introduced. The main climate–energy strategies and policies are assessed based on their capacity to control rebound, with carbon pricing–especially cap-and-trade–appearing to be the best approach. It is argued that motivations for further negotiations on amendments to the recent Paris climate agreement, namely on national policy coordination, can be strengthened by rebound concerns. As part of this, a new suggestion is to complement carbon equalization tariffs on carbon-intensive goods imported from countries with weak or non-existent climate policies with ‘revenue-recycling offsets’. These offsets would ease the political way to implementing carbon equalization tariffs, in turn creating pressure on countries to sign an effective climate treaty–a requirement to achieve consistent and serious carbon pricing worldwide. To support these arguments, the empirical patterns of rebound estimates are broadly outlined. Policy relevance Rebound is given scant attention in both IPCC documents and UNFCCC climate summits, where climate agreements are negotiated. This article argues that without an international climate treaty, or with a soft treaty in the form of voluntary pledges, as characterizes the recent Paris climate agreement, well-intended local and national climate strategies will seriously rebound in terms of CO2 emissions. This means that the motivations for climate negotiations can be strengthened by drawing attention to rebound concerns. The major current climate–energy strategies and policies are assessed on the basis of their capacity to control rebound, with carbon pricing–notably cap-and-trade–revealed to be the best approach. Further analysis and discussion of this is welcome, especially as rebound is neglected in the comparisons of carbon tax and emissions trading solutions to global warming. In particular, rebound should be added to the set of core criteria for judging and comparing instruments of climate policy. In addition, a new suggestion offered is to complement a climate club with carbon equalization tariffs on carbon-intensive goods imported from countries lacking strong climate policy with ‘revenue-recycling offsets’. This would make the implementation of such tariffs more politically feasible as well as creating pressure on countries to sign an effective climate treaty. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","carbon import tariff; carbon rebound; climate agreement; climate club; climate negotiations; energy efficiency","carbon emission; emissions trading; energy efficiency; environmental economics; environmental policy; international agreement; negotiation process; pollution tax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973171127

Each trace gas has its own lifetime, dominant sources and sinks, and observational network (from flask sampling and in situ measurements to space-based remote sensing) and therefore comes with its own optimal configuration of the data assimilation. The CarbonTracker Europe data assimilation system for CO2 estimates global carbon sources and sinks, and updates are released annually and used in carbon cycle studies. CarbonTracker Europe simulations are performed using the new modular implementation of the data assimilation system: The CarbonTracker Data Assimilation Shell (CTDAS). Here, we present and document this redesign of the data assimilation code that forms the heart of CarbonTracker, specifically meant to enable easy extension and modification of the data assimilation system. This paper also presents the setup of the latest version of CarbonTracker Europe (CTE2016), including the use of the gridded state vector, and shows the resulting carbon flux estimates. We present the distribution of the carbon sinks over the hemispheres and between the land biosphere and the oceans. We show that with equal fossil fuel emissions, 2015 has a higher atmospheric CO2 growth rate compared to 2014, due to reduced net land carbon uptake in later year. The European carbon sink is especially present in the forests, and the average average net uptake over 2001-2015 was 0:17±0:11 PgCyr-1 with reductions to zero during drought years. Finally, we also demonstrate the versatility of CTDAS by presenting an overview of the wide range of applications for which it has been used so far. © The Author(s) 2017.",,"atmosphere-biosphere interaction; atmospheric gas; carbon balance; carbon budget; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon emission; carbon flux; carbon sink; data assimilation; fossil fuel; software; source-sink dynamics; trace gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024856899

Advances in biochemical and molecular techniques have helped in enhancing our understanding of biofilm structure and development. In the past, research on biofilms primarily focussed on health and industrial sectors; however, lately, biofilms in agriculture are gaining attention due to their immense potential in crop production, protection, and improvement. Biofilms play an important role in colonization of surfaces – soil, roots, or shoots of plants and enable proliferation in the desired niche, besides enhancing soil fertility. Although reports are available on microbial biofilms in general; scanty information is published on biofilm formation by agriculturally important microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, bacterial-fungal) and their interactions in the ecosystem. Better understanding of agriculturally important bacterial-fungal communities and their interactions can have several implications on climate change, soil quality, plant nutrition, plant protection, bioremediation, etc. Understanding the factors and genes involved in biofilm formation will help to develop more effective strategies for sustainable and environment-friendly agriculture. The present review brings together fundamental aspects of biofilms, in relation to their formation, regulatory mechanisms, genes involved, and their application in different fields, with special emphasis on agriculturally important microbial biofilms. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

On the one side, collaboration between port terminals and shipping liners can lead to costs savings and help achieve a sustainable supply chain, and on the other side, the optimization of operations and sailing times leads to reductions in bunker consumption and, thus, to fuel cost and air emissions reductions. To that effect, there is an increasing need to address the integration opportunities and environmental issues related to container shipping through optimization. This paper focuses on the well known Berth Allocation Problem (BAP), an optimization problem assigning berthing times and positions to vessels in container terminals. We introduce a novel mathematical formulation that extends the classical BAP to cover multiple ports in a shipping network under the assumption of strong cooperation between shipping lines and terminals. Speed is optimized on all sailing legs between ports, demonstrating the effect of speed optimization in reducing the total time of the operation, as well as total fuel consumption and emissions. Furthermore, the model implementation shows that an accurate speed discretization can result in far better economic and environmental results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Berth allocation problem; Container terminal operations; Green maritime logistics; Integer programming; Speed optimization","Containers; Integer programming; Optimization; Port terminals; Railroad yards and terminals; Ships; Speed; Supply chains; Transfer cases (vehicles); Berth allocation problem; Container terminal operation; Global trading system; Green maritime logistics; Mathematical formulation; Optimization problems; Speed optimization; Sustainable supply chains; Reservation systems; container terminal; cost-benefit analysis; environmental issue; logistics; maritime transportation; optimization; port operation; resource allocation; shipping",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019543019

The research is primarily based on a panel analysis for the European Union (EU-28) member states plus Norway over the period 1990–2015, to which a fixed-effect estimator was applied. The results suggest that the residential electricity price has one-third on energy intensity, taking into account the control variables. This implies that the level and structure of electricity prices should be considered as a potential energy policy tool for improving energy efficiency by reducing energy intensity. The results also suggest that energy intensity in Europe was favourably affected by the restructuring of industrial companies in transitional economies, the implementation of national programmes for improvement of energy efficiency, and the introduction of EU Emissions Trading Scheme. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity prices; Energy intensity; Europe; Panel analysis","electricity; energy efficiency; energy policy; European Union; industrial restructuring; panel data; price determination; residential energy; transitional economy; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024493733

A new Divertor Spectroscopy System has been developed for this purpose. Further development of Balmer line analysis techniques has allowed detailed information to be extracted from the three-body recombination contribution to the n = 7 Balmer line intensity. During density ramps, the plasma at the target detaches as inferred from a drop in ion current to the target. At the same time the Balmer 6 → 2 and 7 → 2 line emission near the target is dominated by recombination. As the core density increases further, the density and recombination rate are rising all along the outer leg to the x-point while remaining highest at the target. Even at the highest core densities accessed (Greenwald fraction 0.7) the peaks in recombination and density may have moved not more than a few cm poloidally away from the target which is different to other, higher density tokamaks, where both the peak in recombination and density continue to move towards the x-point as the core density is increased. The inferred magnitude of recombination is small compared to the target ion current at the time detachment (particle flux drop) starts at the target. However, recombination may be having more localized effects (to a flux tube) which we cannot discern at this time. Later, at the highest densities achieved, the total recombination does reach levels similar to the particle flux. © 2017","Balmer line spectroscopy; Detachment; Divertor spectroscopy; TCV tokamak; Tokamak power exhaust; Volumetric recombination","Drops; Magnetoplasma; Tokamak devices; Balmer lines; Detachment; Power exhausts; TCV tokamak; Volumetric recombination; Spectrum analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018627772

The state of California acknowledges that agriculture both contributes to and is affected by climate change, and in 2016 it adopted legislation to help growers reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, explicitly including N2O. Nitrous oxide emissions can vary widely due to environmental and agronomic factors with most emission estimates coming from temperate grain systems. There is, however, a dearth of emission estimates from perennial and vegetable cropping systems commonly found in California's Mediterranean climate. Therefore, emission factors (EFs) specific to California conditions are needed to accurately assess statewide N2O emissions and mitigation options. In this paper, we review 16 studies reporting annual and seasonal N2O emissions. This data set represents all available studies on measured emissions at the whole field scale and on an event basis. Through this series of studies, we discuss how such farm management and environmental factors influence N2O emissions from California agriculture and may serve as a basis for improved EF calculations.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029517685

The current regulation and recommendation encourages the implementation of plant cover, mainly to improve soil fertility and reduce erosion. However, there is no quantitative information on the dynamics and pools of soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions of different protection levels of the plant-residue-derived organic carbon (OC). This study was conducted to provide a range of annual OC inputs in commercial olive oil groves under natural plant cover, to assess the influence of the annual application of aboveground plant cover residues on unprotected and physically, chemically and biochemically protected SOC. In addition, we tested the carbon saturation hypothesis under plant cover. Ten olive oil orchards under plant cover management (PC), together with five comparable bare soil olive oil orchards (NPC) were selected and annual aboveground natural plant residues and SOC pools were sampled and quantified. Annual aboveground plant cover biomass and OC production in PC olive orchards averaged 1.48 t dry-weight (DW) ha−1 and 0.56 t C DW ha−1, respectively with a great variability among sites (coefficient of variation of about 100%). SOC concentration in PC orchards was, on average, 2.8 (0–5 cm soil) and 2.0 (5–15 cm) times higher than in bare soils of NPC, and the pool of protected SOC in the top 15 cm was 2.1 times higher in the PC (17.9 mg C g−1 ± 5.7) (±standard deviation) compared to NPC (8.5 mg C g−1 ± 2.9) olive orchards. Linear or saturation type relationships between each SOC fraction and total SOC content for the range of SOC of the commercial olive oil orchards were statistically indistinguishable, and thus linear models to predict SOC accumulation due to plant cover in olive orchards are suitable, at least for the studied range of SOC. Overall, at regional scale where olive oil groves represent a very high proportion of the agricultural land, the use of plant cover appears to be a promising practice that promotes protection of the SOC, thus improving SOC sequestration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Olive orchards; Plant cover; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic carbon fractions","erosion control; Mediterranean environment; orchard; organic carbon; plant residue; rainfed agriculture; saturation; shrub; soil carbon; soil fertility; vegetation cover",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020020712

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the waste sector contribute to 3% of total anthropogenic emissions. In this study, applicable solutions for municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Luangprabang (LPB) and Laos were examined. Material flow analysis of MSW was performed to estimate the amount of MSW generated in 2015. Approximately 29,419 tonnes of MSW is estimated for 2015. Unmanaged landfilling was the main disposal method, while MSW open burning was also practiced to some extent. The International Panel on Climate Change 2006 model and the Atmospheric Brown Clouds Emission Inventory Manual were used to estimate GHG emissions from existing MSW management, and total emissions are 33,889 tonnes/year carbon dioxide-equivalents (CO2-eq). Three scenarios were developed in order to reduce GHG emissions and environmental problems. Improvement of the MSW management by expanding MSW collection services, introducing composting and recycling, and avoiding open burning, can be considered as solutions to overcome the problems for LPB. The lowest GHG emissions are achieved in the scenario where composting and recycling are proposed, with the total GHG emissions reduction by 18,264 tonnes/year CO2-eq. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ABC EIM; Greenhouse gas emissions; IPCC; landfill; open burning","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Recycling; Waste treatment; ABC EIM; Anthropogenic emissions; Environmental problems; Greenhouse gas reductions; IPCC; Material flow analysis; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Open burning; Municipal solid waste; carbon dioxide; emission control; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; landfill; material flow analysis; municipal solid waste; recycling; waste management; Article; carbon footprint; composting; energy conservation; environmental protection; flow measurement; greenhouse gas; landfill; Laos; material flow analysis; municipal solid waste; recycling; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; environmental monitoring; prevention and control; procedures; waste disposal; Laos; air pollutant; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Laos; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Refuse Disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015680346

The classical phosphine P(t-Bu)3 Lewis base in conjunction with two Lewis acids, B(C6F5)3 and Al(C6F5)3, were used as representative models of intermolecular FLPs. DFT calculations were performed using the dispersion corrected ωB97x-D functional, including toluene as a solvent through the PCM-SMD implicit solvent scheme. The results show that, in all cases, the activation barrier is larger for methane than for hydrogen. We conclude that the observed increase in the barrier for methane activation is due primarily to a larger distortion in methane compared to hydrogen to reach the transition state. Second, a large distortion of the Lewis acid to attain a better interaction with the σ-bond in methane was observed. Finally, we found that, for both hydrogen and methane activation, a considerable reduction in the free energy activation barrier is observed when the Lewis acid Al(C6F5)3 is used. From the results extracted in this study, we propose the use of alanes acids as good candidates for methane activation. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Frustrated Lewis pairs; Hydrogen activation; Many body decomposition analysis; Methane activation; Reaction force","hydrogen; Lewis acid; Lewis base; methane; phosphine; toluene; Article; calculation; comparative study; density functional theory; dispersion; energy; force; molecular interaction; priority journal; reduction (chemistry)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025456892

Yet it is not clear to what extent their effects on animal communities are direct or indirectly mediated by changes in biotic factors, such as plant diversity. Here, we disentangle the direct and indirect effects of climate, human disturbance, vegetation structure and plant functional traits on the functional diversity of avian frugivore communities across a large environmental gradient. Location: Mount Kilimanjaro. Time period: Sampling between November 2013 and October 2015. Major taxa studied: Fleshy-fruited plants, frugivorous birds. Methods: We sampled plant and bird communities along an elevational and a human disturbance gradient and measured corresponding morphological traits of plants and birds to calculate indices of functional identity and functional diversity of plant and bird communities. We used structural equation models to disentangle direct and indirect effects of all variables on functional identity and diversity of frugivorous bird communities. Results: Both functional identity and diversity of frugivorous bird communities were consistently related to the functional identity and diversity of plant communities. Climate had almost exclusively indirect effects on functional identity and diversity of bird communities mediated through effects on plant functional identity and diversity. In contrast, human disturbance also had direct negative effects on bird diversity. Main conclusions: We show that plant functional identity and diversity are the most important drivers of functional identity and diversity of frugivorous birds. Although effects of climate on bird communities are almost exclusively mediated indirectly through plant communities, human disturbance resulted in a direct reduction of bird diversity. The high degree of trait matching between interdependent trophic levels over a large environmental gradient demonstrates the importance of biotic drivers for animal communities and shows that biodiversity models need to consider such bottom-up effects in future conditions. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","bottom-up effects; elevational gradient; frugivorous birds; fruiting plants; Kilimanjaro; land-use gradient; structural equation models","Animalia; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020697143

Malaria remains a substantial problem in this region and efforts to minimise transmission should be considered in future house planning. We studied how building elements, which have been successfully employed in southeast Asia to prevent mosquitos from entering and cooling the house, could be integrated in a more sustainable house design in rural northeastern Tanzania, Africa, to decrease mosquito density and regulate indoor climate. Methods In this field study, six prototype houses of southeast Asian design were built in in the village of Magoda in Muheza District, Tanga Region, Tanzania, and compared with modified and unmodified, traditional, sub-Saharan African houses. Prototype houses were built with walls made of lightweight permeable materials (bamboo, shade net, or timber) with bedrooms elevated from the ground and with screened windows. Modified and unmodified traditional African houses, wattle-daub or mud-block constructions, built on the ground with poor ventilation served as controls. In the modified houses, major structural problems such as leaking roofs were repaired, windows screened, open eaves blocked with bricks and mortar, cement floors repaired or constructed, and rain gutters and a tank for water storage added. Prototype houses were randomly allocated to village households through a free, fair, and transparent lottery. The lottery tickets were deposited in a bucket made of transparent plastic. Each participant could draw one ticket. Hourly measurements of indoor temperature and humidity were recorded in all study houses with data loggers and mosquitoes were collected indoors and outdoors using Furvela tent traps and were identified with standard taxonomic keys. Mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae complex were identified to species using PCR. Attitudes towards the new house design were assessed 6–9 months after the residents moved into their new or modified homes through 15 in-depth interviews with household heads of the new houses and five focus group discussions including neighbours of each group of prototype housing. Findings Between July, 2014, and July, 2015, six prototype houses were constructed; one single and one double storey building with each of the following claddings: bamboo, shade net, and timber. The overall reduction of all mosquitoes caught was highest in the double-storey buildings (96%; 95% CI 92–98) followed closely by the reduction found in single-storey buildings (77%; 72–82) and lowest in the modified reference houses (43%; 36–50) and unmodified reference houses (23%; 18–29). The indoor temperature in the new design houses was 2·3°C (95% CI 2·2–2·4) cooler than in the reference houses. While both single and two-storey buildings provided a cooler indoor climate than did traditional housing, two-story buildings provided the biggest reduction in mosquito densities (96%, 95% CI 89–100). Seven people who moved into the prototype houses and seven of their neighbours (three of whom had their houses modified) participated in in-depth interviews. After living in their new prototype houses for 6–9 months, residents expressed satisfaction with the new design, especially the second-storey sleeping area because of the privacy and security of upstairs bedrooms. Interpretation The new design houses had fewer mosquitoes and were cooler than modified and unmodified traditional homes. New house designs are an underused intervention and hold promise to reduce malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa and keep areas malaria-free after elimination.

For this purpose, 25 permanent sample plots were established on lower slopes at different distances from the enterprise (30, 7, 4, 2, and 1 km; 5 plots at each distance) in 1989. The emissions from the smelter have decreased since the early 1990s. In 2012, the emissions of sulfur dioxide and dust decreased by 100 and 40 times, respectively, as compared with the emissions in 1980. Samples of litter and humus horizons were collected on permanent plots in 1989, 1999, and 2012. The results indicate that the pH of the litter and humus horizons restored to the background level 10 and 23 years after the beginning of the reduction in emissions, respectively. However, these characteristics in the impact zone still somewhat differ from those in the background area. In 2012, the content of Cu in the litter decreased compared to 1989 on all the plots; the content of Cu in the humus horizon decreased only in the close vicinity of the smelter. The contents of other metals in the litter and humus horizons remain constant or increased (probably because of the pH-dependent decrease in migration capacity). The absence of pronounced removal of metals from soils results in the retention of high contamination risk and the conservation of the suppressed state of biota within the impact zone. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","ecosystem stability; industrial pollution; metal mobility; resilience; Retisols; soil recovery; soil remediation; toxicity","Abies; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028027028

Model developers normally calibrate the values of these parameters subjectively to improve the agreement of forecasts with available observations, a procedure referred as expert tuning. A practicable objective multi-variate calibration method build on a quadratic meta-model (MM), that has been applied for a regional climate model (RCM) has shown to be at least as good as expert tuning. Based on these results, an approach to implement the methodology to an NWP model is presented in this study. Challenges in transferring the methodology from RCM to NWP are not only restricted to the use of higher resolution and different time scales. The sensitivity of the NWP model quality with respect to the model parameter space has to be clarified, as well as optimize the overall procedure, in terms of required amount of computing resources for the calibration of an NWP model. Three free model parameters affecting mainly turbulence parameterization schemes were originally selected with respect to their influence on the variables associated to daily forecasts such as daily minimum and maximum 2 m temperature as well as 24 h accumulated precipitation. Preliminary results indicate that it is both affordable in terms of computer resources and meaningful in terms of improved forecast quality. In addition, the proposed methodology has the advantage of being a replicable procedure that can be applied when an updated model version is launched and/or customize the same model implementation over different climatological areas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Calibration; COSMO model; Modelling; Numerical weather prediction","Calibration; Climate models; Forecasting; Models; Weather forecasting; COSMO model; Different time scale; Model implementation; Numerical weather prediction; Numerical weather prediction models; Parameterization schemes; Regional climate modeling (RCM); Turbulence parameterization; Numerical models; calibration; climate modeling; climate prediction; numerical model; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015084149

We compared monthly input and output fluxes of N, Si, and P at the entrance and exit of the hypereutrophic Curonian Lagoon to better understand how seasonal changes in the stoichiometry of nutrient inputs and the occurrence of algal blooms affected nutrient retention within the lagoon. Nutrient ratios were indicative of increasing Si and N limitation during the growing season, and these were associated with a shift from a diatom-based to a cyanobacteria dominated phytoplankton community. The estuary was a net sink for dissolved nutrients, but we observed large interannual difference in the overall retention of N and P. The occurrence of a large cyanobacteria bloom in 2012 was associated with increased export of particulate matter to the Baltic Sea resulting in a net surplus of P export. Bloom conditions mobilized P from sediments and resulted in a shift from net retention to net export for the lagoon. The findings of our study illustrate how changes in nutrient loading ratios influence phytoplankton community composition, which in turn alters the source-sink status of the estuary. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Algal bloom; Curonian lagoon; Ecological stoichiometry; Estuary; Eutrophication; Mass budget; Nutrients","algal bloom; coastal lagoon; cyanobacterium; estuarine environment; land-sea interaction; nitrogen; nutrient enrichment; phosphorus; phytoplankton; retention; seasonal variation; silicon; stoichiometry; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Curonian Lagoon; Europe; algae; Bacillariophyta; Cyanobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022179210

Concerned with the prevalence of adolescent pregnancy, lack of social support, depression, and failure to complete high school, a nurse midwife invited PPEs from a School of Nursing to meet with stakeholders to introduce the PPE program to Bahamian youth. Mentored by a faculty advisor, the PPEs assumed a leadership role and determined that the primary needs of Grand Bahamian adolescents were messages of self-empowerment and proactive life planning within a cultural context. Positive responses from stakeholders and the promise of a partnership between a School of Nursing and a Caribbean community encouraged the PPEs to adapt their PPE program to the cultural climate and needs of the island of Grand Bahama.

Method: Twelve 4-year-old children participated in a mastery-motivational climate physical activity program delivered 2 days a week for 20 weeks during a period of 8 months. All children were fitted with an Actigraph GT3X triaxial accelerometer. Data from the accelerometers were reduced to determine minutes of sedentary time, light physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during (a) all 20 weeks, and (b) Weeks 1 through 4, Weeks 9 through 12, and Weeks 17 to 20 for the mastery climate. Activity levels in the mastery condition were compared to the children’s activity during unplanned free play in Weeks 1, 10, and 20. Results: During the course of the mastery-motivational climate program, participation in sedentary behavior decreased statistically significantly, while participation in MVPA increased statistically significantly. Within the free-play condition, there were no changes in the levels of activity across time, with the children spending on average more than 80% of their time being sedentary. Conclusions: Findings indicate that when specific task structures associated with a mastery climate are included in an instructional setting, these climate manipulations seem to have a direct effect on physical activity levels once the children learned how to manage themselves in the setting. Free-play activity in and of itself does not appear to stimulate MVPA. © 2017 SHAPE America.","Engagement; free play; physical education; young children","accelerometry; child behavior; exercise; female; human; male; motivation; physical education; preschool child; procedures; psychology; recreation; sedentary lifestyle; Accelerometry; Child Behavior; Child, Preschool; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Physical Education and Training; Play and Playthings; Sedentary Lifestyle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019573929

Here, relevant methane-cycling microbial groups were investigated at two remote Arctic sites with respect to soil potential methane production (PMP). Percent abundances of methanogens and iron-reducing bacteria correlated with increased PMP, while methanotrophs correlated with decreased PMP. Interestingly, α-diversity of the methanogens was positively correlated with PMP, while β-diversity was unrelated to PMP. The β-diversity of the entire microbial community, however, was related to PMP. Shannon diversity was a better correlate of PMP than Simpson diversity across analyses, while rarefied species richness was a weak correlate of PMP. These results demonstrate the following: first, soil pH and microbial community structure both probably control methane production in Arctic soils. Second, there may be high functional redundancy in the methanogens with regard to methane production. Third, iron-reducing bacteria co-occur with methanogens in Arctic soils, and iron-reduction-mediated effects on methanogenesis may be controlled by α- and β-diversity. And finally, species evenness and rare species abundances may be driving relationships between microbial groups, influencing Arctic methane production. © 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"carbon dioxide; methane; Alaska; Arctic; bacterial genome; bacterium; biodiversity; chemistry; classification; environment; genetics; metabolism; metagenome; microbiology; microflora; soil; Alaska; Arctic Regions; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Carbon Dioxide; Environment; Genome, Bacterial; Metagenome; Methane; Microbiota; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027489455

Continental scale patterns in the composition and functioning of microbial communities are related to climatic, biotic, and edaphic factors such as temperature and precipitation, plant community composition, and soil carbon, nitrogen, and pH. Although these relationships have been well explored individually, the examination of the factors that may act directly on microbial communities vs. those that may act indirectly through other ecosystem properties has not been well developed. To further such understanding, we utilized structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate a set of hypotheses about the direct and indirect effects of climatic, biotic, and edaphic variables on microbial communities across the continental United States. The primary goals of this work were to test our current understanding of the interactions among climate, soils, and plants in affecting microbial community composition, and to examine whether variation in the composition of the microbial community affects potential rates of soil enzymatic activities. A model of interacting factors created through SEM shows several expected patterns. Distal factors such as climate had indirect effects on microbial communities by influencing plant productivity, soil mineralogy, and soil pH, but factors related to soil organic matter chemistry had the most direct influence on community composition. We observed that both plant productivity and soil mineral composition were important indirect influences on community composition at the continental scale, both interacting to affect organic matter content and microbial biomass and ultimately community composition. Although soil hydrolytic enzymes were related to the moisture regime and soil carbon, oxidative enzymes were also affected by community composition, reflected in the abundance of soil fungi. These results highlight that soil microbial communities can be modeled within the context of multiple interacting ecosystem properties acting both directly and indirectly on their composition and function, and this provides a rich and informative context with which to examine communities. This work also highlights that variation in climate, microbial biomass, and microbial community composition can affect maximum rates of soil enzyme activities, potentially influencing rates of decomposition and nutrient mineralization in soils. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America","continental scale; soil biota; soil enzymes; structural equation model","abundance; biomass; climate change; climate effect; community composition; decomposition; enzyme; enzyme activity; microbial community; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; United States; Fungi; chemistry; climate; ecosystem; fungus; microbiology; plant; soil; Climate; Ecosystem; Fungi; Plants; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020726429

In this paper we reflect on knowledge practices among a partnership of researchers and NRM planners, under a federal program of NRM investment intended to ‘deliver information’ to regional NRM planners to support planning for climate change. We unpack ‘container’ and ‘conduit’ metaphors of linear, one-way communication invoked by the starting conditions, and explore whether more relational ways of communicating were achieved. A key theme emerged early in the research that NRM planners felt overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information available and discouraged by the irrelevance of much of it to their climate change planning. Our research-practice collaboration unfolded in this context and through ongoing face-to-face and virtual engagement over a period of two years. The collaborative approach featured joint identification of priority activities, co-design of planning approaches, and the iterative co-development of an online ‘information portal’, which acted as a boundary object. We report the emergence of a ‘knowing system’, resulting from these efforts to foster relationships and co-produce boundary objects in a particular geographic context.

Using original data on air pollution infringements, it critically examines the shortcomings with existing mechanisms of air pollution control, regulation and enforcement in the UK. In doing so, it identifies how Criminology must continue to push new boundaries and engage with emerging harmful acts of both local and global concern. © Rob White 2013.

The annual average concentration of levoglucosan was 734±1043 ngm-3 with the maximum seasonal mean concentration during postmonsoon season (2206±1753 ngm-3), followed by winter (1161±1347 ngm-3), pre-monsoon (771±524 ngm-3) and minimum concentration during monsoon season (212±279 ngm-3). The other biomass burning tracers (mannosan, galactosan, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid and dehydroabietic acid) also showed the similar seasonal variations. There were good correlations among levoglucosan, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), indicating significant impact of biomass burning activities on carbonaceous aerosol loading throughout the year in Lumbini area. According to the characteristic ratios, levoglucosan / mannosan (lev / man) and syringic acid / vanillic acid (syr / van), we deduced that the high abundances of biomass burning products during nonmonsoon seasons were mainly caused by the burning of crop residues and hardwood while the softwood had less contribution. Based on the diagnostic tracer ratio (i.e., lev / OC), the OC derived from biomass burning constituted large fraction of total OC, especially during post-monsoon season. By analyzing the MODIS fire spot product and 5-day airmass back trajectories, we further demonstrated that organic aerosol composition was not only related to the local agricultural activities and residential biomass usage but also impacted by the regional emissions. During the post-monsoon season, the emissions from rice residue burning in western India and eastern Pakistan could impact particulate air pollution in Lumbini and surrounding regions in southern Nepal. Therefore, our finding is meaningful and has a great importance for adopting the appropriate mitigation measures, not only at the local level but also by involving different regions and nations, to reduce the biomass burning emissions in the broader IGP region nations. © 2017 Author(s).

Models show that global semi-arid regions are experiencing more extreme climate events, which may trigger more C loss from soils. Methods: We used the stable carbon isotope (δ13C) of plant and soil depth profile to examine decomposition rates of SOC along a 2200 km semi-arid grassland transect in northern China. Beta (β) was calculated from the relationship between δ13C and C concentrations of plant and soil profile (0–100 cm). Partial correlation analysis and structure equation models were used to analyze correlations between beta and climatic and edaphic variables. Results: We found that the δ13C values increased from plant tissues to surface soil and then deep soil at all sites, while the SOC concentration decreased. The β values ranged from −0.33 to −2.27, with an average value at −1.37. There was a positive correlation between β value and SOC decomposition rate constant (k), supporting the hypothesis that enrichment of δ13C along soil depth profile was mainly due to isotopic fractionation during microbial SOC decomposition. The correlation between β value and aridity index was mainly due to the variations of edaphic properties such as soil C/N ratio with aridity index, pointing to the more important role of edaphic properties in β value than climatic factors. Conclusions: Despite uncertainties associated with the interpretation of soil δ13C along its depth profile, our results demonstrated that soil δ13C could provide an independent benchmark for examining model-based predictions of SOC decomposition in semi-arid grasslands. Incorporation of both climatic and edaphic variables into models may enhance the predictions for SOC dynamics under global climate changes. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Aridity index; Beta value; Carbon decomposition; Climate change models; Grasslands; Soil organic carbon; Turnover rate","aridity; carbon isotope; climate change; decomposition; grassland; index method; isotopic fractionation; organic carbon; semiarid region; soil carbon; soil depth; soil nitrogen; soil profile; terrestrial ecosystem; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017178279

During the SF, traffic flow drops by ∼50% and the industrial plants are almost entirely shut down in Shenzhen. To characterize the variation in ambient air pollutants due to the, various gaseous and particulate pollutants were measured in real time in urban Shenzhen over three consecutive winters (2014-2016). The results indicate that the concentrations of NO, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), black carbon (BC), primary organic aerosols, chloride, and nitrate in submicron aerosols decrease by 50-80% during SF periods relative to non-Spring Festival periods, regardless of meteorological conditions. This decrease suggests that these pollutants are mostly emitted or secondarily formed from urban local emissions. The concentration variation in species mostly from regional or natural sources, however, is found to be much less, such as for bulk fine particulate matter (PM2. 5). More detailed analysis of the Spring Festival effect reveals an urgent need to reduce emissions of SO2 and VOCs on a regional scale rather than on an urban scale to reduce urban PM2. 5 in Shenzhen, which can also be useful as a reference for other megacities in China. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"aerosol; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; chloride; concentration (composition); megacity; nitrate; nitrogen oxides; pollutant source; urban pollution; volatile organic compound; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026529350

There is a huge fossil-fuel reserve and production capacity in western China, whereas their underdeveloped social and economic status means that there is lower demand. The more developed eastern coastal regions of China show dynamic economic momentum and, hence, higher energy demand. Based on the carbon emission flows in network theory, this paper proposes an approach to recalculate provincial CO2 emissions from the perspective of secondary energy consumption. This approach attributes CO2 emissions to final energy consumers after considering cross-provincial secondary energy trading, especially cross-provincial electric power trading in the regional power grid. Given the uneven distribution of energy resources and the imbalance of energy consumption among regions, cross-provincial secondary energy trading in China is significant, especially in the power industry. By adopting the approach proposed in this paper, the provincial carbon intensity and the corresponding energy policy can be modified to make energy end users pay rather than the primary producer. © 2017","Carbon emission flow; CO2 emissions; Cross-provincial secondary energy trading; Regional grid structure","Commerce; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Power markets; Proven reserves; Accurate calculations; Carbon emission flows; Carbon intensity; Energy trading; Primary producers; Production capacity; Regional grids; Regional power grids; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020050642

However, microbial range size across geographical gradients remains understudied, especially on mountainsides. Here, the patterns of range size of stream microbes (i.e., bacteria and diatoms) and macroorganisms (i.e., macroinvertebrates) along elevational gradients in Asia and Europe were examined. In bacteria, elevational range size showed non-significant phylogenetic signals. In all taxa, there was a positive relationship between niche breadth and species elevational range size, driven by local environmental and climatic variables. No taxa followed the elevational Rapoport's rule. Climate variability explained the most variation in microbial mean elevational range size, whereas local environmental variables were more important for macroinvertebrates. Seasonal and annual climate variation showed negative effects, while daily climate variation had positive effects on community mean elevational range size for all taxa. The negative correlation between range size and species richness suggests that understanding the drivers of range is key for revealing the processes underlying diversity. The results advance the understanding of microbial species thermal barriers by revealing the importance of seasonal and diurnal climate variation, and highlight that aquatic and terrestrial biota may differ in their response to short- and long-term climate variability. © 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"animal; Asia; bacterium; biodiversity; biota; climate; diatom; Europe; geography; growth, development and aging; invertebrate; isolation and purification; phylogeny; species difference; Animals; Asia; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Biota; Climate; Diatoms; Europe; Geography; Invertebrates; Phylogeny; Species Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027512134

In the CCS chain, i.e. from capture to storage via transportation, it is essential to realize accurate measurement of CO2 flows for the purpose of accounting and potential leakage detection. However, there are some significant challenges for the current flow metering technologies to achieve the specified 1.5% measurement uncertainty in the EU-ETS (European Union-Emissions Trading Scheme) for all expected flow conditions. Moreover, there are very few CO2 flow test and calibration facilities that can recreate CCS conditions particularly two-phase CO2 flow in pipelines together with accurate measurement standards. As one of the most potential flowmeters that may be used in the CCS chain, Coriolis flowmeters have the advantages of direct measurement of mass flow rate regardless of its state (liquid, gas, gas/liquid two-phase or supercritical) in addition to the measurement of temperature and density of CO2 for the characterization of flow conditions. This paper assesses the performance of Coriolis flowmeters incorporating a soft-computing correction method for gas-liquid two-phase CO2 flow measurement. The correction method includes a pre-trained backpropagation neural network. Experimental work was conducted on a purpose-built 25 mm bore two-phase CO2 flow test rig for liquid mass flowrate between 300 kg/h and 3050 kg/h and gas mass flowrate from 0 to 330 kg/h under the fluid temperature of 19∼21 °C and pressure of 54∼58 bar. Experimental results suggest that the Coriolis flowmeters with the developed correction method are capable of providing the mass flow rate of gas-liquid CO2 flow with errors mostly within ±2% and ±1.5% on horizontal and vertical pipelines, respectively. © 2017 IEEE.","CCS; Coriolis mass flowmeter; Flow measurement; Gas volume fraction; Gas-liquid CO2 flow","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Chains; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Environmental regulations; Flow rate; Flowmeters; Gas emissions; Gases; Industrial emissions; International law; Liquids; Mass transfer; Neural networks; Pipelines; Soft computing; Uncertainty analysis; Back propagation neural networks; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Coriolis mass flow meter; Electrical power generation; European union emissions trading schemes; Gas liquids; Gas volume fraction; Measurement of temperature; Flow measurement",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026754920

It was found that the new method worked well and identified that having the tank near to the system and connected directly to the source saves pumping energy in all of the WDSs analyzed. If the initial cost of relocating the tank for existing systems or locating the tank near to the source in new systems is less than the cost of energy savings over the lifetime of the tank, then having the tank near to the source is financially worth it. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","global climate change; greenhouse gases; Sustainability; water distribution network; water supply","climate change; cost analysis; distribution system; energy conservation; global climate; greenhouse gas; sensitivity analysis; storage tank; sustainability; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990923758

Most of carbon atoms were in solid solution state in the C-containing TiAl alloys and some fine carbide were dispersedly distributed in the lamellar matrix in case of 0.5 at% carbon additions. For the TiAl alloys containing carbon, the lattice parameters (i.e., a and c) and unit cell volume of α2 phase increased larger than those of γ phase due to higher solid solubility of carbon in the α2 phase. Incorporations of carbon refined the interlamellar spacing of the TiAl based alloys by promoting the nucleation of γ phase and suppressing the thickening of γ lath. The room temperature tensile properties of the TiAl based alloy were improved by the additions of carbon and the alloy with 0.2 at% C showed the highest tensile strength. The trans-lamellar was the major fracture mode. Besides, more excellent high temperature ductility was acquired for the C-doped TiAl alloys because parts of the lamellae displayed the features of ductile fracture.

Using panel data gathered from China's cities from 2000 to 2010, we take advantage of the significant variation in the temporal change of density across cities to estimate the relationship between gross urban population density and multiple indicators of urban greenness. Fixed-effects estimates support the widely held belief that density improves air quality and reduces the per capita carbon footprint. Results also suggest that higher density reduces the growth of road infrastructure and vehicle ownership and promotes walking. While density often translates into proximity and accessibility, higher density does reduce a city's per capita urban park and green space.

Phase purity analysis, which had been checked by the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), showed that all the obtained samples crystallized in a scheelite structure with the space group of I41/a (No. 88). In these samples, we found that increasing the x value enabled shifting the XRD position to the low angle direction. For the photoluminescence (PL) properties, the charge transfer (CT) band as the x value increases exhibited an initial intensity increase followed by a subsequent decrease, and the optimal x value for the maximum CT band intensity was experimentally found to be 0.25. In sharp difference, directly exciting at the excitations of Eu3+, viz. 393 and 464 nm, allowed the Eu3+ emission to constantly increase the emission intensity. In order to further enhance the red fluorescence intensity, the WO3 was selected to co-dope into the NaxCa1−2xMoO4:Eux 3+ (x = 0.5) sample in order to form the Na0.50(MoO4)1−y(WO4)y:Eu0.50 3+ solid solution compounds. Upon excitation at 393 and 464 nm, the y value that corresponded to optimal Eu3+ fluorescence intensity was found to be 0.5. To illustrate our experimental observations, feasible mechanism profile was also given in this work.

In this study, as a self-regulating demand response (DR) management mechanism, deferrable electrolyzers are used as a main controlled resource in a hydrogen-based clean energy hub (CEH), which includes a traditional generation plant (TGP), a low-carbon generation plant (LGP), and wind energy. Based on the hysteresis control model for aggregated electrolyzers, a comfort-constrained optimal energy state regulation (OESR) control strategy is implemented to model the deregulation feature of aggregated electrolyzers. The electrolyzers' population can be integrated as a controlled efficient power plant (EPP) to provide the virtual spinning reserve for CEH. As a flexible and self-regulating participant, the electrolyzer-based EPP is integrated into the hybrid resource constrained optimization model; this reduces the total cost of CEH and carbon emissions and improves the integration of wind energy. Combined with TGP, LGP, and wind energy, the simulation results show that the deployment of aggregated electrolyzers on both the supply and demand sides of the CEH contributes to significant amounts of low-carbon hydrogen. The simulation also illustrates that the DR control strategy has a positive effect on active power and reserve re-dispatch. © 2017 by the authors.

Platinum (Pt) is the state-of-the-art electrocatalyst for IRR, which unfortunately suffers from high cost and poor stability. Herein, strongly coupled LaNiO3 perovskite/carbon composites are developed for the first time as highly efficient, stable and low-cost electrocatalysts for IRR to enable better DSSCs. High-energy ball milling of crystallized LaNiO3 with carbon material is applied for the facile synthesis of LaNiO3/carbon composites. This ball-milling process simultaneously leads to partial reduction of LaNiO3 by carbon with the creation of oxygen vacancies inside the perovskite oxide lattice, a decrease in LaNiO3 particle size and the creation of strong coupling between LaNiO3 and carbon. Particularly, DSSC with LaNiO3/multi-walled carbon nanotubes photocathode delivers a high power conversion efficiency of 9.81% with an attractive enhancement of 21% compared with Pt electrocatalyst, superior to most state-of-the-art highly efficient Pt-free photocathodes in DSSCs. LaNiO3 or carbon alone demonstrates a much poorer performance. Moreover, LaNiO3/carbon composites demonstrate excellent operational stability.

We investigated this issue using long-Term sunshine duration records from China, which experienced a rapid increase in urbanization during the past decades. Over the period 1960-2013, 172 pairs of urban and nearby rural stations were analyzed. Urban and rural sunshine duration trends show similar spatial patterns during a dimming phase (1960-1989) and a subsequent period during which trends were leveling off (1990-2013). This indicates that rather than local effects, the trends in sunshine duration are on more of a national or regional scale in China. Nevertheless, in the dimming phase, the declining rate of sunshine duration in rural areas is around two-Thirds of that in urban areas. The ratio of rural to urban dimming generally increases from a minimum of 0.39 to a maximum of 0.87 with increasing indices of urbanization calculated based on the year 2013.

A visualization study on the spray and combustion characteristics of water emulsified diesel was conducted experimentally in a constant volume chamber under conventional and LTC conditions. The effects of ambient temperature on the evaporation, ignition and combustion characteristics of water emulsified diesel were studied under cold, evaporating and combustion conditions. Experimental results showed that the ambient temperature had little effect on the spray structures, in terms of the liquid core length, the spray shape and the spray area. However, higher ambient temperature slightly reduced the Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of the spray droplets. The auto-ignition delay time increased significantly with the decrease of the ambient temperature. The ignition process always occurred at the entrainment region near the front periphery of the liquid core. This entrainment region was evolved from the early injected fuel droplets which were heated and mixed by the continuous entrainment until the local temperature and equivalence ratio reached the ignition condition. The maximum value of integrated natural flame luminosity (INFL) reduced by 60% when the ambient temperature dropped from 1000 to 800 K, indicating a significant decrease of the soot emissions could be achieved by LTC combustion mode than the conventional diesel engines. © 2017 by the authors.

In this paper, we first interpolate the provincial CO2 emissions to prefectural cities with a combination of areal interpolation method and DMSP/OLS nighttime light data. Then, we test the EKC hypothesis with this city-level data and spatial econometric modeling. This research reveals an uneven landscape of CO2 emissions at both provincial and city scales, suggesting a differentiated decomposition of the mitigation target in China. The city-level monotonic increasing relationship between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions per capita confirmed by our EKC test indicates that CO2 emissions would not decrease automatically as income increases. To that end, actions such as improving the energy efficiency and implementing carbon taxes should be taken to reduce CO2 emissions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Areal interpolation; CO2 emissions; DMSP/OLS night lights; EKC; Urban China",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008884575

Methods: Nationwide data on diarrhoea were obtained for 2003 to 2013 from the Health Information and Management System (HIMS), Ministry of Health, Bhutan. Climatic variables were obtained from the Department of Hydro Met Services, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Bhutan. Seasonal trend decomposition was used to examine secular trends and seasonal patterns of diarrhoea. A Bayesian conditional autoregressive (CAR) model was used to quantify the relationship between monthly diarrhoea, maximum temperature, rainfall, age and gender. Results: The monthly average diarrhoea incidence was highly seasonal. Diarrhoea incidence increased by 0.6% (95% CrI: 0.5-0.6%) for every degree increase in maximum temperature; and 5% (95 Cr I: 4.9-5.1%) for a 1 mm increase in rainfall. Children aged <5 years were found to be 74.2% (95% CrI: 74.1-74.4) more likely to experience diarrhoea than children and adults aged ≥5 years and females were 4.9% (95% CrI: 4.4-5.3%) less likely to suffer from diarrhoea as compared to males. Significant residual spatial clustering was found after accounting for climate and demographic variables. Conclusions: Diarrhoea incidence was highly seasonal, with positive associations with maximum temperature and rainfall and negative associations with age and being female. This calls for public health actions to reduce future risks of climate change with great consideration of local climatic conditions. In addition, protection of <5 years children should be prioritize through provision of rotavirus vaccination, safe and clean drinking water, and proper latrines. © 2017 The Author(s).","Bayesian analysis; Bhutan; Diarrhoea; Spatial analysis; Time series analysis","rain; age distribution; Article; Bhutan; diarrhea; environmental temperature; geographic distribution; human; incidence; seasonal variation; sex ratio; spatiotemporal analysis; time series analysis; trend study; adult; Bayes theorem; child; climate change; diarrhea; female; infant; male; preschool child; season; temperature; theoretical model; Adult; Bayes Theorem; Bhutan; Child; Child, Preschool; Climate Change; Diarrhea; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Models, Theoretical; Rain; Seasons; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025100670

This suggests a potential for emissions reductions through improved accessibility to efficient technologies. This paper estimates an upper-bound CO2 emission mitigation potential that could theoretically be achieved by improved access to efficient technologies in industrial sectors. We develop a linear optimization framework that facilitates the exchange of sectoral production technologies based on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), assuming perfect substitutability of technologies and homogeneity within economic sectors, while ignoring barriers to technological adoption and price driven adjustments. We consider the full global supply chain network and multiple upstream production inputs in addition to energy demand. In contrast to existing literature our framework allows to consider supply chain effects of technology replacements. We use our model to calculate emission reduction potentials for varying levels of access to technology. If best practice technologies were made available globally, CO2 emissions could theoretically be reduced by more than 10 gigatons (Gt). In fact, even second-tier production technologies would create significant global reduction potentials. We decompose sectoral emission reductions to identify contributions by changes in energy intensity, supply chain effects and changes in carbon intensities. Excluding the latter, we find that considering supply chain effects increases total mitigation potentials by 14%. The largest CO2 emission reduction potentials are found for a small set of developing countries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","GHG mitigation potential; Multi-regional input output data; Multiple production inputs; Optimization; Sectoral energy intensities; Supply chain effects; Technology transfer","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Linear programming; Optimization; Supply chains; Technology transfer; CO2 emission reduction; Emission reduction potentials; GHG mitigation; Global supply chain network; Input-output data; Multiple production inputs; Sectoral energy; Technological adoption; Greenhouse gases; carbon emission; developing world; emission control; greenhouse gas; input-output analysis; optimization; supply chain management; technology adoption; technology transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030702075

Its parent model, known as ModelE2, is used to simulate modern Earth and near-term paleo-Earth climates. ROCKE-3D is an ongoing effort to expand the capabilities of ModelE2 to handle a broader range of atmospheric conditions, including higher and lower atmospheric pressures, more diverse chemistries and compositions, larger and smaller planet radii and gravity, different rotation rates (from slower to more rapid than modern Earth's, including synchronous rotation), diverse ocean and land distributions and topographies, and potential basic biosphere functions. The first aim of ROCKE-3D is to model planetary atmospheres on terrestrial worlds within the solar system such as paleo-Earth, modern and paleo-Mars, paleo-Venus, and Saturn's moon Titan. By validating the model for a broad range of temperatures, pressures, and atmospheric constituents, we can then further expand its capabilities to those exoplanetary rocky worlds that have been discovered in the past, as well as those to be discovered in the future. We also discuss the current and near-future capabilities of ROCKE-3D as a community model for studying planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres. © 2017. The American Astronomical Society.

We discuss how these conditions influence the radio emission we expect from their magnetospheres. We find that the environmental conditions are such that the cyclotron maser instability (CMI), the process responsible for the generation of radio waves at magnetic planets in the Solar system, most likely will not operate at Hot Jupiters. Hydrodynamically expanding atmospheres possess extended ionospheres whose plasma densities within the magnetosphere are so large that the plasma frequency is much higher than the cyclotron frequency, which contradicts the condition for the production of radio emission and prevents the escape of radio waves from close-in exoplanets at distances < 0.05 au from a Sun-like host star. The upper atmosphere structure of gas giants around stars similar to the Sun changes between 0.2 and 0.5 au from the hydrodynamic to a hydrostatic regime, and this results in conditions similar to Solar system planets with a region of depleted plasma between the exobase and the magnetopause, where the plasma frequency can be lower than the cyclotron frequency. In such an environment, a beam of highly energetic electrons accelerated along the field lines towards the planet can produce radio emission. However, even if the CMI could operate, the extended ionospheres of Hot Jupiters are too dense to allow the radio emission to escape from the planets. © 2017 The Authors.","Planet-star interactions; Planets and satellites: aurorae; Planets and satellites: detection; Planets and satellites: magnetic fields; Radio continuum: planetary systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032749978

The centripetal force in a rotating fluid bed is typically on the order of 10 times the force of gravity. Since the force keeping the particles in the unit is larger, the drag force can also be larger, allowing for higher gas and slip velocities. This operating regime provides intensified gas-solids contact through higher mass transfer, heat transfer, gas throughput, and bubble suppression. One application for using a rotating fluidized bed is in Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC). When solid fuels are used, oxygen carrier and ash are mixed in the process. In order to maintain high carbon capture efficiencies and recyclability of the oxygen carrier, the ash needs to be separated from the oxygen carrier. This separation can be done aerodynamically since the oxygen carrier is larger and heavier than the ash. It is theorized that rotating fluidized beds could improve both the gas-solid and solid-solid separation process efficiency and throughput as compared to conventional fluidized beds. A 43 cm diameter, 2.5 cm long vortex chamber has been designed and constructed to investigate the application to particle separation. A series of experiments have been performed to investigate the separation of different binary mixtures of solids. These experiments demonstrate the use of a rotating fluidized bed for high-G intensified particle separation that can be combined with high-G intensified gas-solids contact and gas-solids separation. © 2016","Ash separation; Carbon capture; Chemical looping; Fluidization; High-G; Process intensification; Rotating fluidized bed","Binary mixtures; Carbon capture; Combustion; Drag; Efficiency; Fluidization; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized bed process; Fuels; Gases; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Oxygen; Particle separators; Separation; Centripetal force; Chemical looping; Chemical-looping combustion; High-G; Operating regimes; Particle separation; Process intensification; Rotating fluidized bed; Fluidized beds; polyethylene; Article; centrifugation; controlled study; density; equipment design; experimental study; flow rate; fluidized bed reactor; force; particle size; separation technique; solid state; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009354840

It was found that annual PM2.5 in this region experienced a significant decrease in 2014 and 2015, compared with 2013. PM2.5 in 2015 almost met the target on air quality in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2012–2017). In southern cities (e.g. Xingtai, Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Cangzhou), this PM2.5 decreasing trend was caused by both meteorological conditions and regional emission controls in 2014 and 2015. Contributions from regional emission controls were more significant than meteorological conditions. In Tianjin and Langfang, the impact of regional emission controls was partly offset by the meteorological conditions in 2014. In 2015, meteorological conditions turned favorable for a PM2.5 decrease, but emission controls were still the dominant cause. Compared with polluted cities in Hebei and Tianjin, the decreasing trend in Beijing was small (4% and 9% in 2014 and 2015). This reflects the competition between adverse meteorological conditions and emission controls. In northern cities (Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, and Zhangjiakou), regional emission controls dominated the PM2.5 decreasing trend in 2014 and 2015, although they were partly offset by meteorological conditions. In all cities during the heating season in 2015, a more significant decreasing trend of high PM2.5 from emission controls was found than low and middle PM2.5. This indicates that air pollution controls are developing towards refined management (e.g. the Heavy Air Pollution Emergency Response Program) in this region. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

FDPs contain a dinuclear iron active site similar to that in hemerythrin, ribonucleotide reductase, and methane monooxygenase, all of which can bind NO and O2. However, only FDP competently turns over NO to N2O. Here, EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopies allow electronic characterization of the diferric and diferrous species of FDP. The exchange-coupling constant J (Hex = JS1·S2) was found to increase from +20 cm-1 to +32 cm-1 upon reduction of the diferric to the diferrous species, indicative of (1) at least one hydroxo bridge between the iron ions for both states and (2) a change to the diiron core structure upon reduction. In comparison to characterized diiron proteins and synthetic complexes, the experimental values were consistent with a dihydroxo bridged diferric core, which loses one hydroxo bridge upon reduction. DFT calculations of these structures gave values of J and Mössbauer parameters in agreement with experiment. Although the crystal structure shows a hydrogen bond between the iron bound aspartate and the bridging solvent molecule, the DFT calculations of structures consistent with the crystal structure gave calculated values of J incompatible with the spectroscopic results. We conclude that the crystal structure of the diferric state does not represent the frozen solution structure and that a mono-μ-hydroxo diferrous species is the catalytically functional state that reacts with NO and O2. The new EPR spectroscopic probe of the diferric state indicated that the diferric structure of FDP prior to and immediately after turnover with NO are flavin mononucleotide (FMN) dependent, implicating an additional proton transfer role for FMN in turnover of NO. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Bacteria; Density functional theory; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Enzymes; Hydrogen bonds; Iron; Metal ions; Nitric oxide; Reduction; Electronic characterization; Exchange coupling constants; Experimental values; Flavin mono nucleotides (FMN); Methane monooxygenase; Ribonucleotide reductase; Spectroscopic probes; Ssbauer spectroscopies; Crystal structure; aspartic acid; flavine mononucleotide; iron; nitric oxide; nitrogen oxide; nonheme iron protein; oxygen; ferric ion; flavoprotein; iron; Article; catalysis; chemical structure; complex formation; crystal structure; density functional theory; electron spin resonance; enzyme analysis; hydrogen bond; Mossbauer spectroscopy; proton transport; reduction (chemistry); chemistry; enzyme active site; enzymology; molecular model; Mossbauer spectroscopy; quantum theory; Thermotoga maritima; Catalytic Domain; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Ferric Compounds; Flavoproteins; Iron; Models, Molecular; Quantum Theory; Spectroscopy, Mossbauer; Thermotoga maritima",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028663583

China’s regional pilot schemes will converge to a (more) uniform price of emission allowances. As China is a major economic and political actor in the world economy, China’s progress with ETS is important. At the same time, China’s progress in the field of green international competitiveness – standing for a positive revealed comparative advantage in environmentally friendly goods – in the period 2000–2015 is considerable and the improved positioning of China in the EIIW-vita sustainability indicator shows considerable technological dynamics in Asia. The European ETS is working, but it suffers from the rather low price of emission allowances. The long-term time horizon of 2050 in the EU climate policy is rather ambitious and it is unclear whether or not a consistent G20 approach can be achieved – with the EU, China, Japan and the US cooperating amongst each other. There is a lack of a specialized climate stabilization institution in the world economy, the traditional anchoring of climate policy in the UN weakens the practical pressure for efficient cooperation since the UN is very heterogeneous in terms of per capita income and GHG emissions per unit of GDP; G20 might be an institution that is suitable for effective policy cooperation.

This is because credible adaptation policies in the sector require greatly enhanced multi-sectoral policy integration if they are to succeed. But this requirement may be beyond the capacity of many countries to deliver. This article explores the integration challenges faced by forest policy-making in Canada and the United States and uses the case of assisted tree migration to probe the reasons for the failure of institutions in both countries to develop and manage better vertical and horizontal integration in a climate change-related forest policy area. The article emphasizes the importance of previous rounds of policy-making or “policy legacies”, which serve to constrain contemporary policy options. It argues that due to the presence of many such legacies, forest policy development will continue to feature incremental adjustments through policy layering and policy drift, processes which limit the prospects for greater integration and better climate change adaptation in this sector. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Assisted tree migration; climate change; policy integration; policy legacies","Decision making; Forestry; Integration; Public policy; Adaptation policies; Climate change adaptation; Policy integration; Policy making; Policy options; Sectoral policies; Tree migration; Vertical and horizontal integrations; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994085519

Based on a case study in Beijing, the model includes three subsystems: (1) urban traffic, (2) population and economy, and (3) energy consumption and carbon emissions. First, the model is used to decompose the impact of different vehicles on energy consumption and carbon emissions. Decomposition results show that private cars have the most significant impact on urban traffic’s energy consumption and carbon emissions; however, total vehicle kilometers traveled by private cars are the smallest among four trip modes. Then, the model is used to simulate different urban traffic policies. Policies are categorized as follows: (a) driving restrictions on vehicle registration numbers, (b) a scheme for vehicle registrations via a lottery system, and (c) development of public transportation infrastructures. Scenario simulation results show that all those measures can reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. Though the last strategy (c) contains several delays, its effect is more stable and far-reaching. Finally, some recommendations about easing traffic pressure and reducing traffic emissions are given. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Carbon emissions; Energy consumption; Policy simulation; System dynamics; Urban traffic","Carbon; Energy utilization; System theory; Vehicles; Carbon emissions; Policy simulation; Public transportation; Reduce energy consumption; System Dynamics; System dynamics model; Urban traffic; Vehicle registration; Energy policy; carbon emission; computer simulation; decomposition analysis; emission control; energy use; infrastructural development; numerical model; policy analysis; traffic management; transportation infrastructure; transportation policy; urban policy; urban transport; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994791947

Taxis are one of the key objects needed energy consumption monitoring in passenger transport system. However, the traditional data collection methods for vehicle fuel consumption and emissions had high cost and inconvenient maintenance. This study aims at proposing an approach to estimate taxi fuel consumption and emissions based on the global position system (GPS) trajectory data. The bench test experiment was first conducted with three different driving cycles: cruising, acceleration and deceleration, and the composite driving cycle including these two. Then, models to calculate fuel consumption and emission based on the driving trajectory reconstruction were proposed. Therefore, the taxis' fuel consumption and emissions could be got through GPS trajectory data corresponding to these three driving cycles. The model accuracy were verified that fuel consumption (92%) and CO2 emission (95%) fit the measurements much better than CO, NOx, and HC emission models (60%-70%). Furthermore, taking fuel consumption per 100 km as dependent variable, the relative errors between the model's outputs and field measurements were 1.9% in urban areas and 11.2% in comprehensive operating conditions (i.e. both urban and suburb areas). © The Author(s) 2017.","driving cycle; Global positioning system trajectory data; operating conditions; taxi; vehicle fuel consumption and emission",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026484441

The simulation couples self-consistently the drift-reduced two-fluid Braginskii equations to a kinetic equation for neutral atoms. A diagnostic neutral gas puff on the low-field side midplane is included and the impact of neutral density fluctuations on Dα light emission investigated. We find that neutral density fluctuations affect the Dα emission. In particular, at a radial distance from the gas puff smaller than the neutral mean free path, neutral density fluctuations are anti-correlated with plasma density, electron temperature, and Dα fluctuations. It follows that the neutral fluctuations reduce the Dα emission in most of the observed region and, therefore, have to be taken into account when interpreting the amplitude of the Dα emission. On the other hand, higher order statistical moments (skewness, kurtosis) and turbulence characteristics (such as correlation length, or the autocorrelation time) are not significantly affected by the neutral fluctuations. At distances from the gas puff larger than the neutral mean free path, a non-local shadowing effect influences the neutral density fluctuations. There, the Dα fluctuations are correlated with the neutral density fluctuations, and the high-order statistical moments and measurements of other turbulence properties are strongly affected by the neutral density fluctuations.","drift-reduced Braginskii; gas-puff imaging, neutral fluctuations; kinetic neutral atoms; plasma physics; tokamak periphery; turbulence","Density (specific gravity); Electron temperature; Gases; Higher order statistics; Integral equations; Magnetoplasma; Plasma density; Sols; Statistical methods; Tokamak devices; Turbulence; drift-reduced Braginskii; Gas puff; Neutral atoms; Plasma physics; tokamak periphery; Density of gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028452259

S2S prediction fills the gap between short-range weather prediction and long-range seasonal outlooks. Decisions in a range of sectors are made in this extended-range lead time; therefore, there is a strong demand for this new generation of forecasts. International efforts are under way to identify key sources of predictability, improve forecast skill and operationalize aspects of S2S forecasts; however, challenges remain in advancing this new frontier. If S2S predictions are to be used effectively, it is important that, along with science advances, an effort is made to develop, communicate and apply these forecasts appropriately. In this study, the emerging operational S2S forecasts are presented to the wider weather and climate applications community by undertaking the first comprehensive review of sectoral applications of S2S predictions, including public health, disaster preparedness, water management, energy and agriculture. The value of applications-relevant S2S predictions is explored, and the opportunities and challenges facing their uptake are highlighted. It is shown how social sciences can be integrated with S2S development, from communication to decision-making and valuation of forecasts, to enhance the benefits of ‘climate services’ approaches for extended-range forecasting. While S2S forecasting is at a relatively early stage of development, it is concluded that it presents a significant new window of opportunity that can be explored for application-ready capabilities that could allow many sectors the opportunity to systematically plan on a new time horizon. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society","climate prediction; decision-support; ensemble forecasts; extended-range; extremes; forecasting; seasonal prediction","Agricultural robots; Climatology; Decision making; Decision support systems; Disaster prevention; Forecasting; Water management; Climate prediction; Decision supports; Ensemble forecasts; Extended range; extremes; Seasonal prediction; Weather forecasting; climate prediction; decision support system; ensemble forecasting; extreme event; forecasting method; long range forecast; seasonal variation; seasonality; timescale",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017365355

In the case of carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles, the stability can be improved by changing the carbon structure and tuning the metal-support interaction. The large structural and chemical variability of carbon offers a potential for improved electrochemical properties. However, a rational design of the metal-carbon interface requires knowledge about the relation between the carbon structure and the resulting platinum-carbon interaction. Using a variety of complementary analytical methods such as atomic scale imaging and local as well as integral spectroscopic tools in combination with different electrochemical aging protocols, we elaborate a relation between the structure-determined surface properties of the carbon and the resulting platinum-carbon interface. Atomic-scale imaging of the interface combined with electron spectroscopic methods enables distinction between different interaction types and associated bonding state and charge transfer properties. For the investigations, three differently structured industrial carbon support structures have been selected. The reported findings define solid criteria for a rational design of improved carbon supports.

The process of identifying promoters is in most cases empirical and relies on testing a broad range of catalysts prepared with the random deposition of active and promoter phases, typically with no fine control over their localization. This issue is particularly relevant in supported bimetallic systems, where two metals are codeposited onto high-surface area materials. We here report the use of colloidal bimetallic nanocrystals to produce catalysts where the active and promoter phases are colocalized to a fine extent. This strategy enables a systematic approach to study the promotional effects of several transition metals on palladium catalysts for methane oxidation. In order to achieve these goals, we demonstrate a single synthetic protocol to obtain uniform palladium-based bimetallic nanocrystals (PdM, M = V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Sn, and potentially extendable to other metal combinations) with a wide variety of compositions and sizes based on high-temperature thermal decomposition of readily available precursors. Once the nanocrystals are supported onto oxide materials, thermal treatments in air cause segregation of the base metal oxide phase in close proximity to the Pd phase. We demonstrate that some metals (Fe, Co, and Sn) inhibit the sintering of the active Pd metal phase, while others (Ni and Zn) increase its intrinsic activity compared to a monometallic Pd catalyst. This procedure can be generalized to systematically investigate the promotional effects of metal and metal oxide phases for a variety of active metal-promoter combinations and catalytic reactions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalysis; Catalysts; Decomposition; Manganese; Metallic compounds; Metals; Methane; Nanocrystals; Nickel; Sintering; Tin; Transition metals; Zinc; Bimetallic systems; Catalytic reactions; Intrinsic activities; Metal combination; Palladium catalyst; Promotional effect; Synthetic protocols; Systematic identification; Palladium; cobalt; ferrous ion; manganese; metal oxide; methane; nanocrystal; nickel; palladium; palladium nanoparticle; tin; transition element; vanadium; zinc ion; Article; catalysis; catalyst; combustion; controlled study; decomposition; intrinsic activity; oxidation; particle size; surface area; synthesis; X ray crystallography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028670074

Spatial variation in underlying drivers of SOC, such as plant productivity and soil mineralogy, complicates these predictions. Recent advances in the availability of remotely sensed data make it practical to generate multidecadal time series of vegetation indices with high spatial resolution and coverage. However, the utility of such data largely is unknown, only having been tested with shorter (e.g., 1-2 yr) data summaries. Across a 2,000 ha subtropical grassland, we found that a long time series (28 yr) of a vegetation index (Enhanced Vegetation Index; EVI) derived from the Landsat 5 satellite significantly enhanced prediction of spatially varying SOC pools, while a short summary (2 yr) was an ineffective predictor. EVI was the best predictor for surface SOC (0-5 cm depth) and total measured SOC stocks (0-15 cm). The optimum models for SOC in the upper soil layer combined EVI records with elevation and calcium concentration, while deeper SOC was more strongly associated with calcium availability. We demonstrate how data from the open access Landsat archive can predict SOC stocks, a key ecosystem metric, and illustrate the rich variety of analytical approaches that can be applied to long time series of remotely sensed greenness. Overall, our results showed that SOC pools were closely coupled to EVI in this ecosystem, demonstrating that maintenance of higher average green leaf area is correlated with higher SOC. The strong associations of vegetation greenness and calcium concentration with SOC suggest that the ability to sequester additional SOC likely will rely on strategic management of pasture vegetation and soil fertility. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","enhanced vegetation index; Google Earth Engine; Landsat time series; remote sensing; soil carbon sequestration; soil organic carbon; subtropical grasslands","carbon sequestration; climate change; grassland; Landsat; remote sensing; software; soil carbon; soil fertility; soil organic matter; spatial resolution; subtropical region; time series; vegetation index; carbon; carbon sequestration; chemistry; Florida; grassland; procedures; remote sensing; soil; time factor; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Florida; Grassland; Remote Sensing Technology; Soil; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021779062

In order to find solutions for a cleaner combustion process, it is necessary to identify the critical components and parameters responsible for the formation of emissions. This work provides an evaluation process for particle formation during combustion of a modern direct injection engine, which can help to create new aftertreatment techniques, such as a gasoline particle filter (GPF) system, that are fit for purpose. With the advent of “real driving emission” (RDE) regulations, which include market fuels for the particulate number testing procedure, the chemical composition and overall quality of the fuel cannot be neglected in order to yield a comparable emission test within the EU and worldwide. Even within the legislative boundaries such as the DIN EN 228 in Europe, critical gasoline parameters can vary greatly and influence the measured particle number. This work provides a straightforward approach to evaluate any gasoline worldwide considering particle emission tendencies via comprehensible chemical analyses and transparent interpretation. The Menger/Wittmann model (MW index) presented in this work consists of fourteen fundamental physico-chemical parameters (density, vapor pressure, distillation range, volumetric fraction of aromatics, olefins, etc.), measured with standardized and reproducible techniques. These macroscopic quantities incorporate the complex interactions of the chemical single components and directly represent the matrix effects responsible for the magnitude of particle formation during the combustion cycle. An exponential dependence of the PN emissions on the index model and its chemical foundation was found, supporting the notion of cumulative matrix effects of critical parameters applied in this model. In order to validate the correlation and to understand the fundamental parameters, which are necessary to evaluate fuels worldwide, the PN emissions of several reference, market and customized fuels were measured on an engine test bed under laboratory conditions with a customer-related RDE cycle.

While growers have always struggled with year-to-year variation in climate – early rains or unusually hot summers – climate change provides a major directional shift in mean climate. Across the globe, growing regions are warming and plants are shifting in both time and space. Current and future shifts pose a major challenge to researchers and growers alike, yet they also highlight a major avenue to adapt crops to climate change – by understanding and exploiting phenological diversity. Using winegrapes (Vitis vinifera subsp. vinifera) as a case study, we review the phenological diversity present within one crop and its underlying environmental and genetic drivers. In winegrapes, harvest dates are strongly tied to temperature, but this sensitivity varies greatly, with different cultivars (or ‘varieties’) of grapes ripening much more or less for the same amount of warming. Synthesis. This phenological diversity provides a mechanism to help growers adapt winegrapes to shifting climates – by planting different varieties that will grow well under current and future climate regimes. More generally, understanding phenological diversity – including its environmental vs. genetic components – offers a major avenue to use ecological knowledge to advance adaptation for winegrapes, and many other crops, to climate change. © 2017 The Authors.

To define the bounds of reservoir storage capacity, we introduce a dedicated reservoir volume that aggregates the storage capacity of several reservoirs to handle runoff from specific watersheds. We show how the storage bounds can be related to a spectrum of the climate-driven modes of variability in water availability and to the covariation between water and wind availability. A regional case study of the entire hydropower system in Sweden indicates that the longest regulation period possible to consider spans from a few days of individual subwatersheds up to several years, with an average limit of a couple of months. Watershed damping of the runoff substantially increases the longest considered regulation period and capacity. The high covariance found between the potential energy of the surface water and wind energy significantly reduces the longest considered regulation period when hydropower is used to balance the fluctuating wind power. © 2017.

Although Eperes is a relative definition, it can be used (1) to measure the amount of reduced CO2 emissions per unit fossil energy saving, (2) to reflect the effectiveness of fossil energy saving for CO2 emission reduction in different regions, and (3) to provide decision-making criteria for selecting pathways for emission reductions in different regions. The results show that compared with energy saving, emission reduction is a more serious issue in China. This indicates that energy saving policies have been highly effective since their implementation during the 11th “Five-Year Plan”. With respect to provincial disparities, the emission reductions caused by fossil energy saving are not significant in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong. Fujian province has significant Eperes, indicating that emission reduction causing by fossil energy saving is effective. Eperes has been increasing over time in Hunan and Hubei. Hainan's Eperes has remained less than 1, indicating that its emission-reduction effect of fossil energy saving is worse than in other provinces. Moreover, the elasticity of Eastern China is greater than that of Central China and Western China. This finding sheds light on pathway selection for energy saving and emission reduction in China: it would be more appropriate to encourage fossil energy saving in Eastern China, and to promote clean energy use (e.g., water electricity and solar energy) in Central China and Western China. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Data envelopment analysis; Definition; Elasticity of the potential of emission reduction to energy saving; Measurement","Carbon dioxide; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Elasticity; Emission control; Measurements; Solar energy; China; Decision making criteria; Definition; Emission efficiencies; Emission reduction; Energy saving and emission reductions; Energy saving policies; Five-year plans; Energy conservation; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; decision making; elasticity; emission control; energy conservation; environmental economics; environmental policy; fossil fuel; measurement method; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016414844

The combination of ETS and RES policies raises an important issue: What is the effect of combining ETS and RES policies on the existing carbon market and economy? Focusing on the design of the nationwide carbon market, this paper uses a multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to analyze the economic impacts of ETS policy when combined with RES policies in China. The results show that China's annual ETS emissions cap should decrease by 0.3% to maintain stable CO2 prices and achieve the targets in China's intended nationally determined contribution (INDC). It is estimated that the CO2 price on the nationwide carbon market would decrease by 11-64% when the renewable energy subsidy rate increases from 20 to 100%, and the total trading volume would decrease by 3-25%. The results also show that the combination of an ETS and a feed-in tariff (FIT) results in greater GDP cost and welfare loss in all Chinese regions, increasing the total social cost by 0.01-0.06%. © 2017 by the authors.

From the operations perspective, we develop a model to study how increasing carbon emission costs may affect the joint production and location decisions for a manufacturer across different locations. Specifically, our model incorporates economies of scale and explicitly links product demand, production costs and carbon emission levels to location decisions. The firm's decisions in production batch size and locations are then optimised. The system state of emission are analysed under different carbon prices. Finally we check the alignment of objectives in costs and emissions for the system. The results show that for a production system with economies of scale, the production allocation is transformed to a location choice problem after optimising the costs. Raising the carbon price reduces the carbon emissions but may not be able to induce the production to be placed in an emission efficient place. We propose a hybrid policy combining carbon price and free emission allowance to fully align the cost efficiency and emission efficiency and characterise the link between the emission target and the carbon price. © 2017, Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Carbon emissions; carbon price; Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model; emission allowance and location choice","Economics; Efficiency; Location; Carbon emissions; Carbon price; Economic order quantity models; Emission efficiencies; Heterogeneous emissions; Location choice; Production allocation; Reduction of emissions; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019033968

Here we consider a broad range of individual lifestyle choices and calculate their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries, based on 148 scenarios from 39 sources. We recommend four widely applicable high-impact (i.e. low emissions) actions with the potential to contribute to systemic change and substantially reduce annual personal emissions: having one fewer child (an average for developed countries of 58.6 tonnes CO2-equivalent (tCO2e) emission reductions per year), living car-free (2.4 tCO2e saved per year), avoiding airplane travel (1.6 tCO2e saved per roundtrip transatlantic flight) and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 tCO2e saved per year). These actions have much greater potential to reduce emissions than commonly promoted strategies like comprehensive recycling (four times less effective than a plant-based diet) or changing household lightbulbs (eight times less). Though adolescents poised to establish lifelong patterns are an important target group for promoting high-impact actions, we find that ten high school science textbooks from Canada largely fail to mention these actions (they account for 4% of their recommended actions), instead focusing on incremental changes with much smaller potential emissions reductions. Government resources on climate change from the EU, USA, Canada, and Australia also focus recommendations on lower-impact actions. We conclude that there are opportunities to improve existing educational and communication structures to promote the most effective emission-reduction strategies and close this mitigation gap. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","climate change mitigation; climate policy; education; environmental behaviour; transformation pathways","Education; Emission control; Free flight; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Anthropogenic climate changes; Climate change mitigation; Climate policy; Communication structures; Emission reduction strategy; environmental behaviour; Individual lifestyles; Transformation pathways; Climate change; anthropogenic effect; climate change; diet; education; emission; emission control; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; environmental values; European Union; government; greenhouse gas; human activity; lifestyle; mitigation; recycling; travel behavior; Australia; Canada; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025696428

African grasses are aggressive invasive species in Neotropical savannas, where their response to abiotic stress remains unknown. We assessed the role of waterlogging and canopy closure on the presence, abundance and reproductive tillering of African and native grasses in a Neotropical savanna in southeastern Brazil. We obtained abundance and reproductive tillering data of exotic (Melinis minutiflora, Melinis repens and Urochloa decumbens) and common native grasses in 20 sites. We also determined the groundwater depth, soil surface water potential and canopy cover at these sites. The grass species generally had a low frequency and performed poorly where soil remained waterlogged throughout the year, except for two native species. Most native species were exclusive to either well-drained savannas or better drained wet grasslands. However, two species (Loudetiopsis chrysothrix and Trachypogon spicatus) occurred in both vegetation types. Two exotic species (M. minutiflora and M. repens) were less common but demonstrated reasonable performance in wet grasslands, possibly due to their root system plasticity. Furthermore, U. decumbens had a lower occurrence, density and reproductive tillering at these sites, but was successful at sites where the groundwater level was slightly deeper. Although the favourable water regime in the savannas increases their invasibility in general, resistance to invasion by African grasses may be greater at microsites with high canopy closure, where these species showed lower performance and did not affect the abundance of co-occurring native grasses. In summary, the Brazilian savanna becomes more susceptible to the spread of African grasses when disturbances decrease canopy closure or lower rainfall associated with climate change reduces the average groundwater depth and consequently releases invasive species from soil waterlogging in grasslands. © 2016 Ecological Society of Australia","canopy closure; climate changes; groundwater; invasive species; waterlogging","biological invasion; climate change; coexistence; generalist; global change; grass; invasive species; native species; Neotropical Region; root system; savanna; soil surface; waterlogging; Brazil; Loudetiopsis chrysothrix; Melinis minutiflora; Melinis repens; Poaceae; Trachypogon spicatus; Urochloa decumbens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006106077

Here, we developed a cancer-cell specific photosensitizer nano-delivery system by synthesizing protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)-conjugated pullulan (P) with reducible disulfide bonds. The amphiphilic P-s-s-PpIX conjugate self-assembled in aqueous condition to form core-shell structured nanoparticles (P-s-s-PpIX NPs) with average size of 166 nm, showing reduction-controllable stability. In in vitro, the photoactivity of P-s-s-PpIX NPs in an aqueous environment was significantly suppressed by the self-quenching effect, which kept P-s-s-PpIX NPs in a photo-inactive and quenched state. But in the presence of GSH, P-s-s-PpIX NPs quickly dissociated by reductive breakage of disulfide linkers, followed by the significant recovery of fluorescent emission and singlet oxygen generation. In MCF-7 cells, compared to non-reducible P-PpIX NPs with stable amide linkages, P-s-s-PpIX NPs displayed higher cytotoxicity and induced higher apoptosis rate of tumor cells with light irradiation treatment. As a result, the P-s-s-PpIX NPs may serve as an effective smart nanomedicine platform for specific light-up and reduction-triggered cancer imaging and photodynamic therapy with the prominently reduced damage to normal tissues and cells. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Nanoparticle; Photodynamic therapy; Photosensitizer; Pullulan; Self-quenching; Singlet oxygen","Cell death; Covalent bonds; Diseases; Fluorescence imaging; Gas generators; Medical imaging; Medical nanotechnology; Nanoparticles; Photosensitizers; Quenching; Sulfur compounds; Aqueous environment; Fluorescent emission; Nano-delivery systems; Pullulans; Self-quenching; Self-quenching effect; Singlet oxygen; Singlet oxygen generation; Photodynamic therapy; disulfide; glutathione; nanoparticle; oxygen; photosensitizing agent; protoporphyrin; pullulan; singlet oxygen; drug carrier; glucan; glutathione; nanoparticle; photosensitizing agent; protoporphyrin; pullulan; apoptosis; Article; breast cancer; cell killing; cell viability; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; disulfide bond; fluorescence analysis; fluorescence imaging; human; human cell; in vitro study; MCF-7 cell line; mouse; nanomedicine; nonhuman; particle size; photodynamic therapy; photodynamics; photon correlation spectroscopy; phototoxicity; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; zeta potential; animal; cell survival; chemistry; diagnostic imaging; drug effect; drug release; fluorescence; male; neoplasm; oxidation reduction reaction; photochemotherapy; procedures; surface property; transport at the cellular level; Animals; Apoptosis; Biological Transport; Cell Survival; Drug Carriers; Drug Liberation; Fluorescence; Glucans; Glutathione; Humans; Male; MCF-7 Cells; Mice; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Optical Imaging; Oxidation-Reduction; Particle Size; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Protoporphyrins; Singlet Oxygen; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015409340

The APMPA employs 16 parallel capillaries with an inner diameter of 200 µm and arranged in a square configuration. Our measurements show that the stable plasma plumes can be generated by the APMPA and then spread along the dielectric surface. Both the power in the plasma source region and the one transferred onto the dielectric surface are calculated by plotting Lissajous figures. The power strongly depends on the applied voltage, frequency, and the distance between the nozzles and the dielectric surface. In addition, the temperature of N2 molecules in APMPA plasmas is calculated by using optical emission spectroscopy. The temporally resolved images of the APMPA plasmas show that the total emission intensities for the case of positive half-period is much higher than that of negative half-period. In order to describe the performance of the APMPA, the optical emission of the APMPA is compared with a single tube plasma jet with the same configuration and cross section area, and the result illustrates the APMPA can provide a higher density plasma and larger treatment area which may have a beneficial effect on various applications. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Herein, we used the naturally occurring glycine betaine as an efficient and renewable catalyst for the formation of a C-N bond between CO2 and amines using PhSiH3 as the reductant. The effects of different factors on the reaction were studied. It was demonstrated that the catalyst was very active for the reactions, and a broad range of amine substrates could be converted with satisfactory yields. Moreover, the selectivity to different N-substituted compounds could be controlled by the molar ratio of reactants (i.e., CO2, amines, and PhSiH3) and the reaction temperature. In the catalytic cycle, the carbon oxidation state of CO2 could be reduced to +2, 0, and -2, respectively, and thus, the corresponding formamides, aminals, and methylamines were produced via successive two-electron reduction steps. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","Amines; C-N bond formation; Glycine betaine; Reduction; Transformation of carbon dioxide","Amines; Amino acids; Betaines; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Reduction; Substitution reactions; C-n bond formations; Efficient catalysts; Glycine betaine; Naturally occurring; Reaction temperature; Substituted compounds; Two-electron reduction; Value-added chemicals; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027021306

The effect of soil salinity on wheat straw transformation and the roles of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were evaluated in a greenhouse experiment. By sodium chloride (NaCl) addition, straw was applied at the rate of 30 g kg−1 in various saline soils (2.0–4.0 g kg−1). N or combined N and P added in straw amended saline soil (3.0 g kg−1). Three replications of each treatment were sampled to determine straw residues at 30, 60, and 90 d. Results showed straw application significantly increased microbial biomass, especially fungal biomass. Soil salinity increased by 1.0 g kg−1, which decreased straw decomposed rate by 6.3 ~ 11.1%. N application significantly increased straw decomposed rate (p &lt; 0.05), and high salinity obviously inhibited the humidification process of straw. We suggested that straw carbon transformation regulation and little straw residue accumulation in saline soil should arouse more attentions in future studies. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Microbial community; nitrogen; soil organic carbon; soil salinity; wheat straw","biomass; crop residue; decomposition; experimental study; microbial community; saline soil; salinity; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; straw; transformation; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029907273

A multi-sectoral dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model was employed to investigate the impacts of the carbon tariffs on the trade structure, output structure, energy struc-ture. and carbon intensity in China. Simulations showed that the carbon tariffs will promote China's exports to other countries or regions instead of the USA. where the export ratio of low-carbon sectors will increase, whereas the export ratios will decline for some energy-intensive sectors and those that are highly dependent on exports to the USA. Carbon tariffs will have very slight inhibitory impacts on China's foreign trade scale and dependence. The output share of some sectors such as energy-intensive and upstream sectors will decrease, whereas the output share of some manufacturing sectors will increase. The proportion of coal consumption will decline dramatically, whereas the proportion of clean power consumption will mcrease, thereby improvmg China's energy consumption structure by reducing China's carbon intensity to some extent. Some policy implications that emerge from our study results are discussed. © by PSP.","Carbon intensity; Carbon tariffs; Dynamic CGE model; Economic stnicmre","carbon emission; coal; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic analysis; economic structure; energy use; environmental economics; environmental policy; export; fuel consumption; international trade; manufacturing; pollution tax; simulation; trade-environment relations; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025097682

To further improve LCZ mapping accuracy for high-density cities, we investigate the usage of both freely available Landsat and advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) satellite data to generate better LCZ mapping results. Experiments on two high-density Chinese cities, Guangzhou and Wuhan, showed that combining Landsat and ASTER data can improve the overall performance of LCZ mapping results, especially for urban areas.

The effect of in situ methanol on hydrogen production was around 165 times stronger than the effect of ex situ methanol as a sacrificial agent. A plausible mechanism was proposed to explain the higher level of hydrogen production with in situ methanol as a sacrificial agent. The S8-TiO2-Au photocatalysts were thoroughly characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and N2 sorption studies. Photocatalytic products were analyzed using a gas analyzer (gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector). In situ, in operando FT-IR spectroscopy established the formation of formaldehyde and methanol as intermediate products. Density functional theory calculations showed the creation of additional density of states in the band gap of the photocatalyst, as well as a shift in the conduction band to the energy potential for hydrogen formation. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","CO2 reduction; Hydrogen generation; Photocatalysis; Titania; Water splitting; α-Sulfur","Carbon dioxide; Density functional theory; Electron microscopy; Energy gap; Field emission microscopes; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Global warming; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogen production; Ionization of gases; Light; Light emitting diodes; Light sources; Methanol; Photocatalysis; Photocatalysts; Scanning electron microscopy; Sulfur; Thermal conductivity of gases; Titanium dioxide; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; CO2 reduction; Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy; Hydrogen generations; Titania; Visible light active photocatalysts; Water splitting; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026998293

The effects of interfacial force due to free surface tension gradient, the RF coil-induced electromagnetic body force, buoyancy, melt free surface deformation, and seed rotation were examined. The simulation results showed that the contributions of free surface tension gradient and the electromagnetic body force to the melt flow are significant. Marangoni convection affects the growth process adversely by making the melt flow downward in the region under the seed crystal. This downward flow reduces carbon flux into the seed and consequently lowers growth rate. The effects of free surface deformation and seed rotation, although positive, are not so significant compared with those of free surface tension gradient and the electromagnetic body force. Due to the small size of the melt the contribution of buoyancy is also small. © 2017","A1. Computer simulation; A1. Fluid flows; A1. Heat transfer; A1. Magnetic fields; A1. Mass transfer; A2.

Identifying the unevenness of regional development may be crucial for increasing the carbon emission efficiency of power plants. This work evaluates the carbon emission efficiency using the Undesirable-SBM (slacks-based measure) model and data from China's power industry in 30 provinces from 2003 to 2014. Moreover, the global Malmquist index, which consists of efficiency changes (ECs) and technical changes (TCs), is used to determine the driving factors of these changes. Finally, a spatial autocorrelation analysis that is based on Moran's index is performed to confirm the non-equilibrium spatial distribution of the carbon emission efficiency for the power industry. The main findings are as follows: (1) compared to economically underdeveloped provinces, the wealthy eastern coastal provinces exhibit higher carbon emission efficiency; (2) the positive effects of TCs on the efficiency changes are stronger, moreover, the provinces with lower efficiency are more likely to achieve greater improvements; and (3) significant spatial correlations exist among the power sectors of the 30 provinces in terms of carbon emission efficiency; the eastern regions have relatively high efficiency and tend to have a positive spillover effect on the neighboring provinces. Therefore, technological cooperation between various regions is beneficial to ameliorate carbon emission efficiency. Finally, policy implications are provided to address such spatial discrepancies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission efficiency; China's power industry; Spatial autocorrelation analysis; Undesirable-SBM model","Autocorrelation; Efficiency; Emission control; Public policy; Regional planning; Carbon emission efficiencies; Carbon emission reductions; Positive spillovers; Power industry; Regional development; SBM models; Spatial autocorrelation analysis; Spatial correlations; Spatial variables measurement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019126890

Here, we introduce a carbon flux inversion system for estimating carbon flux with satellite measurements under the support of “The Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences—Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Relevant Issues”. The carbon flux inversion system is composed of two separate parts: the Institute of Atmospheric Physics Carbon Dioxide Retrieval Algorithm for Satellite Remote Sensing (IAPCAS), and CarbonTracker-China (CT-China), developed at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) measurements are used in the carbon flux inversion experiment. To improve the quality of the IAPCAS-GOSAT retrieval, we have developed a post-screening and bias correction method, resulting in 25%–30% of the data remaining after quality control. Based on these data, the seasonal variation of XCO2 (column-averaged CO2 dry-air mole fraction) is studied, and a strong relation with vegetation cover and population is identified. Then, the IAPCAS-GOSAT XCO2 product is used in carbon flux estimation by CT-China. The net ecosystem CO2 exchange is −0.34 Pg C yr−1 (±0.08 Pg C yr−1), with a large error reduction of 84%, which is a significant improvement on the error reduction when compared with in situ-only inversion. © 2017, Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","carbon flux; CO2; GOSAT; retrieval algorithm; satellite remote sensing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021414067

Hence, China has launched a pilot low-carbon city program to explore low-carbon pathways since 2010. This study employed a Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System model (LEAP) to simulate six energy sectors-related GHG emissions in a pilot low-carbon Ningbo city, China. The LEAP-Ningbo model comprises three basic modules, i.e. energy supply, energy transformation and end-use energy demand in six urban sectors (i.e., household, service, agriculture, transport, industry, and transformation sectors), and resulting environmental impacts (CO2 equivalents). The results identified by the business as usual (BAU) scenario indicate that total energy consumption is expected to reach 449.72 Mtce and results in emissions of 651.83 Mt CO2e by 2050. In contrast, more aggressive policies and strategies involved in the integrated scenario (INT), which combines the energy structure optimization (ESO) scenario with the policy-oriented energy saving (PES) scenario, can lower energy demand by 14% and CO2e emissions by 27%. A comparison among global cities and low-carbon plans helps identify the carbon emission level and define the actionable low-carbon policies. The high correlation between sectoral energy use and resulting GHG emissions implies energy-carbon reduction efforts, e.g., low-carbon energy substitution, intensive energy-saving policies, the improvement of energy efficiency, and industrial transformation. Achieving low-carbon city targets requires timeline-restricted actions and backgrounds-based measures in plans. The results of this study shed light on if and how cities can shape energy-carbon reduction trajectories and develop low-carbon pathways in China and beyond. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Energy saving; GHG emissions; LEAP; Low-carbon city; Scenarios","Carbon dioxide; Energy conservation; Energy management; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Structural optimization; Urban transportation; Energy saving policies; Energy transformation; GHG emission; Industrial transformations; LEAP; Low-carbon cities; Scenarios; Total energy consumption; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019157372

To ease the situation, greater use of wind energy in China could be the solution for energy conservation and sustainable environment in the long run. This paper describes the presentation of wind power in China, which covers distribution, bases, installed capacity, power generation from the spatial perspective and the environmental benefit. In addition, grey model (GM(1,1) ) and scenario analysis are employed to forecast the installed capacity in China from 2017 to 2025, then the evaluation of two methods is presented. By this research, the results are shown as the following: (1) the North region has great wind energy with 2500-3000 giga watt (GW) and the offshore wind energy in the Southeast is abundant; (2) the Inner Mongolia base located in North China makes a great contribution to wind power as well as having great potential for wind power development with the potential of 1300 GW; (3) the growth rate of installed capacity and wind power generation in China is declining with 100% in 2006 to 30% in 2015, 107% in 2009 to 17% in 2015, respectively; (4) the ""three North"" region has made a great contribution to current installed capacity and wind power generation with 74% and 71%, respectively; (5) wind power has significant environmental benefits with coal reduction of 23,887 × 104 tce, CO2 reduction of 66,854 × 104 tons and SO2 reduction of 173 × 104 tons in total from 2008 to 2015; (6) the installed capacity in China from 2017 to 2025 is predicted utilizing a GM(1,1) model with 38,311.1810 × 103 GW in 2025, while, with a scenario analysis, the installed capacity will reach up to 40,000 × 103 GW in 2025 under the high GDP growth rate and 29,000 × 103 GW in 2025 under the low GDP growth rate, respectively. Finally, it can be concluded that China has a solid foundation for the wind power development due to its abundant wind resources and great potential for wind power. Furthermore, the sustainable development can be guaranteed, and reduction in energy usage as well as emissions can be achieved by promoting wind power widely and effectively. © 2017 by the authors.","China; GM(1,1); Sustainable development; Wind energy distribution; Wind power generation","economic development; energy conservation; environmental economics; future prospect; Gross Domestic Product; growth rate; power generation; resource development; sustainable development; wind power; China; China; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027723665

Planetary habitability is determined not only by a planet's current stellar insolation and atmospheric properties, but also by the evolutionary history of its climate. It has been suggested that icy planets and moons become habitable after their initial ice shield melts as their host stars brighten. Here we show from global climate model simulations that a habitable state is not achieved in the climatic evolution of those icy planets and moons that possess an inactive carbonate-silicate cycle and low concentrations of greenhouse gases. Examples for such planetary bodies are the icy moons Europa and Enceladus, and certain icy exoplanets orbiting G and F stars. We find that the stellar fluxes that are required to overcome a planet's initial snowball state are so large that they lead to significant water loss and preclude a habitable planet. Specifically, they exceed the moist greenhouse limit, at which water vapour accumulates at high altitudes where it can readily escape, or the runaway greenhouse limit, at which the strength of the greenhouse increases until the oceans boil away.We suggest that some icy planetary bodies may transition directly to a moist or runaway greenhouse without passing through a habitable Earth-like state. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Early studies, focused on polycrystalline metal electrodes, outlined in detail the overall trends in the catalytic activity and product selectivity of pure metals; however, several inherent limitations were found, such as low current density and high overpotential, which hindered electrocatalytic CO2 reduction from practical application. Fortunately, the recent development of precisely synthesized nanocatalysts has led to several breakthroughs in catalytic CO2 conversion. By carefully controlling the thermodynamic adsorption energies and flow dynamics of reaction intermediates, nanosized electrocatalysts afford more versatile and energetically efficient routes to convert CO2 into desired chemicals.

It is closely related with and mostly generated from the transportation and industrialization sectors, as well as from the environmentally degrading effect of the urban physical development. Air pollution promotes the lower level of air quality, which in turn promotes the greater risk on health, especially that of the human being. This research aims to aid the government in the policy making process related to air pollution mitigation by developing a standard index model for air polluter (Air Polluter Standard Index—APSI) based on the Geographically Weighted Multivariate Regression (GWMR) approach. This GWMR-based APSI model is aimed as the indicator of the prevailing air pollution. Two of the five polluting elements in the APSI are Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2). The GWMR approach used in modeling the APSI in this research is a spatial multivariate regression model, which is expected to be able to show the effect of the air polluters to the level of air pollution with regard to the geographical aspects of the prevailing event. In this case, the result concluded that there are no significance differences between Multivariate Regression and GWMR in this case. But GWMR is the best model to modeling NO2 and SO2 because it has smallest AIC and MSE. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Air polluter; APSI; GWMR; Multivariate regressions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030232652

We analyze and compare the modeling frameworks, underlying data, assumptions, intermediate parameters, and projections to identify the sources of divergence or consistency, as well as key knowledge gaps. We find that there are significant differences in the base-year data and key parameters for future projections, especially for developing countries. These include passenger and freight activity, mode shares, vehicle ownership rates, and energy consumption by mode, particularly for shipping, aviation and trucking. This may be due in part to a lack of previous efforts to do such consistency-checking and “bench-marking.” We find that the four models differ in terms of the relative roles of various mitigation strategies to achieve a 2 °C/450 ppm target: the economics-based integrated assessment models favor the use of low carbon fuels as the primary mitigation option followed by efficiency improvements, whereas transport-only and expert-based models favor efficiency improvements of vehicles followed by mode shifts. We offer recommendations for future modeling improvements focusing on (1) reducing data gaps; (2) translating the findings from this study into relevant policy implications such as gaps of current policy goals, additional policy targets needed, regional vs. global reductions; (3) modeling strata of demographic groups to improve understanding of vehicle ownership levels, travel behavior, and urban vs. rural considerations; and (4) conducting coordinated efforts in aligning historical data, and comparing input assumptions and results of policy analysis and modeling insights. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Climate mitigation; Energy use; GHG emissions; Model comparison; Transportation behaviors; Transportation demand; Transportation scenarios","Developing countries; Efficiency; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Trucks; Climate mitigations; Energy use; GHG emission; Model comparison; Transportation demand; Transportation scenario; Climate models; assessment method; developing world; emission control; energy use; greenhouse gas; modeling; parameterization; transportation policy; travel behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006835763

Rice cultivation is associated with emissions of potent GHGs such as methane and nitrous oxide. Thai rice has been massively exported worldwide however the markets are becoming more competitive than ever since the green market has been hugely promoted. In order to maintain the same level or enhance of competitiveness, Thai rice needs to be considered for environmentally conscious products to meet the international environmental standards. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle of rice production in order to identify the major emission sources and possible reduction strategies. In this research, the rice variety considered is Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML 105) cultivated by organic practices. The data sources were Don-Chiang Organic Agricultural Cooperative (DCOAC), Mae-teang district, Chiang Mai province, Thailand and the Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE) of Thailand with onsite records and interviews of farmers in 2013. The GHG emissions were calculated from cradle-to-farm by using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach and the 2006 IPCC Guideline for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The functional unit is defined as 1 kg of paddy rice at farm gate. Results showed that the total GHG emissions of organic rice production were 0.58 kg CO2-eq per kg of paddy rice. The major source of GHG emission was from the field emissions accounting for 0.48 kg CO2-eq per kg of paddy rice, about 83% of total, followed by land preparation, harvesting and other stages (planting, cultivation and transport of raw materials) were 9, 5 and 3% of total, respectively. The comparative results clearly showed that the GHG emissions of organic paddy rice were considerably lower than conventional rice production due to the advantages of using organic fertilisers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Organic rice production; Thailand","nitrogen; methane; agricultural emission; competitiveness; crop production; cultivar; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; life cycle analysis; methane; nitrous oxide; organic farming; rice; Article; carbon footprint; field emission; greenhouse gas; life cycle; life cycle assessment; rice; Thailand; agriculture; climate change; greenhouse effect; Mali; Oryza; Chiang Mai [Chiang Mai (PRV)]; Chiang Mai [Northern Region]; Northern Region [Thailand]; Thailand; Agriculture; Climate Change; Greenhouse Effect; Mali; Methane; Oryza; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014806333

Energy efficiency is a tool that can be leveraged by not only industry or national governments but also cities, regions, and local governments for mitigation purposes. However, studies on energy efficiency as a mitigation tool thus far have focused on the national or transnational scale, and on certain sectors of industry. The purpose of this paper is to find the most cost-efficient energy efficiency measures (EEMs) at the city, region, and local government level. To that end, this paper examines the yearly energy savings and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction intensity, as well as energy savings and GHG reduction efficiency, in the case of EEMs conducted by South Korean local governments. Yearly energy savings intensity and GHG reduction intensity are estimated to be in the range of 0.094∼0.375 tonne of oil equivalent (TOE)/M-KRW (million Korean won) and 0.287∼1.180 tCO2e/M-KRW. Results show that inverter installation at water and sewage treatment plants and improvement of pump efficiency are the most cost-efficient EEMs. Moreover, energy savings efficiency and GHG reduction efficiency are within the range of 18.29∼45.31 %, at an average of 30.5 % GHG reduction potential. If this reduction potential is applied to the buildings and facilities regulated and run by cities/local governments, there is a worldwide reduction potential of 1.023 billion tCO2 compared to 2020 business as usual levels. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","City; Energy efficiency measures (EEMs); Energy savings efficiency; Energy savings intensity; GHG reduction efficiency; GHG reduction intensity; Local government; Region","cost-benefit analysis; emission control; empirical analysis; energy conservation; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; international agreement; local government; region; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; urban area; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960446370

With a burgeoning body of work indicating the importance of livestock's contribution to climate change (via Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions), the dairy sector will increasingly be targeted for emission reduction. Yet, gaps in knowledge remain as to the effectiveness of interventions in achieving emission reductions. The investigation examines two high-profile Indian policies to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing the methane emission intensity of milk production in Odisha, India. Selected policies included the installation of smallscale anaerobic digesters and the control of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD). The interventions were evaluated at the cow level informed by data collected from 115 smallholder dairy producers in Puri (n = 31) and Khurda (n = 84) districts in Odisha, India. The installation of an anaerobic digester was found to increase methane emission intensity by 4.41–5.01%. Control of FMD reduced methane emission intensity by 3.68–12.95% depending on the infection scenario considered. The findings highlight the importance of contextually relevant and multi-sectoral approaches to mitigation as the increase in methane emission intensity following anaerobic digester installation represents movement of emissions from the energy sector into the dairy sector where mitigation is inherently more complex. Thus, the long-term usefulness of anaerobic digester installation as a mitigation strategy is limited. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic digester; Climate change; Foot and Mouth Disease; India; Odisha","anaerobic digestion; climate change; dairy farming; emission control; emission inventory; foot and mouth disease; methane; milk production; policy making; smallholder; India; Khurda; Odisha; Puri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020014730

Conducted with a semi-structured interview schedule, this qualitative study presents the findings of research conducted at Tent City, Victoria in 2016. Using snowball sampling, 12 residents of Tent City participated in research that revealed four themes for analysis: (1) push and pull motivations to join the encampment; (2) the role of services in resident’s lives; (3) residents’ experiences with the outside community; and (4) Tent City as a home community. Push factors included substance abuse, mental health problems, unemployment, family problems while pull factors included lack of affordable and appropriate housing, loss of housing, and personal issues. Residents’ experiences with services were generally negative with social/health services being considered inadequate, housing options overly restrictive and controlling. The outside community was considered hostile and uninformed as the workings of Tent City and the benefits it provided. Importantly, Tent City provided both a psychological and functional sense of community for residents. While the directions for future research are many, further examination of the broader sociopolitical context in which tent cities emerge could be examined. As well, the themes identified here could be explored further in terms of how existing services could be restructured to better respond to the needs of homeless persons. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","community; homelessness; qualitative research; Tent City",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019199027

Plant invasion success or failure is based on a combination of evolutionary and ecological processes. Abiotic (e.g., climate) and biotic (e.g., plant competition) conditions in the environment and plant genetics (e.g., fitness) combine in either decreasing or increasing invasion, yet it has proven challenging to know exactly which of these conditions leads to success for a given species, even when a wealth of empirical data is available. Further, current regional distribution models for invasive plant species rarely consider biotic and fitness interactions, instead focusing primarily on abiotic conditions. The crucial role of all three factors (climate dynamics, invader fitness, and ecosystem resistance) must not be ignored. Here we construct a three-factor invasion framework from which we develop conceptual models using empirical studies for yellow starthistle, nonnative common reed, and musk thistle, three dissimilar but commonly occurring invasive plant species in North America. We identify how components of the invasion process-rapid population increase, established local dominance, and rapid range expansion-are influenced by ecosystem resistance, invader fitness, and/or climate dynamics, a set of broadly defined factors for each of the three invasive plant species. Our framework can be used to (1) establish research priorities, (2) address gaps in theoretical understanding, and (3) identify invasion process components that can be targeted to improve management. Building on previous models, our unifying framework, which can be used for assessing any invasive plant species having sufficient empirical data, simultaneously shows the influence of ecosystem resistance, invader fitness, and climate dynamics factors on the invasion process.

Methods: Annual health surveys of retirees were conducted at Tsinghua University during 2011-2016. We conducted linear individual fixedeffect regression analyses to estimate the impact of ambient PM2.5 concentration on physical activity-related health behaviors among survey participants, adjusting for various time-variant individual characteristics and environmental measures. Results: An increase in ambient PM2.5 concentration by one standard deviation (56.6 μg/m3) was associated with a reduction in weekly total hours of walking by 4.69 (95% confidence interval=1.30-8.08), a reduction in leisure-Time Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score by 71.16 (28.91-113.41), and a reduction in total PASE score by 110.67 (59.25-162.08). An increase in ambient PM2.5 concentration by one standard deviation was associated with an increase in daily average hours of nighttime/daytime sleeping by 1.75 (1.24-2.26). The impact of ambient PM2.5 concentration on weekly hours of walking tended to be greater among men than among women. Conclusions: Air pollution significantly discouraged Chinese older adults from engaging in daily physical activities. Policy interventions are needed to reduce air pollution in China's urban areas.

In this paper we develop a model where allowances are endogenously determined by each member of a carbon trade agreement, but with an exogenous constraint on the number of allowances per member. We use a global model to explore the incentives for regions to participate in such a carbon market and we examine its performance. To gain practical policy insights, we employ the STACO model, a numerically calibrated model with twelve world regions. Our results show that the stability and effectiveness of an international carbon market can be improved by imposing constraints on individual allowance choices compared to a carbon market without such constraints. Constraints on allowance choices reduce ‘hot air’ and increase global welfare and mitigation. When tightening the constraint ‘broad but shallow’ agreements are replaced by ‘narrow but deep’ ones. If the constraint is too tight, however, no stable carbon market exists. © 2016, The Author(s).","Allowance choice; Carbon markets; International carbon trade; International climate agreements; STACO model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957712265

It has been estimated that around 5% of the world’s trade could be shipped through the Northern Sea Route (NSR) in the Arctic alone under year-round and unhampered navigability, generating additional income for many European and East Asian countries. Our analysis shows that for Arctic sea ice conditions under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario and business restrictions facing shipping companies, NSR traffic will increase steadily from the mid-2030s onwards, although it will take over a century to reach the full capacity expected for ice-free conditions. However, in order to achieve a balanced view of Arctic shipping, it is important to include its detrimental environmental impacts, most notably emissions of short-lived pollutants such as black carbon, as well as CO2 and non-CO2 emissions associated with the additional economic growth enabled by NSR. The total climate feedback of NSR could contribute 0.05% (0.04%) to global mean temperature rise by 2100 under RCP8.5 (RCP4.5), adding $2.15 trillion ($0.44 trillion) to the NPV of total impacts of climate change over the period until 2200 for the SSP2 socio-economic scenario. The climatic losses offset 33% (24.7%) of the total economic gains from NSR under RCP8.5 (RCP4.5), with the biggest losses set to occur in Africa and India. These findings call for policy instruments aimed at reducing emissions from Arctic shipping and providing compensation to the affected regions. © 2017, The Author(s).",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Economics; Environmental impact; Ice; Sea ice; Ships; Transportation routes; Commercial shipping; East Asian countries; Emissions scenarios; Global-mean temperature; Ice-free conditions; Northern sea routes; Policy instruments; Shipping companies; Climate change; climate change; climate feedback; compensation system; economic growth; economic impact; economic instrument; emission inventory; global trade; income distribution; sea ice; shipping; trade-environment relations; traffic emission; Africa; Arctic; Europe; India; Nucleopolyhedrovirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020074407

Bogota, the capital of Colombia, is the urban center with the greatest population density and third-highest air pollution levels in Latin America. Six automatic monitoring stations were used; they were equipped with measurement instruments for PM10, temperature and solar radiation as well as wind speed and wind direction. The duration of the sampling period was 6 years. The hourly PM10 sampling system included continuous-monitoring equipment that used beta ray attenuation. We analyzed atmospheric stability and the spatial distribution of LSC (vegetated, non-vegetated, impervious and water bodies) before applying the iterative process of Box-Jenkins for ARIMA models. ARIMA analysis indicates greater persistence in PM10 pollution in the presence of increased vegetated LSC (trees and grasslands); persistence decreased in the presence of more impervious LSC (roofs, pavements and footpaths). PM10 persistence is found to be 2 days (48 h). The best distance to demonstrate these findings is between 50 and 100 m, with respect to the monitoring stations' physical location. Urban areas with a predominance of vegetated LSC register lower PM10 concentrations than urban areas with a predominance of impervious LSC (average daily difference = 42.7%).

However, only a system which is accepted and utilised by the public would be sustainable in the long run. This study aimed to explore the perception and attitude of the Malaysian public towards a dengue early warning system. The sample consisted of 847 individuals who were 18 years and above and living/working in the Petaling District, an area adjacent to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A questionnaire consisting of personal information and three sub-measures of; i) perception, ii) attitude towards dengue early warning and iii) response towards early warning; was distributed to participants. We found that most of the respondents know about dengue fever (97.1%) and its association with climate factors (90.6%). Most of them wanted to help reduce the number of dengue cases in their area (91.5%). A small percentage of the respondents admitted that they were not willing to be involved in public activities, and 64% of them admitted that they did not check dengue situations or hotspots around their area regularly. Despite the high awareness on the relationship between climate and dengue, about 45% of respondents do not know or are not sure how this can be used to predict dengue. Respondents would like to know more about how climate data can be used to predict a dengue outbreak (92.7%). Providing more information on how climate can influence dengue cases would increase public acceptability and improve response towards climatebased warning system. The most preferred way of communicating early warning was through the television (66.4%). This study shows that the public in Petaling District considers it necessary to have a dengue warning system to be necessary, but more education is required. © 2019 Public Library of Science.

The study used an ordered logit model to examine the factors that influence smallholder farmers' behavioural intention towards adaptation to climate change. Results from the study show that the gender of the household head, access to extension services on crop and livestock production, access to climate information, membership to social groups and experiencing a drought have a positive influence on farmers' attitude towards adaptation to climate change and variability. The study concluded that although the majority of smallholder farmers perceive that the climate is changing, they continue to habour negative attitudes towards prescribed climate change adaptation techniques. This study recommends more education on climate change, as well as adaptation strategies for both agricultural extension workers and farmers. This can be complemented by disseminating timely climate information through extension officers and farmers’ groups. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change and variability; Farmers' attitudes; Smallholder farmers; Zimbabwe","adaptive management; agricultural extension; agricultural management; agricultural worker; behavioral response; climate change; climate effect; drought; farmers attitude; household survey; regional climate; smallholder; transition zone; agricultural worker; behavior change; climate change; drought; education; female; gender; head; household; human; human experiment; interview; livestock; male; model; structured questionnaire; Zimbabwe; agricultural worker; agriculture; behavior; Zimbabwe; Hwedza; Mashonaland East; Zimbabwe; Agriculture; Climate Change; Farmers; Humans; Intention; Zimbabwe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018290281

However, several regional climate impacts depend on the atmospheric circulation, whose response to climate change remains substantially uncertain and not interpretable in a probabilistic sense in multimodel ensemble projections. To account for these uncertainties, a novel approach where regional climate change is analyzed as a function of carbon emissions conditional on plausible storylines of atmospheric circulation change is here presented and applied to the CMIP5 models' future projections. The different storylines are determined based on the response in three remote drivers of regional circulation: the tropical and polar amplification of global warming and changes in stratospheric vortex strength. As an illustration of this approach, it is shown that the severity of the projected wintertime Mediterranean precipitation decline and central European windiness increase strongly depends on the storyline of circulation change. For a given magnitude of global warming, the highest impact storyline for these aspects of European climate is found for a high tropical amplification and a strengthening of the vortex. The difference in the precipitation and wind responses between the storylines is substantial and equivalent to the contribution from several degrees of global warming. Improving the understanding of the remote driver responses is thus needed to better bound the projected regional impacts in the European sector. The value of these storylines to represent the uncertainty in regional climate projections and to inform the selection of CMIP5 models in regional climate impact studies is discussed. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Atmospheric circulation; Climate change; Climate models; Europe; Extratropics; Regression analysis","Carbon; Climate models; Climatology; Electric power system interconnection; Global warming; Meteorology; Regression analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Vortex flow; Atmospheric circulation; Atmospheric circulation changes; Europe; Extratropics; Mediterranean precipitation; Polar amplifications; Regional climate changes; Regional climate projections; Climate change; atmospheric circulation; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; environmental impact assessment; global warming; regional climate; regression analysis; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025625875

The aim of this study is to propose an approach to estimate the cooling capacity provided by GUI in order to generate useful information for urban planners. The methods are based on the review of the literature to identify the functions of GUI that are involved in providing cooling, and the components of GUI that determine those functions, and then to combine them to provide an overall assessment of the cooling capacity. The approach was used to assess 50 different typologies of GUI, which are result of different combinations of the components that influence the cooling, for three climatic regions.

The growth of the population and of the number of cars in urban areas requires traffic management in order to reduce fuel loss, exhaust emissions, to eliminate time consuming bottlenecks, in other words, to increase the quality of life. The detection of vehicles on the road has been a concern for many researches. Methods of detection were developed based on different types of sensors or devices. Herein is presented an attempt to use a relatively new method of detection based on the measurement of the disturbance of Earth's magnetic field by metallic vehicles. The goal of the work was to design, produce and test the prototype of a vehicle detection module based on a magnetic sensor with very low power consumption and an increased range length of data transmission over wireless radiofrequency link. In order to meet the goals, the prototype was built on the basis of a very low power microcontroller and on the new long range low power technology, LoRa. The tests have been focused on finding the proper algorithm in order to obtain the best accuracy of vehicle detection and lowest power consumption. © 2017 IEEE.","magnetic sensor; smart city; traffic management; vehicle detection","Electric power utilization; Electronics packaging; Magnetic sensors; Magnetism; Population statistics; Smart city; Traffic control; Urban growth; Earth's magnetic field; Low power technologies; Low-power consumption; Low-power microcontrollers; Traffic management; Traffic monitoring; Vehicle detection; Wireless radio-frequency; Vehicle transmissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046953656

Under a warming climate, plants may be less cold hardened and hence more susceptible to the effects of a sudden temperature drop. During the growth season of 2010–2011, growth and cold hardening of European aspen (Populus tremula L.) seedlings from native wild populations were examined under ambient and projected climate scenarios in greenhouses at the Haapastensyrjä research station in Southern Finland. Using locally obtained seedlings, we manipulated temperature and soil moisture during the normal growth period and then subjected them to an artificial freezing treatment during September–November 2010. At the end of the experiment, we determined seedling height, survival and the extent of stem damage, and analysed their variation with mixed effect models. Among the treatments tested, temperature was the main factor affecting survival, cold hardening, and frost damage to seedlings. The higher temperature (4 °C increase) of the 2100 future climate regime was associated with a 35% decrease in seedling survival (from 66 to 31%) during the growing period. Increased irrigation had a positive, but considerably weaker effect on seedling survival (improved survival by ca. 8%). Height of seedlings after the first growth season was enhanced by increased soil moisture and temperature, but these effects were negated the following spring by increased frost damage caused by warmer growth conditions. Although cold hardiness increased as the season progressed, increase of temperature by 1 and 4 °C severely diminished it, and survival after the freezing dropped from 55% (control) to 48% and 14%, while stem damage increased from 58% (control) to 90% and 96%, respectively. These results suggest that regeneration of north European aspen might become burdened in a warmer climate. Although survival was clearly affected, several seedlings grown under the future climate regimes survived freezing and overwintered with negligible damage, suggesting an adaptive capacity of the local population. The intraspecific competition that occurred as a side effect of the experimental setup also affected cold hardening, suggesting that stand structure might be managed to improve the resilience of aspen to frost damage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Cold hardiness; Early development; Populus tremula; Southern Finland","biological development; climate change; climate effect; cold tolerance; deciduous tree; growth rate; growth response; intraspecific competition; low temperature; native species; regeneration; seedling; soil moisture; Finland; Populus tremula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018320805

As a rate-limiting enzyme, carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) catalyzes the conversion of PGE2 to PGF2α. A high ratio of PGE2:PGF2α is beneficial to the establishment and maintenance of porcine pregnancy. PG is essential for the establishment of pregnancy which resembles the proinflammatory response and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is involved in the process. Bioinformatic analysis has shown that NF-κB is a possible factor bound to two cis-regulatory elements in CBR1 promoter. In this study, we cloned the 2997 bp (−2875/+122) of the promoter, and constructed six 5'-deleted dual-luciferase reporter recombinant vectors. In endometrial cells, the region of P2 (−1640/+7) exhibited the greatest transcriptional activity at driving luciferase expression, but not significantly different from that of P1 (−2089/+7). The activity of P1, P2, and P3 (−1019/+7) was highly significantly higher than that of others (P<0.01), suggesting that two positive regulatory elements were likely present in the regions of −1640/−1019 and −1019/−647. The results also showed that the −1640/−647 region was indispensable for the promoter. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrated that the NF-κB subunit p65 binds to one site around −1545/−1531. Using four reference genes, we found that the over-expression of p65 enhanced the expression of CBR1 (P<0.05) in porcine endometrial epithelial cells, while knockdown of the p65 did not down-regulate the CBR1 expression. These results indicated that NF-κB (p65) could bind to the special element of CBR1 gene promoter in porcine endometrial epithelial cells in vitro. The binding site of NF-κB was a positive regulator for the CBR1 gene promoter, but was not necessary for the basic expression. © 2017, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1); Endometrium; NF-κB; Pig; Promoter","luciferase; messenger RNA; small interfering RNA; transcription factor RelA; carbonyl reductase; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; transcription factor; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; binding site; carbonyl reductase 1 gene; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; down regulation; endometrium cell; epithelium cell; gene; gene expression; gene overexpression; luciferase assay; molecular cloning; nonhuman; pig; priority journal; promoter region; protein interaction; transcription initiation; animal; biology; catalysis; cytology; endometrium; female; inflammation; metabolism; pregnancy; Animals; Binding Sites; Carbonyl Reductase (NADPH); Catalysis; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Cloning, Molecular; Computational Biology; Endometrium; Epithelial Cells; Female; Inflammation; NF-kappa B; Pregnancy; Promoter Regions, Genetic; RNA, Small Interfering; Swine; Transcription Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025070789

This paper aims to analyze the unequal impacts of household consumption across different income households on the whole CO2 emissions, by utilizing a semi-closed input-output model and hypothetical extraction method. The semi-closed input-output model moves household consumption activities into the intermediate use along with dividing urban and rural households to several groups by their income levels, and the hypothetical extraction method (HEM) is used to estimate the reductions of CO2 emissions relative to total emissions after extracting the consumption of each household group. The results show that: (1) the impact on CO2 emissions generated by urban households’ consumption are 1.8 times as much as that of rural ones; (2) excluding consumption of higher-income households from the economy would cause greater CO2 emission reductions than lower ones. Specifically, urban highest-income households have the most relative reductions of CO2 emissions, which are −12.2% in 2007 and -13.8% in 2012, while for rural highest-income households are −5.1% in 2007 and -5.1% in 2012. And urban and rural highest-income households are respectively 3.8 and 1.8 times on the relative reductions of the lowest-income ones; (3) the relative reductions of household CO2 emissions from food sectors is the most, while from residence sectors is the least.

In order to analyze the characteristics of drought spatiotemporal change, the precipitation data of eight meteorological stations in the Beiluo River Basin of Shaanxi Province of China have been collected, and the drought index of Pa, SPI and FSE have been selected to analyze the drought in Shaanxi Province for the last 55 years. The results of Pa, SPI and FSE test show that the droughts happened in the Beiluo River Basin are 149, 215 and 203 times in the past 55 years, respectively. Overall, the Beiluo River has a tendency to dry out. The main type of drought is low-grade drought, followed by the mediumgrade drought, and the specially-grade drought happened least. The average rainfall decreases in the Beiluo River Basin from the southeast to the northwest, and the change of the number of drought is just opposite to that of precipitation trend, which increases from southeast to northwest.

The single-peaked structure of the Hugoniot curves contrasts with previous work on higher-Z plasmas, which exhibit a two-peak structure corresponding to both K- and L-shell ionization.

However, the origins for unusual sharp lines in photoluminescence emission at room temperature and tunable narrow-band-emission tailored by reducing Al-O in β-SiAlON:Eu are still unclear. Here, the presence of sharp-line fine structure in the emission spectra of β-SiAlON:Eu is mainly due to purely electronic transitions (zero phonon lines), and their vibronic repetitions resulting from the multimicroenvironment around Eu2+ ions that has been revealed by relative emission intensity of sharp line depends on excitation wavelength and monotonously increasing decay time. The specific features of the Eu2+ occupying interstitial sites indicate that the effect of crystal field strength can be neglected. Therefore, the enhanced rigidity and higher ordering structure of β-SiAlON:Eu with decreasing the substitution of Si-N by Al-O become the main factors in decreasing electron-lattice coupling and reducing inhomogeneous broadening, favoring the blue-shift and narrow of the emission band, the enhanced thermal stability, as well as the charge state of Eu2+. Our results provide new insights for explaining the reason for narrow-band-emission in β-SiAlON:Eu, which will deliver an impetus for the exploration of phosphors with narrow band and ordering structure. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Aluminum; Emission spectroscopy; Light emission; Light emitting diodes; Phosphors; Rigidity; Crystal field strength; Electron-lattice coupling; Electronic transition; Excitation wavelength; Green-emitting phosphors; Higher-order structure; Inhomogeneous broadening; Photoluminescence emission; Europium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027865540

Among the three root-associated layers (i.e., rhizosphere, rhizoplane, and endorhiza), the rhizoplane is a key component serving a critical gating role that controls microbial entry into plant roots. The microbial communities colonizing the three layers are believed to be gradually enriched from the bulk soil inoculum. However, it is unknown how this enrichment process, particularly the rhizosphere to rhizoplane step, is affected by biotic stresses, such as disease. In this study, we address this question using the citrus root-associated microbiome as a model.RESULTS: We identified the rhizosphere-to-rhizoplane-enriched taxonomic and functional properties of the citrus root-associated microbiome and determined how they were affected by Huanglongbing (HLB), a severe systemic disease caused by Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches. Multiple rhizoplane-enriched genera were identified, with Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia being the most dominant. Plant-derived carbon sources are an important driving force for the enrichment process. The enrichment of functional attributes, such as motility, chemotaxis, secretion systems, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis, demonstrated more active microbe-plant interactions on the rhizoplane than the rhizosphere. We observed that HLB impaired the rhizosphere-to-rhizoplane enrichment process of the citrus root-associated microbiome in three ways: (1) by decreasing the relative abundance of most rhizoplane-enriched genera; (2) by reducing the relative abundance and/or expression activity of the functional attributes involved in microbe-plant interactions; and (3) by recruiting more functional features involved in autotrophic life cycle adaptation, such as carbon fixation and nitrogen nitrification in the HLB rhizoplane microbiome. Finally, our data showed that inoculation of Burkholderia strains isolated from the healthy citrus root-associated microbiome could trigger the expression of genes involved in induced systemic resistance in inoculated plants.CONCLUSIONS: HLB causes decreased relative abundance and/or expression activity of rhizoplane-enriched taxonomic and functional properties, collectively resulting in impaired plant host-microbiome interactions. Manipulation of the citrus root-associated microbiome, for instance, by inoculating citrus roots with beneficial Burkholderia strains, has potential to promote plant health. Our results provide novel insights for understanding the contributions of the community enrichment process of the root-associated microbiome to the plant hosts.","Huanglongbing; Liberibacter; Metagenome; Metatranscriptome; Rhizoplane microbiome; Rhizosphere microbiome","RNA 16S; bacterium; Burkholderia; Citrus; gene expression profiling; genetics; host pathogen interaction; metagenomics; microbiology; microflora; phylogeny; physiology; plant disease; plant root; procedures; Rhizobiaceae; rhizosphere; Bacteria; Burkholderia; Citrus; Gene Expression Profiling; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Metagenomics; Microbiota; Phylogeny; Plant Diseases; Plant Roots; Rhizobiaceae; Rhizosphere; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037350137

The result shows that: as a whole, during 1995–2014, the total input of reactive nitrogen in Beijing increased from 516.8 Gg in 1995–616.1Gg in 2014. Seen from the inputting sources of reactive nitrogen, mainly the consumption of food and energy contributes to the increase of general input. Seen from natural and anthropogenic reactive nitrogen, the proportion of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen is above 88%. Meanwhile, the total transferred quantity from external environment in the total quantity of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen produced, i.e. proportion of Z0 increased from 62.9% to 74.3%. Secondly, the consumption structure of food and energy which are two most important sources for increase of input quantity of reactive nitrogen also changed. In the food consumption system, the proportion of the meat products with high nitrogen content was building up. In the energy consumption system, the total energy consumed of traffic sector which has the largest nitrogen oxide emission factor increased about 9.5 times, while kerosene which is the energy category with the largest nitrogen oxide emission factor was its most principal energy consumption category, with the proportion of consumption increasing from 58.2% to 74.2%.

Both closely spaced electron transfer processes are undetectable by dc voltammetry and are associated with the direct reduction of CO2 species and have reversible potentials of approximately -1.27 and -1.40 V vs Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl). A mechanism involving a reversible inner-sphere one-electron reduction of CO2 followed by a rate-determining CO2•- protonation step is proposed. Molecular CO2 has been identified as the dominant electroactive species that undergoes a series of coupling electron transfer and chemical reactions to form the final products.

Meanwhile, the allocation of carbon emission quota among sectors or enterprises proves the first and critical step. For this reason, this paper constructs a comprehensive index combined with the subjective, objective and linear combination weighting methods to allocate carbon emission quotas among the 39 sectors of China’s industry in 2020 based on the level of 2015, and employs the input-oriented ZSG-DEA model to examine the efficiency of allocation solutions in 2020. The results indicate that, first, when carbon emission reduction capacity, responsibility and potential are considered for the comprehensive index of carbon emission quota allocation, the mitigation responsibility plays a relatively higher role than other two indicators. Second, all of the subjective, objective and linear combination weighting methods can be used for effective allocation of carbon emission quotas, and the former two methods have less advantage in light of efficiency. Third, six key industrial sectors are respectively allocated over 500 million tonnes of carbon emission quotas in 2020, which together account for 91.77 % of the total in the industry. Finally, the final carbon emission quota allocation solution reflects both the equity and efficiency principles and achieve the Pareto optimal state. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Carbon quota allocation; Efficiency; Equity; Industrial sectors; ZSG-DEA model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982299809

The network consisted of 10 sensor clusters, each with 10 measurement nodes, distributed to capture the variability in topography and vegetation cover. The sensor network captured significant spatial heterogeneity in rain versus snow precipitation for water-year 2014, variability that was not apparent in the more limited operational data. Using daily dew-point temperature to track temporal elevational changes in the rain-snow transition, the amount of snow accumulation at each node was used to estimate the fraction of rain versus snow. This resulted in an underestimate of total precipitation below the 0°C dew-point elevation, which averaged 1730 m across 10 precipitation events, indicating that measuring snow does not capture total precipitation. We suggest blending lower elevation rain gauge data with higher-elevation sensor-node data for each event to estimate total precipitation. Blended estimates were on average 15–30% higher than using either set of measurements alone. Using data from the current operational snow-pillow sites gives even lower estimates of basin-wide precipitation. Given the increasing importance of liquid precipitation in a warming climate, a strategy that blends distributed measurements of both liquid and solid precipitation will provide more accurate basin-wide precipitation estimates, plus spatial and temporal patters of snow accumulation and melt in a basin. © 2017.

It is widely claimed that in growing cities, individuals' transport energy use could be made more efficient by planning to control urban sprawl and create polycentric urban structures. However, existing conclusions are mixed. This paper contributes to this issue with an in-depth analysis of China's cities. Interestingly, polycentric cities demonstrated lower travel energy efficiency than monocentric ones. This is mainly because urban sub-center developments have failed to combine employment and residential land use. In these planned sub-centers, land use is usually dominated by either housing or industrial park developments, requiring people to commute long distances between home and work, and use cars at high rates. Increasing fragmentation of development management due to political decentralization has apparently worsened the job-housing imbalance. Though a significant effect of urban structure on transport energy consumption was observed, car use control policies had no effect, while a high level of metro services was associated with lower energy consumption. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Individual transport energy use; Low-carbon development; Monocentric city; Polycentric city; Urban structure","energy efficiency; energy use; transportation system; urban area; urban sprawl; urban transport; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020277884

We investigated SOA formation by oxidizing dilute, ambient-level exhaust concentrations from a fleet of on-road gasoline vehicles in a smog chamber. We measured less SOA formation from newer vehicles meeting more stringent emissions standards. This suggests that the natural replacement of older vehicles with newer ones that meet more stringent emissions standards should reduce SOA levels in urban environments. However, SOA production depends on both precursor concentrations (emissions) and atmospheric chemistry (SOA yields). We found a strongly nonlinear relationship between SOA formation and the ratio of nonmethane organic gas to oxides of nitrogen (NOx) (NMOG:NOx), which affects the fate of peroxy radicals. For example, changing the NMOG:NOx from 4 to 10 ppbC/ ppbNOx increased the SOA yield from dilute gasoline vehicle exhaust by a factor of 8. We investigated the implications of this relationship for the Los Angeles area. Although organic gas emissions from gasoline vehicles in Los Angeles are expected to fall by almost 80% over the next two decades, we predict no reduction in SOA production from these emissions due to the effects of rising NMOG:NOx on SOA yields. This highlights the importance of integrated emission control policies for NOx and organic gases.","Air pollution; Atmospheric particulate matter; Gasoline vehicles; NOx; Secondary organic aerosol","gasoline; hydrocarbon; nitrogen; peroxy radical; volatile organic compound; air pollution control; Article; California; chemical structure; chemoluminescence; controlled study; exhaust gas; flame ionization detection; gas chromatography; mass spectrometry; oxidation; particulate matter; photochemistry; photooxidation; precursor; prediction; priority journal; secondary organic aerosol; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021701529

In order to evaluate DCF distribution and its contribution to biogenic carbon flux, surface and vertical distribution of DCF, primary production (PP) and bacterial production (BP) were investigated in both offshore and coastal waters in the South China Sea (SCS). Surface DCF was ~ 0.058 μg C L−1 h−1 (~ 10% of PP), within the same order of magnitude as BP of ~ 0.047 μg C L−1 h−1 in the offshore waters. Integrated over the 1500 m water column, DCF was ~ 196 mg C m−2 h−1, corresponding to ~ 384% of PP, and represented a newly produced source of organic matter. This suggested that DCF was an important microbial metabolic pathway in the SCS, which might support ~ 83% carbon demand of heterotrophic prokaryotes. Interestingly, the DCF was higher in the deep water (~ 0.140 μg C L−1 h−1) than the surface water (~ 0.089 μg C L−1 h−1). In addition to the different microbial community, this different vertical distribution of DCF was likely due to the nutrient status, as our nutrient enrichment experiment showed that the addition of glucose, ammonium and phosphate stimulated the DCF rates, especially the addition of glucose plus ammonium. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bacterial production; Dark carbon fixation; Microbial carbon cycle; Nutrient; Primary production; The South China Sea","bacterium; carbon cycle; carbon fixation; carbon flux; coastal water; deep water; metabolism; microbial activity; microbial community; nutrient enrichment; nutritional status; organic matter; primary production; surface water; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Prokaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027455982

The study employs three kinds of definitions of extreme precipitation: (1) percentile, (2) standard deviation and (3) generalize extreme value (GEV) distribution analysis for extreme events based on local statistics. Relationship between trends in the mean and extreme precipitation is identified with a novel metric, i.e. area aggregated matching ratio (AAMR) computed on regional and global scales. Generally, more (less) extreme events are likely to occur in regions with a positive (negative) mean trend. The match between the mean and extreme trends deteriorates for increasingly heavy precipitation events. The AAMR is higher in regions with negative mean trends than in regions with positive mean trends, suggesting a higher likelihood of severe dry events, compared with heavy rain events in a warming climate. AAMR is found to be higher in tropics and oceans than in the extratropics and land regions, reflecting a higher degree of randomness and more important dynamical rather than thermodynamical contributions of extreme events in the latter regions. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society","climate variability; extreme precipitation; global warming; precipitation; trends","Climate change; Climatology; Global warming; Precipitation (chemical); Climate prediction centers; Climate variability; Daily precipitations; Degree of randomness; Distribution analysis; Extreme precipitation; Global precipitation; trends; Precipitation (meteorology); climate prediction; climate variation; data set; extreme event; global warming; precipitation (climatology); trend analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026667780

This study ascertained impacts of potential future rainfall change on hydrological processes at the Jianfengling (JFL) tropical mountain rainforest watershed in Hainan Island, China using the BASINS (Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources)-HSPF (Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN)-CAT (Climate Assessment Tool) modeling system. The HSPF model was calibrated and validated with available measured data prior to its applications. Three simulation scenarios were then performed to gain a better understanding of the impacts of different rainfall rates and storm intensities on stream discharge, surface water runoff from forest land, and water outflow from the JFL watershed outlet. Results showed that a 10% increase in rainfall rate could result in 1.3 times increase in stream discharge, surface runoff, and water outflow. A potential future wet climate could have profound impacts on hydrological processes at the JFL watershed, whereas a potential future dry climate could result less impacts on stream discharge, surface runoff, and water outflow at the same watershed. Our simulation further revealed that climate change driven by extreme rain storms had greater impacts on annual surface runoff than on annual stream discharge. The coupled CAT-HSPF model is a useful tool to modify historical rainfall data for projecting future rainfall variation impacts on forest hydrological processes due to climate change. This approach would be able to extend to other regions around the world. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Hydrology; Jianfengling; Modeling; Rainfall change; Rainforest","Climate models; Forestry; Hydrology; Models; Rain; Rivers; Runoff; Storms; Surface waters; Watersheds; Climate assessment; Hydrological process; Hydrological simulation program - fortrans; Jianfengling; Point and nonpoint sources; Rainfall variation; Rainforest; Surface water runoff; Climate change; climate change; discharge; environmental impact assessment; estimation method; hydrological modeling; outflow; precipitation intensity; rainfall; rainforest; runoff; watershed; China; Hainan; Hainan; Jianfengling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019040097

We examine the long-term trends in HCHO columns observed by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument from 2005 to 2014 across North America. Biogenic isoprene is the dominant source of HCHO, and its emission has a large temperature dependence. After correcting for this dependence, we find a general pattern of increases in much of North America but decreases in the southeastern U.S. Over the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria industrial area, HCHO columns decreased by 2.2% a−1 from 2005 to 2014, consistent with trends in emissions of anthropogenic VOCs. Over the Cold Lake Oil Sands in the southern Alberta in Canada, HCHO columns increased by 3.8% a−1, consistent with the increase in crude oil production there. HCHO variability in the northwestern U.S. and Midwest could be related to afforestation and corn silage production. Although NOx levels can affect the HCHO yield from isoprene oxidation, we find that decreases in anthropogenic NOx emissions made only a small contribution to the observed HCHO trends. ©2017.

However, there is limited information about the turnover of the recently photosynthesized plant- and soil microbe-derived C in paddy soil. Methods: We conducted an incubation study with four different 13C–labeled substrates: rice shoots (Shoot-C), rice roots (Root-C), rice rhizodeposits (Rhizo-C), and microbe-assimilated C (Micro-C). Results: Shoot- and Root-C were initially rapidly transformed into the dissolved organic C (DOC) pool, while their recovery in microbial biomass C (MBC) and SOC increased with incubation time. There were 0.05%, 9.8% and 10.0% of shoot-C, and 0.06%, 15.9% and 16.5% of root-C recovered in DOC, MBC and SOC pools, respectively at the end of incubation. The percentages of Rhizo- and Micro-C recovered in DOC, MBC, and SOC pools slowly decreased over time. Less than 0.1% of the Rhizo- and Micro-C recovered in DOC pools at the end of experiment; while 45.2% and 33.8% of Rhizo- and Micro-C recovered in SOC pools. Shoot- and Root-C greatly increased the amount of 13C–PLFA in the initial 50 d incubation, which concerned PLFA being indicative for fungi and actinomycetes while those assigning gram-positive bacteria decreased. The dynamic of soil microbes utilizing Rhizo- and Micro-C showed an inverse pattern than those using Shoot- and Root-C. Principal component analysis of 13C–PLFA showed that microbial community composition shifted obviously in the Shoot-C and Root-C treatments over time, but that composition changed little in the Rhizo-C and Micro-C treatments. Conclusions: The input C substrates drive soil microbial community structure and function with respect to carbon stabilization. Rhizodeposited and microbial assimilated C have lower input rates, however, they are better stabilized than shoot- and root-derived C, and thus are preferentially involved in the formation of stable SOC in paddy soils. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Microbial community structure; Microbial utilization; Paddy soil; Soil C assimilation; Soil C cycle","assimilation efficiency; bacterium; biomass; carbon; carbon cycle; community composition; crop residue; experimental study; fungus; microbial community; paddy field; principal component analysis; rhizosphere; rice; root; shoot; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; substrate; Actinobacteria (class); Fungi; Posibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013764639

Current models favor either reactivation of lithospheric structures in response to plate movements, or the impingement of mantle plumes. Geochronology provides a means of testing these models, but constraining the age of carbonatites and related metasomatic events is rarely straightforward. We use in situ U-Th-Pb analysis of monazite by SHRIMP to constrain the emplacement age and hydrothermal history of the rare earth element-bearing Gifford Creek Carbonatite Complex in Western Australia, which has been linked to plume magmatism at ca. 1075 Ma. Monazite in carbonatites and related metasomatic rocks (fenites) from the carbonatite complex dates the initial emplacement of the carbonatite at 1361 ± 10 Ma (n = 22, MSWD = 0.91). The complex was subjected to multiple stages of magmatic/hydrothermal overprinting from ca. 1300 Ma to 900 Ma during later regional tectonothermal events. Carbonatite emplacement at ca. 1360 Ma appears to be an isolated igneous event in the region, and occurred about 300 million years before intrusion of the ca. 1075 Ma Warakurna large igneous province, thus precluding a genetic connection. The Gifford Creek Carbonatite Complex occurs within a major crustal suture, and probably formed in response to reactivation of this suture during plate reorganization. Our study demonstrates the veracity of monazite geochronology in determining the magmatic and hydrothermal histories of a carbonatite complex, critical for evaluating competing geodynamic models for carbonatites. The approach involving in situ SHRIMP U-Th-Pb dating of monazite from a wide spectrum of rocks in a carbonatite complex is best suited to establishing the intrusive age and hydrothermal history of carbonatites. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbonatite; Mantle plume; Monazite; U-Th-Pb geochronology","Geochronology; Geodynamics; Igneous rocks; Lead alloys; Monazite; Plates (structural components); Rare earths; Shellfish; Ternary alloys; Thermal plumes; Thorium alloys; Carbonatites; Geodynamic process; Large igneous provinces; Lithospheric structure; Low-degree partial melting; Mantle plume; Tectono-thermal event; U-Th-Pb geochronologies; Phosphate minerals; age determination; carbonatite; crustal structure; emplacement; geochronology; geodynamics; mantle plume; monazite; numerical model; partial melting; SHRIMP dating; Australia; Western Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018867056

Ultimately, these policies will contribute in achieving Goal 12 of the SDGs (ensure sustainable consumption and production patters) while having an indirect impact on Goal 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture), and on Goal 13 (take urgent action to combat climate change and its impact). We illustrate the use of the framework on assessing the exergetic performance of a theoretical milk concentration process. The framework can be used to apply exergy-based indicators for pinpointing the hotspots in food production chains where the irreversible consumption of natural resources is substantial, and for comparing the resource use efficiency of different system designs and configurations. Furthermore, we list a number of other exergy-based methodologies that are also of relevance in resource use efficiency assessment because they capture additional aspects (such as economic performance which exergy analysis alone cannot address) and with the potential of being integrated in this (or a different) framework.

A full characterization of C cycling requires detailed information on spatiotemporal patterns of surface-atmosphere fluxes. However, relevant C cycle observations are highly variable in their coverage and reporting standards. Especially problematic is the lack of integration of the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange of the ocean, inland freshwaters and the land surface with the atmosphere. Here we adopt a data-driven approach to synthesize a wide range of observation-based spatially explicit surface-atmosphere CO2 fluxes from 2001 to 2010, to identify the state of today's observational opportunities and data limitations. The considered fluxes include net exchange of open oceans, continental shelves, estuaries, rivers, and lakes, as well as CO2 fluxes related to net ecosystem productivity, fire emissions, loss of tropical aboveground C, harvested wood and crops, as well as fossil fuel and cement emissions. Spatially explicit CO2 fluxes are obtained through geostatistical and/or remote-sensing-based upscaling, thereby minimizing biophysical or biogeochemical assumptions encoded in process-based models. We estimate a bottom-up net C exchange (NCE) between the surface (land, ocean, and coastal areas) and the atmosphere. Though we provide also global estimates, the primary goal of this study is to identify key uncertainties and observational shortcomings that need to be prioritized in the expansion of in situ observatories. Uncertainties for NCE and its components are derived using resampling. In many regions, our NCE estimates agree well with independent estimates from other sources such as process-based models and atmospheric inversions. This holds for Europe (mean±1 SD: 0.8±0.1PgCyr-1, positive numbers are sources to the atmosphere), Russia (0.1±0.4PgCyr-1), East Asia (1.6±0.3PgCyr-1), South Asia (0.3±0.1PgCyr-1), Australia (0.2±0.3PgCyr-1), and most of the Ocean regions. Our NCE estimates give a likely too large CO2 sink in tropical areas such as the Amazon, Congo, and Indonesia. Overall, and because of the overestimated CO2 uptake in tropical lands, our global bottom-up NCE amounts to a net sink of -5.4±2.0PgCyr-1. By contrast, the accurately measured mean atmospheric growth rate of CO2 over 2001-2010 indicates that the true value of NCE is a net CO2 source of 4.3±0.1PgCyr-1. This mismatch of nearly 10PgCyr-1 highlights observational gaps and limitations of data-driven models in tropical lands, but also in North America. Our uncertainty assessment provides the basis for setting priority regions where to increase carbon observations in the future. High on the priority list are tropical land regions, which suffer from a lack of in situ observations. Second, extensive pCO2 data are missing in the Southern Ocean. Third, we lack observations that could enable seasonal estimates of shelf, estuary, and inland water-atmosphere C exchange. Our consistent derivation of data uncertainties could serve as prior knowledge in multicriteria optimization such as the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS) and atmospheric inversions, without over- or under-stating bottom-up data credibility. In the future, NCE estimates of carbon sinks could be aggregated at national scale to compare with the official national inventories of CO2 fluxes in the land use, land use change, and forestry sector, upon which future emission reductions are proposed.",,"atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sink; empirical analysis; environmental change; flux measurement; geostatistics; global climate; literature review; net ecosystem exchange; net ecosystem production; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; uncertainty analysis; Amazon River; Australia; Congo; Europe; Far East; Indonesia; North America; Russian Federation; South Asia; Southern Ocean",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027245233

Location: The Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil. Methods: We used ecological niche modelling to estimate geographical distributions for 2,255 species under current and future climate scenarios, which we analysed in relation to spatially explicit land use projections, maps of forest remnants derived from remote sensing and socio-economic variables for each municipality within the Atlantic Forest region. We identified spatial priorities that complement the current network of protected areas under three different prioritization scenarios: (1) conservation of existing forest remnants only; (2) conservation of remnants followed by restoration of degraded habitat; and (3) unconstrained actions, in which management location is not defined a priori. We compared our results under different levels of land protection, with targets of 10%, 17% and 20% of the Atlantic Forest extent. Results: Current forest remnants cover only 12% of the Atlantic Forest, so targets of 17% and 20% were achieved only through active restoration. Targets of 17% and 20% captured most species and represented on average 26%–34% of species’ distributions. The spatial pattern of degraded habitats negatively affected representation of biodiversity and implied higher costs and reduced efficiency of planning. We did not observe major differences between conservation prioritizations based on contrasting climate change scenarios. Main conclusions: Protection of forest remnants alone will not suffice to safeguard woody plant species under climate and land use changes; therefore, restoration actions are urgently needed in the Atlantic Forest. With integrated management actions and multicriterion nationwide planning, reaching the 17% of land protection of Aichi biodiversity targets will constitute an important step towards protecting Atlantic Forest biodiversity. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Aichi targets; climate change; ecological restoration; land use change; MaxEnt; spatial conservation prioritization; species distribution modelling; Zonation","biodiversity; conservation status; land use change; prioritization; remote sensing; restoration ecology; socioeconomic status; woody plant; zonation; Aichi; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Chubu; Honshu; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021052731
