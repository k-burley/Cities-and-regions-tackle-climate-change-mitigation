The study was performed in the framework of the International Cooperative Program on Effects of Air Pollution on Natural Vegetation and Crops. Moss Hypnum cupressiforme Hedw. samples were collected in May 2020 from 41 sampling sites distributed over the entire territory of the country. The mass fractions of 35 elements (Na, Mg, Al, Cl, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Br, Se, Rb, Sr, Sb, Cs, Ba, Cd, La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb, Hf, Ta, Th, Pb, and U) were determined using neutron activation analysis and atomic absorption spectrometry. Comparing with 2015/2016 moss survey data, significant differences in the mass fractions of Cr, As, Se, Br, Sr, Sb, Cd, Pb, and Cu were found. Main air pollution sources (natural processes, transport, industry, agriculture, mining) were identified and characterized using factor and correlation analyses. GIS maps were built to point out the zones with the highest element mass fractions and to relate this to the known sources of contamination. Contamination factor, geo-accumulation index, pollution load index, and potential ecological risk index were calculated to assess the air pollution levels in the country. According to the calculated values, Moldova can be characterized as unpolluted to moderately polluted, with low potential ecological risk related to the degree of atmospheric deposition of potentially toxic elements. The cities of Chisinau and Balti were determined to experience particular environmental stress and are considered moderately polluted. © 2021 by the authors.

The EU financial instruments provide funding for the goals and policies of sustainable development of the state or the region through the involvement of budgetary and private financial resources. The purpose of the research is to analyze the existing practice of promoting the implementation of sustainable development policy of the state (states, regions) in the EU countries through the use of financial and legal instruments in order to provide investors with economic returns in accordance with probable risks, while promoting sustainable development goals. The research methods are as follows: comparative analysis; statistical analysis; systematization, generalization. Results. Financial and legal instruments are measures of financial and legal support provided on an additional basis from the budget in order to promote the implementation of the policy of sustainable development of the state. It has been established that the sustainable development goals, namely: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 16 and 17 are connected with the fewest of financial and legal instruments. Sustainable and green bonds that best contribute to objectives 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 11 (Sustainable Urban and Community Development) and 13 (Climate Change Mitigation) have been identified as perspective and promising financial and legal instruments. The financial and legal instruments towards supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, research and innovation and a low-carbon economy are the most popular in the EU. As a result of the research conducted, it has been found that financial and legal instruments towards promoting the implementation of sustainable development policy direct financial resources to the implementation of certain goals, thereby forming a gap in the implementation of the Global Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. It has been also revealed that during the programming period, financial and legal instruments were installed exceptionally slowly; as a result, by the end of 2016, less than 5 percent was actually invested than planned. © 2021.

The consolidation of VM is the tactic of the competent and smart utilization of resources from cloud data centers. Placement of a VM is one of the significant issues in cloud computing (CC). Physical machines in a cloud environment are aware of the way of the VM placement (VMP) as the mapping VMs. The basic target of placement of VM issue is to reduce the physical machines' items that are running or the hosts in cloud data centers. The VMP methods have an important role in the CC. However, there is no systematic and complete way to discuss and analyze the algorithms. The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic survey of VMP techniques. Also, the benefits and weaknesses connected with selected VMP techniques have been debated, and the significant issues of these techniques are addressed to develop the more efficient VMP technique for the future. Design/methodology/approach: Because of the importance of VMP in the cloud environments, in this paper, the articles and important mechanisms in this domain have been investigated systematically. The VMP mechanisms have been categorized into two major groups, including static and dynamic mechanisms. Findings: The results have indicated that an appropriate VMP has the capacity to decrease the resource consumption rate, energy consumption and carbon emission rate. VMP approaches in computing environment still need improvements in terms of reducing related overhead, consolidation of the cloud environment to become an extremely on-demand mechanism, balancing the load between physical machines, power consumption and refining performance. Research limitations/implications: This study aimed to be comprehensive, but there were some limitations. Some perfect work may be eliminated because of applying some filters to choose the original articles. Surveying all the papers on the topic of VMP is impossible, too. Nevertheless, the authors are trying to present a complete survey over the VMP. Practical implications: The consequences of this research will be valuable for academicians, and it can provide good ideas for future research in this domain. By providing comparative information and analyzing the contemporary developments in this area, this research will directly support academics and working professionals for better knowing the growth in the VMP area. Originality/value: The gathered information in this paper helps to inform the researchers with the state of the art in the VMP area.

A comprehensive thermal-economic-environmental analysis of a household refrigerator with variable displacement compressor using three refrigerants (R134a, R152a and R1234yf) was presented using CoP and normalized CoP, set-up and running cost and Life Cycle Climate Performance, respectively. The results indicate that with the application of variable displacement technology, the compressor stroke can be tuned in response to heat load so that the power consumption is reduced thus the running cost and CO2 emissions. When the compressor stroke using R134a drops from 13 mm to 10 mm, the power consumption, total cost and life cycle CO2 emissions decrease by 86.3%, 56.7% and 59.9%, respectively. Running cost accounts for 89% of the total cost while indirect emissions accounts for 98% of the total CO2 emissions. Replacement of R134a by R152a will decrease the CoP by 10% but also reduce the cost and CO2 emissions by 5% and 8.6% respectively. This is comparable to increasing the R134a system CoP by 0.9. It is indicated that by adopting variable displacement technology, more CO2 emissions could be reduced given that part load represents over 80% of operating hours for refrigerators. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and IIR","Coefficient of performance; Economic cost; Life cycle emission; Linear compressor; Low GWP; Variable displacement","Carbon dioxide; Coefficient of performance; Cost reduction; Economic analysis; Electric power utilization; Free piston compressors; Heating; Life cycle; Refrigerants; Refrigerators; Capacity modulation; Compressor stroke; Environmental analysis; Household refrigerators; Seasonal efficiency; Steady-state efficiency; Variable displacement; Variable displacement compressor; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098957262

It was found that intracellular damages caused by phenol was alleviated in Arthrospira platensis under high CO2 concentrations. A high CO2 concentration locally around the cells promoted secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The stimulated humic acid-like organics (main ingredients in EPS observed by excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy) with strong adhesive properties, which worked as protective barriers to limit phenol transportation into the cells and created a microenvironment suitable for cells growth. The activity of phenol hydroxylase released into extracellular matrix was increased by 112.7% to enhance extracellular phenol degradation under 99.99 vol% CO2. The decreased abundances of intracellular superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde suggested that elevated CO2 level protected cells by alleviating phenol toxicity and regulating intracellular redox state. Furthermore, the effective quantum yield of photosystem II was promoted by reducing the damage on photosynthetic membranes under phenol stress, leading to an increased biomass productivity by 35.1% during the first four days under 99.99 vol% CO2.

Amid the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in January 2020, strict policies were in place to restrict people's movement, bringing about steep reductions in pollution activities and notably lower ambient concentrations of primary pollutants. In this study, we report hourly measurements of fine particulate matter (i.e., PM2.5) and its comprehensive chemical speciation, including elemental and molecular source tracers, at an urban site in Shanghai spanning a period before the lockdown restriction (BR) (1 to 23 Jan. 2020) and during the restriction (DR) (24 Jan.To 9 Feb. 2020). The overall PM2.5 was reduced by 27% from 56.2 ± 40.9 (BR) to 41.1 ± 25.3 μg m-3 (DR) and the organic carbon (OC) in PM2.5 was similar, averaged at 5.45 ± 2.37 (BR) and 5.42 ± 1.75 μgC m-3 (DR). Reduction in nitrate was prominent, from 18.1 (BR) to 9.2 μg m-3 (DR), accounting for most of the PM2.5 decrease. Source analysis of PM2.5 using positive matrix factorization modeling of comprehensive chemical composition, resolved nine primary source factors and five secondary source factors. The quantitative source analysis confirms reduced contributions from primary sources affected by COVID-19, with vehicular emissions showing the largest drop, from 4.6 (BR) to 0.61 μg m-3 (DR) and the percentage change (-87%) in par with vehicle traffic volume and fuel sale statistics (-60% to-90%). In the same time period, secondary sources are revealed to vary in response to precursor reductions from the lockdown, with two sources showing consistent enhancement while the other three showing reductions, highlighting the complexity in secondary organic aerosol formation and the nonlinear response to broad primary precursor pollutants. The combined contribution from the two secondary sources to PM2.5 increased from 7.3 ± 6.6 (BR) to 14.8 ± 9.3 μg m-3 (DR), partially offsetting the reductions from primary sources and nitrate while their increased contribution to OC, from 1.6 ± 1.4 (BR) to 3.2 ± 2.0 μgC m-3 (DR), almost offset the decrease coming from the primary sources. Results from this work underscore challenges in predicting the benefits to PM2.5 improvement from emission reductions of common urban primary sources.

Exploring the temporospatial pattern and influencing factors of carbon emission efficiency (CEE) of energy-intensive industries helps discover the contribution of energy-intensive industries to regional carbon emissions and formulate different regional low-carbon industry development strategies. Through three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, the CEE of energy-intensive industries of China was estimated from provincial level, and the temporospatial distribution and influencing factors of CEE were analyzed by spatial autocorrelation analysis and Tobit model. The results showed that CEE of energy-intensive industries decreased from 0.649 to 0.587 during 2005–2017 with a decreasing rate of 9.60% annually, while the carbon emissions increased from 0.80 to 1.31 billion tonnes during 2005–2017. CEE of energy-intensive industries in China has obvious spatial heterogeneity and spatial agglomeration. CEE of the eastern provinces is relatively higher, while that of the western regions is lower. It showed that the scale efficiency (SE) of energy-intensive industries is close to the optimal frontier, while the pure technical efficiency (PTE) of energy-intensive industries should be improved in the future. Change of CEE of China's provinces may fall into five categories: high-high-high, low-high-high, low-low-high, low-low-low, and low-high-low. Industry scale (IS) and research and development (R&D) are promoting factors for the CEE of energy-intensive industries, while energy intensity (EI), capital formation rate (CF) and water intensity (WI) are negative factors. To improve CEE and promote cleaner production of energy-intensive industries, the technological innovation capacity should be further improved, energy structure should be adjusted, energy and water consumption should be restrained and the open economic system should be further promoted in central and western China in the future, which help to realize the dislocation, coordination, and high-quality development of energy-intensive industries among China's provinces. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission efficiency; China; Energy-intensive industries; Temporospatial pattern; Three-stage DEA","Data envelopment analysis; Pollution control; Public policy; Spatial variables measurement; Carbon emission efficiencies; Energy intensive industries; Pure technical efficiencies; Research and development; Resources consumption; Spatial autocorrelation analysis; Technological innovation; Three-stage data envelopment analysis; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098142667

Predicting carbonaceous aerosols and identifying source contributions are important steps for further epidemiological study and formulating effective emission control policies. However, we are not aware of any study that examined predictions of OC and EC, and this work is also the first study that attempted to use machine learning and hyperparameter optimization method to predict concentrations of specific aerosol contaminants. This paper describes an investigation of the characteristics and sources of OC and EC in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from 2005 to 2010 in the City of Taipei. Respective hourly average concentrations of OC and EC were 5.2 μg/m3 and 1.6 μg/m3. We observed obvious seasonal variation in OC but not in EC. Hourly and daily OC and EC concentrations were predicted using generalized additive model and grey wolf optimized multilayer perceptron model, which could explain up to about 80% of the total variation. Subsequent clustering suggests that traffic emission was the major contribution to OC, accounting for about 80% in the spring, 65% in the summer, and 90% in the fall and winter. In the Taipei area, local emissions were the dominant sources of OC and EC in all seasons, and long-range transport had a significant contribution to OC and in PM2.5 in spring. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Clustering; Elemental carbon; Hyperparameter optimization method; Machine learning; Organic carbon; Source apportionment","Aerosols; Emission control; Multilayer neural networks; Organic carbon; Springs (components); Average concentration; Carbonaceous aerosol; Epidemiological studies; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Generalized additive model; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Long range transport; Source contributions; Forecasting; carbon; organic carbon; carbon; additive; aerosol; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; elemental carbon; emission control; long range transport; machine learning; optimization; organic carbon; traffic emission; aerosol; exhaust gas; machine learning; multilayer perceptron; nonhuman; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; seasonal variation; spring; summer; Taiwan; winter; aerosol; air pollutant; China; city; environmental monitoring; particle size; particulate matter; season; Taipei; Taiwan; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Carbon; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097077478

This study estimated city-level land use carbon emissions (LUCEs) using a novel method based on the correction coefficient calculated by the carbon emissions from energy consumption and basic land use emissions. The method was applied to 13 cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration in China using 30 m resolution land use data and energy balance tables (EBTs), and the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) was used to discuss the relationship between urbanization and LUCEs in three typical models. The results revealed the expansion of built-up land in the BTH region, and LUCEs at the city-level increase continually, except in Beijing, which showed the most significant expansion of built-up land but a declining trend in LUCEs in recent years. The relationship between urbanization and LUCEs can be summarized into three modes: ‘high urbanization - low emissions’, ‘middle urbanization - high emissions’, and ‘low urbanization - low emissions’. The results have great significance for the formulation of policies to reduce city-level carbon emission at different urbanization levels, and the implementation of high-quality people-oriented new-type urbanization can allow the realization of the carbon emission reduction targets of China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; Carbon emissions; City-level; Energy consumption; Land use; Urbanization","Carbon; Climate change; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; Correction coefficients; Environmental Kuznets curves; Quantitative assessments; Urban agglomerations; Urbanization levels; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098946964

There are large uncertainties regarding emissions from RRCC owing to the lack of consideration of several key factors (e.g. combination modes of coal and stoves, combustion modes, and high temporal resolution). In this study, we provided a new estimation framework for RRCC emissions through a case study in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, China. The emission estimations were improved according to four aspects, namely (1) coal-specific and stove-specific coal consumption was calculated based on face-to-face field interviews of 6700 valid volunteers/households covering 288 villages in 50 counties; (2) the influences of combustion modes (flaming and smoldering modes) on emissions were considered; (3) emissions of different fuel-stove combinations were estimated based on coal, stove, and combustion mode-specific RRCC consumption and localised emission factors; and (4) a method for emission estimation with high temporal resolution (1 h) was developed. The results indicated that RRCC emitted 413.6 kt SO2, 55.7 kt NOx, 5717.3 kt CO, 149.4 kt VOCs, 167.1 kt PM2.5, 18.2 kt EC, 32.5 kt OC, and 8.2 kt NH3 in 2016. The combination of bituminous coal and an advanced coal stove was the most significant contributor (20.7–71.8%) to various pollutant emissions. Coal combusted under the flaming mode contributed to most (81.9%) of the total coal consumption, and thus emitted the majority (50.8–99.8%) of pollutants, except for VOCs. Meanwhile, that under the smoldering mode only accounted for 18.1% of the total consumption, but contributed 49.2% and 74.7% of the CO and VOCs emissions, respectively. Two clear emission peaks occurred at approximately 7:00–9:00 and 18:00–20:00. The detailed coal consumption and emissions with high temporal and spatial resolution can provide sound data for further research on rural environmental issues and scientific support to pollution control strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced coal stove; Coal-stove combination; Combustion modes; Emission factors; Rural coal emissions","Air quality; Ammonia; Bituminous coal; Housing; Pollution control; Stoves; Sulfur dioxide; Combination modes; Control strategies; Emission estimation; Environmental issues; High temporal resolution; Pollutant emission; Rural residential; Temporal and spatial; Coal combustion; bituminous coal; combustion; cooking appliance; emission; environmental issue; estimation method; rural area; adult; article; China; combustion; female; household; human; human experiment; interview; major clinical study; male; particulate matter 2.5; pollution control; sound; air pollutant; air pollution; household; particulate matter; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; coal; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Coal; Household Articles; Humans; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096625278

The urban construction scale is expanding continuously with the increase of the urbanization rate. However, resources needed for construction and influences of construction on the ecological environment are enormous, which further cause resource consumption and environmental destructions. Therefore, changing the traditional mode of construction and promoting the development of prefabricated buildings vigorously are conducive to realize the goal of environmental protection and resource conservation. In this study, a life cycle assessment model for prefabricated buildings was constructed based on the basic data of resource and energy consumption in the production stage, transportation stage, and field installation stage. The total carbon emission of a prefabricated building in Wuhan City was estimated, and specific energy conservation and emission reduction measures were proposed. Results show that prefabricated buildings have become a major manifestation of the industrialization of construction, represented by America, Germany, and Japan. In the case study, the total carbon emission of prefabricated components in the project is 3277.66 t, in which the carbon emissions in the production stage, transportation stage, and field installation stage account for 86.58%, 12.37%, and 1.05%, respectively. Based on the above research results, the further decrease in carbon emissions of prefabricated buildings by promoting the development of building energy efficiency and prefabricated buildings, accelerating R&D and innovation of prefabricated building technologies, and strengthening training to designers related with installation of prefabricated buildings is suggested.

Based on the Global Change Assessment Model, this study considered three scenarios from a global perspective and focused on energy consumption, CO2 emissions pathways, deeper emissions reduction (DER), and contribution to global emissions reduction in China. Compared with the Nationally Determined Contribution scenario, to achieve the target of 2 °C or 1.5 °C warming, the peak time of CO2 emissions in China should be advanced to 2025 or even to 2020, and CO2 emissions in China by 2050 should be reduced substantially by 30% or 90%, respectively. Moreover, more than 80% of the DER of 3.1 and 8.6 Gt CO2, respectively, came from the power and industrial sectors. China's contribution to global DER, especially its recent efforts, was found higher than its cumulative emissions level. Correspondingly, China's energy system should undergo substantial low-carbon transformation. By 2050, total primary energy consumption should be increased by about 20% from 2015 level, coal share should decrease to 13%–32%, natural gas share should steadily increase slowly, and the share of non-fossil-fuel energy should rise to 40%–63%. Meanwhile, the share of non-fossil-fuel electricity should increase substantially to 54%–77%. Sensitive analysis of baseline scenario setting shows that, it would be possible for China to achieve the target of the Paris Agreement with a higher level of emissions. © 2021","Carbon dioxide; China; Energy transformation; Low-carbon energy; Paris agreement","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy utilization; Global warming; Cumulative emissions; Emissions reduction; Global perspective; Historical emissions; Low carbon energies; Low carbon transformations; Primary energy consumption; Sensitive analysis; Coal industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100278678

However, the indirect impact of surface vegetation improvement on the regional climate, such as the climate effect of sand-dust events reduction, has never been evaluated. Here, we estimated the feedback of temperature and precipitation on the change of sand-dust events, arising from the vegetation growth with ecological restoration, using a simple theoretical framework with a series of scenario simulations based on a regional climate model (RegCM). The results showed that revegetation reduced dust emissions, with a contribution rate of approximately 40.15%. With the combined influence of ecological restoration and climate change, the cooling effect of sand-dust events strengthened with the increase in the intensity of sand-dust events, which is mainly caused by the strong absorption of shortwave radiation by the atmosphere. The response of precipitation was uncertain because of tropospheric circulation feedback and shortwave radiation absorption. Our results also indicate that changes in sand-dust events caused by vegetation restoration play important roles in shaping the future climate near the arid and semi-arid regions of northern China. The climatic effects of sand-dust events should be included in assessing ecological restoration impacts to promote sustainable development and enhance our understanding of climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

But the debate persists among the academic circles and the government over whether a double dividend, reducing pollution emission and boosting employment, of environmental regulations exists. This study differentiates, based on Cobb-Douglas production function, the variance between high- and low-skilled labour and constructs theoretical models to analyse heterogeneous effects of environmental regulation intensity on the employment of labour with varied skills. The model finds that implementing environmental regulation will generate ‘compliance cost effect’ and ‘innovation offset effect’. The compliance cost effect will promote the employment of high-skilled labour while suppressing that of the low-skilled labour. The innovation offset effect, however, will facilitate the employment for both high-skilled and low-skilled labour. Therefore, the employment of high-skilled labour will grow along with the intensification of environmental regulation while that of the low-skilled labour will decline first and then rebound, showcasing a U-shaped curve. The empirical research results based on the provincial dynamic panel data from 2004 to 2018 in China confirm the theoretical analysis. Moreover, we find spatial spillover effects of environmental regulation on employment, with high-skilled labour being more sensitive to changes in environmental regulation. One percentage point increase in environmental regulation in neighbouring regions will cause 0.072% employment decline in high-skilled labour while that of low-skilled labour will only decrease 0.033%. The conclusions of this study verify that dividend in employment growth for both high-skilled and low-skilled labour can be realised along with intensification of environmental regulation, which carries significant guiding implications for policy-making for environmental regulation in China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Double dividend; Dynamic spatial durbin model; Employment; Environmental regulation intensity; High-skilled labour; Low-skilled labour","article; China; empirical research; employment; human; management; rebound; skill; theoretical study; China; pollution; theoretical model; China; Employment; Environmental Pollution; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098149614

To control PM2.5 pollution, China's government has adopted a series of mitigation measures since 2013. Observed PM2.5 concentration shows a reduction of 44% from 2013 to 2019. However, the accuracy of using these reports to directly evaluate effectiveness of measures has been questioned because of the confounding influence of weather conditions. Using a new numerical model that accounts for the influence of weather conditions, we show that these measures have in fact led to a reduction of 34% in national annual mean PM2.5 concentration. The 10% difference is mainly caused by the poor dispersion condition in 2013, which is a once-in-two-decades phenomenon. If the current mitigation efforts can continue through 2035, the national goal of an air-quality level of 35 μg/m3 will have been achieved in most cities, which can bring tremendous benefits to air quality and human health. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.Air pollution is a major environmental issue in China and imposes severe health burdens on Chinese citizens. Consequently, China has deployed a series of control measures to mitigate fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, the extent to which these measures have been effective is obscured by the existence of confounding meteorological effects. Here, we use a newly developed reduced-form model that can address emission-driven PM2.5 trends and control for meteorological effects to examine the level of PM2.5 reduction across 367 cities since the introduction of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (the Plan) in 2013. Our findings show that, on average, the national annual mean level of PM2.5 decreased by 34% from 2013 to 2019 after the removal of meteorological effects, about 10% less than the reduction level officially observed. Despite this difference, assuming that current control efforts continue through 2035, the long-term air-quality target of 35 μg/m3 as determined by the recently updated Plan will be met. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.A series of measures have been taken to control fine particular matter (PM2.5) pollution in China since 2013.

Under strict emission controls since 2013, the mass concentrations of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased substantially in Winter 2017/2018. However, in March 2018, the mean PM2.5 concentration doubled from ~40 to 87 μg m−3, the reason for which is still unclear in the context of significant emission reductions. Here, using PM2.5 measurements, vertical observations, and reanalysis data, we found that this worsening was attributed to increasingly stable stratification characterized by temperature differences between 850 hPa and 1000 hPa, which reached the maximum value (−4 °C) for March from 1951 to 2018. Not limited to Beijing, positive anomalies in temperature differences occurred widely as a result of a westward transition in the center of the polar vortex. Away from the cold center and dominated by anomalous zonal westerlies, northern China was intruded by warm southerly winds. The warm regional advection increased positive anomalies in low-level temperature differences, and in turn, enhanced geopotential thickness throughout the troposphere. The adverse impact on pollution was also confirmed in comparison to the vortex pattern in January. The vortex changed from the elongated one with a split-flow pattern in January to the annular vortex with a major center over Novaya Zemlya in March. Correspondingly, Beijing was less affected by cold air masses and thereby under relatively stable stratification, which is unfavorable for pollution dispersion in March.

The size distributions of particle mass concentrations were bimodal, with the first peak in the fine fraction (0.4–2.1 µm) and the second peak in the coarse fraction (3.3–5.8 µm). Moreover, the proportion of fine particles increased and the proportion of coarse particles decreased as the pollution level was more elevated. It was found that the composition of coarse particles is as important as that of fine particles when pollution of aerosol metals in the atmosphere in 2016 were compared to 2013. In addition, according to the size distribution characteristics, 23 MEs were divided into three groups: (a) Fe, Co, Sr, Al, Ti, Ba, and U, which concentrated in coarse mode; (b) Zn, As, Cd, Tl, and Pb, which concentrated in fine mode; and (c) Na, K, Be, V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Mo, Ag, and Sn, showing bimodal distribution. Under clean air, slight pollution and moderate pollution conditions, most elements maintained their original size distributions, while under severe pollution, the unimodal distributions of most MEs became bimodal distributions. The factors analysis combined with size distributions indicated that Na, Zn, Mo, Ag, Cd, and Tl, showing the moderate to severe contamination on environment, were significantly influenced by diffuse regional emissions or anthropogenic source emissions (vehicle exhaust emissions and combustion process). The environmental risk assessment revealed that the heavy metal loading in the atmospheric particles collected had a high potential for ecological risk to the environment during sampling period because of the high contribution of Cd, Tl, Zn and Pb. © 2021","Aerosol; Ecological risk; Enrichment factor; Heavy metals; Particulate matter; Size distribution","aluminum; arsenic; barium; beryllium; cadmium; carbon monoxide; chromium; copper; gold; iron; lead; manganese; metal; molybdenum; nickel; potassium; sodium; strontium; thallium; tin; titanium; uranium; vanadium; zinc; heavy metal; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; enrichment; environmental risk; heavy metal; particulate matter; risk assessment; size distribution; source apportionment; winter; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; atmosphere; atmospheric particulate matter; chemical composition; China; combustion; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental impact assessment; exhaust gas; human; particle size; suburban area; winter; aerosol; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; particle size; particulate matter; risk assessment; season; Beijing [China]; China; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Atmosphere; Beijing; Environmental Monitoring; Metals, Heavy; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Risk Assessment; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100199181

This paper introduces a field experiment using an E-band millimeter-wave link to obtain rainfall rate information in Nanjing city, which is situated in the east of China. The link is 3 km long and operates at 71 and 81 GHz. We first distinguish between the wet and the dry periods, and then determine the classification threshold for calculating attenuation baseline in real time. We correct the influence of the wet antenna attenuation and finally calculate the rainfall rate through the power law relationship between the rainfall rate and the rain-induced attenuation. The experimental results show that the correlation between the rainfall rate retrieved from the 71 GHz link and the rainfall rate measured by the raindrop spectrometer is up to 0.9. The correlation at 81 GHz is up to 0.91. The mean relative errors are all below 5%. By comparing with the rainfall rate measured by the laser raindrop spectrometer set up at the experimental site, we verified the reliability and accuracy of monitoring rainfall using the E-band millimeter-wave link. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the combined effects of grazing, wind erosion, and dust deposition have not been explored. As part of a 7-year (2010–2016) field manipulative experiment, this study was conducted to examine the impacts of grazing and simulated aeolian processes (wind erosion and dust deposition) on plant community cover and species richness in a temperate steppe on the Mongolian Plateau, China. Grazing decreased total cover by 4.2%, particularly the cover of tall-stature plants (> 20 cm in height), but resulted in 9.1% greater species richness. Wind erosion also reduced total cover by 17.0% primarily via suppressing short-stature plants associated with soil nitrogen loss, but had no effect on species richness. Dust deposition enhanced total cover by 5.7%, but resulted in a 7.3% decrease in species richness by driving some of the short-stature plant species to extinction. Both wind erosion and dust deposition showed additive effects with grazing on vegetation cover and species richness, though no detectable interaction between aeolian processes and grazing could be detected due to our methodological constraints. The changes in gross ecosystem productivity, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem productivity under the wind erosion and dust deposition treatments were positively related to aeolian process-induced changes in vegetation cover and species richness, highlighting the important roles of plant community shifts in regulating ecosystem carbon cycling. Our findings suggest that plant traits (for example, canopy height) and soil nutrients may be the key for understanding plant community responses to grassland management and natural hazards. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","dust storm; plant diversity; plant height; plant–herbivore interaction; selective foraging; soil nutrient; species richness; vegetation cover","community structure; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; experimental study; forage; grazing; plant community; soil nutrient; species richness; steppe; temperate environment; vegetation cover; wind erosion; Mongolian Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087409483

The construction of low-carbon cities contributes to adjusting the industrial structure, optimizing the energy structure and accelerating institutional reforms. Using the panel data of 285 prefecture-level cities during 2006–2015, this paper takes the pilot program of low-carbon cities as a quasi-natural experiment to detect the impact of the pilot program on industrial structure upgrading and its possible mechanism. The results reveal that the construction of low-carbon cities displays a positive impact on industrial structure supererogation while it has little effect on industrial structure rationalization. Ventilation coefficient is regarded as an instrumental variable to address endogenous problems. The conclusions are still tenable after a series of robustness tests. Mechanism analysis shows that the pilot program can bolster industrial structure supererogation via technological innovation and the reduction of the proportion of high-carbon industries. The regional heterogeneity analysis indicates that the influence of the pilot program on the industrial structure supererogation in the central and western areas is more positive than that in the eastern area, whereas the impact of the pilot program on the industrial structure rationalization is not significant in the three areas. The heterogeneity analysis of environmental law enforcement indicates that the pilot program can more obviously bump up the industrial structure supererogation in cities with strong law enforcement intensity. The impact on the industrial structure rationalization is not evident in cities with weak law enforcement intensity, but the industrial structure rationalization is significantly improved in cities with strong law enforcement intensity.

Currently, only a few emission sources have accurate geographic locations (point sources), while a large part of sources, including industrial plants, are estimated as provincial totals (area sources) and spatially disaggregated onto grid cells based on proxies; this approach is reasonable to some extent but is highly questionable at fine spatial resolutions. Here, we compile a new comprehensive point source database that includes nearly 100,000 industrial facilities in China. We couple it with the frame of Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC), estimate point source emissions, combine point and area sources, and finally map China's anthropogenic emissions of 2013 at the spatial resolution of 30″×30″ (~1 km). Consequently, the percentages of point source emissions in the total emissions increase from less than 30% in the MEIC up to a maximum of 84% for SO2 in 2013. The new point source-based emission maps show the uncoupled distribution of emissions and populations in space at fine spatial scales, however, such a pattern cannot be reproduced by any spatial proxy used in the conventional emissions mapping. This new accurate high-resolution emission mapping approach reduces the modeled biases of air pollutant concentrations in the densely populated areas compared to the raw MEIC inventory, thus improving the assessment of population exposure. © 2020 Science China Press","Air quality modeling; Anthropogenic emission inventory; High-resolution mapping","Air quality; Image resolution; Mapping; Particulate emissions; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollutant concentrations; Air quality modeling; Anthropogenic emissions; Distribution of emissions; Emission inventories; High-resolution emission; Industrial facilities; Point source emissions; Industrial emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098974170

In this paper, the effects of low hydrogen content and FKR on the performance of the GDI engine are mainly studied. The simulation results show that adding less than 3% hydrogen in the GDI engine can improve the BP and BT of the engine under typical urban conditions such as 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. As the hydrogen volume fraction and the FKR increase, the LFS of the mixture increases, resulting in a shorter ignition delay, combustion delay, and 10–90 % MFB. However, an increase in FKR results in a decrease in the BP and BT. In terms of fuel economy, the BSFC decreases as the hydrogen content increases, but as FKR increases, the BSFC increases. In terms of emissions, the proportion of hydrogen increases, HC and NOx emissions increase, and CO and CO2 emissions decrease. Therefore, adding hydrogen to the GDI engine while adjusting the FKR can improve the dynamic performance of the engine and reduce CO and CO2 exhaust emissions. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Combustion and emissions; Flame kernel radius; GDI; Hydrogen","Carbon dioxide; Direct injection; Engines; Fuel economy; Hydrogen fuels; Ignition; Combustion and emission performance; Direct injection spark ignition engines; Dynamic performance; Exhaust emission; Hydrogen combustion; Hydrogen contents; Hydrogen volume fraction; Shorter ignition delay; Hydrogen economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099940008

Thus, it is important to determine the sources of disparities induced by different intermediate inputs and to identify which supply chains are crucial for reducing emissions. We invoke subsystem analysis to examine the sources of disparities between ECE and EVA caused by intermediate inputs used to produce exports in China's Guangdong Province during 2002–2012. We apply multi-temporal structural path analysis to extract crucial ECE paths and corresponding EVAs and investigate variations in priorities to reduce path emissions. The results indicate, first, that both inter- and intra-sector dimensions show disparities in ECE–EVA derived from sectoral spillovers. Second, disparities in spillover components are caused by two factors: differing intensities between direct carbon emissions and the direct coefficient for value-added and the expansion of economic multipliers. Third, fragmentation in production increases the difficulty of mitigating supply chain emissions and enhances disparities in ECE–EVA among high-production tiers (Tier 3→∞). Fourth, an amplification effect influences path disparities in ECE–EVA and determines priorities for reducing path emissions except in cases of emission-shifting. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Export-related carbon emissions; Export-related value-added; Structural path analysis; Subsystem analysis","Carbon; Regression analysis; Amplification effects; Economic benefits; Guangdong Province; Intermediate inputs; Production increase; Reducing emissions; Subsystem analysis; Supply chain emissions; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096484436

Most farmers use conventional irrigation with over fertilisation (CIF), thereby applying approximately 2000 kg N ha−1 fertiliser over two cropping seasons per year. Here, we tested the effect of drip irrigation with reduced fertilisation (DIF) combined with straw incorporation on reducing N2O emissions and nitrogen leaching from solar greenhouse vegetable production systems. Over three consecutive tomato cropping seasons, N2O emissions and nitrogen leaching were monitored in high temporal resolution, thereby producing a unique dataset. Compared to CIF, the realised drip fertigation scheme reduces N2O emission and nitrogen leaching of nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen by approximately a factor of 5–10 (N2O-DIF: 10.3, CIF: 47.5 kg N ha−1 yr−1; N leaching-DIF: 83.6, CIF: 863 kg N ha−1 yr−1). Straw incorporation in CIF, though advantageous for soil health, resulted in pollution swapping as soil N2O emissions increased while NO3− leaching losses decreased. On the contrary, no significant negative environmental N effects of straw incorporation were found for DIF. As crop productivity was not affected by straw incorporation, neither for CIF nor for DIF, our study provides a sound basis for policy advice to recommend farmers to adopt drip fertigation combined with straw application. Wide scale adoption of this technique will result in reductions of environment N losses, alleviate major soil degradation signs, including soil acidity, nutrient imbalance and deterioration of soil microbial community structure, while allowing to maintaining high yields of vegetables in solar greenhouse production systems. © 2021 Elsevier LtdDrip fertigation combined with straw incorporation significantly reduces N2O emission and N leaching, improves soil health, while sustaining high yields. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Conventional fertigation; Drip fertigation; N2O emission; Nitrogen leaching; Solar greenhouse vegetable; Straw incorporation","Deterioration; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouses; Irrigation; Leaching; Soils; Solar heating; Vegetables; Crop productivity; Cropping seasons; Dissolved organic nitrogen; High temporal resolution; Nitrogen leaching; Soil microbial community structure; Solar greenhouse; Straw incorporations; Soil pollution; dissolved organic nitrogen; fertilizer; nitrate; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; organic nitrogen; unclassified drug; water; crop yield; drip irrigation; fertilizer application; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; leaching; nitrogen oxides; vegetable; yield response; Article; controlled study; crop production; drip irrigation; environment; fertigation; greenhouse; harvest; irrigation (agriculture); leaching; nonhuman; nutrient; policy; season; soil acidity; soil degradation; soil health; soil pollution; soil property; temporal analysis; tomato; vegetable; China; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099822757

Based on the new emission factors, this paper aims to identify the structural and technological determinants of provincial carbon intensity in the electricity generation sector (CIE) using the multiplicative LMDI-II method. Results demonstrate that (1) China’s overall CIE decreases by 7.3% in 2001–2015, and the research period can be divided into four stages according to CIE changes (i.e., rapid growth, rapid decline, slow growth, and transition). The CIE in the 12th FYP estimated in this paper, 24.9% lower than that using the emission factors from IPCC, is closer to China’s actual situation. (2) There exists huge heterogeneity in the determinants of provincial CIE changes in four stages. CIE growth in the Northwest and Northeast is caused by the coal-dominated energy structure. CIE growth in the Southwest is attributed to the electricity structure effect, while that of the Coast region is caused by the geographic distribution effect. The electricity efficiency effect is attributed to the CIE growth for these regions and the Southwest should also place focus on the electricity trade effect. The impact of electricity trade-related factors depends on the region being a net exporter or importer of electricity. (3) To achieve carbon intensity reduction targets, 30 provinces are categorized into four types based on various combinations of structural and technological determinants. The findings provide insights into capturing future emission-mitigating focus as well as defining the emission-mitigating responsibilities between electricity exporters and importers in China. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon intensity; Electricity generation; Structural determinants; Technological determinants","electricity generation; emission inventory; heterogeneity; reduction; technological change; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; coal; China; electricity; technology; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Coal; Electricity; Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095989793

Yongliang 15) and common vetch (Vicia sativa L., var. Lanjian 3) were planted in pot experiments in an inland arid region in 2019. Four treatments were conducted with eight replicates: plants without sheep excrement and cutting (CK), plants with multi‐cutting (MC), plants with sheep excrement (SE), and plants with multi‐cutting and sheep excrement (CE). The results showed that the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission of common vetch with CE significantly was higher than that with MC at the earlier and later branching stages (p &lt; 0.05). That of spring wheat with CE was significantly higher than that with MC at the later tillering stage (p &lt; 0.05). Nitrogen oxide (N2O) emissions of the two forage crops with SE rose significantly more than those with MC at both stages (p &lt; 0.05). Methane (CH4) of both forage crops with SE changed from ab-sorption to emission (p &lt; 0.05). Soil NO3−‐N content of both forages significantly increased with SE compared with MC (p &lt; 0.05), while soil NH4+‐N content did not change significantly. Sheep excrement changed the CH4 sink into a CH4 source of the soil growing the two forage crops and increased the emissions of CO2 and N2O, whereas multi‐cutting significantly reduced the GHG intensity of forage crops mostly by promoting the growth of the two forage crops. Future studies are suggested to identify the spatiotemporal effects of cutting and sheep excrement on GHG emissions to improve the prediction of future climate impacts from grazing activities. © 2021 by the authors.

In recent years, great achievements have been obtained in the understanding the mechanism and development of efficient and selective catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction. However, the electrochemical CO2 reduction is still far from practical applications. Based on the gap between current research and practical applications, the state-of-the-art of the theoretical and experiment investigations on different electrocatalysts for the electrocatalysis of CO2 to CH4 is systematically and constructively reviewed. First of all, strategies for enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity of electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH4 are also examined in this review. The modulated strategies mainly involve the following aspects: i) tuning the applied potentials, ii) morphology engineering, iii) crystallographic facets engineering, iv) defect engineering, v) alloying. Furthermore, the influence of the electrolyte on the activity and selectivity for electrocatalysis of CO2 to CH4 is also reviewed. This review will build a systematic understanding in the electrochemical CO2 reduction to CH4 and may help to provide new insight for designing and optimizing the catalysts and/or electrolyte. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","ambient conditions; CH4 synthesis; CO2 reduction reaction; electrocatalysts","Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Ambient conditions; Applied potentials; Crystallographic facets; Electrochemical reductions; Experiment investigation; Modulated strategy; Selective catalysts; Value added products; Carbon dioxide",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099457892

Waste cooking oil (WCO) holds promise as a means of reducing pollutant emissions thereby improving human health with the co-benefit of decreasing climate-forcing gas emissions by avoiding the combustion of mineral coal. With an annual production of ~2.17 Mt of WCO in Northern China, it could be used to meet the winter heating demand of ~3.25 million rural households, offsetting ~9.83 Mt of raw coal consumption. Through the adoption of coal-to-WCO shift in rural regions of 15 provinces, approximately 15.0%, 15.6%, 15.9% and 13.7%, respectively of CO, PM2.5, SO2 and NOX emissions would be eliminated. It is estimated that such a change would remove the respective contributions of these pollutants to the premature deaths of respectively, 63,400, 29,300, 173,00 and 31,300 rural residents. Such a positive health impact on the labor cohort would reduce the loss of labor supply and work time, as well as producing billions of RMB in economic benefits. WCO-based heating technology has the same effect on the reduction of GWC100 value as other modern energy carriers while also being cheaper and sustainable, long term. Reducing household emissions by substituting raw coal with green energy is a vital strategy to support pathways for sustainable environment design. The results of this work for the coal-to-WCO shift can reinforce the support for coal phase-out in China. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Clean heating; Green combustion; Household emission; Waste cooking oil; Waste recycle","climate change; coal combustion; economic activity; fuel; health impact; household survey; public health; rural area; waste technology; adoption; adult; article; China; climate; combustion; cooking; economic aspect; environmental planning; heating; household; human; particulate matter 2.5; rural population; winter; air pollutant; China; cooking; heating; particulate matter; China; coal; Air Pollutants; China; Coal; Cooking; Heating; Humans; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099621042

As the first batch of ""low-carbon development""pilot provinces, adjusting the industrial structure, changing the mode of economic development and realizing ""low-carbon economy""have become the urgent problems to be solved in Shaanxi Province. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Carbon dioxide; Coal industry; Deterioration; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Greenhouse effect; Carbon emission reductions; Consumption of energy; Ecological environments; Energy consumption structure; Environmental carrying capacities; Environmental pollutions; Industrial structures; Low-carbon development; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105682699

To solve the problem of excessive pollution governance costs, we determined the spot price of emission futures with a pricing model based on an arbitrage-free interval, and constructed a dual-objective optimization model that accounts for both GDP and the pollutant removal cost. By comparing the optimal removal volumes for each cooperator with the national allocation of removal quotas, we divided actors into sellers and buyers of cooperative emission rights based on futures trading. Finally, we used an asymmetric Nash negotiation model to distribute the benefits of cooperation. To demonstrate the approach, we used China's Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region as a case study, and found that the cooperative governance strategy can help to solve the air pollution problem. Compared with the independent autonomy model of the futures market, the Cooperative Governance Model (CGM) increased the GDP of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region by 22.143 × 109 Yuan, an increase of 0.3 %, and decreased the removal cost by 124.030 × 106 Yuan, a decrease of 0.4 %. Our results provide a reference for policy decisions on collaborative air pollution control, and can be used to promote collaborative air pollution control in other regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Asymmetric nash negotiation model; Cooperative governance model; Futures","Air pollution; Commerce; Costs; Financial markets; Storm sewers; Sulfur dioxide; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Futures trading; Governance models; Nash negotiation models; Objective optimization; Policy decisions; Pollutant removal; Pollution problems; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098473935

We sampled plankton and water quality from a man-made lake monthly from 2006 to 2015 for the period from after creation to 13-year old of the lake. We used correlation, variation partitioning, multivariate autoregressive state-space models, and dynamic factor analyses to disentangle interactions of biotic and abiotic factors in regulating the dynamics of plankton size groups. We found that annual average total abundances decreased 86% for phytoplankton and 78% for zooplankton, while concentrations increased 1.8 times for total nitrogen and 2.7 times for total phosphorus during the study period. We concluded that the decline of plankton abundance was largely attributed to the predation of zooplankton on phytoplankton, fish predation on both phytoplankton and zooplankton, and linkages with the decline of water salinity, pH, and the increase of clarity. The decline of plankton abundance was apparently not resulted from long-term change in nutrient concentrations. These conclusions were further supported by that abundances of nano-phytoplankton and micro-phytoplankton oscillated in opposite direction with extremely low density of Cladocera (< 1 individual/L) during the study period. Our conclusions were also supported by the strong interactions between Rotifera and macro-phytoplankton and between nano-phytoplankton and Copepoda, as well as by the describability of the six plankton size groups in a shared trend that was opposite to the trends of water clarity and planktivorous fish stock density. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biotic interactions; Dynamic factor analysis; Environment; Multivariate autoregressive models; Time series","abundance; anthropogenic effect; climate change; community dynamics; community response; environmental factor; lacustrine environment; lake water; plankton; relative abundance; water quality; China; Dishui Lake; Shanghai; Cladocera; Copepoda; Rotifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092317892

The high potential at the cathode caused by the anode hydrogen-oxygen interface leads to the occurrence of carbon corrosion reactions during the startup and shutdown process. System strategies, including gas purge and auxiliary load, have been developed to alleviate the performance decay during startup and shutdown processes. Improper water management will cause local flooding to accelerate the carbon corrosion. Many novel flow fields have been proposed to solve water management problems, such as an optimized 3D flow field, baffle flow field and porous media flow field. The carbon corrosion under normal operation is not as serious as that under start-up and flooding, but it is serious enough to affect the later performance of the PEMFC after long-term operation. Varieties of new supports, such as mesoporous carbon, graphitized carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanofibers (CNF), and metal oxides, have been developed to improve the durability of the catalyst support. This review aims to provide a clear understanding of the carbon corrosion mechanisms, thereby helping researchers to prolong the lifetime of PEMFCs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon corrosion; Long-term ageing; Mitigation; PEMFC; Startup and shutdown; Water flooding","Carbon nanofibers; Carbon nanotubes; Corrosion; Electrodes; Floods; Flow fields; Porous materials; Graphitized carbons; Management problems; Mitigation strategy; Normal operations; Operating condition; Performance decay; Porous-media flow; Startup and shutdown process; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099254920

Despite increasing efforts of fire monitoring, it remains challenging to quantify the variability in interannual and seasonal emissions of GHGs and PM from biomass burn-ing. In this study, we investigated the biomass burning emissions in Northeastern China based on fire radiative power (FRP) obtained from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suites (VIIRS) active fires datasets during the period 2012 to 2019. Our results showed that the average annual emissions from biomass burning in Northeastern China during 2012–2019 were: 81.6Tg for CO2, 260.2 Gg for CH4, 5.5 Gg for N2O, 543.2 Gg for PM2.5 and 573.6 Gg for PM10, respectively. Higher levels of GHGs and PM emissions were concentrated in the Songnen Plain and Sanjiang Plain, the main grain producing areas in this region, and were associated with dense fire points. There were two emission peaks observed each year: after harvesting (October to November) and before plant-ing (March to April). During this study period, the total fire emissions initially increased and then decreased in a fluctuating pattern, with emissions peaking in 2015, the year when more emission regulations were introduced. Crop straw was the major source of GHGs and PM among all kinds of biomass burning. Following more stringent controls on burning and the utilization of crop straw, the main burning season changed from autumn to spring. The proportion from spring burning increased from 20.5% in 2013 to 77.1% in 2019, with an annual growth rate of 20%. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of regulatory control in reducing GHGs and PM emissions, as well as satellite fire observations as a powerful means to assess such outcomes. © 2021 by the authors.

In the warm seasons (April–September), O3 pollution (defined as a maximum daily 8-h average O3 mixing ratio that exceeds 75 ppbv) occurred frequently (59%–92% of days) and O3 concentrations significantly increased (especially in July–September) from 2006–2009 to 2018. We applied the Lagrangian photochemical trajectory model, built on the coupling of the Lagrangian backward trajectory model and Master Chemical Mechanism box model, to identify the source regions, key precursors, and emission sectors. The NCP was identified as the major source region with an average contribution of 74% ± 27% to the regional O3 concentrations during the O3 episodes in April–September. Regional O3 formation was highly NOx-sensitive in air masses traveling from the southern part of the NCP but limited by anthropogenic hydrocarbons (especially alkenes) in air masses from the northern part of the NCP. The reduction of emissions from transportation and industry sectors would significantly reduce the regional O3 concentrations. Biomass burning also exerts a significant influence on regional O3 concentrations under certain circumstances. This study demonstrates that the regional background O3 at mountaintop levels is a good indicator of surface O3 pollution over a wide spatial coverage, and provides guidance for regional collaboration on emission control to mitigate photochemical air pollution over the NCP. © 2021.

China has promised a 60%–65% reduction in carbon emissions per unit GDP by 2030, compared to the baseline of 2005. Therefore, it is important to obtain accurate dynamic information on the spatial and temporal patterns of carbon emissions and carbon footprints to support formulating effective national carbon emission reduction policies. This study attempts to build a carbon emission panel data model that simulates carbon emissions in China from 2000–2013 using nighttime lighting data and carbon emission statistics data. By applying the Exploratory Spatial-Temporal Data Analysis (ESTDA) framework, this study conducted an analysis on the spatial patterns and dynamic spatial-temporal interactions of carbon footprints from 2001–2013. The improved Tapio decoupling model was adopted to investigate the levels of coupling or decoupling between the carbon emission load and economic growth in 336 prefecture-level units. The results show that, firstly, high accuracy was achieved by the model in simulating carbon emissions. Secondly, the total carbon footprints and carbon deficits across China increased with average annual growth rates of 4.82% and 5.72%, respectively. The overall carbon footprints and carbon deficits were larger in the North than that in the South. There were extremely significant spatial autocorrelation features in the carbon footprints of prefecture-level units. Thirdly, the relative lengths of the Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) time paths were longer in the North than that in the South, and they increased from the coastal to the central and western regions. Lastly, the overall decoupling index was mainly a weak decoupling type, but the number of cities with this weak decoupling continued to decrease. The unsustainable development trend of China’s economic growth and carbon emission load will continue for some time. © 2021, Science in China Press.","carbon deficit; carbon footprint; decoupling effect; exploratory spatial-temporal data analysis; nighttime lighting data; spatial-temporal interaction characteristics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102104572

Wetlands have the functions of ecological water storage, water supply, and climate regulation, which plays an indispensable role in global environmental security. The Pumqu River Basin (PRB) is located in an area with extremely vulnerable ecological environment, where climate change is obvious. Understanding wetland distribution, changes and causes in the PRB are of great importance to the rational management and protection of wetlands. Using the Landsat series satellite images, wetlands of this area in 2000, 2010, and 2018 were extracted. The results showed that (1) there were obvious regional differences in wetland types and their distribution patterns in the basin. Wetlands were mainly distributed in areas with slopes less than 12◦ and at elevations between 4000 m and 5500 m. (2) During the past 20 years, the wetland area in the basin decreased, and the changing trend of wetlands was different. Palustrine wetlands decreased tremendously, riverine and lacustrine wetlands first decreased and then increased, while floodplain wetlands first increased and then decreased. Palustrine wetlands were reclaimed to cultivated land, but the proportion of reclamation is small. (3) Climate dominated wetland changes in the PRB. The changes in riverine and lacustrine wetlands were mainly affected by the warm-season average temperature, the change in palustrine wetlands was mainly related to the annual precipitation and the warm-season average temperature, and the change in floodplain wetlands was related to the warm-season precipitation.

Although some studies coupled hydrologic models with crop models, there are several hypotheses and unconsidered factors in these studies, such as no irrigation. To improve simulation of discharge, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model was coupled with a crop growth model, incorporating an improved evapotranspiration module based on the soil water stress method. The new evapotranspiration module improved two water stress errors of the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model. Considering the impact of agricultural irrigation and crop rotation, regional crop growth and hydrology were simulated in the upstream watershed of the Qingkou River in the east of China. Results of simulation by the Coupled Hydrology-Crop growth (CHC) model were compared with observed discharge data, measured soil moisture data, and evapotranspiration data obtained from remote sensing inversion. The daily Nash efficiency coefficient was 0.78 for the calibration period from 1978 to 2008 and was 0.76 for the verification period from 2009 to 2016. The simulated soil moisture was found to be significantly correlated with observed soil moisture, better than the simulation by the VIC model alone. The daily efficiency coefficient of the CHC model simulation increased by 0.13 for the verification period compared with that of the VIC model; and the transpiration module of the CHC model had the best simulation accuracy among the VIC, EPIC, and CHC transpiration modules. Combined with observed data, the reason for the water stress error of the EPIC model, reported by some references, was found: A parameter needs to be further adjusted combined with the actual condition instead of being constant. Thus, the coupled hydrology and crop growth model improved the simulation of hydrological elements and can help guide the efficient use of water resources and adjustment of agricultural cropping practices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coupled hydrology and crop growth model; Crop influence; Crop rotation; Improved evapotranspiration module; Irrigation; Soil water stress method; Variable Infiltration Capacity","Agricultural robots; Crops; Efficiency; Environmental protection; Evapotranspiration; Hydrology; Irrigation; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Transpiration; Agricultural irrigation; Calibration periods; Crop growth model; Efficiency coefficient; Efficient use of water; Environmental policy integrated climate models; Simulation accuracy; Variable infiltration capacity models; Climate models; calibration; crop production; discharge; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; soil moisture; soil water; water stress; watershed; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098690412

Compared to the unsubstituted BODIPY parent, SR BODIPYs are much more efficient in generating T1. We have also determined the capability of the SR BODIPYs to yield singlet oxygen O2(1Δg) using two methods: (1) measuring the steady state and time-resolved NIR phosphorescence that peaked at 1270 nm; (2) recording DPBF decomposition caused by the reaction with singlet oxygen. The results show that both thioalkyl and thiophenyl very remarkably increase the quantum yield of singlet oxygen formation up to 0.83 from 0.10. To understand the mechanism, we have studied the related photophysics using steady state and time-resolved fluorescence and UV-vis absorption, as well as quantum chemical calculations based on Density Functional Theory. Both the thioalkyl and thiophenyl remarkably decrease the quantum yield of fluorescence and shorten the fluorescence lifetime of BODIPYs, they also cause the occurrence of a new S1(n,π*) with a slightly lower energy than S1(π,π*). Since intersystem crossing (ISC) from S1(n,π*) to T1(π,π*) is symmetrically allowed, while ISC from S1(π,π*) to T1(π,π*) is symmetrically forbidden, this explains why SR presence renders BODIPY efficient photosensitizer for excited triplet state and singlet oxygen generation. SR induced efficient T1 formation is different from the cases of carbonyl (C=O) or thiocarbonyl (C=S). This finding provides a new method to get efficient heavy atom free photosensitizers, which is important in developing new generation photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy, photochemical up conversion of near IR sunlight in solar cell, and photoredox catalysis. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Density functional theory; Excited states; Fluorescence; Gas generators; Photodynamic therapy; Photolysis; Photophysics; Quantum chemistry; Quantum theory; Quantum yield; Excited triplet state; Fluorescence lifetimes; Laser flash photolysis techniques; Photoredox catalysis; Quantum chemical calculations; Singlet oxygen formation; Singlet oxygen generation; Time-resolved fluorescence; Photosensitizers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103380568

As an emerging technology, small modular reactors (SMRs) are developed to tackle global needs for providing safe, clean, and economic energy. The identification of suitable sites for SMRs, which is a multifaceted process and includes multiple considerations, is a crucial step for their development. In this study, a climate-oriented SMR site recognition (CSSR) approach that reflects the long-term effects of climate change is developed to identify potential sites that are suitable for SMR placement. Specifically, annual mean temperature and annual maximum consecutive 10-day precipitation are considered under two future periods (i.e., 2040–2069 and 2070–2099) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (i.e., 4.5 and 8.5). In addition, economic and social factors, including transmission lines density, highway network density, distance to water bodies, population density and northern municipalities distribution are taken into account. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach, a case study for Saskatchewan, Canada is conducted.

The results are illustrated in contour maps of the speed, acceleration and emission rates and show that CO, HC, NOx and PM emissions differ for the three road types; however, the peak emission points all occur on the provincial road. The average CO, HC, NOx and PM emission factors based on distance for the China II RVs are 9.21, 4.05, 1.68 and 2.58 times higher, respectively, than those of the China III RVs. However, the average NOx emission factors of the China II and III RVs are 2.21 and 1.65 times higher than the corresponding recommended values of national emission inventory guideline, resulting in underestimation of overall RVs’ emissions. Distance-based emission factors of four pollutants ranked from high to low are farm road > rural road > provincial road. In contrast to the average emission factors of the China II RVs on the three road types, those of the China III RVs are significantly less in terms of distance and fuel consumption. The results of other researchers differ from those in this study: the CO emission factor of the China II RVs is 2.12 times higher than that of the China II light-duty diesel vehicles (LDDVs). The PM emission factor of the China III RVs is 2.67 times higher than that of the China III LDDVs.

It has been suggested recently that similarly to temperate and boreal trees, subtropical tree species also show endodormancy and a chilling requirement of endodormancy release. However, there are no previous experimental results on the chilling temperature range that is effective for endodormancy release in subtropical trees. We studied endodormancy and the chilling requirement in four subtropical tree species experimentally. In addition to chilling in natural conditions, we applied controlled chilling at several constant temperatures ranging from -2 to +15 °C. Our results show endodormancy and a chilling requirement in the tree species studied and reveal several differences among the four species in the manifestation and depth of endodormancy. Most importantly, our findings indicate that contrary to the prevailing mainline conception that chilling temperatures are generally restricted to those below +10 °C, higher temperatures of up to +15 °C are also effective for endodormancy release in the subtropical tree species examined. An exact upper threshold of +10.4 °C has been experimentally established for boreal Betula pubescens. We hypothesized that this difference would be explained by differences in the occurrence of low autumn temperatures between the two respective climates. We developed a method for testing the hypothesis by analysing long-term climatic records in relation to the experimental findings. Tentative results supported our hypothesis. On the basis of this novel result, we put forward the testable generalized hypothesis that in any climatic conditions where trees show endodormancy, the range of temperatures physiologically effective in endodormancy release represents the range of typical autumn air temperatures occurring in those particular climatic conditions. © 2020","Bud burst; chilling requirement; climatic variation; endodormancy; flowering; leafout; subtropical trees; tree phenology","climate change; climate effect; cold tolerance; dormancy; high temperature; hypothesis testing; phenology; subtropical region; temperate forest; testing method; Betula pubescens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098873815

In this work, we perform ray-tracing simulations on radio wave transport in the corona and interplanetary region with anisotropic electron density fluctuations. For the first time, the variation of the apparent source size, burst duration, and source position for the fundamental emission and harmonic emission at the frequency of 35 MHz are simulated as a function of the anisotropic parameter α and the angular scattering rate coefficient η = 2/h 0, where 2 = δ n 2/n 2 is the density fluctuation level and h 0 is its correlation length near the wave excitation site. It is found that isotropic fluctuations produce a much larger decay time than a highly anisotropic fluctuation for fundamental emission. By comparing the observed duration and source size with the simulation results in the parameter space, we can estimate the scattering coefficient and the anisotropic parameter η = 8.9 10-5 km-1 and α = 0.719 with a point pulse source assumption. Position offsets due to wave scattering and refraction can produce the co-spatial of the fundamental and harmonic waves in the observation of some type III radio bursts. The visual speed due to the wave propagation effect can reach 1.5c for η = 2.4 10-4 km-1 and α = 0.2 for the fundamental emission in the sky plane, accompanied with large expansion rate of the source size. The direction of the visual speed is mostly identical to the direction of the offset, thus, for the observation aimed at obtaining the source position, the source centroid at the starting time is closer to the wave excitation site. © 2021.

The article empirically examines these theoretical hypotheses using a panel data set of sulfur dioxide emission reduction targets and GDP growth goals across Chinese provinces. The statistical findings support these arguments and help elucidate the “black box” of decision-making in the public sector. Evidence for Practice: High pollutant emission reduction pressure can lower provincial leaders' expectations of economic growth in China.

To investigate the impacts of this lockdown measure on air quality in India, we used the Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to estimate the changes of key air pollutants. From pre-lockdown to lockdown periods, improved air quality is observed in India, indicated by the lower key pollutant levels such as PM 2.5 (-26 %), maximum daily 8 h average ozone (MDA8 O3) (-11 %), NO2 (-50 %), and SO2 (-14 %). In addition, changes in these pollutants show distinct spatial variations with the more important decrease in northern and western India. During the lockdown, our results illustrate that such emission reductions play a positive role in the improvement of air quality. Significant reductions of PM2.5 concentration and its major components are predicted, especially for secondary inorganic aerosols that are up to 92 %, 57 %, and 79 % for nitrate (NO-3), sulfate (SO2 4-), and ammonium (NHC 4), respectively. On average, the MDA8 O3 also decreases 15 % during the lockdown period although it increases slightly in some VOC-limited urban locations, which is mainly due to the more significant reduction of NOx than VOCs. More aggressive and localized emission control strategies should be implemented in India to mitigate air pollution in the future. © Author(s) 2021.

This study explores historical snowfall records since the 1960s at 62 meteorological stations in Heilongjiang Province, and examines the snowfall responses in this most northerly high-latitude snow zone of China. Results confirm a significant increase of annual average temperature with a turn-over year in 1987, representing a shift of a cooler to warmer climate. Our study reports five most sensitive snowfall indicators of the warmer climate: snow intensity, snow phenology (first snow day, last snow day, snow season) and light snow days, all revealing significant trends and strong relationships with annual temperature. Their turn-over years responded rapidly after 1987. Overall, the study area has experienced significantly delayed first snow, advanced last snow and a shorter snow season; snowfall intensity has become stronger accompanying the decreased light snow days. Total snow amount and extreme snow events (blizzard and heavy snow) are found not sensitive indicators of a warmer climate; other influences such as atmospheric circulation may have played a role in their significant increase in the study period. Light snow is the predominant snow class of the study area. Its decreased snow days may negatively impact snow water availability of this important agricultural region of China. © 2020 The Author(s)","Global warming; High-latitude region; Sensitive indicator; Snowfall; Snowfall response","Agricultural robots; Global warming; Storms; Annual temperatures; Atmospheric circulation; Climate warming; Global distribution; High Latitudes; Meteorological station; Sensitive indicator; Snowfall intensity; Snow; agricultural land; atmospheric circulation; global warming; phenology; snow; water availability; China; Heilongjiang; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098460020

Understanding vehicular emission characteristics for the purpose of targeted control measures is critically important for improving efficient use of fossil energy and promoting sustainable development of global ambient environment. There have been many studies on vehicle emissions in cities of a level terrain (i.e., road grade within 2%), while there is currently very limited research effort in studying vehicle emissions in mountainous terrains. In China, mountains, plateaus, and hilly areas account for 69% of the total land area. To fill that knowledge gap, this study performed real-world emission measurements on a busy mountainous road in a Chinese city, Fuzhou, using both light-duty gasoline and medium-duty diesel vehicles equipped with a Portable Emissions Measurement System. Instantaneous second-by-second CO, NOx, and HC emissions, vehicle speed, and location data were recorded simultaneously. There are several major findings and policy implications from the study. First, per kilometer emissions from the medium-duty diesel vehicles are orders of magnitude higher than the light-duty gasoline vehicles, and therefore vehicle emission control policy must emphasize on medium-duty diesel vehicles to achieve greater reduction. Second, the effects of speed and acceleration, separate or joint, on per kilometer emissions are nonlinear and differ between the light-duty gasoline and the medium-duty diesel vehicles in the mountainous road. Third, moderate upgrade, acceleration, and moderately high speed are found to be associated with high per kilometer emissions in mountainous roads. Conservative driving behavior associated with steep uphill actually results in slightly reduced per kilometer emissions from those with moderate uphill driving. Fourth, with the Chinese national vehicle emission standards become more stringent, there is a lag in the vehicular emissions control technology development and regulations for NOx and HC as compared to CO in China. And lastly, per kilometer emissions of light-duty gasoline vehicles are more sensitive to vehicle specific power than those of medium-duty diesel vehicles. And the current MOVES operating mode definition by vehicle specific power is not adequate for medium-duty diesel vehicle emissions in mountainous roads. Thus, a modified operating mode definition is proposed. The study findings will provide important scientific basis for developing a China-specific mountainous emissions model and vehicle emission control policies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; Mountainous road; Operating mode; Portable emissions measurement system; Vehicle specific power","Air quality; Diesel engines; Diesel locomotives; Emission control; Gasoline; Nitrogen oxides; Public policy; Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Sustainable development; Ambient air pollution; Ambient environment; Increasing production; Light duty gasoline vehicles; Mountainous terrain; Orders of magnitude; Portable emissions measurement systems; Vehicle specific power; Light weight vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095786134

The biggest difference between this paper and the existing literature is that this paper does not assume that the information shock is a white noise process but that the information shock comes from the news. This study does not use fiscal expenditure budget data and fiscal expenditure final data to estimate information friction but rather extends the standard Fève and Pietrunti (2016) theoretical framework to identify effective information and noise signals from market policy news by machine learning. A latent Dirichlet allocation model is employed to estimate the variance of effective information. China's carbon policy uncertainty as indicated by Chinese-language newspapers is used to estimate the variance of the noise signal. Therefore, we can calculate time-varying high-frequency information friction. The results of this study show that enterprises with different attributes in the same industry face different information friction. In China, state-owned industrial enterprises have the lowest levels of information friction. Joint-stock industrial enterprises have the highest levels of information friction. The higher the degree of policy information friction, the weaker the impact of effective information shocks and the greater the reduction in policy effects. These results have policy implications – the government should pay attention to enterprise attributes to reduce policy uncertainty and the degree of policy information friction, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of policy regulation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","DSGE model; Information frictions; Machine learning; News","Budget control; Carbon; Commerce; Public policy; Statistics; Uncertainty analysis; White noise; Dynamic measurement; Fiscal expenditures; High-frequency informations; Industrial enterprise; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Policy implications; Theoretical framework; White noise process; Friction; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental policy; machine learning; pollution tax; state owned enterprise; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096190076

Nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and three nitro-PAHs (NPAHs) in PM2.5 were detected via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The PAHs concentration in summer and winter decreased from 6.37 ± 1.30 ng/m3 and 96.9 ± 69.9 ng/m3 to 4.89 ± 2.67 ng/m3 and 49.8 ± 43.4 ng/m3 from 2015 to 2017. NPAHs decreased in winter (from 1707 ± 708 pg/m3 to 1192 ± 1113 pg/m3), but increased in summer from 2015 (336 ± 77.2 pg/m3) to 2017 (456 ± 312 pg/m3). Diagnostic ratios of PAHs indicated that petroleum combustion was the main emission source in summer, and pollutants originating from the combustion of petroleum, coal and biomass dominated in winter. The 2-nitrofluoranthene (2-NFR)/2-nitropyrene (2-NP) ratio in this study demonstrated that the OH radical pathway was the main pathway for the formation of 2-NP and 2-NFR. The mean total benzo[a]pyrene-equivalent concentrations (BaPeq) and incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) values decreased from 2013 to 2017. The high value of total BaPeq in the winter of 2017 in Xinxiang revealed that a high-risk of cancer remained for residents. The results of this study demonstrate that the decreases in PAHs and NPAHS concentrations from 2015 to 2017.

However, its role in tackling climate change remains ambiguous as there exist considerable differences in the outcomes of limited studies. A vast diversity in spatial planning factors, along with the indirectness and complexity in the influencing mechanism, can be possible reasons behind this uncertainty. In order to clarify the effect of the spatial planning factors and analyze their mechanisms, we systematically reviewed the literature on this topic from the year 2005 to 2020. Based on the articles reviewed, we identified seven major factors that affect CO2 emissions from different spatial planning levels. Additionally, we decompose the interrelationships among the causal factors and propose models of the direct and indirect effects of each factor on the CO2 emissions. Further, we summarized the mode of influence of each factor in different CO2 emission sectors, clarified the dissimilar results between studies, and analyzed the key reasons that led to the ambiguity to have a robust understanding. We also propose specific planning suggestions to control CO2 emissions, outline a future direction for the overall multi-factor composite research and put forward approaches to optimize the research method. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Built environment; CO2 emission; Land use; Literature review; Spatial planning; Urban form",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101542995

Although bioremediation of PAHs under denitrification is considered a promising approach, denitrification was an important contributor to N2O and NO emissions. This long-term study confirmed for the first time that microorganisms could utilize NO to efficiently degrade phenanthrene and fluoranthene. When the two systems of NO-dependent phenanthrene and fluoranthene degradation were stable, the first-order rate constants of phenanthrene and fluoranthene in the two systems (0.1940 and 0.0825 day−1, respectively) were close to those values (0.2290 and 0.1085 day−1, respectively) observed at nitrate-reducing conditions. Further analysis of functional genes revealed that phenanthrene and fluoranthene might be degraded under the combined action of the anaerobic pathway mediated by NO reduction and intra-aerobic pathway mediated by NO dismutation. The genomic analysis showed that Nod genes had high diversity and most of them were similar to aquifer cluster group in the two systems.

They are affected by various environmental parameters, such as salinity. Although the spatiotemporal distribution and dynamics of virioplankton have been extensively studied in saline environments, few detailed studies of community structure and function of viruses along salinity gradients have been conducted. Here, we used the 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic sequencing from a subtropical estuary (Pearl River Estuary, PRE; located in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China) to explore how viral community composition and function vary along a salinity gradient. Results showed that the detected viruses were mainly bacteriophages. The double-stranded DNA viruses were the most abundant (especially Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, Mimiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, and Podoviridae), followed by a small number of single-stranded DNA (Circoviridae) and RNA (Retroviridae) viruses. Viral biodiversity significantly declined and community structure varied greatly along the salinity gradient. The salinity, ammonium and dissolved oxygen were dominated factors influencing the community composition of viruses. Association network analysis showed that viruses had a negative effect on multiple host taxa (prokaryotic and eukaryotic species). Metagenomic data revealed that the main viral functional potential was involved in organic matter metabolism by carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). Deeper comparative functional analyses showed that viruses in the low-salinity environment had more carbohydrate-binding module and glycosidase hydrolases activities than those under high-salinity conditions. However, an opposite pattern was observed for carbohydrate esterases. These results suggest that virus-encoded CAZyme genes may alter the bacterial metabolism in estuaries. Overall, our results demonstrate that there is a spatial heterogeneity in the composition and function of virioplankton along a salinity gradient. This study enhances our understanding of viral distribution and their contribution to regulating carbon degradation throughout environments with varying salinities in subtropical estuaries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon degradation; CAZyme activities; Pearl River estuary; Salinity; Viral traits","Bacteriophages; Biodiversity; Biogeochemistry; Carbohydrates; Dissolved oxygen; DNA; Enzymes; Estuaries; Genes; Metabolism; RNA; Tropics; Biogeochemical cycling; Carbohydrate binding modules; Carbohydrate esterase; Community composition; Environmental parameter; Shenzhen , Guangdong Province; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatiotemporal distributions; Computer viruses; organic matter; RNA 16S; RNA 18S; biogeochemical cycle; community structure; DNA; enzyme activity; metabolism; microbial community; plankton; salinity; amplicon; Article; bacterial metabolism; bacteriophage; carbon cycling; Circoviridae; community structure; controlled study; environmental factor; environmental impact; estuary; genome analysis; geographic distribution; microbial diversity; Mimiviridae; Myoviridae; nonhuman; Phycodnaviridae; physical chemistry; plankton; Podoviridae; population abundance; priority journal; Retroviridae; salinity; Siphoviridae; species composition; virioplankton; virus cell interaction; virus detection; virus genome; biodiversity; China; river; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Estuary; Bacteria (microorganisms); Circoviridae; DNA viruses; Eukaryota; Myoviridae; Phycodnaviridae; Podoviridae; Prokaryota; Retroviridae; Siphoviridae; Biodiversity; China; Estuaries; Rivers; Salinity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096401743

In this study, we analyzed the temporal and spatial trend of precipitation and the characteristics of LUCC on the QTP. Meanwhile, we also used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as an indicator of LUCC to discuss the relationship between LUCC and precipitation. The results show the following: (1) Annual precipitation showed a fluctuant upward trend at a rate of 11.5 mm/decade in this area from 1967 to 2016; three periods (i.e., 22 years, 12 years, and 2 years) of oscillations in annual precipitation were observed, in which expectant 22 years is the main oscillation period. It was predicted that QTP will still be in the stage of increasing precipitation. (2) The LUCC of the plateau changed apparently from 1980 to 2018. The area of grassland decreased by 9.47%, and the area of unused land increased by 7.25%. From the perspective of spatial distribution, the transfer of grassland to unused land occurred in the western part of the QTP, while the reverse transfer was mainly distributed in the northwestern part of the QTP. (3) NDVI in the northern and southwestern parts of the QTP is positively correlated with precipitation, while negative correlations are mainly distributed in the southeast of the QTP, including parts of Sichuan and Yunnan Province. Our results show that precipitation in the QTP has shown a fluctuating growth trend in recent years, and precipitation and NDVI are mainly positively correlated. Furthermore, we hope that this work can provide a theoretical basis for predicting regional hydrology, climate change, and LUCC research. © 2021 by the authors.

In the current study, the interannual-decadal variation in the Bohai Sea's surface Chl-a concentration and the underlying dynamics are investigated based on 16 years (August 2002–February 2019) of satellite ocean colour observations. The Chl-a concentration shows a spatially coherent increasing trend from 2003 to 2011 and a decreasing trend from 2012 to 2018 in both the Bohai and North Yellow Seas. Both decadal trends are clearer in the Bohai Sea than in the Yellow Sea and in coastal waters than in offshore waters. The decreasing trend is more obvious than the increasing trend. The low-frequency variations are mainly controlled by sea surface temperature (SST) and rainfall variations and eventually related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). During positive PDO phases, warm SST anomalies exist in the Bohai and Yellow Seas and negative rainfall anomalies exist over the sea and surrounding lands. These anomalies would decrease the surface layer dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration through suppressing the upward turbulent nutrient diffusion and reducing land-sourced nutrient fluxes into the ocean, leading to negative Chl-a concentration anomalies. During negative PDO phases, the opposite situation occurs. Human activities may make a secondary contribution through enhancing/reducing the anthropogenic nitrogen emission before/after 2011. This study emphasizes the natural climate variability in modulating low-frequency variations in surface Chl-a concentrations in the Bohai and Yellow Seas in recent decades and is useful for marine resource planning and marine ecological management in the Bohai Sea in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropogenic nitrogen emission; Bohai Sea; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Interannual-decadal variation; Pacific decadal oscillation","Chlorophyll; Ecosystems; Marine biology; Nutrients; Offshore oil well production; Rain; Surface waters; Dissolved inorganic nitrogens; Ecological managements; Low-frequency variations; Natural climate variabilities; Pacific decadal oscillation; Satellite ocean colour observation; Sea surface temperature (SST); Surface chlorophyll; Oceanography; annual variation; chlorophyll a; coastal water; concentration (composition); decadal variation; dissolved inorganic nitrogen; human activity; nutrient dynamics; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; rainfall; satellite altimetry; sea surface temperature; temporal analysis; Bohai Sea; Pacific Ocean; Yellow Sea; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098452221

China, as the early epicenter of the pandemic, locked down one-third of its cities in an attempt to prevent the rapid spread of the virus. Human migration patterns have subsequently been radically altered and many regions have seen perceived improvements in air quality during the lockdowns. This study empirically examines the relationship between human migration and air pollution and further evaluates the causal impacts of the lockdowns. A spatial econometric method and a spatial explicit counterfactual framework are employed in this study. The key findings are as follows: i) a considerable amount of variation in AQI, PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 concentration can be explained by human migration but we fail to find suggestive evidence in the cases of SO2 and CO; ii) the implementation of lockdown measures led to a significant reduction in AQI (18.1%), PM2.5 (22.2%), NO2 (20.5%), and PM10 (10.7%), but has no meaningful impacts on SO2, CO and O3 levels; iii) further analysis indicates that the impacts of lockdown policies varied by control stringency and by regional heterogeneity.

The catalysts were prepared by wet ion-exchange (IE), impregnation (IM) and solid state ion-exchange (SSIE) methods. These catalysts were characterized by XRD, UV–vis DR spectroscopy, H2-TPR, TPD and in-situ DRIFTS. At 350 °C, more than 90% N2O conversion could be obtained over the Fe-beta-IE catalyst. The activity for N2O removal of Fe-beta-IE was higher than Fe-beta-IM and Fe-beta-SSIE catalysts. The UV–vis spectra showed that 84.2% of isolated Fe(III) ion appeared on Fe-beta-IE catalyst. It indicated that the isolated Fe(III) ions might be considered as the active sites for N2O reduction. Besides, in the presence of H2O, the activities in CO-SCR for N2O removal over Fe-beta catalysts were inhibited, which might be due to the hydroxylation deactivation of iron species and excess accumulation of carbonates.

A literature search for peer-reviewed, English language, literature published since the pandemic emerged was conducted using Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library. The final sample yielded a total of 22 commentaries, editorials, discussion papers, and a research study that explicitly addressed the intersection of COVID-19 and climate change. Sixty articles emerged in the initial review of the intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change with the final yield of 22 articles deemed valid for inclusion after full text review. With the emergence of COVID-19 and scholarly discourse that addresses the intersection of the pandemic with climate change, key issues emerged that intersect with policy /advocacy, social justice, and nursing's public health role in clinical practice, education, policy/advocacy, and research/scholarship. Five themes that emerged included the role of public health in COVID-19 and climate change efforts; global approach addressing human-environment issues; intersection of COVID-19 and climate change from a community and global perspective; impacts of COVID-19, climate change and the environment and professional associations and specialty organizations’ views and responsibilities with a lens on COVID-19 and climate change. Despite the importance of addressing racial inequities as well as systemic and structural racism that impacts those most affected by climate change and pandemics such as COVID-19, no literature addressed this topic.

The AD of OFMSW has received considerable attention due to its significant energy and nutrient recovery as well as its greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential. AD is a biological process involving treating and stabilising organic matter in the absence of oxygen accomplished by a consortium of microorganisms and occurs under hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis phases. The hydrolysis phase is recognised as the primary rate-limiting step. Thus, exploring the ways to speed up the hydrolysis process will maximise biogas production. The key factors affecting the digestion efficiency include feedstock quality, pre-treatment process, design and selection of digestion process and process conditions including pH, temperature, carbon to nitrogen (C: N) ratio, organic loading rate and hydraulic retention time. The review reveals that solid-state anaerobic digestion (SSAD) is best suited for OFMSW due to its high solid concentration (>15%) and better process performance. The continuous digestion with thermophilic temperatures was found to be the best condition for high solid AD process. The plug flow and continuous stir tank reactors were the best performing options to control the biological conditions for the digestate post-treatment.

The process consisted of an extended anaerobic period (180 min) followed by a low DO (0.3 ± 0.05 mg/L) simultaneous nitrification-denitrifying phosphorus removal. The reactor was operated within a wide range of COD/N ratio (5–10) without any volatile fatty acids (VFA) supplementation. N and P removal efficiencies were as high as 91% and 96%, respectively. The process was efficient even at a very low COD /N ratio of 5, with N and P removal efficiencies of 70% and 90%, respectively. The N and P removal efficiencies improved to more than 90% at a COD/N ratio 8. It was found that the initial filtered flocculated COD (ffCOD)/[total oxidized Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKNoxidized) + NOx-Nintitial] ratio in the reactor played a significant role in the process efficiency. It was observed that N-removal efficiency decreased with a decrease of [ffCODinitial/ (TKNoxidized + NOx-Ninitial)] ratio even at high COD/N ratio of 10. Simultaneous nitrification denitrification (SND) efficiencies varied between 60%–88% depending on the influent COD/N ratio and [ffCODinitial/ (TKNoxidized + NOx-Ninitial)] ratio in the reactor. Cyclic studies showed a distinct two step phosphorus release in the extended anaerobic period in contrast to the more conventional single step phosphorus release. During the aerobic period, low DO favored denitrifying P-removal without significant accumulation of NO3-N, and NO2-N until all endogenous carbon was consumed. Denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms (DPAOs) played a vital role in simultaneous denitrification and phosphorus removal. Aerobic and anoxic P-removal represented about 55% and 45% of the overall phosphorus removal, respectively. Cycle tests showed that DPAOs have a competitive advantage over NOB for nitrite consumption at low DO. The process was found to be carbon efficient as evidenced by the COD/NOx-N ratio of 4.2 for denitrification. Compared to traditional enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) coupled with exogenous denitrification, this process reduces carbon and oxygen demand for combined N and P removal from municipal wastewater by about 45%, and 35% respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon deficient municipal wastewater; Denitrifying phosphorus accumulating microorganisms; Low aeration demand; Simultaneous N and P removal","Activated sludge process; Anoxic water; Batch reactors; Biological water treatment; Carbon; Competition; Denitrification; Efficiency; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Phosphorus; Volatile fatty acids; Wastewater treatment; Competitive advantage; Denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms; Denitrifying phosphorus removal; Enhanced biological phosphorus removal; Municipal wastewaters; Process efficiency; Sequencing batch reactors; Simultaneous nitrification denitrifications; Chemicals removal (water treatment); carbon; nitrite; nitrogen; phosphorus; carbon; activated sludge; aeration; denitrification; dissolved oxygen; nitrification; nitrifying bacterium; phosphorus; wastewater treatment; Article; clinical effectiveness; denitrification; denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organism; enhanced biological phosphorus removal; municipal wastewater; nitrification; oxygen consumption; polyphosphate accumulating organism; priority journal; simultaneous nitrification denitrifying phosphorus removal; waste water management; bioreactor; denitrification; sewage; wastewater; Bioreactors; Carbon; Denitrification; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096443096

Random distribution of vegetable waste can increase the risk of non-point agricultural pollution and explore the feasibility of its resource utilization. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of different doses of exogenous microbial agents on soil microbial communities after in situ composting of cucumber straw on plots with biodegradable mulch films. The cucumber straw and chicken manure were used as the base materials, and the next generation sequencing was used to analyze changes in the microbiome following composting. The results demonstrate that the addition of exogenous microbial agents had prolonged the high-temperature duration, reduced the total organic carbon (TOC) content, and accelerated the decline in the C/N ratio, ensuring compost maturity and effectively shortening the composting time. The predominant bacterial phyla of the four treatment groups were Proteobacteria and Firmicutes; while among fungal phyla, these treatments decreased the relative abundance of Ascomycota. The treatment of 300 t/ha microbial agents significantly increased the richness and diversity of both the bacterial and fungal communities. Redundancy analysis suggested that soil total nitrogen (TN) content had a significant effect on the bacterial community, while TN content, pH, and temperature influenced the fungal community in these samples. Collectively, the treatment of 300 t/ha exogenous microbial agents improved the quality of composting and promoted microbiome diversity. © 2021 by the authors.

The results show that S2 reduces 10.6% carbon emission than S1, mainly owing to higher heat value of incineration feedstock and higher yield of electricity. In addition, the cumulative energy demands of S1 and S2 are − 6290 and − 6544 MJ/t MSW, and their energy efficiencies are 67.4 and 70.3%, respectively. Moreover, RFW separation reduces acidic gases emission due to the substitution effect of more energy products.

Improving crop water use efficiency (WUE) will help to safeguard the environmental sustainability of food production in dryland areas. However, the impact of drought on crop WUE varies—a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of relevant factors is needed to support evidence-based management decisions. Here, we used a meta-analysis of global drylands (81 studies with 836 paired observations) to evaluate the response of various crop WUEs to drought based on various natural and human induced factors. Our results showed that responses of crop types’ WUE varied under drought intensity, which probably a reference for crop selection in drylands. Cotton could be one of crop selection reference in hyper-arid or arid regions, and legume is not recommended for drylands without irrigation. Cereal crop are suitable for growing in semi-arid or dry sub-humid areas. Moreover, soil improvement and fertilizer management are the effective methods to alleviate drought stress, in addition to irrigation. Soil with medium-texture, 1.3–1.4 g cm−3 bulk density and 15–20 g kg−1 organic matter is beneficial for improving WUE under drought. Fertilizer should be carefully considered and not exceed 200 kg ha−1 for wheat in drylands. Water deficit can improve crop WUE, but should not exceed 40% of the full irrigation amount. Field management practices, such as mulching and weed control, can help alleviate drought by regulating WUE to some extent. This study evaluated the responses of various crop WUEs to drought and highlighted the factors contributing to and/or decreasing crop WUE from natural factor and management practices, which provides a basis for agricultural drought mitigation strategies under future climate change in dryland areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Crop selection; Dryland agriculture; Irrigation; Water productivity; Yield","Agricultural robots; Crops; Drought; Efficiency; Factor analysis; Fertilizers; Irrigation; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Textures; Water conservation; Water resources; Weed control; Agricultural drought; Agricultural water use; Drought intensities; Environmental sustainability; Evidence-based managements; Fertilizer management; Global climate changes; Management practices; Climate change; climate change; drought stress; dryland farming; global climate; management practice; meta-analysis; semiarid region; soil improvement; sustainability; water availability; water resource; water stress; water use efficiency; Fabaceae; Gossypium hirsutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100173392

Currently, in production are used varieties of domestic and foreign selection. Along with the yield, the products obtained are of great importance, according to which the intended purpose of a particular variety is determined. The study of the quality indicators of potato tubers is an integral part of the development of varietal cultivation technology. The purpose of the research is to study the qualitative indicators of potato tubers of the Gala variety at different plant densities and the use of fungicides in the Middle Urals. The research was carried out in 2018-2019 on the experimental field of the educational and experimental farm of the Ural State Agrarian University. The object of research is a medium-early high-yielding potato variety Gala. When conducting biochemical and agrochemical studies, gravimetric, extraction, ebuliostatic, ionometric and photometric methods were used. The electrical conductivity of tubers was determined with a conduct meter in mSm, the concentration of cell juice with a refract meter in %, nitrates in tubers - with a nitrate tester in mg/kg, the acidity (pH) of tubers - with a pH meter. The research results showed that the concentration of potato tubers cell juice decreases from 7.0 to 2.65% with an increase in the feeding area from 1400 to 2800 cm2. The use of fungicides shirlan and infinito reduces the electrical conductivity. The specific weight of potato tubers increases with an increase in the feeding area from 0.92 to 1.16 grams. The nitrate content decreased with an increase in the feeding area and the use of fungicides from 340 to 326 mg/kg. During the growing period, the content of carbon dioxide (CO2) of the potato plant in the control variant was 775, and with the use of shirlan it was 1043, which is an increase of 1.5 times. The scientific novelty lies in the fact that for the first time in the conditions of the Middle Urals, an assessment of tubers was carried out according to physiological, agrophysical and agrochemical indicators with new devices during the periods of storage of tubers (April) and vegetation of potato plants, depending on the feeding area and the use of fungicides. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Cultivation; Economic and social effects; Electric conductivity; Feeding; Food storage; Fungicides; Industrial robots; Nitrates; Vegetation; Agricultural crops; Content of carbon dioxide; Electrical conductivity; Nitrate contents; Photometric method; Potato varieties; Quality indicators; Research results; Tubes (components)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103816283

In the case of Colombia, the role of biomass has been tackled through qualitative roadmaps and regional climate policy assessments. However, neither of these approaches has addressed the complexity of the bio-based economy systematically in the wider context of emission mitigation and energy and chemicals supply. In response to this limitation, we extended a bottom-up energy system optimization model by adding a comprehensive database of novel bio-based value chains. We included advanced road and aviation biofuels, (bio)chemicals, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and integrated biorefinery configurations. A scenario analysis was conducted for the period 2015–2050, which reflected uncertainties in the capacity for technological learning, climate policy ambitions, and land availability for energy crops. Our results indicate that biomass can play an important, even if variable, role in supplying 315–760 PJ/y of modern bio-based products. In pursuit of a deep decarbonization trajectory, the large-scale mobilization of biomass resources can reduce the cost of the energy system by up to 11 billion $/year, the marginal abatement cost by 62%, and the potential reliance on imports of oil and chemicals in the future. The mitigation potential of BECCS can reach 24–29% of the cumulative avoided emissions between 2015 and 2050.

To optimize design accuracy and thermal performance, significant design factors of HSGHEs should be identified. Thus, this study investigates the effects of influential factors on the thermal performance of HSGHEs through sensitivity analysis. Numerical models were established with respect to the operation of HSGHEs using the finite element method. Variance-based sensitivity analysis was conducted using the numerical results to quantitatively evaluate the overall effects, which include the main effects as well as interaction effects between the design factors. Furthermore, case studies of two different regions were applied to the sensitivity analysis to compare the effects of regional climate factors on the order of significance of the input factors. As a result, ground thermal conductivity, installation depth, and inlet fluid temperature were determined as major design factors. On the other hand, the order of significance of the major factors was found to be dependent on regional climate factors. This result implies that it is necessary to consider different critical factors of HSGHE design according to the ambient conditions of the installation region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ground-coupled heat pump system; Horizontal ground heat exchanger; Sensitivity analysis","Geothermal heat pumps; Numerical methods; Sensitivity analysis; Thermal conductivity; Ambient conditions; Ground heat exchangers; Ground thermal conductivity; Ground-coupled heat pump systems; Influential factors; Performance factors; Thermal Performance; Variance-based sensitivity analysis; Factor analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097710802

We estimated the effect of health behaviors against air pollution on reducing the risk of COVID‐19 during the initial phase of the pandemic. The attack rates of COVID‐19 in 159 mainland Chinese cities during the first 2 weeks after the closure of major cities was estimated; air pollution level as a surrogate indicator of the mask‐wearing rate. Data on air pollution levels and meteorologic factors 2 weeks prior to the closure were obtained. The attack rate was compared with the level of air pollution using a generalized linear model after adjusting for confounders. When fine particulates (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels increased by one unit of air quality index (AQI), the infection risk decreased by 0.7% and 3.4%, respectively. When PM2.5 levels exceeded 150 (level 4), the infection risk decreased (relative risk, RR = 0.635, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.442 to 0.912 for level 4; RR = 0.529, 95% CI: 0.337 to 0.830 for level 5; respectively). After controlling for the number of high-speed railway routes, when PM2.5 and NO2 levels increased by one AQI, relative risk for PM2.5 and NO2 was 0.990 (95% CI, 0.984 to 0.997) and 0.946 (95% CI, 0.911 to 0.982), respectively, demonstrating a consistently negative association. It is postulated that, during the early phase of the pandemic, the cities with higher air pollution levels may represent the higher practice of mask‐wearing to protect from air pollution, which could have acted as a barrier to the transmission of the virus. This study highlights the importance of health behaviors, including mask‐wearing for preventing infections. © 2021 by the authors.

We compared the physicochemical properties of CaO-based sorbents, which could change depending on their preparation methods, and determined that the CaO particle size was the most critical factor that affected their CO2 sorption performance. The CO2 sorption performance of CaO-based sorbents could be maximized via the simple physical reduction of their particle size, and this was experimentally demonstrated using ball-milling. The CO2 sorption uptake of CaO prepared using the conventional solid-state method was significantly increased to the highest ever reported level after ball-milling, and it reached 98.0% of the theoretical maximum CO2 sorption capacity. The most important application of the particle-size-dependency of CaO-based sorbents on their CO2 sorption uptake is the reactivation of used sorbents via reducing the size of the aggregated or sintered bulky particles that form after cyclic usage. The CO2 sorption uptake of the used CaO (~32.9 wt% after 10 alternative sorption–regeneration cycles) was successfully recovered (almost doubled) to ~64.7 wt% after ball-milling.

Especially with rapid development and urbanization, widespread wastewater treatment plants in watersheds have altered the amounts and proportions of riverine nutrients and organic carbon, which has strongly impacted carbon dynamics and budgets in coastal oceans. In this study, a well-validated carbon cycle model was used to reveal the response of carbon dynamics to reasonable estimated disturbance to riverine inputs (i.e., nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC)) in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE). Scenario results demonstrate the distinct response patterns and spatial variability of carbon dynamics. Specifically, with phytoplankton blooms and biological production closely linked to riverine nutrients, riverine nutrient alterations mainly impact photosynthesis in the PRE, especially in the lower part of the PRE. As DOC fuels bacterial respiration in the water column, heterotrophic respiration is particularly sensitive to riverine DOC disturbances. POC not only relates to light penetration in turbid estuarine waters, which impacts photosynthesis, but also undergoes deposition, which affects the biochemical reactions in the sediment. Thus, perturbations to riverine POC input led to significant changes in both biological production and sediment dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) release. Multiple linear regression results reveal that both net community production and sediment DIC release flux modulate the variations of air-sea CO2 flux in the PRE, which highlights the roles of terrestrial POC input and deposition in a shallow estuary. When delivered into the PRE, a high proportion of POC tends to be deposited and contribute to sediment DIC release or carbon sequestration, while a significant fraction of riverine DOC is transported offshore to shelf regions. This study underscores the impacts of intensive human activities on carbon cycle system in coastal oceans and the importance of terrestrial organic carbon reduction and nutrient control in upstream basins. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air-sea CO2 flux (ASF); Carbon dynamics; Estuarine carbon export; Numerical model; Wastewater treatment rate","Budget control; Deposition; Dynamics; Estuaries; Linear regression; Nutrients; Offshore oil well production; Photosynthesis; Sediments; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Biochemical reactions; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Dissolved organic carbon; Heterotrophic respiration; Multiple linear regressions; Net community productions; Particulate organic carbon; Wastewater treatment plants; Organic carbon; biological production; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; dissolved inorganic carbon; dissolved organic carbon; human activity; regression analysis; urban development; urbanization; wastewater treatment plant; watershed; Zhujiang Estuary; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097739821

The relation between CO2 concentrations and surface air temperature (SAT) has been found related to Rossby waves based on a multi-layer complex network approach. However, the significant relations between CO2 and SAT occur in the South Hemisphere that is not that much influenced by human activities may offer not enough information to formulate targeted carbon reduction policies. Here, we address it by removing the effects of the Rossby waves to reconstruct CO2 concentrations and SAT multi-layer complex network. We uncover that the CO2 concentrations are strongly associated with the surrounding SAT regions. The influential regions of CO2 on SAT occur over eastern Asia, West Asia, North Africa, the coast of North American, and Western Europe. It is shown that CO2 over Siberia in phase with the SAT variability in eastern East Asia. Indeed, CO2 concentration variability is causing effects on the recent warming of SAT in some middle latitude regions. Furthermore, sensitive parameters that CO2 impacts SAT of top 15 carbon emissions countries have been identified. These countries are significantly responsible for global warming, giving implications for carbon emissions reductions. The methodology and results presented here not only facilitate further research in regions of increased sensitivity to the warming resulting from CO2 concentrations but also can formulate strategies and countermeasures for carbon emission and carbon reduction. © 2021 Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101957098

The daily mesopause temperatures are estimated using ambipolar diffusion coefficient data from the meteor radars at Davis Station (68.6°S, 77.9°E), in Antarctica, Svalbard (78.3°N, 16°E), Tromsø (69.6°N, 19.2°E) in the Arctic, and Mohe (53.5°N, 122.3°E) and Beijing (40.3°N, 116.2°E) in the northern middle latitudes. The seasonal variations in the meteor radar-derived temperatures are in good agreement with the temperatures from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument onboard the TIMED satellite. Interhemispheric observations indicate that the mesopause temperatures over the southern and northern polar regions show a clear seasonal asymmetry. The seasonal variations in the Davis Station meteor radar temperatures in the southern polar mesopause are dominated by an annual oscillation (AO) with a relatively weak semiannual oscillation (SAO), which show a clear minimum during summer and a maximum during winter. The mesopause temperatures in the northern high and middle latitudes observed by the Svalbard, Tromsø, Mohe, and Beijing meteor radars mainly show an AO, with a maximum during winter and a minimum during summer. The AO in the northern polar regions is stronger than that in the southern polar regions, while the SAO in the southern polar regions is relatively strong compared to that in the northern polar regions. © 2021.

A large number of energy system modeling and planning tools are available to urban energy planners, but the majority of review studies focus on summarizing the capabilities of these tools. Comparatively few reviews examine the array of gaps in the field alongside potential solutions, particularly from both expert and practitioner viewpoints. This study aims to fill this gap. It provides a pragmatic, comprehensive overview of technical, methodological, and institutional gaps and solutions amongst urban energy system modeling tools and methods. It also compares solutions in order to identify relatively high-impact and easy-to-implement recommendations for tool developers, researchers, urban energy planners, policymakers, and other decision-makers. Key methodological solutions include developing: 1) more integrated modeling approaches; and 2) more comprehensive energy modeling scenarios to represent social factors and system imperfections.

This paper reports for the first time an experimental and multi-perspective analysis on an industrial scale co-pyrolysis of waste biomass and plastic. The results show that the resulting biochar product had a low calorific value of ≥21.0 MJ/kg, which meets the national standard for commercial solid fuel (GB/T 31862–2015). The calorific value of the produced gas was over 10 MJ/m3 and met the requirements of the national standard for residential heating and cooking (GB/T 13612–2006). The products of the co-pyrolysis can replace 1100 t of standard coal per annum, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, sulfur dioxide emissions, smoke, and other contaminants at the rate of 1720 t, 5–6 t, and 320 kg, respectively, as well as reducing smoke pollution. In addition, through the recycling of 750 t of plastic waste per annum for use in the co-pyrolysis, this method can reduce the white pollution of 50–66.7 km2 of farmland in the local area. The present study can guide the optimization of such systems and lead to adequate flexibility in the co-pyrolysis of different wastes to generate economic and socioenvironmental benefits. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Co-pyrolysis; Coal; Plastic waste; Product characterization; Socioenvironmental analysis","Biomass; Bituminous coal; Calorific value; Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Energy dissipation; Fuels; Global warming; Pollution; Smoke; Sulfur dioxide; Waste incineration; Carbon dioxide emissions; Industrial scale; Multi-perspective; National standard; Plastic wastes; Residential heating; Smoke pollution; Sulfur dioxide emissions; Pyrolysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099229989

The conventional method generally uses a range of modelling approaches to determine PM2.5:AOD relationships that are subsequently used to infer ground-level PM2.5 concentrations from satellite-retrieved AOD. Here, we use a high-resolution atmospheric chemistry simulation to explore how changes in the vertical distribution of aerosol extinction coefficients affects the PM2.5:AOD relationship and how we can use that information to improve the robustness of inferred estimates of ground-level PM2.5 over eastern China. We define a metric, ΓPBLAOD, that describes the fraction of AOD that resides in the planetary boundary layer compared with the total columnar AOD. We determine physically-meaningful PM2.5:AOD relationships using data for which ΓPBLAOD≥50%, a criterion based on sensitivity analyses on data clusters that we identify using a hierarchical clustering method. We use statistical and machine learning methods to develop independent models that describe these PM2.5:AOD relationships, and use a Monte Carlo approach to quantify the improvement after our selection of more physically relevant data records. Benefiting from the improved representativeness of AOD for ground-level PM2.5, our method effectively reduces bias in inferred estimates of ground-level PM2.5 by 10–15% (9–12%) for space-borne sensors passing over in the morning (afternoon). It also captures more variations in ground-level PM2.5 by up to 8% (5%) for space-borne sensors passing over in the morning (afternoon), particularly over areas dominated by natural aerosols such as dust. Accordingly, our method improves the seasonal ground-level PM2.5 maps, e.g. the bias of the autumn (winter) mean of ground-level PM2.5 estimates over Qinghai and Gansu (Shaaxi, Shanxi, and Henan) provinces reduces from −8% to −5% (11%–6%). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","AOD; Machine learning; Model of atmospheric chemistry and transport; PM2.5; Statistical regression","Aerosols; Atmospheric chemistry; Boundary layers; Hierarchical clustering; Monte Carlo methods; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sensitivity analysis; Aerosol extinction coefficient; Aerosol optical depths; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Hierarchical clustering methods; Machine learning methods; Planetary boundary layers; Satellite remote sensing; Vertical distributions; Learning systems; aerosol composition; atmospheric chemistry; boundary layer; concentration (composition); machine learning; optical depth; satellite altimetry; satellite sensor; vertical distribution; aerosol optical depth; Article; atmosphere; autumn; boundary layer; China; cross validation; data clustering; dust; ground level; hierarchical clustering; machine learning; Monte Carlo method; optical depth; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; quantitative analysis; regression analysis; remote sensing; season; sensitivity analysis; simulation; statistical analysis; winter; China; Gansu; Henan; Qinghai; Shanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100019722

The prevalent allocation mode applies the production-based principle (PBP) and causes equity and efficiency losses of CE reduction. The exploration of a CE reduction policy under the consumption-based principle (CBP) is highly demanded. In this article, by studying the transfer of CEs embodied in interprovincial trade (CEs-PT) in 1997–2007 within China, we propose a CE reduction allocation approach under the CBP. We found that net CEs-PT were huge and had increased from 172.22 million tons (Mts.) to 425.94 Mts. The main transfer flow was from the resource-based provinces to the economically developed provinces, from North China to South China. Under the PBP, the transfer of CEs-PT caused serious equity and efficiency losses of CE reduction in China. Then, we propose a CE reduction allocation approach under the CBP that considers the long-term dynamic change of regional CEs. The approach can eliminate equity loss, improve CE reduction efficiency, and avoid the impact of short-term fluctuations of regional CEs. Based on this approach, we calculated China’s provincial CE reduction responsibility and found that compared with the allocation approach under the PBP, the CE reduction responsibility of most net exporters of CEs-PT decreased, while that of most net importers increased. To accomplish CE reduction efficiently and economically, we propose a CE reduction trading system. The research can provide support for CE reduction allocation policy and CE reduction trading system for China and other countries. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon emission reduction allocation approach; Carbon emissions transfer; Consumption-based principle; Equity and efficiency losses; Long-term dynamic change","carbon emission; demand analysis; economic development; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; fuel consumption; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085526376

To illustrate this point, a cost-benefit analysis of metal recovery from e-waste was conducted with Europe, North America and China as representative regions of e-waste producers. The final profit associated with the entire e-waste recycling process was estimated by deducing the energy costs of metal recovery from the revenues of the manually dismantling stage and the metal recovery stage. Then, the potential job opportunities were estimated based on the final profit from the local e-waste recycling and average wage per year. Overall, profits of manually dismantling 1 ton of e-waste varied widely, but the final profits were positive. The potential job opportunities generated by local e-waste recycling ranged from 4.65 × 105 person/year for North America to 2.03 × 106 for China person/year. According to our study, the environmental load of 1 kg of e-waste would be 1–9 USD, indicating that this is the cost required to offset the environmental consequences of each kilogram of e-waste. By applying environmental load to per capita, the concept can act as a tool to encourage countries to fairly share the environmental responsibility of e-waste based on their e-waste generation. Based on this, we propose an e-waste emissions trading system that set a cap on the total amount of e-waste that could be generated globally and per country, to reduce e-waste and carbon emissions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","E-waste CBA; E-waste environmental load per capita; Potential job opportunity","Cost benefit analysis; Metal recovery; Metals; Profitability; Recycling; Wastes; E-waste generations; E-waste recycling; Environmental consequences; Environmental loads; Environmental responsibility; International policies; Job opportunities; Shared responsibility; Electronic Waste; antimony; copper; gold; lead; nickel; palladium; silver; tin; carbon emission; cost-benefit analysis; electronic waste; emissions trading; employment; foreign policy; heavy metal; profitability; recycling; waste management; Article; China; cost benefit analysis; e-waste; energy cost; environmental policy; Europe; metal recovery; North America; uncertainty; cost benefit analysis; policy; recycling; China; Europe; North America; China; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Electronic Waste; Europe; Policy; Recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100563082

Identification of long-term evolution of ozone sensitivity to precursors is essential to evaluating the impact of emission reduction measures on ozone pollution. Traditional observation-based model and 3-d numerical model are not suitable for analyzing long-term variation of ozone sensitivity to precursors. In this study, by transforming the conventional ozone isopleth plot into a VOCR isopleth plot in the functional space of NOx and ozone concentrations, we developed a novel approach to identify ozone sensitivity to precursors by simply using long-term monitoring data of ozone, NOx and temperature. This approach estimated ozone formation regimes (OFR) by ozone sensitivity to NOx and temperature separately, and the convergence of OFR serves as a way of mutual verification. We found that ozone formation was generally in the VOCR-limited or transitional regime in Shanghai, the largest metropolitan area in China. However, OFR was shifted to NOx-limited at Pudong station during 2017–19 due much to the stringent NOx emission control. OFR was also shifted to NOx-limited along with the increasing temperature. When temperature was over 30 °C, Shanghai was mostly in a NOx-limited OFR. This highlights that the NOx emission control measures need to be strengthened to reduce peak ozone levels more efficiently. Jinshan station exhibited a different trend with OFR shifted to VOCR-limited in 2017–19, which proved the effectiveness of VOCs emission control on petrochemical sector. However, OFR was shifted to NOx-limited when temperature was over 30 °C, suggesting more stringent VOCs emissions control should be targeted on days with higher temperature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Long-term evolution; Ozone formation regime; Ozone pollution; Shanghai; VOCR isopleth","Emission control; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Metadata; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Sensitivity analysis; 3-D numerical modeling; Increasing temperatures; Long-term monitoring datum; Observation-based model; Ozone concentration; Petrochemical sector; Transitional regimes; Tropospheric ozone; Air pollution; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); high temperature; ozone; pollutant transport; sensitivity analysis; air pollution control; ambient air; Article; China; concentration (parameter); environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; gas evolution; ozone layer; particulate matter 2.5; petrochemical industry; precursor; priority journal; process optimization; sensitivity analysis; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096606872

Through the mediation effect test, this paper found that tertiary industry is the mediation channel of population agglomeration to reduce air pollution. An increase of population density in big cities is conductive to increasing the proportion of tertiary industry, thereby reducing the proportion of seriously polluting secondary industry, and reducing air pollution. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agglomeration; Air quality; Environmental technology; Large dataset; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Air pollution indicators; Empirical studies; Large cities; Mediating effect; Population densities; Rapid urbanizations; Tertiary industries; Pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102775517

China began to implement a low-carbon economic policy in 2010, but the effect of the policy needs to be evaluated. Accordingly, this paper aims to discuss China’s low-carbon policy through exploring the following two questions, namely, whether the policy effect reaches the expected goal and whether the policy effects will balance economic development and emission reduction. Then, the paper puts forward suggestions for the improvement of China’s low-carbon policy. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is organized around three distinct aspects of policy effect evaluation. This paper uses the synthetic control method to construct a policy effect evaluation model and conducts a quasi-natural experiment. The paper selects annual panel data from 2003 to 2015, which is selected from 33 provinces. A comparative analysis of carbon dioxide emissions, energy consumption and economic development between Hubei Province and Liaoning Province. Findings: The results reveal that the implementation of the low-carbon pilot province policy in 2010 has a significant impact on the emission reduction effect of Liaoning Province, but the impact on the emission reduction effect of Hubei Province is not significant. The carbon emission trading system implemented in 2012 has reduced the emission reductions in Hubei Province and Liaoning Province has achieved better emission reduction effects after the implementation of this policy. After the implementation of the policy, the economic development of Hubei Province has been improved, but it has not brought help to the economic development of Liaoning Province. These findings provide new insights into the use of an emissions trading system for improving economic development and ultimately facilitate the attainment of the broader goal of sustainability. Originality/value: This paper proposes an innovative policy effect evaluation method by considering the status of unit gross domestic product, fixed asset investment in the energy industry, energy consumption, emission reduction technology innovation and other evaluation indicators. This paper contributes to broadening current methods of policy effect evaluation in China. © 2020, Bowen Yang, Liping Liu and Yanhui Yin.","Carbon emissions trading; Climate change law; Low carbon economy; Policy effect evaluation; Synthetic control method","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; economic development; economic policy; emission control; environmental policy; China; Hubei; Liaoning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101422546

China is an extremely large coal producer (3695 Mt/2015) and consumer (3698 Mt/2015), and Shanxi Province (i.e., a major coal-producing province in China) is a crucial element in China’s energy conservation and emission reduction goals. In this study, the Pingshuo mining area (PMA) in Shanxi Province was chosen as a case to analyze the dynamic changes in carbon emissions based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method, and the factors influencing carbon emissions were analyzed via the IPAT equation. Carbon emission sources in opencast mines mainly included fuel and explosive use, coal mine methane escape, coal and gangue spontaneous combustion, and electricity consumption. The carbon emission of the PMA increased from 4 × 104 Mg in 1986 to 1.05 × 106 Mg in 2015, with an average annual increase of 11.64%. In the PMA, 4.71 × 106 Mg of carbon emissions from fuel consumption accounted for 41.79% of carbon emissions, and 5.26 × 106 Mg of carbon emissions from methane emissions accounted for 46.66%. Carbon emissions from explosives and electricity use were 4.1 × 105 Mg and 8.8 × 105 Mg, respectively. In this mining area, the factors influencing carbon emissions included population, GDP, and coal output. The results of this study not only provide a reference for cleaner production in mining areas but also lay a foundation for the study of global opencast coal mining carbon emissions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emission reduction; Carbon sources; Driving force; IPAT equation; Mining activities; Pingshuo opencast mine","carbon emission; cleaner production; coal mine; coal mining; emission control; energy conservation; environmental impact; explosive; fuel consumption; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; China; Shanxi; carbon; coal; China; coal mining; combustion; Carbon; China; Coal; Coal Mining; Spontaneous Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096015158

The source contributions and transboundary transport of fine particles (PM2.5) in pollution episodes are closely related to large-scale or synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation. How to effectively reduce emissions to control haze pollution under different synoptic conditions is rarely reported. In this study, we classify the synoptic conditions over central China from 2013 to 2018 by using Lamb-Jenkinson method and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Final (FNL) operational global analysis data. The effectiveness of emission control to reduce PM2.5 pollution during winter haze episodes under potential synoptic controls is simulated by GEOS-Chem model. Among the 10 identified synoptic patterns, four types account for 87 % of the total pollution days. Two typical synoptic modes are characterized by low surface wind speed and stable weather conditions or high relative humidity (A or C type) over central China due to a high-pressure system or a southwest trough and low-pressure system, blocking pollutants dispersion. Sensitivity simulations show that these two heavy pollution processes are mainly contributed by local emission sources with ∼82 % for A type and ∼85 % for C type, respectively. The other two patterns lead to pollution of transport characteristics affected by northerly or southerly winds (NW or SW type), carrying air pollution from northern or southern China to central China. The contribution of pollution transmission from northern and southern China is 36.9 % and 7.6 %, respectively of PM2.5, and local emission sources contribute 41 % and 69 %, respectively. We also estimate the effectiveness of emission reduction in these four typical severe pollution synoptic processes. By only reducing SO2 and NOx emission and not controlling NH3, the enhanced nitrate counteracts the effect of sulfate reduction on PM2.5 mitigation, with a less than 4 % decrease in PM2.5. In addition, to effectively mitigate haze pollution of NW- and SW-type synoptic-controlled episodes, local emission control actions should be in coordination with regional collaborative actions. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

As numerous energy conversion and storage devices with various features have been developed, determining their types and capacity size and optimizing the synergic action of all selected energy devices under load uncertainty have become challenging issues during the planning and designing of a new IES. To address these issues, a load uncertainty model is constructed by integrating the regional equivalent standard building-integrated load prediction method, the robust uncertainty set method and the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm. Based on this uncertainty model, this paper proposes a planning method that incorporates the fuzzy multi-objective decision and two-stage adaptive robust optimization methods for handling these challenging issues. The multi-objective decision method enables comprehensive optimization based on the system's economic performance, carbon emissions and grid integration level. The two-stage adaptive robust optimization method aims to optimize the single-objective problem transformed by the multi-objective decision method. The planning method is implemented in an industrial park in the Baoding City of China. The influence of load budget uncertainty, annual load growth rate and energy purchase price is then investigated. The results show that the load budget uncertainty and annual load growth rate only affect the optimal capacity size of the selected devices, whereas the energy purchase price influences both the optimal device types and their capacity size. The optimal capacity size remains constant when the load budget uncertainty exceeds 3. This study provides a methodology to select the suitable device types and determine their capacity size for IES under load uncertainty, which will benefit the design of a new IES. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Grid integration level; Integrated energy system; Load uncertainty; Multi-objective decision; Two-stage robust optimization","Budget control; Carbon; Clustering algorithms; Decision theory; Energy conversion; Fuzzy clustering; Virtual storage; Comprehensive optimizations; Effective approaches; Energy conversion and storages; Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms; Integrated energy systems; Multiobjective decision; Planning and designings; Robust optimization method; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100307942

The comparison shows that the clean and static boundary conditions, referred to as PROFILE, apparently underestimate the ozone concentration over the upper troposphere and stratosphere, whereas the global chemical transport model (CTM) provides much more reasonable performance. Further investigation reveals that the boundary conditions exert larger impacts over areas with high altitudes and close distances to boundaries, such as the Tibetan Plateau, while they yield weak impacts on regions relatively far from the boundary, such as the North China Plain (NCP). Process analysis was conducted to investigate the modulation of physical and chemical processes on ozone formation in June 2017, illustrating that during the daytime of the high-O3 period, the photochemical reactions within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) almost become the only source favorable to ozone accumulation. Motivated by this phenomenon, we constructed a linear regression and found that the maximum daily 8-hr ozone (MDA8) ozone concentration was highly correlated with the surface ozone change rate and chemical reactions in the PBL during the pollution period, with MDA8 ozone exceeding 70 ppbv over NCP. Based on this relationship as well as the design of numerical experiments, we propose a strategy of dynamic emission control. Firstly, the emission reduction during the peak ozone formation period may weaken the fast chemical reactions in the PBL and subsequent surface ozone concentration. Secondly, emission reduction one or two days prior to an episode might achieve larger ozone reduction through the accumulation effect. Lastly, emission control outside of the NCP may surpass the local impact under favorable meteorological conditions. Therefore, the efficacy of dynamic emission control was striking when both the accumulation and transport effect were taken into consideration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Boundary conditions; Dynamic emission control; Ozone; PBL; Process analysis","Boundary conditions; Boundary layers; Chemical analysis; Emission control; Meteorological instruments; Modulation; Ozone; Ozone layer; Photochemical reactions; Reduction; Accumulation effects; Chemical transport models; Different boundary condition; Meteorological condition; Numerical experiments; Planetary boundary layers; Surface ozone concentrations; Vertical distributions; Air pollution; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; ozone; atmospheric transport; boundary condition; boundary layer; comparative study; concentration (composition); correlation; emission control; governance approach; ozone; ozonesonde; physicochemical property; air pollution control; air quality; altitude; chemical reaction; China; concentration (parameter); ozone layer; photochemistry; stratosphere; troposphere; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; China; Air Pollutants; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Ozone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096199904

With this rise in mean temperature, there is a lot of uncertainty on how weather and climate extremes would unfold, especially for various climate zones of India. It is therefore essential that the potential changes in both magnitude and direction of weather and climate extremes at the regional level when the global temperature reaches the different warming levels from 1 °C to 3 °C be established to allow for informed policy formulation. The present study explores the potential changes in the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices of rainfall and temperature estimated from the coupled model inter-comparison project CMIP5 multi-model ensemble over different climatic zones of India at 1 °C, 1.5 °C, 2 °C, 2.5 °C and 3 °C global temperature rise relative to pre-industrial levels under two Representative Concentration Pathways, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Projected changes in temperature extremes indicate significant changes at all warming levels across the nine climate zones of India. Hot temperature extremes are expected to increase while cold temperature extremes decrease. For India, country average at 3 °C under the RCP8.5 and 2 °C under the RCP4.5 scenarios, ensemble median shows that Warm Spell Duration Index will increase by 131 days and 66 days; hot days increase by 44% and 52%, warm nights increase by 23% and 13%; cold days decrease by 10% and 9%, and cold nights decrease by 13% and 12% relative to pre-industrial levels. The greatest changes in temperature based indices are projected in the colder northern parts of the country followed by the arid zone. Ensemble median for rainfall indices shows an increase in high precipitation indices, though with large model spread indicating the large uncertainties in the projections. Annual total precipitation and heavy rainfall related extreme indices show statistically significant increases in the tropical, temperate and semi-arid regions of India, moving from 1 °C to 3 °C warming level under RCP8.5 scenario whereas there is generally no significant change in the maximum number of consecutive dry and wet days. Moreover, the potential changes in climate extremes at the regional level are expected to have far-reaching impacts on the social and economic statuses of the respective climate zones. This information at a regional scale also calls attention to the national and state action plan on climate change and adaptation to be more responsive in order to take coherent and integrated policy decisions. © 2020 The Authors","Climate extreme; Climate zones; CMIP5; Global temperature rise; Warming levels","action plan; air temperature; climate change; CMIP; extreme event; future prospect; global warming; greenhouse gas; precipitation intensity; surface temperature; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096953902

Previous studies assess the health risk using an exposure-response function, such as an exposure-mortality model (EMM) based on total concentration of PM2.5. However, the risk assessment method can be problematic as it ignores the unequal toxicity between the different chemical components of PM2.5. To derive a components-specific EMM (CS-EMM), we conducted a whole-population-based epidemiology study in China, using the Chinese Population Census data in 2000 and 2010. Concentrations of ambient PM2.5 and its components were assessed by satellite-based concentrations of PM2.5 and composition fractions simulated by a chemical transport model. We used a difference-in-difference approach to associate county-level changes of census-based total mortality with changes of PM2.5 and its components between 2010 and 2000. The chemical components of PM2.5 simulated by the model included sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), organic carbon (OC), and black carbon (BC). We further compared CS-EMM with EMM based on a single pollutant of PM2.5 (PM2.5-EMM) or black carbon (BC-EMM), by evaluating their performance in a risk assessment. Using census-based total mortality and cross validation we evaluated the performance of the mortality prediction of an EMM, and found that the CS-EMM outperformed PM2.5-EMM or BC-EMM. For instance, CS-EMM, PM2.5-EMM, and BC-EMM all overestimated the average number of county-level deaths by 117, 142, and 149, respectively; hence CS-EMM overestimated by the lowest amount. Moreover, CS-EMM had the advantage of interpreting the toxicity of PM2.5 mixture in its entirety. From 2000 to 2010, CS-EMM attributed a 205496 increase in PM2.5-Associated mortality across China to the joint contribution of the growth of total concentration and the reduction of PM2.5 toxicity. Among the components, BC contributed 6.4% of PM2.5 concentration growth, but corresponded to a 46.7% increment in PM2.5-Associated deaths. This study developed a framework to establish and validate an exposure-response function based on PM2.5 components, and illustrated its advantages in terms of risk prediction and result interpretation in China. Our approach can be utilized to evaluate how chemical composition modified the health impact of PM2.5, and should help policy-makers target the toxic sources of air pollution.

Understanding the spatial–temporal variation of R-factor and its driving forces is essential to reduce soil and water loss as well as formulate a regional ecological restoration plan. In this study, the Huaihe River Basin (HRB), a typical climatic transitional zone of eastern China, was selected as the study region. Using daily precipitation data of 36 national standard meteorological stations in the HRB during 1960–2014, the temporal variation and spatial pattern of R-factor were examined. To explore the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulations, three climatic indicators – the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST), the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) – were analyzed with R-factor by the cross-wavelet transform. Results indicated that: (1) Average annual R-factor was 5339.64 MJ∙mm∙hm−2∙h−1 with an insignificantly increasing trend. Summer accounted the most of seasonal R-factor, followed by autumn and spring. Only the winter R-factor presented a significantly increasing trend. (2) The spatial gradient of R-factor decreased from south to north in the HRB. The common high value of R-factor appeared in the Dabie Mountain. In summer, another high value of R-factor mainly concentrated in the coastal of HRB. (3) Climatic indicators had a strong influence on R-factor in this region. The non-stationary feature was reflected by the resonant period between R-factor and climatic indicators. It should be noticed that the winter R-factor is increasing when the positive phase of AO in the long-term period. This study is helpful to understand the variation of rainfall erosivity in the climatic transitional zone of eastern China. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climatic indicators; Huaihe River Basin; Non-stationary feature; R-factor; Trend variation","Arctic Oscillation; erosivity; monsoon; precipitation intensity; rainfall; sea surface temperature; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal variation; transition zone; trend analysis; water erosion; China; Huai Basin; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095831329

However, most of previous efforts only focused on urban structures in term of two-dimensional space, whereas the vertical influence of urban buildings (three-dimensional space) plays an important role in CO2 emissions. To address this issue, we took the cities in mainland China as study case to quantitatively explore how the three-dimensional urban structure affects CO2 emissions. First, we collected the city-level CO2 emission data from a greenhouse gas emission dataset released by the China City Greenhouse Gas Working Group. Then, a series of spatial metrics were established to quantify three-dimensional urban structures based on urban building data derived from Baidu Map. On the strength of the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model, an extended approach and ridge regression analysis were finally utilized to investigate the consequences of three-dimensional urban structures on CO2 emissions at the city level. The results indicate that the total building volume is the largest driving force accelerating CO2 emissions due to the massive consumption of energies for human activities during rapid urbanization. Besides, urban buildings with taller height and large heat dissipation area also have significant positive effects on promoting CO2 emissions. Although a compact coverage of urban buildings at a two-dimensional scale contributes to the reduction of CO2 emissions, urban structure characterized by an intense and congested pattern in three-dimensional space can lead to more CO2 emissions because of the adverse impacts from surrounding environment and traffic congestion. Additionally, an irregular pattern of three-dimensional urban structure would help reduce CO2 emissions to some extent. Such study results highlight the importance of urban planning for the development of a low-carbon city, and suggest the compact patterns of three-dimensional urban structures should be controlled within a reasonable range to avoid more CO2 emissions caused by excessive centralization and aggregation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions; Impact analysis; STIRPAT model; Three-dimensional urban structures; Urban planning","Buildings; Greenhouse gases; Regression analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Traffic congestion; Carbon dioxide emissions; Consumption of energy; Low-carbon development; Rapid urbanizations; Surrounding environment; Three dimensional space; Three-dimensional spatial structures; Two dimensional spaces; Carbon dioxide; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; emission inventory; pollution monitoring; spatial analysis; three-dimensional modeling; traffic congestion; urban area; urban planning; Article; building; carbon footprint; China; city planning; controlled study; environmental impact; geographic distribution; greenhouse gas; human activities; population and population related phenomena; priority journal; quantitative analysis; regression analysis; spatial analysis; Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population Affluence and Technology model; stochastic model; urban area; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094831665

This allows policymakers to trace worldwide CO2 emissions at multiple levels of trade, production, consumption, and shared principle alongside the world trade network. This paper employs the gross export decomposition methodology and the World Input-Output Database for calculations. Firstly, compared with traditional trade statistics, measuring embedded emissions in value-added trade can deduct the double-counted terms of CO2 emissions due to intermediate products crossing several borders repeatedly. Secondly, the worldwide inter-country CO2 emission footprints embedded in exports, imports, and net flows of value-added trade are traced in a geographical world map. It occurs that, China, the USA, Russia, and the EU are the top four largest emitters. Thirdly, network analysis is further utilized to capture bilateral implicit CO2 emission relationships, e.g., the EU members' environmental impacts depend on intra-regional trade within the union. Finally, a comparison is made under three burden-sharing principles based on value-added trade. The shared responsibility offers a compromise between the producer's and the consumer's principle, which is considered to be fairer and more effective. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Burden-sharing responsibility; CO2 emission network; Input-output methodology; Value-added trade","carbon emission; carbon footprint; emission control; environmental impact; European Union; trade-environment relations; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094825176

After high-temperature heat treatment, it can be decomposed into SO2 and CaO; the former can be used to produce sulfuric acid, and the latter can be used as building materials. In this paper, the catalytic thermal decomposition conditions of phosphogyp- sum were optimized, and the effects of the reaction temperature, reaction atmosphere, reaction time and carbon powder content on the decomposition of phosphogypsum were studied. The research shows that the synergistic effect of carbon powder and CO reducing atmosphere can effectively reduce the decomposition temperature of phosphogypsum. According to the results of the orthogonal test under simulated suspended laboratory conditions, the factors affecting the decomposition rate of phosphogypsum are temperature, time, atmosphere and carbon powder content in turn, and the factors affecting the desulfurization rate are time, temperature, atmosphere and carbon powder content in turn. Under laboratory conditions, the highest decomposition rate and desulfurization rate of phosphogypsum are 97.73% and 97.2%, and the corresponding reaction conditions are as follows: Calcination temperature is 1180 °C, calcination time is 15 min, carbon powder content is 4%, and CO concentration is 6%. The results of thermal analysis of phosphogypsum at different temperature rising rates show that the higher the temperature rising rate, the higher the initial temperature of decomposition reaction and the temperature of maximum thermal decomposition rate, but the increase in the temperature rising rate will not reduce the decomposition rate of phosphogyp- sum. © 2021 by the authors.

Notably, urban areas contribute to the majority of global CO2 emissions. The exploration of spatial differences and their impacts on CO2 emissions in cities serves an essential role in formulating regional carbon emission reduction strategies. Therefore, combining spatial autocorrelation analysis with a geographical detector model could help understanding how CO2 emissions are spatially distributed in cities and the mechanisms responsible for their distribution. By analyzing China's prefecture-level cities as spatial unit, the spatial distribution features of CO2 emissions were investigated, and their main drivers in 2005 and 2012 were identified. The results indicates that CO2 emissions increased by 60.35% from 2005 to 2012. The higher CO2 emissions in cities were mainly located in the east and north regions of China. CO2 emissions had a significant positive spatial autocorrelation and an obvious phenomenon of stratification appeared in 2005 and 2012. The degree of spatial agglomeration among cities with low and high CO2 emissions both increased. Gross domestic product (GDP), research and development (R&amp;D), foreign direct investment (FDI), and urban built-up area were major factors affecting CO2 emissions. Increased population density was associated with decreased CO2 emissions, while the effect of climate types increased from 2005 to 2012. The interactions of GDP with share_ industry (the share of labour in the secondary industry), population density, and urbanization had a stronger influence on CO2 emissions in 2005, while the interactions of GDP with FDI, climate types, and share_ industry were stronger in 2012. However, the influence of share_ industry and climate types on CO2 emissions were only important when certain economic levels were met. The findings provide a reference for decision-makers to develop more accurate and detailed policies to reduce CO2 emissions in Chinese cities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; Cities; CO2 emissions; Driving factors; Geographical detector model; Spatial autocorrelation","Autocorrelation; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Global warming; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Spatial variables measurement; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emission reductions; Distribution features; Foreign direct investments; Gross domestic products; Research and development; Spatial autocorrelation analysis; Spatial autocorrelations; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098730856

The associations were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Among 4,137 participants, 575 showed the occurrence of carotid plaque during the follow-up period. After controlling for potential confounders, the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) of carotid plaque associated with per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5, NO2, and O3 were 1.78 (1.55, 2.03), 1.32 (1.14, 1.53) and 1.99 (1.71, 2.31), respectively. Increased EVI and NDVI were significantly associated with lower risk of carotid plaque [HR (and 95%CI): 0.84 (0.77, 0.93) and 0.87 (0.80, 0.94)]. PM2.5 significantly mediated 80.47% or 93.00% of the estimated association between EVI or NDVI and carotid plaque. In light of the significant associations between air pollution, greenness and carotid plaque in this study, continued efforts are needed to curb air pollution and plan more green space considering their effects on vascular disease. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Carotid plaque; Cohort study; Greenness","Hazards; Hospitals; Inverse problems; Nitrogen oxides; Office buildings; Regression analysis; Vegetation; Aerodynamic diameters; Confidence interval; Enhanced vegetation index; Inter quartile ranges; Inverse distance weighted; Normalized difference vegetation index; Particulate Matter; Proportional hazards; Air pollution; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; confidence interval; greenspace; health risk; NDVI; pollution exposure; vegetation cover; adult; air pollution; Article; carotid atherosclerosis; China; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; Enhanced Vegetation Index; environmental factor; female; follow up; general hospital; greenness; human; inverse distance weighted method; long term exposure; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; office worker; particulate matter 2.5; particulate matter exposure; physical examination; proportional hazards model; prospective study; statistical analysis; urban population; vegetation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100154249

Very interestingly, the Pd catalyst supported by NaLa-ZSM-5 exhibited the best result. Over an optimized catalyst, a complete conversion of methane can be achieved at around 320 °C, which is about 60 °C lower than the temperature needed for Pd/Na-ZSM-5. Physicochemical characterizations such as XRD, SEM, HRTEM, XPS, and ICP-OES techniques were used to investigate the factors influencing the catalytic activity and find out the reasons behind the discrepancy in the catalytic performance of methane combustion over these zeolite-supported Pd catalysts. Based on the characterization results, it is proposed that the Pd dispersion and its chemical states are major factors that govern catalytic performance of methane combustion over these catalysts. To the best of our knowledge, the optimal catalyst in this study stands out compared with other reported similar Pd catalysts for the catalytic combustion of methane in terms of activity. © 2019","Catalytic combustion; Lanthanum; Methane; Pd catalysts; Zeolite","Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalytic oxidation; Combustion; Ion exchange; Lanthanum; Methane; Palladium; Zeolites; Catalytic combustion; Catalytic combustion of methane; Catalytic performance; Conversion of methanes; Methane combustion; Pd catalyst; Physico-chemical characterization; Supported Pd catalysts; Catalyst supports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076241093

A pilot study was conducted to compare the effects of compound fertilizer and rapeseed cake organic fertilizer on C and N preservation in the soils and runoff of a tea plantation as well as the C and N isotopic fractionation in soils over the three annual cycles of fertilization and tea-leaf harvest. Overall, rapeseed cake organic fertilization effectively increased the pH, total organic matter, NH4-N and NO3-N in soils by 2.19–4.29%, 8.04–21.14%, 53.65–100.32% and 5.74–54.08%, respectively, but decreased NH4-N inputs in runoff by 10.36–25.12% and NO3-N inputs in runoff by 8.94–24.10% relative to the same rate of pure N in compound fertilizer. Before fertilization in February, the average δ13C and δ15N were −25.15‰ and 1.88‰, while after a full year of fertilization and tea-leaf harvesting in October, the average soil δ13C and δ15N contents were −23.83‰ and −0.33‰ after compound fertilization and −26.22‰ and 1.64‰ after rapeseed cake organic fertilization, respectively, indicating the evident effects of fertilization on the isotopic fractionation in soil. In addition, the fractionation extent was positively associated with the fertilization rates under both fertilizers. However, the two fertilization types had different effects on the C and N isotope fractionations, with rapeseed cake organic fertilization contributing more to δ13C (21.07–81.80%) but less to δ15N (18.20–78.93%) and compound fertilization presenting the opposite results (1.88–46.18% and 53.82–98.12%, respectively). This study demonstrates that rapeseed cake organic fertilization can better preserve soil C and N pools while reducing their runoff in tea plantations, which may greatly hinder the regional soil acidification and water eutrophication trends. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon and nitrogen isotopes; Compound fertilizer; Rapeseed cake organic fertilizer; Runoff water; Tea plantation","Acidification; Carbon; Eutrophication; Isotopes; Nitrogen fertilizers; Oilseeds; Runoff; Soils; Tea; Carbon and nitrogen; Fertilizer applications; Isotope fractionation; Isotopic fractionations; Organic fertilization; Organic fertilizers; Total organic matter; Water eutrophication; Organic carbon; ammonia; carbon; carbon 13; isotope; nitrate; nitrogen; nitrogen 15; organic fertilizer; organic matter; acidification; carbon isotope; eutrophication; fertilizer application; isotopic fractionation; nitrogen isotope; pH; rainfall-runoff modeling; Article; comparative study; concentration (parameter); environmental impact; eutrophication; fertilization; fertilizer application; fractionation; geographic distribution; harvest; human; nutrient content; pH; pilot study; plantation; preservation; priority journal; quantitative analysis; rapeseed; runoff; soil acidification; soil treatment; tea; Brassica napus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094626518

It is critical to objectively evaluate the influence of relevant factors on carbon emissions, which may be beneficial for the implementation of policies and the formulation of development plans. However, the current decomposition approach based on production-theoretical decomposition analysis (PDA) and weak disposability may cause deviation on potential emission reduction. This paper proposes a modified PDA model under the assumption of semi-disposability and decomposes the carbon emission changes of China's thermal power generation sector accordingly. The results show that provinces, which have the highest non-disposal degrees during the study period, are mostly located along the east coast of China. The growth in installed capacity is identified as the largest contributor to the increase in national carbon emissions, while the decrease in capacity utilization rate significantly benefits the carbon emission reduction. A cluster analysis is also conducted to give policy implications for provinces with similar characteristics. Compared with traditional methods under strong and weak disposability assumption, the proposed model shows great advantages in identifying the potential emission reduction and reflecting the real production process, which makes it more suitable for decomposing the changes of carbon emissions and other environmental pollutants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Distance function; Production-theoretical decomposition analysis; Semi-disposability; Thermal power generation sector","carbon dioxide; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cluster analysis; decomposition analysis; electricity industry; emission control; global warming; policy implementation; pollution policy; spatiotemporal analysis; theoretical study; thermal power; Article; carbon footprint; China; cluster analysis; decomposition; empiricism; geothermal energy; reduction (chemistry); theoretical study; air pollutant; theoretical model; China; Air Pollutants; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098858739

Accurate assessment of moisture loads arising from WDR can be obtained through the watertightness test during which different levels of WDR intensities and Driving Rain Wind Pressures (DRWPs) are applied to a test specimen and water that penetrates wall assembly can thus be quantified. Although many previous studies have included watertightness tests, only a few of these have attempted to correlate the moisture loads to WDR conditions as may occur in specific locations within a country. To improve the assessment of moisture loads for a vinyl-clad wall assembly, a wall test specimen was tested following a test protocol based on local climate data using National Research Council of Canada’s Dynamic Wind and Wall Testing Facility (DWTF). The use of this test protocol permitted quantifying the moisture load in the vinyl wall assembly when subjected to several different simulated WDR conditions. The moisture load was formulated as a function of the WDR intensity and DRWP which thereafter allowed evaluating the moisture load based on a given climate’s hourly rainfall intensity and wind velocity. Such work is particularly relevant considering that the intensity, duration and frequency of WDR events across Canada will in some regions increase due to the effects of climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, a decarbonization model with consideration of both technological progress and cross-regional power transmission for China's power sector is built to explore the potential and possible pathway of decarbonization under the constraint of optimal cost. The model is operated at different carbon prices in three economic growth scenarios. Our findings show that the power generation structure is undergoing a shift from coal power to hydropower, nuclear power, and wind power, and both the coal power generation and carbon emissions can peak by 2030. Carbon pricing can speed up this process and reduce the peak height. Additionally, an appropriate carbon price has a significant promoting effect on decarbonization in the power sector; we conclude that the optimal carbon price is 21 USD/t. Moreover, the higher the economic development level, the lower the final average cost of power generation mix and the more significant the carbon emissions reduction, which implies that it is more cost-effective to carry out decarbonization related policy in the power sector during the stage of rapid economic growth. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-regional power transmission; Decarbonization; Power sector; Structural optimization; Technology learning curve","Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decarbonization; Emission control; Nuclear fuels; Power transmission; Transmissions; Wind power; Carbon emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Carbon pricing; Cost effective; Economic growths; Power generation mix; Promoting effect; Technological progress; Electric power system interconnection; carbon emission; cost-benefit analysis; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; pollution tax; power generation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099640039

While it was widely expected to see a dramatic reduction in air pollution, reality appears to be much more complex due to the joint influences of emissions and meteorology in dictating air pollution. By analyzing ample meteorological and environmental observational data, this study attempts to evaluate the contribution of an economic lockdown or at a well-below normal level across China to air pollution during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Besides the unprecedented emission reductions that helped to improve air quality, multiple other factors came into play, such as high humidity and low wind speed that are favorable for haze formation. After separating long-term trends, seasonal signals, holiday effects, and meteorological contributions concerning climatology, we estimated that the relative contributions of human activities to changes in particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 μm and nitrogen dioxide during the epidemic were −17.13 μg/m3 and −0.03 μg/m3, respectively, with negative quantities denoting reductions to air pollution. Furthermore, comparing the changes in PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations after lockdown revealed that for short-term control measures, meteorological factors mainly affected pollutant particles. © Copyright © 2021 Xian, Li and Wei.","air quality; COVID-19; lockdown; meteorology; synoptic circulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103641515

Recently, regulation of the oxidation state of catalysts has emerged as an effective method for designing better-performing CO2RR catalysts. The oxidation state of the catalyst was observed to influence the activity and selectivity of CO2RR, which is essentially based on promoting reactant activation, regulating the adsorption of intermediates and facilitating the C-C coupling. The CO2RR performance of various catalysts, such as Cu-based catalysts, non-Cu metal catalysts, atomically dispersed metal catalysts and carbon materials, can be efficiently improved through oxidation state regulation. In this review, we first discuss current understandings on how the oxidation state affects the catalytic properties of catalysts. Then, we summarize recent progress in strategies used to regulate the oxidation state of catalysts and their resultant performances toward CO2RR. In particular, we highlight recent advancements in in situ techniques that are used to uncover the dynamic evolution of the oxidation state of catalysts during CO2RR.

However, evidence regarding short-term effect of SO2 on years of life lost (YLL) from stroke is scarce. We aim to estimate the short-term association between SO2 pollution and YLL for stroke and the related excess life years and economic loss. Methods: A national time-series study was conducted in 48 Chinese cities from 2013 to 2017. Generalized additive model coupled with random-effects model were used to explore the effects of SO2 on YLL from stroke. Stratified analyses were performed by demographical and geographical factors, and the effect modification of city-level factors was estimated. In addition, the related economic loss was calculated using the method of the value per statistical life year (VSLY). Results: Averaged daily mean SO2 concentration was 27.1 μg/m3 in 48 Chinese cities from 2013 to 2017. Per 10 μg/m3 increase in the concentration of SO2 (lag03) was associated with an increment of 0.70% (95% confidence interval: 0.27%,1.13%), 0.51% (−0.01%,1.04%), 0.71% (0.14%,1.28%) increase in YLL from total stroke, hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, respectively. The effect of short-term ambient SO2 exposure on YLL from stroke was more pronounced in the less-educated population and those living in the south. The corresponding excess economic loss during the study period due to SO2-related YLL from stroke accounted for 0.08% (0.03%, 0.13%) of the GDP in China. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence from China that short-term exposure to SO2 is positively associated with YLL from stroke and its major subtypes in certain subgroups of population. This study calls for greater awareness of the adverse health effect due to SO2 in China and other developing countries, as well as local-specific implementation of air pollution mitigation measures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Economic loss; Effect modification; Stratified analyses; Stroke; Sulfur dioxide; Years of life lost","Air pollution; Developing countries; Losses; Random processes; Time series analysis; Adverse health effects; Confidence interval; Effect modifications; Generalized additive model; Pollution mitigation; Random effects model; Short-term exposure; Stratified analysis; Sulfur dioxide; sulfur dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; aged; air pollution; ambient air; brain hemorrhage; cerebrovascular accident; China; city; concentration (parameter); economic crisis; environmental exposure; environmental temperature; female; human; humidity; major clinical study; male; mortality; population density; time series analysis; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; epidemiology; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095851631

In order to understand the development characteristics and regular patterns of urban low-carbon traffic, we present a game model that enables us to predict the possible range of travel mode choice and the impact of low-carbon awareness. Through chaos analysis and simulation of the model, the authors come to realize that the proportions of travel mode choice can reach an equilibrium under a certain urban traffic system. This equilibrium is related to low-carbon awareness and the situation of the urban traffic system. The research we have done suggests that in small cities with undeveloped traffic systems, the most effective measure to achieve urban low-carbon traffic is to increase the comprehensive costs of high-carbon travel. However, in big cities with developed traffic systems, raising low-carbon awareness of residents can greatly increase the proportion of low-carbon travelers and improve the stability of travel mode choice. The results could provide development strategies and policy suggestions for urban low-carbon traffic and reduce the adverse impact of urban traffic emissions on public health. © 2021 by the authors.

Following the construction of a superefficiency SBM model and combining the panel data of three major urban agglomerations in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2003 to 2017, carbon emission efficiency was measured and analyzed. A spatial Durbin model (SDM) was incorporated to analyze the urban agglomerations in the Yangtze River Economic Belt and the impact of urbanization quality and foreign direct investment (FDI) on carbon emission efficiency. Finally, the SDM model was used to decompose the spillover effect. Generally, carbon emission efficiency in the three major urban agglomerations in the Yangtze River Economic Belt is low, with regional differences. FDI only has a positive impact on the carbon emissions of the Yangtze River Delta and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Furthermore, urbanization and population density have led to high levels of carbon emission in the region; however, the industrial structure and energy intensity factors have inhibited the improvement of regional carbon emission efficiency. Improving the quality of urbanization and trade structure is important to achieve energy conservation and emission reductions, which are pillars of sustainable economic development. © 2021 by the authors.

Using Guangzhou city as a case, this paper explored the air quality and health co-benefits of peaking carbon dioxide emissions under three scenarios and developed an integrated assessment framework by combining a local air pollutant emission inventory, an atmospheric chemistry transport model, and a health assessment model. The results showed that SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 could achieve larger emission reductions than NH3, VOCs, and NOx among all the scenarios we examined. Under the enhanced peaking scenario with the most stringent mitigation strategies, Guangzhou could meet the local ambient air quality standard for PM2.5 (34 μg/m3), with the most reduction observed in the annual average PM2.5 concentration (28.4%) and related premature deaths (17.08%), compared with the base year 2015. We also identified hotspot grids, which were areas with high concentrations of carbon emissions, high concentrations of air pollution and poor air quality in Guangzhou.

It is also the site of frequent floods, droughts, and other natural disasters. Conducting Holocene environmental archaeology research in this region is of great importance when studying the evolution of the relationship between humans and the environment and the interactive effects humans had on the environment from 10.0 to 3.0 ka BP, for which no written records exist. This review provides a comprehensive summary of materials that have been published over the past several decades concerning Holocene environmental archaeology in the Yangtze River Valley, to further understand large-scale regional Holocene environmental and cultural interaction within this area. The results show that: 1) in recent years, Holocene envi-ronmental archaeology research in the Yangtze River Valley has primarily taken paleoflood and sea-level change stratigraphical events to be the foundational threads for study. This began with research on the spatiotemporal distribution of archaeological sites, typical archaeological site stratigraphy, and research on back-ground features concerning environmental evolution recorded by the regional natural sedimentary strata. 2) Significant progress has been made at the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, indicating that Holocene environmental ar-chaeology research along the Yangtze River Valley is deepening and broadening. 3) Dramatic changes to Neolithic cultures that occurred approximately 4.0 ka BP were influenced by climate change and associated consequences, although the impacts differed on the various Neolithic cultures in the Yangtze River Valley. Local topography, regional climate, and varying survival strategies may have contributed to these differences. 4) Newly-published research pays particular attention to the sedimentary records of the past with res-olutions as high as one year to several months, the degree to which humans altered the quality of their natural environment, and human adjustments to settlement and subsistence practices during periods of Holocene climate change. The application of technologies such as remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and molecular biological analysis are also gradually being extended into the research field of Holocene environmental archaeology in the Yangtze River Valley. © 2021 by the authors.

Climate warming and overgrazing have already caused degradation in a large fraction of alpine grasslands on this plateau. However, it remains unclear how human activities (mainly livestock grazing) regulates vegetation dynamics under climate change. Here, alpine grassland productivity (substituted with the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) is hypothesized to vary in a nonlinear trajectory to follow climate fluctuations and human disturbances. With generalized additive mixed modelling (GAMM) and residual-trend (RESTREND) analysis together, both magnitude and direction of climatic (in terms of temperature, precipitation, and radiation) and anthropogenic impacts on NDVI variation were examined across alpine meadows, steppes, and desert-steppes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The results revealed that accelerating warming and greening, respectively, took place in 76.2% and 78.8% of alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The relative importance of temperature, precipitation, and radiation impacts was comparable, between 20.4% and 24.8%, and combined to explain 66.2% of NDVI variance at the pixel scale. The human influence was strengthening and weakening, respectively, in 15.5% and 14.3% of grassland pixels, being slightly larger than any sole climatic variable across the entire plateau. Anthropogenic and climatic factors can be in opposite ways to affect alpine grasslands, even within the same grassland type, likely regulated by plant community assembly and species functional traits. Therefore, the underlying mechanisms of how plant functional diversity regulates nonlinear ecosystem response to climatic and anthropogenic stresses should be carefully explored in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic impacts; Climate fluctuations; Ecosystem non-linearity; Grassland productivity; Human disturbance; Vegetation dynamics","anthropogenic effect; climate change; ecosystem response; grassland; NDVI; overgrazing; plant community; vegetation dynamics; article; climate; desert; human; human impact (environment); nonlinear system; plant community; precipitation; productivity; steppe; stress; vegetation dynamics; warming; animal; climate change; ecosystem; grassland; nonlinear system; Tibet; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Animals; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Grassland; Humans; Nonlinear Dynamics; Tibet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098134914

Natural gas consumption (NGC) offers the possibility of achieving double dividends, namely economic growth and CO2 emissions reduction. It is therefore essential to investigate the double dividends of NGC to China's low carbon development. This study establishes one expanded Cobb-Douglas production function and Kaya function, as well as corresponding panel regression econometric models, to evaluate the double dividends of NGC at both national and regional levels by using China's provincial panel data for the period of 1997–2017. The results show that at national level, NGC promotes economic growth and has potential to facilitate CO2 emissions reduction, but with a small share. At regional level, NGC can achieve economic growth in the northeast, the northern coastal and the eastern coastal regions although the increasing share of NGC fails to further stimulate CO2 emissions reduction. NGC impedes economic growth in the southern coastal region and the southwest region, and the increasing share of NGC could not bring CO2 emissions reduction dividend. In the Yellow River midstream region and the northwest region, the impact of NGC on the double dividends is insufficient. In the Yangtze River midstream region, NGC cannot significantly encourage economic growth and CO2 emissions reduction. NGC contributes less to economic growth than coal and oil at both national and regional levels. The high carbon consumption of residents and industries leads to more CO2 emissions, but the CO2 emissions reduction induced by the increasing share of NGC is insufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to improve natural gas supply network, increase monetary incentive to NGC, expand domestic and international natural gas supply sources, and prepare region-specific policies on supporting NGC. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide emissions; Double dividends; Economic growth; Natural gas consumption; Policy-making","Carbon dioxide; Coastal zones; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Gas supply; Global warming; Carbon dioxide emissions; Cobb-Douglas production function; Double dividend; Econometric model; Economic growths; Low-carbon development; Natural gas consumption; Northwest regions; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097456559

To address global warming, effective methods must be adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of fossil fuels. Vapor compression heat pumps offer an effective way to recover energy from waste heat sources and reduce primary energy consumption. However, the traditional working fluids used in heat pumps generally have a high global warming potential (GWP) and produce a significant greenhouse effect when leaked. Therefore, low-GWP (GWP<150) refrigerants have recently become a topic of widespread research interest for the continuing development of vapor compression heat pumps. Much research has examined the performance, characteristics, and application potential of low-GWP refrigerants in heat pumps. However, no published reviews have exclusively focused on the status of research on heat pumps with pure low-GWP refrigerants and no systematic application guidelines have been developed for these low-GWP vapor compression heat pumps. This review analyzes the use of 17 different pure low-GWP refrigerants, including natural refrigerants (R717, R718, and R744), hydrocarbons (R290, R600, R600a, R601, and R1270), hydrofluorocarbons (R152a and R161), hydrofluoroolefins (R1234yf, R1234ze(E), R1234ze(Z), R1336mzz(Z), and R1336mzz(E)), and hydrochlorofluorolefins (R1233zd(E) and R1224yd(Z)), for use in vapor compression heat pumps. Guidelines for the application of these heat pumps are also presented based on a review of the existing literature and a thorough comparison of simulation studies on heat pumps using pure low-GWP refrigerants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Application roadmap; Pure low-GWP refrigerant; Technical guideline; Vapor compression heat pump","Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Heat pump systems; Refrigerants; Waste heat; Application guidelines; Continuing development; Environmental concerns; Global warming potential; Natural refrigerants; Primary energy consumption; Research interests; Simulation studies; Pumps",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097085428

An important field of work pertains to developing global governance frameworks and to influencing international and national policy-making processes. Evaluation of such normative work has received even less attention than the evaluation of projects and programmes. In this chapter, the authors argue that there are no clear differences between the methods used to evaluate normative aspects of development work and the methods used to evaluate more operational (or ‘on the ground’) activities. Any perceived differences are in the relative lengths and complexities of the causal chains leading from the intervention to the desired results and impacts. The arguments articulated in this chapter are founded on theory-based approaches to evaluating development interventions. They are based on the realization that development interventions, whether designed with clear intervention logic or haphazardly/opportunistically formulated, have an underlying intent - to produce change from one state or condition to another. Thus, development interventions are embodiments of theories. Inherent in this assertion is the idea that not only is there a clear underlying logic or theory on which the interventions (new programmes or policy) are based, but also that given stated or unstated assumptions the interventions’ outcomes can be traced back to the activities undertaken. If one views development interventions as a set of activities with causal intent, it is possible to deploy theory-based approaches to explore the intended changes and determine whether the interventions have, indeed, produced the expected changes (and explore whether interventions yielded unexpected changes). This chapter describes approaches to evaluating the environmental aspects of international development with particular reference to the work of the United Nations Environment Programme in general, and its normative aspects in particular. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Juha I.

To date, scientists have developed various strategies, including CO2 utilization technologies, to reduce global carbon emissions. This paper presents the global scientific landscape of the CO2 utilization research from 1995 to 2019 based on a bibliometric analysis of 1875 publications extracted from Web of Science. The findings indicate a major increase in the number of publications and citations received from 2015 to 2019, denoting a fast-emerging research trend. The dynamics of global CO2 utilization research is partly driven by China’s policies and research funding to promote low-carbon economic development. Applied Energy is recognized as a core journal in this research topic. The utilization of CO2 is a multidisciplinary topic that has progressed by multidimensional collaborations at the country and organizations levels, while the formation of co-authorship networks at the individual level is mostly influenced by the authors’ affiliations. Keyword co-occurrence analysis reveals a rapid evolution in the CO2 utilization strategies from chemical fixation in carbonates and epoxides to pilot-scale testing of power-to-gas technologies in Europe and the USA. The development of efficient power-to-fuel technologies and biological utilization routes (using microalgae and bacteria) will probably be the next research priorities in CO2 utilization research. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon capture and utilization; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Energy storage; Power to liquid; Power to X","anthropogenic effect; bibliography; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic development; global climate; China; Europe; United States; carbon dioxide; atmosphere; bibliometrics; climate change; Europe; Atmosphere; Bibliometrics; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096042626

Due to the incompatibility of many adsorbents to F2 and HF, aluminas and polymeric adsorbents were selected as potentially compatible materials. To determine the adsorption potential of these adsorbents in the low concentration region, the concentration pulse chromatographic technique was chosen to determine the Henry's Law constants of CO2, CF4, and O2 gases with three polymeric adsorbents (HayeSep Q, HayeSep B, and Fluorinated DVB) and two aluminas (AA-300, and Alumina A). The results were plotted and compared on van't Hoff plots (the natural logarithm of Henry's Law constants as a function of inverse absolute temperature) with the heat of adsorption values being calculated from the lines of best fit for all gases and adsorbents tested in this study. Due to the large energies required to operate the excimer lasers, a cryo-cooler was determined to be feasible to precool the feed stream before separation, which increases the adsorption capacity and the compatibility of the adsorbents to F2 and HF. The van't Hoff plots were extrapolated to colder temperatures to determine the Henry's Law constants to analyze the potential of using the cryo-cooler. From this study, it was determined that HayeSep Q was the best polymeric adsorbent with significant adsorption of CO2 at temperatures below −50 °C while being the best performing CF4 adsorbent. AA-300 was the best performing alumina in this study while having significant adsorption of CF4 at temperatures below −135 °C. However, from a compatibility standpoint, both of these materials need to be tested to determine their robustness in the presence of F2 and HF at room and reduced temperatures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CF4 adsorption; CO2 adsorption; COF2 adsorption; Cryo-cooler Adsorbent Separation; Excimer Laser; O2 Adsorption","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Carbon dioxide; Cooling systems; Excimer lasers; Gas chromatography; Polymers; Removal; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption potential; Adsorption separation; Chromatographic techniques; Compatible materials; Concentration pulse; Henry's Law constant; Polymeric adsorbent; Adsorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096641110

Biodiversity benchmark surveys traditionally require intense human labor inputs to find, identify, and record organisms limiting the rate and impact of scientific enquiry and discovery. Recent emergence and advancement of monitoring technologies have improved biodiversity data collection to a scale and scope previously unimaginable. Community science web platforms, smartphone applications, and technology assisted identification have expedited the speed and enhanced the volume of observational data all while providing open access to these data worldwide. How to integrate and leverage the data into valuable information on how species are changing in space and time requires new best practices in computational and analytical approaches. Here we integrate data from three community science repositories to explore how a specialist herbivore distribution changes in relation to host plant distributions and other environmental factors. We generate a series of temporally explicit species distribution models to generate range predictions for a specialist insect herbivore (Papilio cresphontes) and three predominant host-plant species. We find that this insect species has experienced rapid northern range expansion, likely due to a combination of the range of its larval host plants and climate changes in winter. This case study shows rapid data collection through large scale community science endeavors can be leveraged through thoughtful data integration and transparent analytic pipelines to inform how environmental change impacts where species are and their interactions for a more cost effective method of biodiversity benchmarking. © Copyright © 2021 Wilson, Casajus, Hutchinson, McFarland, Kerr, Berteaux, Larrivée and Prudic.","benchmarking biodiversity; biotic interactions; citizen science; climate change; species distribution models",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102681646

In contrast, soil fertilized with acidified slurry had lower N-NO3 values when compared to raw slurry fertilization treatments. Bacterial sequencing using Illumina MiSeq showed no differences in the genetic diversity of bacterial communities. In all tested soil samples, dominants at the phylum level were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria, while dominants at the class level were Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Thermoleophilia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Acidimicrobiia.

Using density functional theory, we study the impact of the intrinsic molecular dipole moments and the local charges induced by various molecular adducts on the energy and localization properties of the optically active defect-based exciton in a (10,5) SWCNT. The interplay of two effects plays a role in the localization of the exciton and, therefore, its red shift, but at different scales: The source of the leading order contribution is the defect conformation, resulting in the red shift of the defect-associated exciton with respect to the E11 band of the pristine SWCNT on the order of ∼100 meV, while the individual dipoles and polarization properties of molecular adducts lead to significantly smaller red shifts on the order of ∼10 meV. While the species-dependent trends in defect-induced charges do not directly correlate to the exciton red shift, the charge at the sp3-defect exhibits a distinct behavior between ortho- and para-defect configurations and is relevant to the chemical reactivity of the defect position depending on the adduct type.

Lung epithelial cells bear the brunt of PM2.5 exposure. In the present study, we found that exposure of A549 cells to the water-soluble fraction of PM2.5 (WS-PM2.5) promoted the expression and internalization of caveolin-1. Caveolin-1 knockdown restrained the endocytosis of WS-PM2.5. In addition, WS-PM2.5 accumulation in the cells induced the phosphorylation of serine/threonine protein kinase B (AKT) and nuclear factor κ-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB), as well as the expression of Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5). Inhibiting activation of AKT and NFκB also partly reduced WS-PM2.5 concentration in cells, but KLF5 knockdown did not affect the intracellular accumulation of WS-PM2.5. KLF5 knockdown suppressed cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1A1) expression and activated caspase 3. Luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that KLF5 positively regulated the transcription of KLF5. These results suggested that caveolin-1 was required for the endocytosis of WS-PM2.5. Intracellular accumulation of WS-PM2.5 activated AKT and NFκB, which facilitated WS-PM2.5 endocytosis.

However, while nearly 30 MXenes have already been synthesized, less carbonitride MXenes were experimentally reported so far, yet their potential promising electrochemical properties are greatly expected. Here, we explored the thermodynamically favorable configurations of Mo2(CN)Tx (T = F, OH, and O) with a mixture of functional groups under various electrochemical environments. It is revealed that the O*/OH*-terminated Mo-based carbonitride MXenes exhibit the most stable state under ambient conditions. By exploring the catalytic performance of HER for various Mo2(CxN1-x)T2 at different ratios of C and N atoms, we found that three optimal C/N ratios with 0.5 ML O∗ and 0.5 ML OH∗ showed good catalytic activity of HER, comparable to Pt metals. Further investigations of strain-tunable HER of the cofunctionalized Mo2(CxN1-x)OOH suggest that the biaxial strain may effectively modify the ΔGH* of HER, which can be ascribed to the asymmetrical surface topology and charge polarization. These results provide not only a strategy to synthesize carbonitride MXenes with various surface functionalizations but also a feasible solution to design by chemical doping and strain engineering. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbides; Carbon nitride; Catalyst activity; Electrocatalysts; Hydrogen; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Surface chemistry; Transition metals; Ambient conditions; Catalytic performance; Charge polarization; Electrical conductivity; Electrochemical environments; Functionalizations; Strain engineering; Transition metal carbide; Molybdenum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101807895

As each storage technology has different strengths and weaknesses, combinations of various storage solutions may lead to better techno-economic performance than singular approaches. To this purpose, an optimization model including a novel dispatch control strategy for a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is proposed, which uses biogas for long-term and batteries for short-term storage. The model optimizes for minimum lifetime costs while exploiting the biomass resources with maximum efficiency and quantifying the additional solar and battery capacities needed. It is applied in a case study with an innovative biomass-based polygeneration system in a rural locality of Bolivia to serve electricity, potable water, and bio-slurry as fertilizer. The results indicate that even with maximized efficiency of the biomass resource conversion, large PV and battery capacities are necessary to satisfy the electricity demand of the locality. Despite of the high investment costs, the biomass-based polygeneration system would cost 22% less over the project lifetime than the fossil-fuel based reference system while being less dependent on fuel price changes. It would also reduce CO2-emissions by over 98%. © 2020 The Author(s)","Bio-solar polygeneration; Dispatch strategy; Hybrid energy storage","Biogas; Biomass; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Fossil fuels; Investments; Optimization; Potable water; Alternative to fossil fuels; Electricity demands; Hybrid energy storage systems; Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS); Maximum Efficiency; Optimization modeling; Polygeneration system; Storage technology; Fuel storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098530970

The concept of a ""mega-region""is more accurate than that of a ""mega-city""for air quality management as there is an interaction between urban and non-urban emissions. Parallels are drawn between the GZB and the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) mega-region of central California for excessive wintertime PM2.5 concentrations. Long-Term chemical composition measurements show the usual high levels of organic and elemental carbon, minerals, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium. Wintertime provides prolonged high pressure systems in both areas punctuated by unstable precipitation events. Sluggish nighttime winds allow pollutants such as ammonia from distant agricultural operations, to mix with urban pollutants, sometimes serving as a reactor to create secondary sulfates and nitrates, and possibly some secondary organic compounds. A shallow surface layer forms at night in the SJV and GZB that couples to an upper level inversion after sunrise, allowing pollutants accumulated aloft to mix to the surface. Although current air quality management strategies have focused on urban emissions, and PM2.5 levels are on a downward trend, future management efforts must consider reducing emissions from a variety of sources in the larger region of these basins. Agricultural emissions are important in the SJV, but are just being addressed in the GZB. Tactics developed for the SJV would probably be effective in other areas of the world with similar emissions, topography, and meteorology. Experiments related to agricultural NOx emissions, emission inventory enhancements, source apportionment, and estimates of precursor limitations for ammonium nitrate formation, have been conducted in the SJV that can be tested in the GZB.

Although it is unlikely the government will meet this target, restoration projects are still underway. One restoration strategy involves blocking peatland drainage canals, but the consequences of this for smallholder farmers whose livelihoods are dependent on agriculture are unclear. This paper investigates perceived impacts of canal blocks on smallholder farmers and identifies factors that affect their willingness to accept canal blocks on their land. We use data from 181 household questionnaires collected in 2018 across three villages in Jambi province, Sumatra. We found that the majority of respondents would accept canal blocks on their farms, perceiving that the blocks would have no impact on yields or farm access, and would decrease fire risk. Respondents who would not accept blocks on their farms were more likely to use canals to access their farms and perceive that canal blocks would decrease yields. The majority of farmers unwilling to accept canal blocks did not change their mind when provided with an option of a block that would allow boat travel. Our results improve understanding of why some smallholders may be unwilling to engage with peatland restoration. Further research is needed to understand the impact of canal blocks on smallholders’ yields. Engaging with stakeholders from the outset to understand farmers’ concerns, and perceptions is key if the government is to succeed in meeting its peatland restoration target and to ensure that the costs and benefits of restoration are evenly shared between local stakeholders and other actors. © 2020, The Author(s).","Conservation social science; Environmental social science; Interviews; Perceptions; Questionnaires",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097785815

Biomass carbon is an important biophysical parameter of forest ecosystems that indicates carbon mitigation and human–forest interactions. Spectral modeling approach was used to assess the relation of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with biomass carbon, crown density, tree density, slope, altitude, aspect, species, and forest division in temperate conifer region of Himalaya. Field inventory was recorded from 188 biomass plots of 0.1 ha each across the study area. NDVI was observed to have a positive relation with aboveground biomass carbon, crown density, tree density, and altitude. The NDVI and ABC values ranged from (0.11 to 0.43) and (1.54 to 276.82 t ha−1), respectively. Among the aspects, highest and lowest average NDVI was observed for south east (0.289) and north (0.258), respectively. Similarly highest and lowest average aboveground biomass carbon was observed for north east (72.63 t ha−1) and east (44.30 t ha−1), respectively. NDVI expressed a fairly good relation with biophysical parameters including altitude, aspect, crown density, tree density, species, and location (forest division). NDVI using principal tree species composition (forest type) revealed a relation with aboveground biomass carbon for Cedrus deodara (R2 = 0.63), Mixed I (R2 = 0.61), Pinus wallichiana (R2 = 0.57), and Mixed-II (R2 = 0.48). NDVI demonstrates potential to understand biomass carbon variability through establishment of relations with forest biophysical parameters using spectral modeling approach. Varying NDVI can be ascribed to vegetation canopy density, number of stems, species, and altitude. The database and established relations would help indicate biomass carbon dynamics and enable to adopt site-specific management. The study further helps draw inferences on mitigation and adaptation perspectives in view of varying biophysical conditions that occur in a forest. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation; Biomass carbon; Biophysical factors; Himalayan temperate conifers; Mitigation; NDVI","aboveground biomass; adaptation; biomass; biophysics; coniferous forest; environmental assessment; factor analysis; forest ecosystem; human activity; management practice; mitigation; nature-society relations; NDVI; temperate environment; Himalayas; Cedrus deodara; Coniferophyta; Pinus wallichiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102563122

There is lack of deeper understanding on plant response to warming under differing site characteristics in the mountainous terrain. A 2-yr experiment was conducted in the high mountains of Bhutan. The objective was to investigate the effects of short-term artificial warming on high-altitude grassland vegetation at north- and south-facing sites. An artificially warmed environment was simulated using open-top chambers (OTCs) that were compared with control chambers experiencing ambient conditions. Variables measured were species diversity, species richness, proportions of plant functional groups, forage dry matter, and forage quality. Generally at the north-facing site, OTC treatment showed a lower species diversity (OTC treatment H' ≈2.35; Control treatment H' ≈2.75), species richness (OTC treatment MI ≈1.38; Control treatment MI ≈1.45), sedge abundance (OTC treatment sedge cover ≈14.5%; Control treatment sedge cover ≈25%), and crude protein content (OTC treatment CP ≈6.60%; Control treatment CP ≈7.70%). On both sites, OTC treatment had a higher grass abundance (OTC treatment grass cover ≈24.0%; Control treatment grass cover ≈17.0%) and higher dry matter content (OTC treatment DM ≈1.70 t ha−1; Control treatment DM ≈1.50 t ha−1). The study suggests that climate warming triggers shifts in vegetation characteristics of high-altitude grasslands in the rugged mountainous terrain, but the magnitude of shift varies according to site characteristics. Under warming, the north-facing site could experience greater vegetation change, characterized by reduced species diversity, species richness, proportion of sedge, and crude protein content. © 2020 The Society for Range Management","Dry matter; Forage quality; Global warming; Species diversity; Species richness","community structure; dry matter; experimental study; grass; grassland; mountain region; plant community; site selection; species diversity; species richness; Bhutan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098999593

Under the influence of climate change and human activities, the spatio-temporalattern of surface water is constantly changing, so it is of great significance to monitor its spatiotemporal changes quickly and accurately for the sustainable development of social economy and the management and protection of water resources. The shrinking of surface water bodies in the basin has caused a series of problems such as the degradation of ecological quality and the aggravation of urban heat island phenomenon, which seriously affected the quality of human life. In this paper, taking Erhai Lake Basin as the study area, the water bodies information in 1989,1999,2009 and 2019 is extracted and classified based on long-time Landsat remote sensing images. The temporal and spatial pattern of surface water in Erhai Lake Basin in recent 30 years is obtained, and the relationship between surface water change, climate change and human activities is discussed. © 2021 IEEE.","Erhai Lake Basin; Remote sensing; Spatio-temporal Changes; Surface water","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Ecology; Internet of things; Lakes; Remote sensing; Surface water resources; Agricultural productions; Ecological quality; Protection of water resources; Remote sensing data; Remote sensing images; Spatio-temporal changes; Surface water body; Temporal and spatial pattern; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104445900

However, EM fungal diversity, community composition, and underlying assembly processes in Inner Mongolia, China, where forests are typically semiarid and cold-temperate zones, attract less attention. In this study, we investigated EM fungal communities from 63 root samples of five common pine plants in Inner Mongolia across 1,900 km using Illumina Miseq sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer 2 region. We evaluated the impact of host plant phylogeny, soil, climatic, and spatial variables on EM fungal diversity and community turnover. Deterministic vs. stochastic processes for EM fungal community assembly were quantified using β-nearest taxon index scores. In total, we identified 288 EM fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to 31 lineages, of which the most abundant lineages were Tomentella–Thelephora, Wilcoxina, Tricholoma, and Suillus–Rhizopogon. Variations in EM fungal OTU richness and community composition were significantly predicted by host phylogeny, soil (total nitrogen, phosphorus, nitrogen–phosphorus ratio, and magnesium), climate, and spatial distance, with the host plant being the most important factor. β-nearest taxon index demonstrated that both deterministic and stochastic processes jointly determined the community assembly of EM fungi, with the predominance of stochastic processes. At the Saihanwula site selected for preference analysis, all plant species (100%) presented significant preferences for EM fungi, 54% of abundant EM fungal OTUs showed significant preferences for host plants, and 26% of pairs of plant species and abundant fungal OTUs exhibited remarkably strong preferences. Overall, we inferred that the high diversity and distinctive community composition of EM fungi associated with natural pine species in Inner Mongolia and the stochastic processes prevailed in determining the community assembly of EM fungi. Our study shed light on the diversity and community assembly of EM fungi associated with common pine species in semiarid and cold temperate forests in Inner Mongolia, China, for the first time and provided a better understanding of the ecological processes underlying the community assembly of mutualistic fungi. © Copyright © 2021 Wang, Zhang, Xu, Babalola, Xiang, Zhao and Fan.","community assembly; ectomycorrhizal fungi; fungal diversity; host phylogeny; pine species; plant-fungi preference; stochastic processes","internal transcribed spacer; internal transcribed spacer 2; magnesium; magnesium sulfate; nitrogen; phosphorus; rain; RNA 16S; Article; Ascomycetes; Basidiomycetes; Betaproteobacteria; Betula platyphylla; biogeography; bioinformatics; China; climate; cold stress; community structure; DNA extraction; ectomycorrhiza; Firmicutes; fungal community; genome size; geographic distribution; high throughput sequencing; Inner Mongolia; microbial community; microbial diversity; Mongolia; mucormycosis; nonhuman; phylogeny; pine; Planctomycetes; plant root; polymerase chain reaction; Proteobacteria; rhizosphere; Salicaceae; Sanger sequencing; sequence analysis; soil; soil microflora; stochastic model; taxon; temperate deciduous forest; Tricholoma; turnover rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103416200

A plethora of novel cluster anions have now been isolated from the reactions of polyanionic [Ex]q- precursors with low-valent d-/f-block metal complexes, main-group organometallics, or organics in polar aprotic solvents. The range of products includes intermetalloid clusters with transition metal atom(s) embedded in main-group element cages, organometallic Zintl anions in which [Ex]q- acts as a ligand, intermetallic Zintl anions where [Ex]q- is bridged by ligand-free transition metal atom(s), organo-Zintl anions where [Ex]q- is functionalized with organic-group(s), and oligomers formed through oxidative coupling reactions. The synthesis and characterization of these unconventional complexes, where important contributions to stability come from ionic, covalent, and metal-metal bonds as well as weaker aurophilic and van der Waals interactions, extend the boundaries of coordination chemistry and solid-state chemistry. Substantial progress has been made in this field over the past two decades, but there are still many mysteries to unravel related to the cluster growth mechanism and the controllable synthesis of targeted clusters, along with the remarkable and diverse patterns of chemical bonding that present a substantial challenge to theory. In this Account, we hope to shed some light on the relationship between structure, electronic properties, and cluster growth by highlighting selected examples from our recent work on homoatomic deltahedral [Ex]q- anions, including (1) germanium-based Zintl clusters, such as the supertetrahedral intermetallic clusters [M6Ge16]4- (M = Zn, Cd) and the sandwich cluster {(Ge9)2[η6-Ge(PdPPh3)3]}4- with a heterometallic Ge@Pd3 interlayer; (2) tin-based intermetalloid clusters [Mx@Sny]q- and the application of [Co@Sn9]4- in bottom-up synthesis; and (3) lead clusters with precious metal cores, including the largest Zintl anion [Au12Pb44]8-. In addition to their intrinsic appeal from a structural and electronic perspective, these new cluster anions also show promise as precursors for the development of new materials with applications in heterogeneous catalysis, where we have recently reported the selective reduction of CO2. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102963901

However, in reality, these species are often segregated due to localized sources and the influence of topography. In order to investigate the degree to which the rates of chemical reactions between two reactive species are reduced due to the possible segregation of species within the convective boundary layer, we perform large-eddy simulations (LESs) in the mountainous region of Hong Kong Island. We adopt a simple chemical scheme with 15 primary and secondary chemical species, including ozone and its precursors. We calculate the segregation intensity due to inhomogeneity in the surface emissions of primary pollutants and due to turbulent motions related to topography. We show that the inhomogeneity in the emissions increases the segregation intensity by a factor of 2-5 relative to a case in which the emissions are assumed to be uniformly distributed. Topography has an important effect on the segregation locally, but this influence is relatively limited when considering the spatial domain as a whole. In the particular setting of our model, segregation reduces the ozone formation by 8 %-12 % compared to the case with complete mixing, implying that the coarse-resolution models may overestimate the surface ozone when ignoring the segregation effect.</p>. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

In order to explore the regional differences in China’s provincial carbon emission intensity and the effect of relevant influencing factors, this paper combines EKC model and STIRPAT model to conduct research. Using carbon emission intensity and other influencing factors of China’s 30 provinces ranging from 2005 to 2017 to construct a panel data, the authors use exploratory spatial data analysis and Spatial Durbin Model to study the spatial effect of carbon emission intensity in China’s provincial regions and the impact of different development factors on carbon emission intensity. The results show that from 2005 to 2017, China’s carbon emission intensity gradually declined from east to west and from south to north. The inter-provincial carbon emission intensity of China presents an agglomeration effect in space, and the agglomeration effect gradually weakens with time. In addition, reducing energy intensity can reduce carbon emission intensity to a large extent. By optimizing industrial structure, increasing the degree of foreign trade and promoting financial development, carbon emission intensity can also be inhibited. Therefore, reducing the energy intensity of various industries and establishing inter-regional carbon emission cooperation mechanism will be effective to control the carbon emission intensity. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emission intensity; Economic development; Energy intensity; Environmental Kuznets curve; Exploratory spatial data analysis; Spatial Durbin Model","agglomeration; carbon emission; energy intensity; energy planning; environmental economics; financial system; industrial structure; regional development; spatial data; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; industry; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096307824

Herein, C3N5 as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction was investigated by density functional theory methods. The electronic and optical properties indicate that C3N5 has a longer visible-light region with 2.0 eV of band gap in comparison with g-C3N4. The spatial distributions of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) show that the π network of C3N5 is extended by introducing —N[dbnd]N— linkage, which results in much higher photocatalytic efficiency than g-C3N4. The Gibbs free energies for possible CO2 reaction paths on C3N5 were computed. The results show that CO2 can be reduced to CH4 with a low limiting potential of −0.54 V and to CH3CH2OH with a low limiting potential of −0.61 V, which all driven by solar energy.

This work experimentally studied the contribution of lubricating oil and its key constituents to the particle emission via monitoring the combustion process and analyzing the particle physic-chemical characteristics. Two sets of experiments were conducted to understand how the lubricating oil alters the regular combustion cycles and to study the effects of oil sulfur and metallic-ash constituents on the particle chemical characteristics, respectively. Details of the surface oxygenated functional groups and carbon chemical state on the particle surface were analyzed by XPS, while the FTIR was employed to characterize the possible functional groups in the bulk particle samples and the bonding patterns of the sulfur element. The effects on the particle morphology and elemental compositions were analyzed by SEM-EDS. Results show that the lubricating oil could shorten the ignition-delay phase combustion effectively, for instance, by 20% when 1wt% oil is burned along with diesel. Furthermore, more oxygenated surface functional groups and relatively more sp3 hybridization carbon shows up in the oil-derived particles. The sulfur element in the oil increases the oxygenated functional groups and lowers the aliphatic C[sbnd]H group by forming –SH radical. On the contrary, the metallic-ash fraction reduces the amount of oxygenated functional groups because the inorganic sulfates/phosphates occupy some oxygen atoms during the combustion reaction.

However, different spin states of the same metal atom have rarely been studied. In this study, a hydrazine-pretreatment strategy is presented toward high-spin-state nickel centers in nickel(II) phthalocyanine and porphyrin. Such high-spin-state nickel centers possess abundant unpaired 3d electrons and exhibit considerably enhanced activity for CO2 reduction. The high-spin-state nickel(II) phthalocyanine displays a higher CO faradaic efficiency than that of ground-state nickel(II) phthalocyanine (98.5% vs 93.2% at -0.7 V; the ratio of CO and H2 generated by high-spin-state nickel(II) phthalocyanine is approximately 5 times that generated by ground-state nickel(II) phthalocyanine). And the CO faradaic efficiency of nickel porphyrin increased from approximately 0% (ground state) to 25.0% (high spin state). Operando X-ray absorption fine structure analysis demonstrates that the high-spin-state nickel exhibits a stronger adsorption of CO2 and intermediates, which is beneficial to CO2 reduction. Theoretical calculations reveal that the high-spin-state nickel center shows a smaller highest-lowest occupied molecular orbital gap, which favors the production of the key intermediate*COOH, thus accelerating CO2 reduction. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","carbon dioxide reduction; hydrazine; nickel; phthalocyanine; spin state","Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Efficiency; Ground state; Molecular orbitals; Nitrogen compounds; Pollution control; Porphyrins; Spin dynamics; Transition metals; X ray absorption; Carbon dioxide reduction; Catalytic mechanisms; Faradaic efficiencies; Lowest occupied molecular orbitals; Molecular catalysts; Theoretical calculations; Transition-metal centers; X-ray absorption fine structure analysis; Nickel compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103453464

The construction of a series of dams along the upper reaches of the Min River, especially the Shuikou Dam, which started filling in 1993, modified the flow processes at the lower Min River, leading to the significant increase in low-flows and slightly decrease in flood-flows. At the same time, reservoirs have more effects on the sediment transport process than flow process by trapping most sediment in the reservoirs, and greatly reduced the amount of sediment transporting downstream. Increase in vegetation cover also contributes to the decrease in sediment yield. The reduction in sediment together with excessive sand mining in the lower Min River resulted in the severe downward erosion of the riverbed. Using a reformulated elasticity approach to quantifying climatic and anthropogenic contributions to sediment changes, the relative contribution of precipitation variability and human activities to sediment reduction in the lower Min River are quantified, which shows that the sediment reduction is fully caused by human activities (including land use/land cover changes and dam construction). © 2021 by the authors.","Anthropogenic impact; Dam construction; Elasticity approach; Hydrologic change; Precipitation; Streamflow; Suspended sediment; Vegetation","Climate change; Land use; Precipitation (meteorology); Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Anthropogenic contribution; Climate variability; Elasticity approaches; Land use/land cover change; Precipitation variability; Relative contribution; Sediment transport process; Southeastern china; Rivers; climate change; dam; dam construction; human activity; land cover; land use change; river flow; sediment transport; vegetation cover; China; Fujian; Min River [Fujian]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102660571

Here, we use a historical atmospheric circulation–precipitation relationship to constrain future modelled wet-season precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau. Our constraint reduces precipitation increases to half of those from the unconstrained ensemble and reduces spread by around a factor of three. This constrained precipitation is used with estimated glacier melt contributions to constrain future runoff for seven rivers. We estimate runoff increases of 1.0–7.2% at the end of the twenty-first century for global mean warming of 1.5–4 °C above pre-industrial levels. Because population projections diverge across basins, this runoff increase will reduce the population fraction living under water scarcity conditions in the Yangtze and Yellow basins but not in the Indus and Ganges basins, necessitating improved water security through climate change adaptation policies in these regions at higher risk. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"climate change; glacier; risk assessment; runoff; twenty first century; uncertainty analysis; warming; water storage; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100137390

The dissolution and convection of CO2 injected into brines are the primary trapping mechanisms to enhance storage efficiency and provide long-term storage security. The spatial mass transfer characteristics of convection in porous media remain poorly understood. In this study, two kinds of analogous fluid pairs were used as the equivalents of CO2-saturated brine and in situ brine. Density-driven convection experiments using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology in heterogeneous porous media were performed at various stages, including the diffusion stage, the unstable trigger stage and the convection development stage. Combined with the spatial evolution of the fingers and the change in MRI mean intensity, the local fluid concentration and overall mass transfer behavior could be quantified. Physical quantities associated with mass transfer by convection, such as the mixing layer thickness and scalar dissipation rate at the diffusion stages, the onset time at the unstable trigger stage, the average velocity of the front finger, the finger number, the transverse concentration gradient of the finger, and the sweep area of the finger at the convection development stage, were also analyzed systematically. We found that convective mixing substantially promotes mass transfer over pure diffusion, and the dissolution rate can be further enhanced by improving the injection method at each stage.

The aim of this paper is to assess the effects of these measures on China's CO2 emissions by using a newly proposed decomposition approach, which identified eight new factors related to the above realistic measures, i.e., energy saving and production technologies, industrial energy and production efficiencies, regional energy and production efficiencies, and pure energy and production efficiencies. The main findings indicate benefits from considerable technological progress in energy-saving and production during 2000–2016 period, and two technological factors contributed the most to emissions abatement and cumulatively reduced 5372.43 Mt and 1291.72 Mt CO2 emissions. The efforts of industrial restructuring promoted energy and production efficiency improvement, which further facilitated emission reduction. In contrast, the pure energy and production efficiency changes cumulatively led to 1080.26 Mt and 1135.85 Mt CO2 emissions growth during the whole sample period, suggesting that severe resource misallocation problems may exist in both the energy market and output market. Additionally, the Chinese government failed to narrow the technology gap between developed regions and underdeveloped regions, further restricting emission reduction. © 2020","Data envelopment analysis; Index decomposition analysis; Industrial restructuring; Market-oriented reform; Regional balanced development","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Global warming; Regional planning; Carbon dioxide emissions; Decomposition analysis; Decomposition approach; Industrial restructuring; Industrial structures; Market oriented reforms; Production technology; Technological progress; Energy efficiency; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; decomposition analysis; emission inventory; numerical model; regional development; technological development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098466473

Yet, meta-analyses synthesizing our understanding regarding the influences of climate and soil on the functional traits – AGB relationships at a community-level in global forests are still unavailable. Here, we evaluated the latitudinal gradient in the functional traits –AGB relationships in forests, including functional trait diversity (FTD) – AGB (FTD-AGB), community-weighted mean (CWM) of conservative traits (CWMCT-AGB), CWM of acquisitive traits (CWMAT-AGB), and CWM of plant maximum height or diameter (FunDom-AGB), and then answer the question whether climate and soil conditions modulate the functional traits – AGB relationships in global forests. To do so, we selected those studies which reported the relationships of FTD and CWM with AGB stock (i.e. in Mg ha−1) rather with AGB productivity or growth (i.e. Mg ha−1 yr−1) at a community-level (i.e. forest plot). By using piecewise structural equation meta-modeling, we found that: (1) functional traits – AGB relationships at a community-level were driven by mean annual temperature (MAT), aridity and soil fertility. (2) Higher MAT and low aridity promoted FTD-AGB relationships but the opposite trend was true for CWMCT-AGB, whereas higher MAT promoted CWMAT-AGB and FunDom-AGB at high aridity levels. (3) The FunDom-AGB relationship increased with increasing the number of forest plots but other relationships declined. (4) The negligible or negative FTD-AGB relationships but the positive AGB-FunDom relationships were conspicuous across global forests, indicating the mass ratio effect in terms of functional dominance. Our meta-analysis suggests that functional dominance and conservative species' strategy in relation to favorable abiotic conditions should be promoted to increase AGB stock under global environmental changes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aridity; Forest functioning; Functional traits; Mass ratio effect; Niche complementarity effect; Soil fertility; Temperature","Ecology; Soils; Abiotic conditions; Aboveground biomass; Functional traits; Global environmental change; Latitudinal gradients; Mean annual temperatures; Soil conditions; Structural equations; Forestry; carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; potassium; aboveground biomass; aridity; climate effect; ecosystem function; forest; latitudinal gradient; meta-analysis; niche; soil fertility; temperature effect; Article; biological trait; biomass; carbon storage; cation exchange; climate; concentration (parameter); dispersion; environmental change; evapotranspiration; forest; latitude; multiple linear regression analysis; nonhuman; plant leaf; plant seed; precipitation; priority journal; soil fertility; species richness; temperature; biomass; ecosystem; meta analysis; soil; tree; tropic climate; Biomass; Climate; Ecosystem; Soil; Trees; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095587828

However, whether the stimulating effect of NO3− on flooded soil still affects the response of nitrifiers and denitrifiers to subsequent water drainage remains unclear, as does the N2O emission dynamics. We conducted a microcosm experiment using intact paddy soil columns with three levels of NO3− treatment under flooded conditions: the application of NO3− solutions with 0, 60 and 200 kg KNO3-N per hectare (N0, N60, and N200, respectively). The N2O emission rate was measured using a closed chamber method, and the community composition and abundance of nitrifiers and denitrifiers were determined using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods, respectively. The results showed that all the added NO3− was exhausted during the flood period and below 0.50 mg kg−1 at the end of flooded incubation. Arch-amoA and narG gene abundance were significantly elevated by NO3− application before drainage. Then water drainage promoted the narG gene numbers of N60- and N200-treated soils increase by 109 copies g−1 more than N0 treatment, and the community compositions of narG- and nirK-containing denitrifiers differed significantly among the three NO3− treatments. In addition, draining resulted in clear shifts in the community structures of Arch-amoA- and Bac-amoA-containing nitrifiers in the N60-treated soils, and also resulted in higher increase of Arch-amoA gene abundance in the N60- and N200-treated soils than in N0 treatment. These results indicate that NO3− application on flooded soil enhance the response of Arch-amoA and narG gene abundance to subsequent water drainage. However, the differences in the denitrifier community had few correlations with N2O emissions during draining (p &gt; 0.05), while the Arch-amoA gene abundance in the N0- and N60-treated soils increased about 6.45 and 3.70 times respectively after drainage (p &lt; 0.05) and strongly correlated with higher N2O emissions (r &gt; 0.92, p &lt; 0.01). Considering the NH4+-N consumption and the NO3−-N production, we could speculate that the changes in the ammonia-oxidizing archaea community after drainage are only important regulators of N2O emission rates in this paddy soil columns. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS","Denitrifiers; N2O emissions; Nitrifiers; NO3− addition; Paddy soil; Water drainage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101251316

A large number of random and fluctuating wind power makes the system bear more and more risks, which has caused the dispatching department to pay increasing attention to regional wind power output. Although the upscaling method is widely used to predict regional wind power output, it still has shortcomings. This paper proposes a regional wind power prediction based on hierarchical clustering and upscaling method. This approach uses a greedy algorithm to search for the optimal number of sub-regions.

Based on the industrial boiler's emission inventory of air pollutants, measure-specific emission reductions from 2015 to 2017 was estimated in this study. Besides, the measure-specific environmental benefits of unit emission reduction on concentration and deposition flux were systematically evaluated by WRF-CMAQ model. The total emission reductions for CFIBs of PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NOx, Hg, As, Cd, Cr and Pb from 2015 to 2017 were 1.2 Tg, 0.53 Tg, 2.06 Tg, 0.65 Tg, 37.6 tons, 179.5 tons, 17.9 tons, 1029.3 tons and 676.0 tons, respectively. Based on meteorological fields in 2017, their corresponding national population-weighted mitigated concentration was 1.8 μg m−3, 1.3 μg m−3, 3.6 μg m−3, 0.6 μg m−3 (NO2), 0.076 ng m−3, 0.37 ng m−3, 0.04 ng m−3, 1.83 ng m−3 and 2.3 ng m−3, respectively. Updating APCDs was identified as the major measure to reduce air pollutants (except NOx), accounting for more than 35% of emission reductions and mitigated concentration. Moreover, elimination was the major NOx reduction method, contributing to 55% of NOx emission reductions. The promoting of fuels, including replacement of CFIBs with gas-fired and biomass-fired industrial boilers, had higher environmental benefits for unit emission reductions. Furthermore, there were still more than 43,000 CFIBs with the capacity &lt;10 t h−1, accounting for 14%, 21%, and 11% of total PM2.5, SO2, and NOX emissions for CFIBs in 2017; meanwhile, 20% and 59% of CFIBs did not install flue gas desulfurization and denitrification devices, respectively. Therefore, it is recommended to give priority to phase out CFIBs with capacity &lt;10 t h−1 and APCDs updating for larger capacity CFIBs in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution control measures; Coal-fired industrial boiler; Measure-specific environmental benefits; WRF-CMAQ","Air pollution control equipment; Boiler control; Coal fired boilers; Emission control; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas fired boilers; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollution control devices; Deposition fluxes; Emission inventories; Emission reduction; Environmental benefits; Flue gas desulfurization; Industrial boilers; Meteorological fields; Air pollution; arsenic; cadmium; chromium; lead; mercury; nitric oxide; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; coal-fired power plant; emission control; emission inventory; modeling; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; sulfur dioxide; air pollutant; air pollution control; Article; boiler; China; circulating fluidized bed boiler; Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System; concentration (parameter); controlled study; denitrification; desulfurization; grate fired boiler; model; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; pulverized coal boiler; Weather Research and Forecasting; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099705531

By empirically testing the actual inhibitory effect of China's total factor energy efficiency progress on PM2.5, this paper can provide a new evaluation index for energy conservation in China and help Chinese cities understand the beneficial environmental effect of total factor productivity (TFP) progress under the constraint of energy consumption to point out an effective path of energy conservation and emission reduction that is highly in line with China's current high-quality development strategy. Based on the panel data of 105 key environmental protection cities in China, this paper evaluates total factor energy efficiency with range directional model (RDM) and global Malmquist (GM) productivity index based on data envelopment analysis (DEA); it then uses spatial econometric models to test the impact of energy efficiency progress on PM2.5 concentration. The efficiency evaluation results show that the total factor energy efficiency of 105 key environmental protection cities has increased by an average of 35.9% from 2004 to 2015, with an average annual progress rate of 2.2%. Compared with Eastern and Central China, the progress of energy efficiency in the western region during 2004–2015 is relatively lagged. The average energy efficiency progress rate of higher administrative hierarchy cities and super cities with more than 10 million permanent residents is much higher than that of other cities. The results of GM index decomposition show that technological progress is the main driving force of energy efficiency progress. The spatial econometric analysis results show that there is a significant positive spatial autocorrelation in the concentration of PM2.5 in sample cities, and the energy efficiency progress can significantly inhibit the PM2.5 pollution in local and adjacent cities. The influence of each explanatory variable on PM2.5 concentration is mainly composed of the spatial spillover effect. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","DEA; Energy efficiency; Global Malmquist productivity index; PM 2.5; Spatial econometric","Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Productivity; Quality control; Development strategies; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Explanatory variables; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial econometric models; Technological progress; Total factor energy efficiencies; Total factor productivity; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098670229

A completely randomized design was conducted in the in vitro incubation, and 4 culture PG dose levels (0, 7.5, 15, and 22.5 μL/g of dry matter) were used in the trial. Based on the fermentation results, the control group (0 μL/g of dry matter, CON) and the second treatment group (15.0 μL/g of dry matter, TRT) were chosen for further analysis to explore the effects of PG on the bacterial and archaeal community structure. The concentrations of propanol, propanal, and succinate increased linearly, whereas the concentration of L-lactate decreased linearly as PG doses increased. The molar proportion of propionate demonstrated a linear increase with increasing PG doses. In contrast with propionate, the molar proportion of acetate and butyrate, and acetate-to-propionate ratio decreased linearly with increasing PG doses. The addition of PG markedly decreased methane production without negative effects on nutrient degradability. In the archaeal level, the relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter tended to decrease, but that of Methanomassiliicoccus significantly increased in TRT group. At the bacterial level, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Prevotella in TRT group was numerically higher than that in CON group. The analysis of the Negativicutes class showed that the relative abundance of Succiniclasticum tended to increase, whereas that of Selenomonas tended to decrease in TRT group. These results demonstrated that PG might be used as an inhibitor to mitigate methane emission. However, the small decrease in methane production will limit the application of PG as a methane inhibitor in production practices. Further research is needed to determine whether use together with other inhibitors may improve the effects of PG on the utilization of reducing equivalents ([H]) and methane production. © 2021 American Dairy Science Association","archaeal community; bacterial community; methanogenesis; propionate formation; propylene glycol","methane; animal; animal food; diet; digestion; female; fermentation; lactation; metabolism; microflora; rumen; Animal Feed; Animals; Diet; Digestion; Female; Fermentation; Lactation; Methane; Microbiota; Rumen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100115631

However, elucidating the role of a specific electronic state of metal oxide in simultaneously regulating the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) and competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still rare, making it difficult to accurately predict the practical CO2RR performance. Herein, replacing the Zn site by heteroatoms with different outer electrons (Mo and Cu) is found to tune both occupied and unoccupied orbitals near the Fermi level of ZnO. Moreover, the different electronic states significantly modulate both CO2RR and HER activity with a totally inverse trend, thus dramatically tuning the practical CO2RR performance. In parallel, the correlation between electronic states, reaction free energies and practical activity is demonstrated.

Notably, temporally growing and spatial agglomeration of high vehicular NOx emissions make an essential challenge to the mitigation strategy-makers. However, so far, there have been few studies to give insight into the socioeconomic drivers like the spatial imbalance of socioeconomic development, vehicle structure and road infrastructure to help governors. To fill the above gap, this study explores drivers of temporal change and spatial differences by building a temporal-spatial decomposition model and accounting for national and regional NOx emissions from vehicles in China from 2005 to 2015. Results show that, of all the driving forces in this study, only road vehicle carrying capacity (ΔNVI) acts as a primary driving force for both temporal growing and spatial agglomeration of vehicular NOx emissions in China. Regional vehicle emission intensity (ΔNNI) and road economic growth (ΔNEI) only mainly contributed to spatial agglomeration. While economic development (ΔNG) played a crucial role in the temporal growing of vehicular NOx emissions in China. These findings indicate that the future mitigation policy should fully cover the comprehensive socioeconomic factors, which would be useful for China and other developing countries when aiming to improve the performance of their current vehicle emissions policy system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agglomeration; China; Spatial differences; Temporal-spatial decomposition; Vehicular NOx emissions","Agglomeration; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Economics; Nitrogen oxides; Roads and streets; Mitigation policies; Mitigation strategy; Road infrastructures; Socio-economic development; Socio-economic factor; Spatial decompositions; Spatial differences; Vehicle structures; Road vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098593951

In order to understand the basic situation of China's low-carbon cities more specifically, this paper selects countries with different urbanization rates to carry out benchmarking analysis with China, hoping to draw on the experience of other countries from the national level through multi-dimensional comparison, and guide the direction of China's future urban development. Firstly, this paper selects the basic indicators such as the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions, per capita carbon emissions and carbon emissions per unit GDP of each country; Secondly, it compares the proportion of coal in energy and other indicators, and analyzes the energy structure of each country in depth; Thirdly, it compares the trend of carbon emissions in each country among 1990-2017. Finally, in order to reflect the carbon emission in the development of urbanization, this paper uses the ""urbanization carbon emission index"", which is the ratio of per capita carbon emission and urbanization rate, to show the relationship between the degree of urbanization and carbon emission. Through benchmarking analysis, we can more clearly understand the overall trend of low-carbon city construction in different countries, recognize the gap between China and other countries, and better guide the development of low-carbon cities in China in the future. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Benchmarking; Carbon dioxide; Coal industry; Global warming; Pollution control; Sustainable development; Ecological environments; Economy and society; Energy structures; Foreign countries; Low-carbon cities; Multi dimensional; Total amount of carbons; Urban development; Urban growth",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103269516

We also find that the number of polluting firms shrank by 48% (and by even more among small and micro firms) after the implementation of the central environmental protection inspection. Furthermore, the central environmental protection inspection signiﬁcantly reduces industrial chemical oxygen demand (COD) emissions by at least 46.5% without affecting the production output of surviving firms. These findings are robust to alternative specifications and different sampling strategies. This paper opens up a new viewpoint to focus on the effect of the central environmental protection inspection on corporate environmental actions. The available evidence leads us to cautiously conclude that environmental campaign-style enforcement promotes firms meeting emissions reduction goals in the short term through end-of-pipe abatement. A long-term inspection mechanism and incentives for firms to carry out green transformations are thus recommended for future practice. © 2021","Campaign-style enforcement; Central environmental protection inspection; China; Industrial pollution reduction","Chemical oxygen demand; Emission control; Environmental protection; Emissions reduction; Environmental action; Environmental issues; Environmental statistics; Production outputs; Sampling strategies; Short term; South China; Inspection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099314994

However, there are some challenges, such as difficult large-scale preparation, weak interface connection, limited active sites, and inefficient light utilization, which restrain the further utilization for carbon modified g-C3N4. To solve these disadvantages, we recommended a novel and general surface grafting strategy followed by thein situcarbonization treatment to obtain carbon-modified graphitic carbon nitride (CMCN). Experimental results disclose that the introduced carbon connected intimately with g-C3N4by edge N atoms, which dramatically improve the charge transfer kinetics. CMCN presents incredibly reinforced visible light photocatalytic activity with an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of 5.549 mmol g−1h−1, which is about 13.3 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4. Theoretical calculation results show that the introduced carbon can form a new intermediate state between the bandgap, which could capture the photoexcited electrons and reinforce the visible light absorption. Importantly, the practicality of the CMCN material is further demonstrated by replacing a sacrificial reagent with benzyl alcohol conversion to produce value-added benzaldehyde, where the decent evolution rates of 0.288 and 0.230 mmol g−1h−1can be achieved for H2and benzaldehyde, respectively. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Charge transfer; Grafting (chemical); Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Light; Light absorption; Benzyl alcohol conversion; Benzyl alcohol oxidation; Charge transfer kinetics; Hydrogen evolution rate; Large scale preparation; Theoretical calculations; Visible light absorption; Visible light photocatalytic activity; Photocatalytic activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102982146

Quantifying the spatiotemporal patterns of WUE at both canopy and ecosystem levels across main dryland ecosystems along climate gradients is vital for water resource management in water-limited regions. However, the patterns of WUE among natural and managed ecosystems in drylands are not well understood. We partitioned the evapotranspiration (ET) components and calculated WUE at both canopy and ecosystem levels across dryland ecosystems in an arid region in Northwest China using observations from a regional flux observation network. Our results showed divergent variations of canopy and ecosystem WUE across the main ecosystems along climate gradients in arid regions. The ecosystem WUE and canopy WUE ranged from 0.7 to 1.8 gC Kg−1 H2O and from 0.8 to 2.4 gC Kg−1 H2O, respectively. Climatic gradients were the dominant factors controlling the spatial patterns of WUE across dryland ecosystems. Divergences were also observed between oasis and natural ecosystems because of different environmental conditions and management practices. Climatic regulation of the spatial WUE patterns was dominated by water variability rather than temperature. The higher canopy WUE for desert ecosystems indicated that these ecosystems were adapted to the water-limited environment. The discrepancies of both canopy and ecosystem WUE between croplands in arid and hyper-arid climate zones were caused by the differences in agricultural management techniques for these crops. Human activities (e.g., irrigation and agriculture management) altered the distribution of water resource and water use strategies, which further affected the magnitude and patterns of WUE in drylands. This study provides insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of ET components and both canopy and ecosystem WUE over dryland ecosystems and can inform regional water resources management in water-limited regions. © 2020","Arid and semi-arid regions; Carbon and water fluxes; Evapotranspiration partitioning; Gross ecosystem production; Heihe River Basin; Water availability","agricultural management; alpine environment; arid region; canopy architecture; desert; evapotranspiration; oasis agriculture; water stress; water use efficiency; China; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097761192

The AEM oxides, especially BaO, were found to improve the CLC performance of IO greatly due to the formation of AEM ferrites, which promoted the lattice oxygen activity. When using the pristine IO, less than 10% of the input H2S could be removed with the remaining being released from the reactor mainly in the form of SO2. The loadings of CaO and MgO were also found to be ineffective in sulfur removal from the syngas, because the sulfur fixation reactions were kinetically and thermodynamically limited for CaO and MgO, respectively. By contrast, over 60% of the input H2S was effectively retained on the BaO-loaded OC in the form of sulfates/sulfites because of the high reactivity between BaCO3 and H2S in the presence of Fe2O3. This study indicates that the IO loaded with BaO showed superior performance both in CLC of syngas and control of sulfur species, which can be used in the CLC of sulfur containing fuels to realize a cleaner combustion process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alkaline earth metal; Chemical looping combustion; H2S; Oxygen carrier; Sulfur removal","Alkaline earth metals; Alkalinity; Calcium oxide; Hematite; Hydrogen sulfide; Iron ores; Magnesia; Municipal solid waste; Oxygen; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Synthesis gas; Waste incineration; Alkaline earth metal oxides; Chemical-looping combustion; Combustion pro-cess; High reactivity; Lattice oxygen; Oxygen Carrier; Simulated municipal solid waste; Syn-gas; Barium compounds; alkaline earth metal; alkalinity; chemical method; combustion; control system; hydrogen sulfide; iron ore; municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097737494

Although it is widely acknowledged that dynamics of grassland biomass is significantly regulated by climate change, in situ evidence at meaningfully large spatiotemporal scales is limited. Here, we combine biomass measurements from six long-term (&gt; 30 years) experiments and data in existing literatures to explore the spatiotemporal changes in AGB in Inner Mongolian temperate grasslands. We show that, on average, annual AGB over the past 4 decades is 2561, 1496 and 835 kg ha−1, respectively, in meadow steppe, typical steppe and desert steppe in Inner Mongolia. The spatiotemporal changes of AGB are regulated by interactions of climatic attributes, edaphic properties, grassland type and livestock. Using a machine-learning-based approach, we map annual AGB (from 1981 to 2100) across the Inner Mongolian grasslands at the spatial resolution of 1 km. We find that on the regional scale, meadow steppe has the highest annual AGB, followed by typical and desert steppe. Future climate change characterized mainly by warming could lead to a general decrease in grassland AGB. Under climate change, on average, compared with the historical AGB (i.e. average of 1981-2019), the AGB at the end of this century (i.e. average of 2080-2100) would decrease by 14 % under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 28 % under RCP8.5. If the carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment effect on AGB is considered, however, the estimated decreases in future AGB can be reversed due to the growing atmospheric CO2 concentrations under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The projected changes in AGB show large spatial and temporal disparities across different grassland types and RCP scenarios. Our study demonstrates the accuracy of predictions in AGB using a modelling approach driven by several readily obtainable environmental variables and provides new data at a large scale and fine resolution extrapolated from field measurements. © Author(s) 2021.

In the context of low-carbon technology transition in China's energy sector, this paper uses panel data of 30 provinces from 2000 to 2017, totally 297,721 patent data, and empirically examines how environmental regulation affects regional energy low-carbon technology innovation and diffusion under the framework of the ""Porter Hypothesis"". In addition, regional heterogeneity is also considered and the sub-samples of eastern, central and western regions were studied separately. The conclusions show significant heterogeneity in regions. The eastern region, which is less dependent on industries with high emissions and energy consumption, environmental regulation does not affect the innovation and diffusion of low-carbon technology in the energy sector. With the increasing intensity of environmental regulation, only the diffusion of low-carbon technology in the central region has been significantly improved, indicating that this region mainly adopts the introduction and learning of existing low-carbon technologies to meet the demand of emission reduction. Under the circumstances of high risk, uncertainty, sunk cost and opportunity cost brought by low-carbon energy technology, covered companies in western region are more inclined to relocate limited resources to schemes rather than low-carbon innovation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Climate change; Diffusion; Emission control; Energy utilization; Engineering education; Environmental regulations; Greenhouse gases; Patents and inventions; Risk management; Eastern regions; Emission reduction; Emission sources; Low-carbon energy technology; Low-carbon technologies; Opportunity costs; Porter hypothesis; Western region; Environmental technology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102771162

The Loess Plateau has suffered serious erosion in the past decades, and revegetation projects, such as those under the ‘Grain for Green’ program, have been conducted for soil erosion prevention. The irrational distribution of artificial plantations had negative consequences, including vegetation degradation, soil drying, and decreases in streamflow. Determining the suitable plant species is critical in guiding the design of revegetation programs and may help delimit the suitable boundaries for artificial plantations. In this study, we used an eco-hydrological model to quantify the suitability of two typical revegetation species (Robinia pseudoacacia and Stipa bungeana) using a developed vegetation suitability equation, which estimates the water use/water stress trade-off. The results showed that R. pseudoacacia was more sensitive to water stress than S. bungeana. The water use of both species varied along the precipitation gradient, and S. bungeana generally had a higher water use than R. pseudoacacia. Suitable areas for R. pseudoacacia were mainly located in the northeastern part of the plateau. By overlaying the suitable boundaries for R. pseudoacacia on the current land cover, we found that the area of forests distributed in unsuitable regions reached 7.31% of the entire Loess Plateau. Converting forests beyond the suitable boundary to grasslands would increase the water yield (0.51%–12.23%) and slightly decrease the soil retention capacity (0.01%–0.08%), resulting in a ‘win-win’ situation for sustainable plant-soil ecosystems and soil-water conservations.

However, most reported reactions, such as ethylene epoxidation, ammonia decomposition and H–D bond formation are exothermic, and only H–D bond formation has been achieved at room temperature. These reactions require low activation energies (&lt;2 eV), which are readily attained using visible-frequency localized surface plasmons (from ~1.75 eV to ~3.1 eV). Here, we show that endothermic reactions that require higher activation energy (&gt;3.1 eV) can be initiated at room temperature by using localized surface plasmons in the deep-UV range. As an example, by leveraging simultaneous excitation of multiple localized surface plasmon modes of Al nanoparticles by using high-energy electrons, we initiate the reduction of CO2 to CO by carbon at room temperature. We employ an environmental transmission electron microscope to excite and characterize Al localized surface plasmon resonances, and simultaneously measure the spatial distribution of carbon gasification near the nanoparticles in a CO2 environment. This approach opens a path towards exploring other industrially relevant chemical processes that are initiated by plasmonic fields at room temperature. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Activation energy; Aluminum; Aluminum metallography; Ammonia; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Chemical bonds; Ethylene; Light sources; Nanoparticles; Plasmons; Transmission electron microscopy; Ammonia decomposition; Endothermic reactions; Environmental transmission electron microscopes; Ethylene epoxidation; Localized surface plasmon; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Low-activation energy; Metallic nanoparticles; Surface plasmon resonance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094954400

In this paper, we examine the feasibility, costs, and carbon benefits of using electric bike-sharing-a low carbon form of ride-sharing-as a potential substitute for shorter ride-sharing trips, with the overall goal of greening the ride-sharing ecosystem. Using public datasets from New York City, our analysis shows that nearly half of the taxi and rideshare trips in New York are shorts trips of less than 3.5km, and that biking is actually faster than using a car for ultra-short trips of 2km or less. We analyze the cost and carbon benefits of different levels of ride substitution under various scenarios. We find that the additional bikes required to satisfy increased demand from ride substitution increases sub-linearly and results in 6.6% carbon emission reduction for 10% taxi ride substitution. Moreover, this reduction can be achieved through a hybrid mix that requires only a quarter of the bikes to be electric bikes, which reduces system costs. We also find that expanding bike-share systems to new areas that lack bike-share coverage requires additional investments due to the need for new bike stations and bike capacity to satisfy demand but also provides substantial carbon emission reductions. Finally, frequent station repositioning can reduce the number of bikes needed in the system by up to a third for a minimal increase in carbon emissions of 2% from the trucks required to perform repositioning, providing an interesting tradeoff between capital costs and carbon emissions. © 2021 ACM.","Carbon Emission; Electric Bikes; Optimization; Ride Substitution","Bicycles; Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Emission control; Taxicabs; Urban transportation; Capital costs; Carbon analysis; Carbon benefits; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; New York city; Ride-sharing; System costs; Electric bikes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103665907

This effort relies heavily on renewable electricity and calls for a transition that is: (i) flexible enough to accommodate existing and new electricity end uses and users; (ii) resilient in response to climate change and other threats to electricity infrastructure; (iii) cost-effective in comparison to alternatives; and (iv) just in the face of energy systems that are often the result of—or the cause of—procedural, distributive, and historical injustices. Acknowledging the intertwined roles of technology and policy, this work provides a cross-disciplinary review of how microgrids may contribute to renewable electricity systems that are flexible, resilient, cost-effective, and just (including illustrative examples from Korea, California, New York, the European Union, and elsewhere). Following this review of generalized microgrid characteristics, we more closely examine the role and potential of microgrids in two United States jurisdictions that have adopted 100% renewable electricity standards (Hawai‘i and Puerto Rico), and which are actively developing regulatory regimes putatively designed to enable renewable microgrids. Collectively, this review shows that although microgrids have the potential to support the transition to 100% renewable electricity in a variety of ways, the emerging policy structures require substantial further development to operationalize that potential. We conclude that unresolved fundamental policy tensions arise from justice considerations, such as how to distribute the benefits and burdens of microgrid infrastructure, rather than from technical questions about microgrid topologies and operating characteristics. Nonetheless, technical and quantitative future research will be necessary to assist regulators as they develop microgrid policies. In particular, there is a need to develop socio–techno–economic analyses of cost-effectiveness, which consider a broad range of potential benefits and costs. © 2021 by the authors.

Because soil microbial communities play a critical role in regulating C fluxes from soils, we examined microbial activity and greenhouse gas production soon after permafrost thaw and ground collapse (into collapse-scar bogs), relative to the permafrost plateau or older thaw features. Using multiple field and laboratory-based assays at a field site in interior Alaska, we show that the youngest collapse-scar bog had the highest CH4 production potential from soil incubations, and, based upon temporal changes in porewater concentrations and 13C-CH4 and 13C-CO2, had greater summer in situ rates of respiration, methanogenesis, and surface CH4 oxidation. These patterns could be explained by greater C and N availability in the young bog, while alternative terminal electron accepting processes did not play a significant role. Field diffusive CH4 fluxes from the young bog were 4.1 times greater in the shoulder season and 1.7–7.2 times greater in winter relative to older bogs, but not during summer. Greater relative CH4 flux rates in the shoulder season and winter could be due to reduced CH4 oxidation relative to summer, magnifying the importance of differences in production. Both the permafrost plateau and collapse-scar bogs were sources of C to the atmosphere due in large part to winter C fluxes. In collapse scar bogs, winter is a critical period when differences in thermokarst age translates to differences in surface fluxes. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

However, a dense deployment of BHEs may lead to thermal interference between neighboring boreholes and thereby to over-exploitation of the heat capacity of the ground. Here we propose a novel method to estimate the technical potential of BHEs which takes into account potential thermal interference as well as the available area for BHE installations. The method combines simulation of the long-term heat extraction through BHEs for a range of borehole spacings and depths and includes an optimisation step to maximise the heat extraction. Application of the method to a case study in western Switzerland, from an available area of 284km2, yields an annual technical potential of 4.65TWh and a maximum energy density of 15.5kWh/m2. The results also suggest that, for a minimum borehole spacing of 5m and a maximum borehole depth of 200m, the cumulative installed borehole depth should not exceed 2km/ha. The estimated technical potential can be used by urban planners for the techno-economic analysis of BHE systems and by policy makers to develop strategies that encourage the use of shallow geothermal energy. © 2020 The Authors","Borehole heat exchangers; Geographic information systems; Numerical modelling; Potential estimation; Shallow geothermal energy","Boreholes; Economic analysis; Extraction; Heat exchangers; Specific heat; Well spacing; Borehole heat exchangers; Geothermal potential; Shallow boreholes; Shallow geothermal energies; Technical potential; Techno-Economic analysis; Thermal interferences; Western Switzerland; Geothermal energy; economic analysis; geothermal energy; heat capacity; installation; optimization; policy making; simulation; urban planning; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096562223

By using a large vegetation-plot database, we asked how local richness and abundance of alien species vary by regions, elevation, climate, soil properties, human disturbance, and habitat types. Location: Western, central and southern Europe. Methods: We linked consolidated data from the European Vegetation Archive (16,211 plots) to a habitat classification scheme, climate, soil properties and human disturbance variables. In addition, we used 250 km × 250 km regional grid cells to test whether local patterns differ among regions. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) and quantile GAMs to explore how relative alien species richness and the sum of alien species covers per plot relate to predictors. Random Forest analyses (RFs) were employed to assess the importance of individual predictors that were not multicollinear. Results: Relative alien species richness and the sum of alien species covers varied across regions and habitat types, with effects being more pronounced at the maximum rather than average responses. Both response variables declined with increasing elevation and distance to the nearest road or railroad and increased with the amount of sealed soil. Maxima in fitted functions matched plots from regional invasion hotspots in northwestern and central Europe. RFs accounted for 39.6% and 20.9% of the total variation in relative alien species richness and the sum of alien species covers, respectively, with region and habitat being the most important variables. Conclusions: The importance of maximum response quantiles and the prevalence of regional hotspots point to invasion debt in European woodlands. As alien plants expand further, their species richness and abundance in woodlands will be likely driven by the shared effects of the introduction and planting history, differences in the invaded habitat types, and dispersal corridors. © 2021 International Association for Vegetation Science","alien plants; biological invasions; Europe; European Vegetation Archive; exotic plants; forest; habitat type; invasibility; neophytes; non-native plants","abundance; biological invasion; classification; database; dispersal; habitat type; human activity; introduced species; species richness; woodland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105046558

Methods of sampling sediments at these source areas for the purposes of dust characterisation are varied and can produce different representations of emitted dust. This study systematically compared dust characterisations from three established approaches for estimating dust emission potential, namely: Big Spring Number Eight (BSNE) traps, a Portable In-situ Wind Erosion Laboratory (PI-SWERL) wind tunnel, and bulk surface sampling, at a known Namib Desert dust source. Individual particle analysis by auto-SEM (QEMSCAN) allowed comparison of size, shape, mineralogy and elemental composition at micrometre-scale for samples from the three approaches. BSNE samples consisted of a lower proportion of fine sediment (<20 µm particle diameter) than PI-SWERL-derived samples, with this performance possibly influenced by atmospheric humidity. In comparison, PI-SWERL characterised the dust with relatively fewer particles between 63 and 100 µm, a fraction that was more evident in both the BSNE-derived and surface sediments. The reduced representation of this coarser fraction resulted in appreciable differences in particle shape and mineralogic characteristics compared to BSNE and surface-derived samples. The different representations by the three methods return variable dust characteristics at source across fundamental properties of particle size, shape and mineralogy. Awareness of the different representations of dust caused by sampling technique remains essential for the appropriate physical and geochemical characterisation of aeolian dust and highlights how standardised techniques are important for meaningful comparisons, while methods to achieve accurate characterisation remain a priority for the discipline. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Auto-SEM; BSNE; Individual particle analysis; Mineral dust; PI-SWERL; Sampling","eolian deposit; geochemical method; mineral dust; physical analysis; sampling; scanning electron microscopy; sediment trap; source identification; wind erosion; Namib Desert; Namibia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103227390

The fuel, in this case coal, is burned with pure oxygen instead of air in the oxy-fuel process. Since combustion with pure oxygen results in very high temperatures, flue gas must be recirculated and returned to the combustion chamber to lower and control the combustion temperature. This in turn leads to significantly higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and water vapor in the flue gas of the power plant boiler compared to the regular air-fired process, which result in increased radiant heat transfer to the evaporator tubes along the combustion chamber walls. Efficient models are available that can be applied to the numerical simulation of combustion chambers. A widely used model is the Weighted Sum of Gray Gases Model (WSGGM).In this work, the combustion chamber of an oxy-fuel power plant on a demonstration scale with an electrical output of 250 MWel was simulated to compare the results of different gas and particle radiation models. The gas radiation was modelled with the different WSGG model formulations. In addition, the influence of particle radiation was investigated. Therefore the emissivity of the particles were correlated to experimental data. The results corresponds in all cases with the output design of the power plant. The combustion exit temperature is slightly over-predicted for all models and particle properties. It has shown that the particle radiation has a strong influence on the heat wall flux in the burner region where the particle load is high. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CFD (Computational fluid dynamics); Oxy-fuel combustion; Radiation modelling; Weighted-sum-of-gray-gases model (WSGGM)","Boilers; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Coal combustion; Combustion chambers; Flue gases; Fuels; Oxygen; Power plants; Scales (weighing instruments); Combustion chamber walls; Combustion temperatures; Model formulation; Particle properties; Particle radiation; Power plant boiler; Radiation calculations; Weighted-sum-of-gray-gases models; Heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098466427

To identify regions experiencing secular change in their water resources, many studies compute linear trends in the total water storage (TWS) anomaly derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission data. Such analyses suggest that several major water systems are under stress (Rodell et al 2009 Nature 460 999-1002; Long et al 2013 Geophys. Res. Lett. 40 3395-401; Richey et al 2015 Water Resour. Res. 51 5217-38; Voss et al 2013 Water Resour. Res. 49 904-14; Famiglietti 2014 Nat. Clim. Change. 4 945-8; Rodell et al 2018 Nature 557 651-9). TWS varies in space and time due to low frequency natural variability, anthropogenic intervention, and climate-change (Hamlington et al 2017 Sci. Rep. 7 995; Nerem et al 2018 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci.). Therefore, linear trends from a short time series can only be interpreted in a meaningful way after accounting for natural spatiotemporal variability in TWS (Paolo et al 2015 Science 348 327-31; Edward 2012 Geophys. Res. Lett. 39 L01702). In this study, we first show that GRACE TWS trends from a short time series cannot determine conclusively if an observed change is unprecedented or severe. To address this limitation, we develop a novel metric, trend to variability ratio (TVR), that assesses the severity of TWS trends observed by GRACE from 2003 to 2015 relative to the multi-decadal climate-driven variability. We demonstrate that the TVR combined with the trend provides a more informative and complete assessment of water storage change. We show that similar trends imply markedly different severity of TWS change, depending on location. Currently more than 3.2 billion people are living in regions facing severe water storage depletion w.r.t. past decades. Furthermore, nearly 36% of hydrological catchments losing water in the last decade have suffered from unprecedented loss.

Sometimes, however, adaptation to climate change may consume energy, threatening efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Examples are numerous, and include the use of air conditioning or water desalination. Nevertheless, no clear view exists on how energy demand globally can be impacted by climate change. In this paper we systematically map existing evidence on how and to what extent adaptation responses to climate change may impact energy demand. The literature is large, fast-growing and spans several disciplines, but we identify several research gaps. First, the literature focuses almost exclusively on heating and cooling demand, while overlooking other potential sectors. It also focuses heavily on a few world regions, while local specific climate and socio-economic conditions may highly influence the impacts, and focuses largely on average demand, while often disregarding peak energy demand. Finally, and most importantly, only a handful of papers-most of them with a specific geographical scope-consider that different adaptation possibilities may lead to different impacts on energy demand, which is an important prerequisite if the impact of adaptation on energy demand is to be lowered and maladaptation to be avoided. The reviewed papers study for the most part similar options, and most adaptation possibilities are conversely studied by just one or two papers. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, only limited assessments exist for Indonesia despite extensive burning and globally important carbon emissions. We evaluated the accuracy of four MODIS-derived (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) burned area products (MCD45A1 collection 5.1, MCD64A1 (collection 5.1 and 6), FireCCI51), and their sensitivity to burned-area size and temporal window length used for detection. The products were compared to reference burned areas from SPOT 5 imagery using error matrices and linear regressions. The MCD45A1 product detected &lt;1% of burned areas. The other products detected 38%-48% of burned area with accuracies increasing modestly (45%-57%) when smaller burns (&lt;100 ha) were excluded, with MCD64A1 C6 performing best. Except for the MCD45 product, linear regressions showed generally good agreement in peatlands (R2 ranging from 0.6 to 0.8) but detections were less accurate in non-peatlands (R2 ranging from 0.2 to 0.5). Despite having higher spatial resolution, the FireCCI51 product (250 m) showed lower accuracy (OE = 0.55-0.88, CE = 0.33-0.50) than the 500 m MCD64A1 C6 product (OE = 0.43-0.79, CE = 0.36-0.51) but it was comparable to the C5.1 product (OE = 0.52-0.91, CE = 0.37-0.67). Dense clouds and smoke limited the accuracies of all burned area products, even when the temporal window for detection was lengthened. This study shows that emissions calculations based on burned area in peatlands remain highly uncertain. Given the globally significant amount of emissions from burning peatlands, specific attention is required to improve burned area mapping in these regions in order for global emissions models to accurately reflect when, where, and how much emissions are occurring. © 2021 The Author(s).

An intersectional framework yields implications for research and policy in two ways, both broadly and specifically for marginalized groups. First, climate change research and policy would benefit from a more active articulation of intersectionality in its models of adaptation and vulnerability by recognizing groups at high risk for negative outcomes, including distress and displacement.

For this reason, there is a need for a review of building standards and adaptation to the context of energy performance in planning future projects. The objective of this research was to ascertain the thermal transmittance of external walls for single-family homes and to establish the energetically optimal thickness of thermal insulation by using an energy simulation to maintain heating energy consumption in conditions of climate change while following the state regulations in the Los Ríos region of Chile. It was demonstrated that for each time period and in each geographical location of the region the optimal U-value of the external walls is different. For a house to have a heating energy consumption corresponding to 90 kWh/m2/year, it must have an optimal average U-value of the walls of 0.49 ± 0.11 W/m2K (year 2006 in the study region); however, for the period 2035–2050, this value is expected to reach 0.78 ± 0.14 W/m2K. In addition, it was shown that designing the house with an energy performance perspective of 15 years helps to reduce the carbon footprint of the use of thermal insulation in the walls by 20%.

Our improved analysis of the hydrogen Balmer series shows that plasma–molecule processes are strongly contributing to the Balmer series intensities and substantially alter the divertor detachment particle balance. We find that Molecular Activated Recombination (MAR) ion sinks from H2+ (and possibly H−) are a factor ∼5 larger than Electron–Ion Recombination (EIR) and are a significant contributor to the observed reduction in the outer divertor ion target flux. Molecular Activated Ionisation (MAI) appears to be substantial during the detachment onset, but further research is required into its magnitude given its uncertainty. Plasma–molecule interactions enhance the Balmer line series emission strongly near the target as detachment proceeds. This indicates enhancements of the Lyman series, potentially affecting power balance in the divertor. As those enhancements vary spatially in the divertor and are different for different transitions, they are expected to result in a separation of the Lyβ and Lyα emission regions.

While their position of political influence in the Republican coalition is widely recognised, the full range of effects of this position on evangelicals' climate opinions is not. To move research on evangelicals from the margins of climate change opinion research, we review and integrate the interdisciplinary literature on US evangelicals, climate change, and politics. In assessing this literature, we identify three areas in need of further research. First, there is a critical need for more research on the climate attitudes of evangelicals of color, who comprise a growing share of the evangelical tradition in the US. Second, highlighting the Christian Right's active engagement in the climate debate, we identify a need for more experimental work examining how cues from religious elites may shape evangelicals' opinions. Finally, we suggest that to better harness insights across disciplines, researchers must become more explicitly aware of how different disciplines conceptualize temporality. Attending to temporal scale suggests that a new approach is needed to test how dominion beliefs, which are widely thought to be an important theological driver of climate skepticism, operate. We also suggest that two factors that appear to play a weak or limited role in driving climate skepticism over the short term (anti-science attitudes and evangelical religiosity) may in fact play a significant role in driving skepticism over the medium term.

The authors determined that energy policy renewal should consider Ukraine’s commitments to transition to a carbon-neutral economy. The systematization of scientific achievements shows that one of the priority tasks is to minimize the gaps in the energy efficiency of the national economy. It is established that, despite the significant scientific achievements in this area, the scientific community has not adopted a single approach to assessing energy efficiency yet. The purpose of this article is to assess the energy efficiency gaps in the national economy, in order to identify their peak values and the factors causing them, and appropriate mechanisms to minimize them. The energy efficiency gaps are assessed using frontal analysis and Shepard’s energy distance function. Analytical data from the World Bank, the Swiss Institute of Economics, and the International Energy Agency form the information base. The study applied software package Stata 14 for calculation the energy efficiency gaps for Ukraine for 2002–2019. The study applied the Shepard’s function translogarithmic, stochastic frontier analysis for the assessment of energy efficiency gaps. According to the study results, the average level of energy efficiency gaps is 0.12, and their values became the largest in 2009 and 2015. First of all, this is due to the impact of the global financial crisis and the escalation of military–political conflicts. The growing dynamics of the energy efficiency gaps level is due to the excess of the negative effect of increasing exports of primary energy resources and inefficient technologies for their processing over the positive impact of energy-efficient innovation imports. In this case, the government should provide a proactive strategy for creating a positive investment climate, in order to attract additional financial resources for extending green innovations and popularizing the green style and cultivate the energy safety behavior in society. © 2021 by the authors.

Charcoal is a biomass-based renewable energy that provides energy for hundreds of millions of households worldwide and generates income for 40 million people. However, it currently causes up to 7% of the global deforestation rate. In the absence of affordable alternative fuels, it is necessary to identify conditions that foster sustainable charcoal production. In this study, we (a) develop a stylized model that simulates feedbacks between forest biomass and charcoal production, and (b) use the model to examine the effects of interventions that foster sustainable charcoal systems through transitions to communal management or private systems, increases in carbonization efficiency and charcoal demand reductions. Our model simulations suggest that at low demand, a transition is unnecessary. At intermediate to high demands, interventions that increase carbonization efficiency and/or reduce demand should be combined with transitions to communal management (at intermediate forest biomass levels) or private systems (at low forest biomass levels) to ensure long-term sustainability of charcoal systems and avoid collapse within 100 years. These results highlight multiple pathways for sustainable charcoal production systems tailored to meet supply and demand. All pathways are feasible across tropical biomes and could foster the simultaneous continuation of forests and charcoal production in the near future. © 2021 The Author(s).

This research examines the suitability of de-inked paper sludge (DPS), after pelletization, as a sustainable alternative component to a peat-based growing media, creating ideal root conditions for tree development (e.g. high water storage, low compaction). DPS, tested on Lepidium sativum L. germination, did not show toxicity effects. Three species, Quercus ilex L., Lagerstroemia indica L. and Prunus serrulata “Kanzan”, were planted in 40 cm Ø pots filled with a control (peat, pumice and zeolite) and the experimental substrate (compost, DPS pellets, pumice and zeolite). After two years in the nursery, the trees were planted in situ. The physical and chemical properties of substrates were analyzed. Plant morphological and physiological parameters were monitored: trunk diameter, leaf dry matter, leaf nitrogen, chlorophyll, and photosynthetic efficiency. The new substrate showed higher Corg (+135%), total N (+73%) and easily available water (+19%), compared to the control substrate used in the nursery. In this new substrate, the trees showed similar radial growth values to the control in the nursery and after transplanting in situ improved their photosynthetic performance in terms of quantum yield of photosystem II (+36%, and +29% in P. serrulata and L. indica, respectively) and electron transport rate (+39%, +25%, and +32% in P. serrulata, Q. ilex and L. indica, respectively). Pelletization represents an attractive amendment for growing media, which enhances the plant's physiological health status. This study proposes alternative recovery methods for paper industry waste with low environmental impact. As the process is developed locally, it should also contribute to reducing energy-related CO2 emissions from transport.

This study considers the comparative advantages of the sectors of the economy in the final product ratio, energy intensity, and carbonization of the gross output. The input–output model is transformed to a structured form, and the projected gradient of the gross domestic product (GDP) is derived. Factorial models of energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are developed and used to obtain the projected antigradients of these indicators. Each of these vectors determine the locally optimal structural change for each dimension. Their components are found to be proportional to the sectoral deviations from the national average, thus revealing a sectorwise comparative advantage or disadvantage. This observation allowed us to characterize these components as Ricardian gradients. Although it is not possible to move in each of the three vectors concurrently, it is possible to direct the economic restructuring to make the least possible acute angles with each vector. Thus, the locally Pareto-optimal vector of structural change is formed. At each moment in time, the system is directed to move alongside this vector or by the boundary. The suggested approach is applied to simulate the economies of China and the United States. The obtained results reveal that the suggested changes in the structure of the gross output simultaneously allowed for an increase in GDP, a decrease in energy consumption, and the mitigation of CO2 emissions.

There still remains uncertainty as to how much a low-carbon energy system costs compared to a high-carbon system. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) show a large range of costs of mitigation towards the 2°C target, with up to an order of magnitude difference between the highest and lowest cost, depending on a number of factors including model structure, technology availability and costs, and the degree of feedback with the wider macro-economy. A simpler analysis potentially serves to highlight where costs fall and to what degree. Here we show that the additional cost of a low-carbon energy system is less than 1% of global GDP more than a system resulting from low mitigation effort. The proposed approach aligns with some previous IAMs and other projections discussed in the paper, whilst also providing a clearer and more detailed view of the world. Achieving this system by 2050, with CO2 emissions of about 15GtCO2, depends heavily on decarbonisation of the electricity sector to around 100gCO2/kWh, as well as on maximising energy efficiency potential across all sectors. This scenario would require a major mitigation effort in all the assessed world regions. However, in order to keep the global mean surface temperature increase below 1.5°C, it would be necessary to achieve net-zero emission by 2050, requiring a much further mitigation effort. © 2021 Regional Energy Resources Information Center (RERIC), Asian Institute of Technology.

In the LifeMedGreenRoof project (LIFE12ENV/MT/000732) a significant activity was carried out in order to identify innovations that may improve the substrate performance, mainly in terms of long stability and water management. Six different substrates (two with wood biochar) have been selected and characterized for their chemical and physical properties, according to the Italian and German standards for growing media (UNI 11235:2015 and FLL-2008), focusing above all on their hydraulic performance. Such substrates were also tested in a rainfall simulator for the determination of runoff coefficient, comparing water availability data obtained in the rainfall simulator with those derived from the usual laboratory protocol (UNI EN). Many differences among substrates about their physical, chemical and hydraulic properties arose.

Progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is challenged in many countries by losses from disasters triggered by natural hazards. Even in regions where a comparatively smaller number of disasters have occurred, the economic impact has been significant. Countries with medium to low levels of income and weaker governance have been particularly vulnerable. Reducing disaster risk is therefore critical to poverty reduction and sustainable development. Drawing on the evaluations of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) at the global and national level carried out by the Independent Evaluation Office of UNDP, this chapter revisits the disaster risk reduction efforts, progress and challenges since the adoption of the SDGs and Sendai Framework and discusses UNDP’s contributions at the national level. The chapter examines integrated approaches to addressing disaster risk and vulnerability reduction in development programming. The chapter draws on the country programme evaluations as well as the conclusions and lessons based on the global “Evaluation of UNDP Support to Poverty Reduction in the Least Developed Countries” and “Evaluation of UNDP Contribution to Disaster Prevention and Recovery.” These evaluations paid particular attention to the challenges posed by climate change in increasing natural hazards and the need for a more coordinated approach to adaptation. The chapter discusses how national governments and the international community have attempted to respond to these challenges. The findings section analyses UNDP’s contribution to disaster risk reduction, enabling linkages to poverty reduction and climate change adaptation, and addressing multiple crises.

In addition to emission reductions, it may also provide a method for earning and evening out the income distribution. The economic impacts of PCT for a single person depend greatly on the method of allocating emission rights. Currently, it is not known how the economic impacts for various income levels differ between different allocation methods. Herein, we present a PCT model for mobility and various methods for allocating emissions rights. The economic impacts on various income levels are calculated based on Finnish statistical mobility data and using a PCT pilot in the city of Lahti. Results show that greenhouse gas emissions from mobility are lower for people with a low income, and PCT could provide additional income and even out the income distribution. The financial benefits and payoffs depend on the carbon cap, carbon floor price and emission right allocations. The results of this study provide basic information on how PCT can be put into action, what options there are for emission allocation, and how PCT can be used to even out the income distribution. © 2021 World Conference on Transport Research Society","Allowance allocation; Economic; Mobility; Personal carbon budgets and trading; Policy; Transport","emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; income distribution; pollution tax; spatial distribution; Finland; Lahti; Paijat-Hame",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100537690

A high pedodiversity observed over very short distances due to both past and present land use, such as in Western Africa (Northern Togo), makes this a crucial issue. In particular, some small spots covered by sacred forests (forêts sacrées) of high cultural value in this area are extremely biodiverse, calcareous and high in OM in contrast with the non-calcareous, poor OM, overgrazed woody savannah and agricultural surroundings. The objectives of our work were to understand this pedodiversity and the process of CaCO3 formation in the soil under the highly biodiverse forest using morphological, micromorphological, chemical and mineralogical soil analyses. The results show a high degree of weathering of the gneiss parent material, presence of plinthite gravels, dominance of 1:1 clays, formation of swelling clays in the imperfectly drained soils, and low OM content. The presence of palygorskite, although in traces, suggests drier intervals and is consistent in this context with the extreme wet and dry climate conditions in the region. In the OM rich soils under forest, bio-calcification takes place in the form of CaCO3 needles, micrite hypocoatings around biopores and calcified cells. Oribatid excrements are associated with calcite and organic matter in the sacred forest soil, indicating that litter recycling has played an important role in the formation of calcite. We hypothesize that the high biological activity releasing CO2, formation of HCO3– and precipitation of CaCO3 due to the Ca2+ released by the recycled organic matter and weathering of plagioclases, lead to different forms of secondary calcium carbonate in the sacred forest soils. The high oxalate content of the vegetation in the sacred forest suggests that calcium carbonate formation, possibly via the oxalate-carbonate pathway, may also have played a role in calcite precipitation in these in organic matter rich soils. The parent material of these soils is not calcareous, meaning that these are not lithogenic carbonates, thus making them an important carbon sink. The soil characteristics indicate a high potential for development of the soils of the area in both agricultural yields and in potential carbon sequestration relevant to global change policies. © 2020","Calcium oxalate; Granite and gneiss; Organic matter; Palygorskite; Pedodiversity; Weathering","calcite; calcium carbonate; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate conditions; forest soil; global change; gneiss; soil fertility; soil organic matter; soil-vegetation interaction; Togo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095840132

We use a well-evaluated version of the WRF-Chem model at 3 km horizontal resolution to determine the daily accumulation of pollution over Beijing from local and regional sources in October 2014 under a range of meteorological conditions. Considering feasible emission reductions across residential, transport, power, and industrial sectors, we find that 1 d controls on local emissions have an immediate effect on PM2.5; (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 μ;m) concentrations on the same day but can have lingering effects as much as 5 d later under stagnant conditions. One-day controls in surrounding provinces have the greatest effect in Beijing on the day following the controls but may have negligible effects under northwesterly winds when local emissions dominate. To explore the contribution of different emission sectors and regions, we perform simulations with each source removed in turn. We find that residential and industrial sectors from neighbouring provinces dominate PM2.5; levels in Beijing during major pollution episodes but that local residential emissions and industrial or residential emissions from more distant provinces can also contribute significantly during some episodes. We then perform a structured set of perturbed emission simulations to allow us to build statistical emulators that represent the relationships between emission sources and air pollution in Beijing over the period. We use these computationally fast emulators to determine the sensitivity of PM2.5; concentrations to different emission sources and the interactions between them, including for secondary PM, and to create pollutant response surfaces for daily average PM2.5; concentrations in Beijing. We use these surfaces to identify the short-term emission controls needed to meet the national air quality target of daily average PM2.5; less than 75 μ;g m-3; for pollution episodes of different intensities. We find that for heavily polluted days with daily mean PM2.5; higher than 225 μ;g m-3;, even emission reductions of 90 % across all sectors over Beijing and surrounding provinces may be insufficient to meet the national air quality standards. These results highlight the regional nature of PM pollution and the challenges of tackling it during major pollution episodes.. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Using the analysis and synthesis techniques and the analytical and statistical study results, the authors have concluded that the climate change issue is a huge threat to humanity and requires an immediate solution. Oil and gas companies being one of the largest environmental pollution sources should first and foremost take appropriate measures to combat climate change. A systematic approach as the main one has been chosen to study this issue, due to which such diverse elements as sustainable development, the state, and oil and gas companies that have previously been studied separately are considered from a holistic perspective. The paper has proven that the largest Russian oil and gas companies such as Gazprom PJSC, LUKOIL PJSC, and Rosneft OC PJSC recognize the importance of actions to combat climate change and not only include sustainable development goals in their policies and strategies but also implement specific responses to climate change, thereby making a significant contribution to achieving the goal of combating climate change. The paper materials are of practical value for state authorities in terms of improving policies implemented in the field of sustainable development and drawing up regulatory documents and programs.

What young people know about the SDGs and how to engage with the SDGs can contribute significantly to the realisation of the SDGs within the shortest possible time. Specifically, climate change is central to the SDGs because of its substantial nexus with economic, social and environmental outcomes for all regions of the world. Thus, this study investigates climate change awareness among secondary school students to guide climate change mitigation strategies and practices among young people for the attainment of the SDGs. The study adopts a qualitative research approach using content analysis of the essays on climate change written and presented by students of different secondary schools in Ota, Nigeria. The analysis reveals, among other things, that the students are knowledgeable about climate change and that their schools are the most prevalent source of climate change knowledge. The most-reported climate change effect from the essays include: rise in global temperatures, melting of ice, flooding, rise in sea level, drought, extinction of terrestrial and marine life and health challenges. Common mitigation strategies suggested by the students entail awareness, tree planting, use of low carbon vehicles, use of energy-saving bulbs, reduction of carbon emissions, and recycling of waste. With adequate climate change knowledge and mitigation strategies, many young people can contribute and engage practically with the climate change discourse, thereby improving the climate change statistics in their regions and accelerating progress on the SDGs. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Energy conservation; Planning; Reforestation; Sea level; Solid wastes; Students; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Global temperatures; Low carbon vehicles; Mitigation strategy; Qualitative research; Recycling of wastes; Secondary schools; Social and environmental; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103691076

Current debates tend to consider actions to respond to climate change as either adaptive or maladaptive, leading to binary framings of outcomes as either successful or harmful. To address this, our article considers the vast space that exists between success and failure in climate change adaptation, highlighting the importance of applying the concepts of successful adaptation and maladaptation jointly in analyses of such outcomes. To this end, we develop an integrated framework to examine the major adaptive and maladaptive effects induced by large-scale seawater desalination. Now a major component of water supply in cities and regions around the world, desalination is increasingly viewed as an adaptation to water challenges linked with climate change. Based on a comprehensive review of the (successful/mal)adaptation literature, we present a matrix that will help academics and practitioners think through the complex and overlapping outcomes of adaptation via desalination in the water sector. We then discuss the insights concerning the configurations of desalination's adaptive and maladaptive outcomes. Overall, we present a threefold argument: (1) that examining successful outcomes alongside maladaptive ones enables a more complete and nuanced understanding of the overall effects of adaptation actions and their spatial and temporal distribution; (2) that a consideration of this can help to highlight the tradeoffs and constraints that are inherent in adaptation in order to support decision-making; and (3) that a more complex approach to adaptation outcomes can assist in problematizing the social-political drivers and consequences of adaptation.

India is a country with a rapidly growing economy and a large market, and it has the second largest population in the world, which was 1.3 billion in 2018. India also suffers from environmental problems, such as air pollution and global warming that is contributed by traffic CO2emissions from transportation. In order to analyze this problem, a particularly challenging issue in developing countries like India, is the collection of traffic data. In general, developing countries do not often have well established infrastructure such as installations of small traffic signals, they lack new road construction and public transportation, etc. This study is the first real traffic congestion analysis in India and introduces unique traffic flow analysis such as: (1) Collecting over a month of recent traffic data in a major city in India, (2) defining traffic congestion from occupancy parameter based on traffic flow theory and observation data, and (3) using geographical special analysis (GIS) for identifying traffic congestion location. These three combination analysis enables one to identify the most congested area in the city with quantitative congestion condition.

This study also evaluates EoS for Peng–Robinson (PR) and Soave–Redlich–Kwong (SRK) and their capability to predict the thermodynamic properties of CO2-rich mixtures. The investigation was carried out using machine learning such as an artificial neural network (ANN) and a classified learner. A lower average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of 7.46% was obtained for the PR in comparison with SRK (AARD = 15.0%) for three components system of CO2 with N2 and CH4. Moreover, it was found to be 13.5% for PR and 19.50% for SRK in the five components’ (CO2 with N2, CH4, Ar, and O2) case. In addition, applying machine learning provided promise and valuable insight to deal with engineering problems. The implementation of machine learning in conjunction with EoS led to getting lower predictive AARD in contrast to EoS.

They are often operated inefficiently and in association with high emission fuels like wood. This leads to disproportionate air pollution contributions. Despite the proliferation of these appliances, an understanding of particulate matter (PM) emissions from these sources remains relatively low. Emissions from five solid fuels are quantified using a ""conventional""and an Ecodesign stove. PM measurements are obtained using both ""hot filter""sampling of the raw flue gas, and sampling of cooled, diluted flue gas using an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor and AE33 aethalometer. PM emissions factors (EF) derived from diluted flue gas incorporate light condensable organic compounds; hence they are generally higher than those obtained with ""hot filter""sampling, which do not. Overall, the PM EFs ranged from 0.2 to 108.2 g GJ-1 for solid fuels. The PM EF determined for a solid fuel depends strongly on the measurement method employed and on user behavior, and less strongly on secondary air supply and stove type. Kerosene-based firelighters were found to make a disproportionately high contribution to PM emissions. Organic aerosol dominated PM composition for all fuels, constituting 50-65% of PM from bituminous and low-smoke ovoids, and 85-95% from torrefied olive stone (TOS) briquettes, sod peat, and wood logs. Torrefied biomass and low-smoke ovoids were found to yield the lowest PM emissions. Substituting these fuels for smoky coal, peat, and wood could reduce PM2.5 emissions by approximately 63%. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Aerosols; Behavioral research; Briquets; Chemical speciation; Coal combustion; Flue gases; Flues; Fuels; Gas emissions; Peat; Smoke; Stoves; Wood fuels; Developed regions; Developing nations; Heating appliances; Measurement methods; Organic aerosol; Particulate matter emissions; PM-composition; Study of emissions; Particulate emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103310265

The region was a center of reurbanisation following the decline of the Harappan civilisation and is considered a hub of economic, political and religious evolution since the sixth millennium BC. Hetapatti contains an uninterrupted sequence from Neolithic to Historic (Gupta) period. The study integrates two different approaches (phytoliths and carbon isotope analysis) to infer vegetational and climatic changes and to understand their relationship to the cultural sequence. Our results show a gradual transformation from a warm and humid climate into a warm and dry climate from the Neolithic to Historic (Gupta) period. We find an abrupt weakening of the ISM at ~2080 cal BP driving a warm and dry climate. The comparison of our data with other high resolution regional and global records led us to hypothesise a synchronicity in this warm and dry trend, coeval with the Roman warm period (RWP). The observed variation in vegetation and climate might have driven by the fluctuations in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). Additionally, the phytolith analysis provides evidence of cereal crops including rice, wheat, barley, millets, etc. suggesting a crop affinity with the earlier Indus crop package. It is interesting to note that the site displays an uninterrupted cultural sequence from Neolithic to Historic times, with artefacts of each phase exhibiting technological and stylistic developments from the preceding culture. From this we infer that the well adapted socio-ecological strategies and availability of perennial rivers may have helped the ancient civilisation to absorb the stress relating to a varying climate. © The Author(s) 2020.","carbon isotope; Central Ganga Plain; Hetapatti; ISM; Neolithic; phytolith","artifact; carbon isotope; civilization; climate variation; Holocene; isotopic analysis; Neolithic; phytolith; Gangetic Plain; Hordeum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097596206

These barriers may be mitigated by coupling a HPWH with an air-based solar collector to preheat inlet HPWH air, and using a lifecycle thinking approach to evaluate HPWHs or solar-assisted HPWHs (SAHPWHs) to encompass low operating costs. The objective of this study was to economically analyze the HPWH and SAHPWH across Canada and the United States to determine locations in which the systems are economically feasible as a method for reducing residential greenhouse gas emissions. The methodology for this included simulating the HPWH and SAHPWH performance using an experimentally validated TRNSYS model. The results show that HPWHs are typically more feasible than SAHPWHs except in locations with high electricity rates or long heating seasons, or locations with fossil fuel dominant electricity grids when carbon pricing is considered. As such, each location must be studied to determine which options are economically suitable. The findings presented illustrate economical clean water heating options, and subsidies that could be introduced to further encourage uptake of low carbon water heating. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Economic assessment; Heat pump water heater; Lifecycle cost; Solar thermal; Subsidies","Air source heat pumps; Airports; Carbon; Costs; Economic analysis; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Housing; Life cycle; Location; Military bases; Operating costs; Solar collectors; Solar water heaters; Water heaters; Carbon pricing; Electricity grids; Heat pump water heater; Heating season; Lifecycle thinkings; Residential energy consumption; Solar assisted; Solar thermal collector; Hot water distribution systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097874508

This study aims to discern the trace metals dynamics in this complex aquatic system. We used a combined approach of geochemical tools such as geochemical partitioning, Zn isotopes signatures, and multivariate statistics. Zinc and Pb concentrations in Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and sediments were considerably higher in some sites. The sediment partition of As, Cr, and Cu revealed the residual fraction (F4) as the main fraction for these elements, indicating low mobility. Zinc and Pb were mostly associated with the exchangeable/carbonate (F1) and the reducible (F2) fractions, respectively, implying a higher susceptibility of these elements to being released from sediments. Zinc isotopic compositions of sediments and SPM fell in a binary mixing source process between lithogenic (δ66/64ZnJMC ≈ + 0.30‰) and anthropogenic (δ66/64ZnJMC ≈ + 0.15‰) end members. The lighter δ66/64ZnJMC values accompanied by high Zn concentrations in exchangeable/carbonate fraction (ZnF1) enable the tracking of Zn anthropogenic sources in the studied rivers. Overall, the results indicated that Hg, Pb, and Zn had a dominant anthropogenic origin linked to the industrial activities, while As, Cr, and Cu were mainly associated with lithogenic sources. This work demonstrates how integrating geochemical tools is valuable for assessing geochemical processes and mixing source effects in anthropized river watersheds. © 2020","Anthropogenic activity; Isotope tracer; Metal pollution; Sequential extraction","Copper; Flood control; Geochemistry; Isotopes; Lead; Mixing; Multivariant analysis; Potable water; River diversion; Suspended sediments; Trace elements; Zinc compounds; Anthropogenic origin; Anthropogenic sources; Geochemical partitioning; Industrial activities; Isotopic composition; Metropolitan regions; Multivariate statistics; Suspended particulate matters; Fluorine compounds; anthropogenic source; concentration (composition); drinking water; fluvial deposit; industrial waste; isotopic analysis; multivariate analysis; partitioning; river water; trace metal; water quality; watershed; zinc; Brazil; Rio de Janeiro [Brazil]; Rio Guandu; Rio Paraiba do Sul; heavy metal; isotope; zinc; Brazil; environmental monitoring; human; river; sediment; water pollutant; Brazil; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Humans; Isotopes; Metals, Heavy; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zinc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090416709

The traditional flooded paddy rice fields not only use large amounts of irrigation water, but also produce significant methane (CH4) emissions. To balance food security with environmental impacts of rice production, many water-saving irrigations technologies have been tested in the field to increase the drainage period during the rice growth cycle. However, whether these management solutions can be implemented at the regional scale needs to be further explored. Because it is too time-consuming and resource-intensive for field experiments to be carried out across large areas, we opt to assess the regional impacts of alternative irrigation schemes via computer modeling, by coupling the well-known DSSAT and DNDC models, which have been extensively validated in China. Irrigation methods tested include the traditional Continuous Flooding (CF), Midseason Drainage (MD) and Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). Simulation results show that compared with CF, water-saving irrigation methods can significantly reduce the CH4 emission from paddy rice field, with slight or no loss in expected rice yields. AWD had the greatest effect in reducing irrigation water amounts and CH4 emission. Compared with CF, CH4 emission under the AWD were 60% - 71% lower in Northeast China sites and 34% - 65% lower in South China sites. At the same time, compared to CF, irrigation water use in AWD was reduced by 23% - 34% in northeast China sites and by 18% - 50% in south China sites. Our results suggest that policies that support expansion of AWD in paddy rice cultivation across China can lead to a “win-win” for the food-water-GHG emissions tradeoffs, and offer a viable solution for policy makers and stakeholders in China. © 2020","CH4 emission; DNDC model; Paddy rice; Water saving irrigation","Agricultural robots; Chemical contamination; Commerce; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Floods; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Water conservation; Water resources; Water supply; Agricultural greenhouse; Alternative irrigations; Irrigation methods; Irrigation regimes; Irrigation water use; Mid-season drainage; Water-saving irrigation; WETTING AND DRYING; Irrigation; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; carbon emission; environmental impact; environmental modeling; greenhouse gas; irrigation system; methane; paddy farming; rice; trade-off; water use; agricultural management; alternate wetting and drying; Article; carbon footprint; China; computer model; controlled study; decision support system; decomposition; denitrification; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; flooding; food security; irrigation (agriculture); midseason drainage; nonhuman; rice; stakeholder engagement; water management; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098480635

In this study, we improved treatment of the dust emission process in a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem v12.6.0), by incorporating the geographical variation of aerodynamic roughness length (Z0), smooth roughness length (Z0s) and soil texture and by introducing the Owen effect and the formulation of the sandblasting efficiency - by Lu and Shao (1999). To investigate the impact of the modifications incorporated in the model, several sensitivity simulations were performed for a severe dust storm during 27 March to 2 April 2015 over northern China. Results show that simulated threshold friction velocity is very sensitive to the updated Z0 and Z0s field, with the relative difference ranging from 10% to 60% compared to the original model with a uniform value. The inclusion of the Owen effect leads to an increase in surface friction velocity, which mainly occurs in the arid and semi-arid regions of northwest China. The substitution of a fixed value of - assumed in the original scheme with one varying with friction velocity and soil texture based on observations reduces - by 50% on average, especially over regions with sand texture. Comparisons of sensitivity simulations and measurements show that the revised scheme with the implementation of updates provides more realistic threshold friction velocities and PM10 mass concentrations. The performance of the improved model has been evaluated against surface PM10 observations as well as MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) values, showing that the spatial and temporal variation of mineral dust are better captured by the revised scheme. Due to the inclusion of the improvement, average PM10 concentrations at observational sites are more comparable to the observations, and the average mean bias (MB) and normalized mean bias (NMB) values are reduced from -196.29 μgm-3 and -52.79% to -47.72 μgm-3 and -22.46% respectively. Our study suggests that the erodibility factor, sandblasting efficiency and soil-related properties which are simply assumed in the empirical scheme may lack a physical mechanism and spatial temporal representativeness. Further study and measurements should be conducted to obtain a more realistic and detailed map of these parameters in order to improve dust representation in the model. © 2021 EDP Sciences.

Better understanding of porperties of particulate matters and trace elemetns associations are important for comprehensive evaluations on environmental impacts caused by the ultra-low emiission retrofits. This work have analyzed ash formaion and trace elements emissions as well as their associations with particulate matters in an ultra-low emission coal-fired power plant. The results indicate that ultra-low emission retrofits would greatly reduce particulate matters emissions, and trace elements distributions in bottom ash, fly ash, and fine particles are not significant changed. However, it would affect trace elements distributions in particulate matter from different sampling sites, which is due to the alternations on ash fromation caused by the change of local reaction conditions, thus affecting the particualte matter properties and trace elements migration behaviors. Electrostatic precipitator and wet electrostatic precipitator are capable for most of trace elements laden particle matter removal, but the particulate matters escaped from wet electrostatic precipitator are enriched in As, Cu, Zn, and Pb.

First, Mn-doped ZnSe NCs were successfully synthesised and then coated with the ZnS shell in aqueous solution at low temperature to obtain Mn:ZnSe/ZnS NCs. The resulting Mn:ZnSe/ZnS NCs with the 4-to-6-nm sizes emitted the strong and characteristic luminescence that originates from the 4T1→6A1 transition in Mn2+ ions. Further, the prepared Mn:ZnSe/ZnS NCs were embedded into poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers by one-step electrospinning of PMMA/NCs or PAN/NCs mixtures, respectively. The surface morphology of the fibrous Mn:ZnSe/ZnS-in-PMMA and Mn:ZnSe/ZnS-in-PAN hybrids was imaged by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The distribution of the Mn:ZnSe/ZnS NCs into polymer fibers and its crystallinity were determined by a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) equipped with the selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The optical characterisation of the fabricated fibrous hybrids showed that the photoluminescence from Mn:ZnSe/ZnS-in-PMMA was much enhanced compared to that from Mn:ZnSe/ZnS-in-PAN. We have discussed on the mechanism governing these emission properties to see that the electrospun Mn:ZnSe/ZnS-in-PMMA hybrid is very promising in designing emitters for solid-state illumination sources and lighting devices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Electrospinning; Mn-doped ZnSe/ZnS core/Shell nanocrystals; PAN hybrids; Photoluminescence; PMMA hybrids","Chlorine containing polymers; Crystallinity; Electron diffraction; Electrospinning; Esters; II-VI semiconductors; Luminescence; Manganese metallography; Morphology; Nanocrystals; Polymers; Scanning electron microscopy; Selenium compounds; Surface morphology; Temperature; Zinc Selenide; Zinc sulfide; Core/shell nanocrystals; Electrospun polymers; Enhanced luminescence; Optical characterisation; Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA); Polyacrylonitrile fiber; Selected area electron diffraction; Solid state illumination; Manganese compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100066045

This study investigates how much sport club members are willing to pay for environmental measures and how sport‐specific, clubspecific, environmental, and socio‐demographic factors are associated with their willingness‐to‐pay. In 2019 and 2020, active adult sport club members in five team/racket sports were sampled using an online survey in Germany (n = 3036). The contingent valuation method was applied to estimate sport club members’ willingness‐to‐pay for environmental measures. Regression analyses were em-ployed to investigate a set of factors that are associated with club members’ decision to pay at all and the amount of willingness‐to‐pay. The results show that 64.3% of respondents reported a positive willingness‐to‐pay. The average willingness‐to‐pay for environmental measures amounts to EUR 14.53 per year and to EUR 22.59 for those reporting a positive willingness‐to‐pay. The results of t‐tests show that club members stating a positive WTP differ significantly from members who are not willing to pay anything in terms of sport‐specific, club‐specific, environmental, and socio‐de-mographic factors. The logistic regression results indicate that the likelihood of reporting a positive willingness‐to‐pay increases with increasing environmental consciousness, educational level, weekly practice hours, identification and satisfaction with the club, and subjective well‐being, while age has a U‐shaped effect. The results of a Tobit model show that the amount of willingness‐to‐pay is positively determined by environmental consciousness, educational level, and satisfaction with the club. The findings suggest that the majority of club members are willing to pay higher membership fees for the implementation of environmental measures in sport clubs. Increasing members’ level of environmental consciousness through educational initiatives represents a way for sport policy and sport managers to help increase financial support for environmental measures among club members. © 2021 by the authors.

During the one-day audit, the hospital kitchen generated 1515.15 kg (1.7 US tons) of solid waste daily or 0.23 kg of total waste per meal served. Extrapolating to all meals served in 2019, the hospital kitchen generates over 442,067 kg (487 US tons) of waste and emits approximately 294,466 kg of CO2e annually from waste disposal. Most of this waste (85%, 376,247 kg or 415 US tons annually) is currently sent to landfill. With feasible changes, including increased recycling and moderate composting, this hospital could reduce landfilled waste by 205,245 kg (226 US tons, or 55% reduction) and reduce GHG emissions by 189,025 kg CO2e (64% reduction). Given NYC's ambitious waste and GHG emission reduction targets outlined in its OneNYC strategic plan, studies analyzing composition, emissions, and waste diversion potential of large institutions can be valuable in achieving city sustainability goals.

Thus, the macro-trends forecast increasing energy efficiency and focus on the use of renewable gas or the electrification of heat generation. This has implications for the business models of urban electricity and in particular natural gas distribution network operators (DNOs): When the energy demand decreases, a disproportionately long grid is operated, which can cause a rise of grid charges and thus the gas price. This creates a situation in which a self-reinforcing feedback loop starts, which increases the risk of gas grid defection. We present a mixed integer linear optimization model to analyze the interdependencies between the electricity and gas DNOs’ and the building owners’ investment decisions during the transformation path. The results of the investigation in a real grid area are used to validate the simulation setup of a sensitivity analysis of 27 types of building collectives and five grid topologies, which provides a systematic insight into the interrelated system. Therefore, it is possible to identify building and grid configurations that increase the risk of a complete gas grid shutdown and those that should be operated as a flexibility option in a future renewable energy system. © 2021 by the authors.

It is critical to understand the molecular composition of the organic material coating the surface of carbonate reservoir rock in order to design better enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods. Herein, we extracted organic compounds from a carbonate reservoir rock and characterized their composition using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). In contrast to conventional interpretation that the mixed-wet or oil-wet nature of carbonate reservoir rocks arises from the adsorption of carboxylic acids, our results demonstrated that the organic species strongly bound to carbonate reservoir rock surface are dominated by N-containing species, including a group of “sticky molecules”. Each of these molecules can form multiple hydrogen-bonds, therefore they might act as a “double-sided tape” which binds crude oil strongly to the carbonate rock surface. Furthermore, we applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques to a model mineral surface with regions of positive change and negative charge which was contacted with the crude oil produced from the formation where the rock was sampled. It was found that only the organic molecules with positive charge in the oil were adsorbed onto the mineral. This supports HRMS results which suggest that the organic materials strongly bound to the carbonate reservoir rock surface are dominated by basic N-containing molecules. Overall, these findings suggest that, beside fatty acids, these “sticky molecules” might also play an important role in controlling the wetting state of carbonate reservoir rock. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbonate; Enhanced oil recovery; Organic layer; Reservoir rock; Sticky molecule; Wettability","Atomic force microscopy; Carbonation; Crude oil; Enhanced recovery; Fatty acids; Hydrogen bonds; Mass spectrometry; Minerals; Molecules; Petroleum reservoirs; Wetting; Carbonate reservoir; Enhanced oil recovery; High resolution mass spectrometry; Mineral surfaces; Molecular compositions; Oil recovery efficiency; Organic materials; Organic molecules; Rocks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096483892

WEPP model efficiency in predicting ephemeral gully (EG) erosion was recently tested and compared with both EGEM and empirical models. The models abilities to predict EG erosion were validated using measured estimates at the 6 eroding locations around Mubi area in Northeast Nigeria between April 2008 and October 2009. Each location consisted of 3 watersheds where data on soils, climate, slope, management practices, EG shapes and dimensions were collected. Data on relevant soil properties were collected in the field and then analyzed in laboratory. The mass of soil loss (MSL) predicted by empirical, EGEM and WEPP models were compared with the measured using paired T-test, regression graphs (r2-values), error analysis, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) in a completely randomized design. The EG erosion losses varied significantly (P ≤ 0.05) between sites and years. No significant (P ≤ 0.05) differences were observed between measured and the empirically predicted aggregate MSL. The measured aggregate MSL strongly correlated with those predicted by empirical (r2 = 0.67), than with EGEM (r2 = 0.57), and WEPP (r2 = 0.53) models. Slight over and under-prediction instances against the measured erosion were noted with all the models. The WEPP model was found to slightly over-predict MSL when compared to either the empirical or EGEM model. The prediction quality of the models was generally impressive. Future works should focus more on local inputs such as climate, plants, management, and tillage data for use with WEPP. © 2020 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water and Power Press","EGEM; Empirical; Ephemeral gully erosion; Mubi; Northeast Nigeria; Soil loss; WEPP",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090308332

Different types of fuel technologies have been developed in order to improve efficiency, reduce air pollution impacts, such as the case of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for heavy-duty vehicles. Many studies show the relationship between the effects of short and long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), premature deaths worldwide as well as cardiorespiratory diseases in elderly population are related to this pollutant. In this context, this paper aims at evaluating the atmospheric dispersion of PM in a stretch of a highway (Anhanguera-Bandeirantes) in the São Paulo State in Brazil due to the road freight transport considering the use of diesel and LNG in heavy-duty vehicles and the impacts on human health.

Aircraft developed adopting this configuration are expected to achieve a payload capability higher than common single aisle analogues (e.g., Airbus 320 and Boeing 737 families), without any increase in the overall dimensions. We estimated the exhaust emissions from the PrandtlPlane and compared the corresponding impacts to those of a conventional reference aircraft, in terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Global Temperature Potential (GTP), on two time‐horizons and accounted for regional sensitivity. We considered carbon dioxide, carbonaceous and sulphate aerosols, nitrogen oxides and related ozone production, methane degradation and nitrate aerosols formation, contrails, and contrail cirrus. Overall, the introduction of the PrandtlPlane is expected to bring a considerable reduction of climate change in all the source regions considered, on both the time-horizons examined. Moreover, fuel consumption is expected to be reduced by 20%, as confirmed through high‐fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Sensitivity of data, models, and metrics are detailed.

Despite the high social controversy caused by LEZs in many cities, the scientific literature has paid little attention to study their public acceptability. This paper conducts a modelling approach exploring the impact of four groups of variables on the public acceptability of LEZs: (i) socio-economic and demographic characteristics; (ii) personal attitudes; (iii) travel-related variables; and (iv) perceptions and mobility habits linked to LEZs. The city of Madrid, Spain, is a case study of great interest because a LEZ called “Madrid Central” has been recently implemented. A total of 799 individual questionnaires were used to calibrate an ordered logit model. Results indicate that socio-economic and demographic variables are weakly related to the level of public acceptability towards the LEZ. On the contrary, the political ideology of individuals, their environmental awareness, their primary transport mode, the use of shared mobility systems, and the frequency of access to “Madrid Central” have a higher explanatory power. The results may be useful for policy-makers to understand the factors that increase the public acceptability of LEZs. © 2021 by the authors.

Rationally-designed and effective support is of high importance for achieving safe and efficient tunnel construction. The No. 2 inclined shaft of Muzhailing Tunnel was taken as the engineering background prototype, for which, a similar model test was conducted to evaluate the effect of highly pre-tightened constant resistance (NPR, Negative Poisson’s Ratio) anchor cable support provision to the geologically complex carbonaceous slate at different depths. Two schemes were proposed during testing: one scheme was without support and the second was with asymmetric support from highly pre-tightened constant resistance anchor cable. Digital speckle displacement analysis system and micro-ground-stress sensors were employed to measure the deformation and shear stress distribution of the tunnel. The results demonstrated that through the second support scheme, the deformation of the surrounding rock could be effectively ameliorated, while this support scheme was applied on the project site of the No.2 inclined shaft, to explore the rationality of the scheme through field engineering tests. On-site monitoring indicated that the deformation of the surrounding rock was within the reasonable design range and the problem of severe tunnel deformation was effectively controlled.

However, their combined effect on the N2O emissions and ammonia-oxidizer (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea, AOB and AOA) communities remains unclear in calcareous soils under climate warming. We conducted two incubation experiments (25 and 35 °C) to examine how N2O emissions and AOA and AOB communities responded to organic amendment (urea plus cattle manure, UCM), and in combination with urease (N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide, NBPT) and nitrification inhibitor (nitrapyrin). The treatments of UCM + nitrapyrin and UCM + nitrapyrin + NBPT significantly lowered total N2O emissions by average 64.5 and 71.05% at 25 and 35 °C, respectively, compared with UCM treatment. AOB gene abundance and α-diversity (Chao1 and Shannon indices) were significantly increased by the application of urea and manure (P &lt; 0.05). However, relative to UCM treatment, nitrapyrin addition treatments decreased AOB gene abundance and Chao 1 index by average 115.4 and 30.4% at 25 and 35 °C, respectively. PCA analysis showed that UCM or UCM plus nitrapyrin notably shifted AOB structure at both temperatures. However, fertilization had little effects on AOA community (P &gt; 0.05). Potential nitrification rate (PNR) was greatly decreased by nitrapyrin addition, and PNR significantly positively correlated with AOB gene abundance (P = 0.0179 at 25 °C and P = 0.0029 at 35 °C) rather than AOA (P &gt; 0.05). Structural equation model analysis showed that temperature directly increased AOA abundance but decrease AOB abundance, while fertilization indirectly influenced AOB community by altering soil NH4+, pH and SOC. In conclusion, the combined application of organic amendment, NBPT and nitrapyrin significantly lowered N2O emissions via reducing AOB community in calcareous soil even at high temperature.

The application of tabular jet in cross flow was adopted to test the effectiveness of synchronous control. The flow rate, height, direction, and relative molecular masses were studied in this research. Results suggest that the ideal damping ratio of the sound pressure amplitude can be as high as 73.7% under the carbon dioxide jet in cross flow case. The carbon dioxide jet in cross flow case can lead to a better thermoacoustic instability suppression result than the instances of argon or helium. Besides, amplitude and frequency switching of the unsteady flame emerged during the experiment. Adding minimal inert gaseous can change the local oscillation of equivalence ratio. The suppression ratio of NOx emission can reach as high as 44% under the carbon dioxide cases, which performs better than the argon or helium cases. Moreover, the flame length declines as the tabular jet in cross flow rate increases. When the flow rate increases (or the height decreases), the size of the flame front or root will decrease. The average flame length dropped from 122 to 41 mm. The macrostructure of the flame changes significantly under different injecting heights or directions.

The concept of smart cities gains increasing importance in the European Union, a fact that is reflected in the project “European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities” of the European Commission. Smart cities are a practical example of how the new energy policies shape the lives of the European Union citizens, trying to improve it. As a consequence, new business models arise in big cities, involving the use of technology for better living conditions. These new, technology-based business models are important, as they improve the life quality of the inhabitants, they reduce the climate change impact, and they contribute as well to job creation in the IT-industry, promoting innovation. They have as well a social impact, as they bring experts from energy policies, business, economics, legal and IT together in order to project a new type of city—the smart city. The research hypothesis of the present article is that there is a high acceptance towards the concept of smart cities at the European Union level and that this concept could be implemented with the help of information technology and of artificial intelligence. This way, legal provisions, economic measures and IT-tools work together in order to create synergy effects for better life quality of the citizens of the European Union. The research hypothesis is analyzed by means of the questionnaire as a qualitative research method and is as well assessed by using case studies (e.g., Austria, Finland, Romania). The novelty of the case studies is that the development of smart cities is analyzed due to the new trend towards sustainability in two countries with different living conditions in the European Union. © 2021 by the authors.

While products like aboveground biomass maps derived from these leaf-off lidar datasets each can meet state- or substate-level measurement requirements individually, combining them over multiple jurisdictions does not guarantee the consistency required in forest carbon planning, trading and reporting schemes. In this study, we refine a multi-state level forest carbon monitoring framework that addresses these spatial inconsistencies caused by variability in data quality and modeling techniques. This work is built upon our long term efforts to link airborne lidar, National Agricultural Imagery Program imagery and USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis plot measurements for high-resolution forest aboveground biomass mapping. Compared with machine learning algorithms (r2 = 0.38, bias = −2.3, RMSE = 45.2 Mg ha−1), the use of a linear model is not only able to maintain a good prediction accuracy of aboveground biomass density (r2 = 0.32, bias = 4.0, RMSE = 49.4 Mg ha−1) but largely mitigates problems related to variability in data quality. Our latest effort has led to the generation of a consistent 30 m pixel forest aboveground carbon map covering 11 states in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative region of the USA.

This paper focuses on the impact of this policy shock on air quality based on daily data from 286 cities in China and uses a regression discontinuity design to test the effectiveness of the policy on improving air quality. Cross-city analyses suggest that, the overall reduction effects on Air Quality Index (AQI) were not significant. Of the examined pollutants, more substantial reductions in SO2 and PM10 concentrations, by 6.3%–7.7% and 3.3%–5.4%, respectively, were observed immediately after the policy implementation. However, the reduction effects on PM2.5, CO, and NO2 were not significant, and no reduction effect was observed for O3. City-specific analyses show that most of the cities that experienced statistically significant policy effects are located in North China and feature high baseline pollutant concentration levels. The early warning effect and persistence of the effect of the policy were also discussed. On the one hand, significant reductions in NO2, CO, and SO2 occurred 6 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2 weeks, respectively, prior to the entry dates of the inspection team. On the other hand, the policy effects decayed significantly immediately after the “on-site” inspection ended. This study implies that a sustainable environmental governance system is necessary and that applying a regression discontinuity design based on high-density time series data is valid for environmental policy evaluation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Central inspections of environmental protection; Policy effectiveness; Regression discontinuity","Air quality; Inspection; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Air quality indices; Environmental governances; Environmental policy; Environmental pollutions; Environmental supervision; Policy implementations; Pollutant concentration; Substantial reduction; Environmental protection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096930352

Developing countries show high preferences for emission reduction and energy-saving technology, solar energy, wind energy and bio-energy, whereas a low preference for supercritical and ultra supercritical power units, nuclear energy and tidal energy. 4. Agroforestry, energy conservation and efficiency, renewable energy and water resources are priority areas for climate change financing. 5. Building institutional capacity, improving technology R&D networks and institutions, formulation and implementation ability of planning schemes, and data statistics and verification are priority areas needed for capacity building. To better address climate change, developing countries need to establish and improve information exchange channels or platforms and strengthen South-South climate cooperation while optimizing the allocation of climate change resources according to the priority needs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Addressing climate change; Addressing climate change needs; Climate change mitigation and adaptation; Developing countries","Developing countries; Emission control; Energy conservation; Forestry; International cooperation; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Surveys; Technology transfer; Tidal power; Urban transportation; Waste management; Water conservation; Water resources; Wind power; Carbon sequestration; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Energy-saving technologies; Government officials; Implementation abilities; Information exchanges; Institutional capacities; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099201516

Strategies can be defined as local or central heating. Local heating strives to heat occupants, while central heating aims to heat the building fabric and therefore the occupants. Each strategy requires a different approach to control and technology in response to priorities such as conservation, comfort and cost. This paper reviews current and emerging technologies in the context of church heating. The fuel source, heat generation technology and heat emitter are arranged in a matrix, with pairwise analysis undertaken to create weightings for each assessment criteria. The process of constructing the matrix and undertaking pairwise analysis using personas is discussed. The result is a ranking of fuels and technologies appropriate to the main priorities and individual preferences. Some desirable technologies are inherently more damaging to historic church environments due to invasive installation. These technologies score poorly when the aim is fabric preservation. Greener fuels, like biomass, may rank lower than fossil fuels, due in part to operational differences. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Heating; Religious buildings; Assessment criteria; Building fabrics; Carbon emissions; Emerging technologies; Generation technologies; Heating technology; Individual preference; Operational strategies; Air conditioning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103535174

It plays an important role in the formation of OH radicals, which are connected to the formation of various airborne chemicals. Herein, we present a simple modeling for the simulation of diurnal variations in the HCHO concentration of ambient air. This was achieved using data collected during different seasons from November 2015 to March 2017 at a suburban location in Toyama City (Japan), where non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) levels were low at sub carbon ppm (ppmC) order. The modeling was based on the assumption that photochemical reactions of methane were the major factor of secondary HCHO formation. The model took into account the production and decomposition of HCHO by photochemical reactions as well as its loss due to other reactions such as dry deposition. Accordingly, the model’s equation contained terms for solar radiation, temperature, and methane concentration. The results predicted using the model showed good agreement with the experimental data observed on fine days, i.e., except rainy, foggy, and heavily cloudy days. The relationships between HCHO concentration and solar radiation/temperature on different days as well as the seasonal variation of HCHO concentration were also interpreted by the proposed model. This study contributes to the evaluation of the pollution levels of formaldehyde. Moreover, the model may be used to demonstrate the impact of increasing methane levels, with regard to global warming and the background levels of HCHO in the atmosphere. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ambient air; Diurnal variation; Formaldehyde concentration; Modeling","ambient air; cancer; carcinogen; decomposition; diurnal variation; formaldehyde; methane; nonmethane hydrocarbon; photochemistry; pollution exposure; seasonal variation; Chubu; Honshu; Japan; Toyama [Chubu]; formaldehyde; air pollutant; city; environmental monitoring; Japan; Air Pollutants; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Formaldehyde; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096006009

However, VRE deployment requires a fleet of dispatchable power plants to supply electricity during periods with limited wind and sunlight. These plants will operate at reduced utilization rates that pose serious economic challenges. To address this challenge, this paper presents the techno-economic assessment of flexible power and hydrogen production from integrated gasification combined cycles (IGCC) employing the gas switching combustion (GSC) technology for CO2 capture and membrane assisted water gas shift (MAWGS) reactors for hydrogen production. Three GSC-MAWGS-IGCC plants are evaluated based on different gasification technologies: Shell, High Temperature Winkler, and GE. These advanced plants are compared to two benchmark IGCC plants, one without and one with CO2 capture. All plants utilize state-of-the-art H-class gas turbines and hot gas clean-up for maximum efficiency. Under baseload operation, the GSC plants returned CO2 avoidance costs in the range of 24.9–36.9 €/ton compared to 44.3 €/ton for the benchmark. However, the major advantage of these plants is evident in the more realistic mid-load scenario. Due to the ability to keep operating and sell hydrogen to the market during times of abundant wind and sun, the best GSC plants offer a 6–11%-point higher annual rate of return than the benchmark plant with CO2 capture. This large economic advantage shows that the flexible GSC plants are a promising option for balancing VRE, provided a market for the generated clean hydrogen exists. © 2021 The Author(s)","CCS; CO2 capture; Economic analysis; Flexible power plant; Gas switching combustion; Variable renewable energy","Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Combined cycle power plants; Commerce; Earnings; Gasification; Water gas shift; Economic advantages; Economic challenges; Gasification technologies; Integrated gasification combined cycle; Maximum Efficiency; Techno-economic assessment; Utilization rates; Variable renewable energies; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100273584

These models are most useful to conservation managers when they include factors that can be readily manipulated, such as fire. In this study, we collated a comprehensive dataset of mammal records from a fire-prone region in south-east Australia where mammals have suffered declines in recent decades. We used species distribution modelling to (1) determine the relative influence of climate, fire, vegetation and topography on ground-dwelling mammal distributions; (2) determine species responses to time since fire, and; (3) provide spatial predictions of habitat suitability for conservation planning. Climate was the predominant driver of habitat suitability for most species, although other factors were influential in some cases. Time since fire was an important factor driving the distribution of only two of 16 modelled species which were more likely to be recorded in recently burnt vegetation. Habitat suitability varied spatially among species however multi-species habitat suitability was highest in the drier and hotter eastern section of the landscape, highlighting a key area for conservation efforts. The outputs from our models can be used for practical conservation actions such as finding new populations or identifying sites for reintroductions. We conclude that presence-only species distribution models are useful for determining species fire responses, complementing more systematic methods, and that including dynamic variables, such as time since fire, can increase their conservation relevance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Conservation; Fire regime; Habitat suitability model; Mammals; Threatened species; Wildlife","action plan; biodiversity; conservation planning; data set; habitat selection; mammal; population distribution; prioritization; topography; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102234150

In order to implement this concept, many technological and operational challenges have to be coped with. As the fuel consumption during a mission strongly depends on a successful execution of AWSE, the existing uncertainties regarding flight planning increase. While a conservative fuel planning ensures a follower to complete the mission even in the case of a formation failure, it might result in high amounts of excess fuel and, therefore, additional fuel consumption. In this study, this issue is addressed by the adaptation of flight planning procedures to the requirements of AWSE focusing on fuel planning in particular, considered from the perspective of a designated follower aircraft of a two-aircraft formation. This trade-off is modeled as an n-action two-event decision-making problem. Each of the possible actions is represented by a combination of mission routing and a corresponding diversion airport, taking atmospheric effects (e.g., wind) into account in order to determine the resulting amount of trip fuel. The two events under consideration are a total formation failure in contrast to a complete success. Based on a scenario with a set of double origin destination pairs characterizing the formations and representative weather patterns for the North Atlantic region, each action is analyzed with regard to the expected fuel consumption and expense. Based on a set of assumed formation success probabilities, we find that the proposed method holds a savings potential to reduce the follower’s fuel consumption by 4.8% and its monetary expenses by 1.2% compared with a conventional flight planning. In order to gain a monetary profit margin applying this method, the required formation success probability is shown to vary between 92% and 96%, depending on the assumed fuel price. © 2021 by the authors.

To do this, the satellite utilizes the Thermal and Near Infrared Sensor for Carbon Observation Fourier-Transform Spectrometer-2 (TANSO-FTS-2). This spectrometer detects gas absorption spectra of solar radiation reflected from the Earth's surface in the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) region as well as the emitted thermal infrared radiation (TIR) from the ground and the atmosphere. TANSO-FTS-2 can measure the oxygen A band (0.76 μm), weak and strong CO2 bands (1.6 and 2.0 μm), weak and strong CH4 bands (1.6 and 2.3 μm), a weak CO band (2.3 μm), a mid-wave TIR band (5.5-8.4 μm), and a long-wave TIR band (8.4-14.3 μm) with 0.2 cm-1 spectral sampling intervals. TANSO-FTS-2 is equipped with a solar diffuser target, a monochromatic light source, and a blackbody for spectral radiance calibration. These calibration sources permit characterization of time-dependent instrument changes in orbit. The onboardrecalibrated instrumental parameters are considered in operational level-1 processing and released as TANSO-FTS-2 level-1 version 102102 products, which were officially released on 25 May 2020. This paper provides an overview of the TANSO-FTS-2 instrument, the level-1 processing, and the first-year in-orbit performance. To validate the spectral radiance calibration during the first year of operation, the spectral radiance of the version 102102 product is compared at temporally coincident and spatially collocated points from February 2019 to March 2020 with TANSO-FTS on GOSAT for SWIR and with AIRS on Aqua and IASI on METOP-B for TIR. The spectral radiances measured by TANSO-FTS and TANSO-FTS-2 agree within 2% of the averaged bias and 0.5% standard deviation for SWIR bands. The agreement of brightness temperature between TANSO-FTS-2 and AIRS-IASI is better than 1K in the range from 220 to 320 K. GOSAT-2 not only provides seamless global CO2 and CH4 observation but also observes local emissions and uptake with an additional CO channel, fully customized sampling patterns, higher signal-to-noise ratios, and wider pointing angles than GOSAT. © Author(s) 2021.",,"AIRS; Aqua (satellite); biomass burning; brightness temperature; calibration; carbon cycle; fossil fuel; Fourier transform; GOSAT; greenhouse gas; IASI; MetOp; near infrared; OCO; satellite mission; satellite sensor; signal-to-noise ratio; spectral analysis; spectral reflectance; spectrometer; temperature effect; Trachinotus falcatus; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102519485

In the saturated state of the dynamo, we find a Faraday depth (FD) dispersion σFD ≈100 rad m-2, in agreement with observed values in the ICM. Remarkably, the FD power spectrum is qualitatively similar to M(k)/k, where M(k) is the magnetic spectrum and k the wavenumber. However, this similarity is broken at high k when FD is obtained by applying rotation measure (RM) synthesis to polarized emission from the ICM due to poor resolution and complexities of spectrum in FD space. Unlike the Gaussian probability distribution function (PDF) obtained for FD, the PDF of the synchrotron intensity is lognormal. A relatively large σFD in the ICMgives rise to strong frequency-dependent variations of the pixel-wisemean and peak polarized intensities at low frequencies (≲ 1.5 GHz). Themean fractional polarization (p) obtained at the resolution of the simulations increases from <0.1 at 0.5 GHz to its intrinsic value of ∼0.3 at 6 GHz. Beam smoothing significantly affects the polarization properties below ≲ 1.5 GHz, reducing (p) to ≲ 0.01 at 0.5 GHz. At frequencies ≳ 5 GHz, polarization remains largely unaffected, even when recovered using RM synthesis. Thus, our results underline the need for high-frequency (≳ 5 GHz) observations with future radio telescopes to effectively probe the properties of polarized emission in the ICM. © 2021 The Author(s).","dynamo; galaxies: Clusters: Intracluster medium; galaxies: Magnetic fields; MHD; turbulence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100292332

Flash boiling atomization, achieved by heating the fuel before injection, can notably improve spray atomization and reduce the occurrence of pool fire, thus reduce soot emission under extreme conditions. This investigation compared the performance of subcooled spray combustions and flash boiling spray combustions with the use of an optical engine facility. The optical engine was equipped with an optical liner so that side views of the combustion can be captured with a high-speed color camera. The high-speed measurement data from early injection conditions were then analyzed with the HSV color model to investigate the flame characteristics in the premixed, infrared, and diffusion flame regions. Indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and particulate number (PN) under different conditions were also analyzed under different conditions.

The internal cost is the actual cost of the industry chain, while the external cost is converted into the cost value by examining the environmental impact of pollutant emission levels in each stage of the life cycle of ethanol gasoline production. Based on this model, by selecting the project data of specific regions and manufacturers in China, it can be calculated as follows: The main links affecting the internal cost of ethanol gasoline production are crude oil procurement cost, refinery and ethanol plant construction cost; The main influencing link of external cost is the emission of ethanol gasoline combustion, including the fuel, power and other energy consumption factors in the production of ethanol and gasoline; The cost can be optimized from the perspective of production technology, technological process, energy material consumption and various labor costs. Assuming E10 is used in the whole Chinese market, the empirical results are as follows: among the pollutants produced by the use of ethanol-added gasoline in the whole region, CO2 emission reduction is the largest, exceeding 53 million tons, followed by CO and wastewater emission reduction of 1.78 million tons and 1.58 million tons respectively. In terms of the conventional gasoline, the CO emission reduction of about 20% is the largest, followed by about 17% reduction of HC, about 15% reduction of SO2 and about 9% reduction of CO2 respectively. These results show that the promotion of ethanol gasoline (E10) usage in China has a considerable reduction effect of emission if the availability of raw materials are sufficient. The life cycle external cost of ethanol gasoline is 11.45%, lower than that of conventional gasoline. In 2019, China's fuel ethanol production capacity was 4.15 million tons, and the actual production was about 3 million tons. Assuming that all of it were used to produce E10 ethanol gasoline, compared with traditional gasoline consumption, the emission reduction benefit of E10 gasoline would be nearly $84.7 million. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Costs; Emission control; Energy utilization; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Gasoline; Gasoline refining; Petroleum industry; Sulfur dioxide; Wages; CO2 emission reduction; Conventional gasoline; Gasoline production; Life cycle cost model; Pollutant emission; Production technology; Technological process; Wastewater emissions; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103844114

Ruminal methane (CH4) emissions from ruminants not only pollute the environment and exacerbate the greenhouse effect, but also cause animal energy losses and low production efficiency. Consequently, it is necessary to find ways of reducing methane emissions in ruminants. Studies have reported that feed additives such as nitrogen-containing compounds, probiotics, prebiotics, and plant extracts significantly reduce ruminant methane; however, systematic reviews of such studies are lacking. The present article summarizes research over the past five years on the effects of nitrogen-containing compounds, probiotics, probiotics, and plant extracts on methane emissions in ruminants. The paper could provide theoretical support and guide future research in animal production and global warming mitigation. Methods. This review uses the Web of Science database to search keywords related to ruminants and methane reduction in the past five years, and uses Sci-Hub, PubMed, etc. as auxiliary searchers. Read, filter, list, and summarize all the retrieved documents, and finally complete this article. Results. Most of the extracts can not only significantly reduce CH4 greenhouse gas emissions, but they will not cause negative effects on animal and human health either. Therefore, this article reviews the mechanisms of CH4 production in ruminants and the application and effects of N-containing compounds, probiotics, prebiotics, and plant extracts on CH4 emission reduction in ruminants based on published studies over the past 5 years. Conclusion. Our review provides a theoretical basis for future research and the application of feed additives in ruminant CH4 emission reduction activities.

In this study, 30 provinces with different population sizes and in different stages of development in China, were selected to explore the spatial heterogeneity of carbon emissions by exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), combined with geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR). The findings revealed that (1) energy-related carbon emissions at the province-level in China increased from 1997 to 2016, with an increment of 8,893 million tons; (2) there is a significant positive spatial correlation between provincial carbon emissions, which showed the characteristics of rising first and then falling; this indicated that provincial carbon emissions have obvious spatial dependent characteristics; (3) the tertiary industry ratio had a restraining effect on carbon emissions, whereas the other three variables, namely GDP, urbanization rate, and energy intensity had a positive effect on carbon emissions of provinces in China; and (4) province-scale spatial differences in and distribution patterns of carbon emissions within the same countrywide, which will help decision making in terms of carbon trading and ecological compensation mechanisms. Therefore, we suggested that in the formulation of reduction policies for carbon emissions, policymakers need to adapt to local conditions which accord to the characteristics of the province. © 2021 Technoscience Publications.

Therefore the combustion properties of methane, the major component of natural gas, have received great attention recently. This work aims to provide skeletal and reduced kinetic models for methane oxidation, which can be used for efficient simulations of methane combustion under engine-relevant conditions. The Foundational Fuel Chemistry Model (FFCM-1) developed at Stanford University served as the starting kinetic model for the reduction process. A 25 species skeletal model was firstly obtained by using sensitivity analysis and a 17 species reduced model was subsequently obtained through quasi-steady-state assumptions. The reduction procedure was performed within the parameter range of pressure from 1 to 120 atm, initial temperature for homogeneous ignition from 1000 to 2500 K, and equivalence ratio from 0.6 to 1.4, which includes the engine relevant conditions. Extensive validations of the present skeletal and reduced kinetic models were demonstrated through comparison with the original FFCM-1 model in the prediction of the homogeneous ignition, extinction and ignition in perfectly stirred reactor, premixed flame propagation and detonation properties. Very good agreement is achieved and thereby the original FFCM-1 model can be replaced by the present skeletal or reduced kinetic models in simulations of methane combustion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Engine-relevant condition; Flame propagation; Ignition; Kinetic model reduction; Methane oxidation","Combustion; Engines; Kinetic parameters; Methane; Musculoskeletal system; Natural gas; Sensitivity analysis; Combustion property; Detonation properties; Efficient simulation; Extinction and ignition; Initial temperatures; Perfectly stirred reactor; Quasi-steady-state assumptions; Stanford University; Kinetic theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096118096

The quantitative indicators of GHG emissions for 1992 and 2017 of six countries with developed agriculture and vast territories—Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Russia, and the United States—are compared. The results of calculations carried out using the database of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO UN) show that all these countries have to a degree reduced GHG emissions per unit of production over 25 years. The largest reduction from 1992 to 2017 was achieved by Russia (49%), and the smallest, by Canada (8%). In 2017, in Australia, Brazil, Russia, and the United States, GHG emissions per unit of crop production amounted to 0.06–0.07 t of CO2 equivalent per Mcal, while in Canada and China, it was 0.09–0.10 t of CO2-equivalent per Mcal. The results of a comparative study show that Russia is able to implement a competitive advantage in the world agri-food markets, since it is currently a leading exporter of grain and oilseeds. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","agricultural intensification; carbon footprint; greenhouse gas emissions; sustainable development; yield",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107525873

As mechanical air conditioning is a primary adaptive technology for managing rising temperatures in cities, we examine in this paper the impact of a prolonged blackout on heat exposure in residential structures during heat wave conditions, when air conditioning is most critical to human health. Our approach combines a regional climate modeling system with a building energy model to simulate how a concurrent heat wave and grid failure event impacts residential building-interior temperatures across Phoenix. Our results find a substantial increase in heat exposure across residential buildings in response to the loss of electrical power and mechanical cooling systems, with such an event potentially exposing more than one million residents to hazardous levels of heat.

Data scarcity on the auxiliary power demand at berth has limited the scope and temporal resolution of previous studies to few ports and ships. We establish a novel method to estimate the auxiliary power demand at berth for 714 major ports in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK). Therefore, emission report data from the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification scheme of the European Union and ship tracking data from the Automatic Identification System are combined. Annual emissions of 3 Mt (/ 5 Mt) CO2 could be avoided if the auxiliary power demand at berth would be supplied from national grids (/ from CO2-neutral electricity). This equals an average reduction of overall shipping emissions by 2.2% (3.7%), and requires only 0.2% (6.4 TWh) of the current electricity generation capacity of the EEA and the UK.

Forest thinning is being implemented as a strategy for reducing forest vulnerability to disturbance, including mortality from fire, insects, and drought, as well as protecting human communities. However, the terrestrial carbon balance impacts of thinning remain uncertain across regions, spatiotemporal scales, and treatment types. Continuous and in situ long-term measurements of partial harvest impacts to stand-scale carbon and water cycle dynamics are nonetheless rare. Here, we examine post-thinning carbon and water flux impacts in a young ponderosa pine forest in Northern Idaho. We examine in situ stock and flux impacts during the 3 years after treatment as well as simulate the forest sector carbon balance through 2050, including on and off-site net emissions. During the observation period, increases in tree-scale net primary production (NPP) and water use persistence through summer drought did not overcome the impacts of density reduction, leading to 45% annual reductions of NPP. Growth duration remained constrained by summer drought in control and thinned stands. Ecosystem model and life cycle assessment estimates demonstrated a net forest sector carbon deficit relative to control stands of 27.0 Mg C ha−1 in 2050 due to emissions from dead biomass pools despite increases to net ecosystem production. Our results demonstrate dynamics resulting in carbon losses from forest thinning, providing a baseline with which to inform landscape-scale modeling and assess tradeoffs between harvest losses and potential gains from management practices. © 2021.

Objective: This review intends to provide an overview on the legal requirements for testing potential contaminants in herbal drugs used for the production of herbal medicinal products. Methodology: The following issues are described and discussed:. For the assessment of pesticide residues, Chapter 2.8.13 of the European Pharmacopoeia and Regulation (EC) 396/2005 applies, for heavy metals the general Pharmacopoeia monograph as well as the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Q3D guideline on elemental impurities. The Pharmacopoeia also includes limits and acceptance criteria for microbiological purity and aflatoxins, respectively. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are mentioned in Regulation (EC) 1881/2006 for food as well as in a Reflection Paper on herbal medicinal products. For several years, a potential contamination with pyrrolizidine alkaloids was discussed which led to measures being imposed on industry and health authorities. Results: Various examples demonstrate that the evaluation of data from daily analytical practice is extremely useful to gain an overview on the occurrence of residues and/or contaminants in herbal drugs and herbal preparations. Such evaluations might assist manufacturers in their individual risk assessment and the definition of their testing strategies and contribute to guarantee the quality and safety of the marketed products. Conclusion: Annual data evaluations demonstrate that a remarkable decrease of the pyrrolizidine alkaloid content burden in herbal drugs and extracts used for the production of herbal medicinal products has been achieved over the past few years. However, it has also become clear that this issue cannot be completely solved in the near future. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","contaminants; elemental impurities; herbal medicinal products; pesticide residue; pyrrolizidine alkaloids","aflatoxin; heavy metal; herbaceous agent; mycotoxin; pesticide residue; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrrolizidine alkaloid; drug; plant medicinal product; Bacillus subtilis; drug contamination; drug impurity; drug legislation; drug purity; drug quality; drug screening; Escherichia coli; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; medicinal plant; microbial contamination; microbiological examination; nonhuman; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Review; risk assessment; Salmonella; Staphylococcus aureus; weed; drug contamination; herbal medicine; Drug Contamination; Herbal Medicine; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Plant Preparations; Plants, Medicinal",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071194922

Box 261, Thessaloniki, GR‐54124, Greece","Drought and heat stresses are major factors limiting crop growth and productivity, and their effect is more devastating when occurring concurrently. Plant glutathione transferases (GSTs) are differentially expressed in response to different stimuli, conferring tolerance to a wide range of abiotic stresses. GSTs from drought‐tolerant Phaseolus vulgaris var. “Plake Megalosperma Prespon” is expected to play an important role in the response mechanisms to combined and single heat and drought stresses. Herein, we examined wild‐type N. tabacum plants (cv. Basmas Xanthi) and T1 transgenic lines overexpressing the stress‐induced Pvgstu3–3 and Pvgstu2–2 genes. The overexpres-sion of Pvgstu3–3 contributed to potential thermotolerance and greater plant performance under combined stress. Significant alterations in the primary metabolism were observed in the transgenic plants between combined stress and stress‐free conditions. Stress‐responsive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and transcription factors (TFs) related to photosynthesis, signal transduction, starch and sucrose metabolism, osmotic adjustment and thermotolerance, were identified under combined stress. In contrast, induction of certain DEGs and TF families under stress‐free conditions indicated that transgenic plants were in a primed state. The overexpression of the Pvgstu3–3 is play-ing a leading role in the production of signaling molecules, induction of specific metabolites and activation of the protective mechanisms for enhanced protection against combined abiotic stresses in tobacco. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper is an attempt to change the perception concerning such waste. In the context of circular economy, textile waste has to be conceived as a source for carbon and energy. A new attitude is compulsory due to the increase of post-consumer waste quantity since the volume of textile consumption has lately increased. Fast fashion cycle and cheaper textile products having a shorter lifetime led to an increase of the quantity of post-consumer textile waste. Demands for pollution reduction generated the concern to upcycle the textile waste in order to recover, at least partially, the materials as well as the energy consumed for their manufacture, reducing accordingly the carbon and water footprints of these products,. The scarcity of raw materials and of fossil fuels, the high environmental impact of the simple disposal of waste, imposed a new policy regarding the transformation of the linear economy which characterizes today’s textile industry into a circular one, leading to a lower environmental impact. This involves the valorization of post-consumer waste by recycling or at least by a partial recovery of the materials and energy spent for the manufacture of these products. A good management of post-consumer textile waste is mandatory for attaining a zero waste target. Some good practices in the field are presented by this paper. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Energy production; Recovering fiber content; Recycling worn clothes; Textile post-consumer waste; Valorization of carbon content","economic conditions; environmental impact; industrial waste; perception; public attitude; recycling; textile industry; waste management; fossil fuel; recycling; textile; textile industry; waste management; Fossil Fuels; Recycling; Textile Industry; Textiles; Waste Management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100041600

The major portion of annual precipitation in this region falls during the Indian Summer Monsoon season (June–September); however, this region also receives a significant amount of rainfall during the pre-monsoon season (March–May). Here, we quantitatively reconstruct the climate of the Upper Siwalik subgroup, eastern Himalayan region, based on fossil assemblages using the Coexistence Approach (CA). The age of the fossil assemblage is considered to be late Pliocene–early Pleistocene. Data reconstructed for the present-day and past pre-monsoon rainfall in Northeastern India indicate an increasing trend since the late Miocene–early Pliocene. During the late Pliocene–early Pleistocene (Upper Siwalik), the temperature seasonality between warm (27–28.1 °C) and cold months (22–23.6 °C) was less pronounced compared with present-day warm (27–27.7 °C) and cold (14.8–15.4 °C) months conditions at the fossil locality. The reconstructed rainfall data indicate a monsoonal type of climate having a strong seasonality in wet and dry seasons during the deposition of the Upper Siwalik sediments. Moreover, composition of the fossil floras and reconstructed palaeoclimate suggest a vegetation shift from dominantly wet evergreen to semi-evergreen at the fossil locality, coincident with an increase in length of the dry season. The comparison of reconstructed CA data and climate modelling data of a Gelasian time slice with that of previously reconstructed climate data by using Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Programme (CLAMP) analysis of the late Pliocene–early Pleistocene (Upper Siwalik) fossils of the same locality provides nearly the identical result. Furthermore, all the reconstructed data indicate a monsoonal type of climate during the deposition of the Upper Siwalik sediments. © 2021, Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Arunachal Pradesh; Coexistence Approach; Fossil flora; Monsoon; Palaeoclimate","climate modeling; fossil assemblage; fossil record; multivariate analysis; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; seasonality; Himalayas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100449924

Further, near-surface air pollutants were investigated at an urban megacity Delhi during 01 March to 31 May 2020.

Charney School of Marine Sciences, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel","The Eastern Mediterranean continental slope offshore Israel became a focus of exploration for, and production of, natural gas in recent years. The 2010–2011 Nautilus ROV expedition performed detailed video recordings and sampling in two areas offshore Israel: the Palmachim disturbance, southwest of Tel Aviv, and an area offshore Acre, north of Haifa. An analytical programme regarding the carbonate structures was carried out, examining the overall mineralogy, stable C and O isotopes, and Ca, Mg, and Mn concentrations. This provided information on their composition and as a result, an indication of the carbon sources and temperature of formation. The major authigenic minerals identified comprised magnesian calcite, dolomite, aragonite, and kutnohorite. The detrital minerals included quartz, clays, feldspars, and rare augite and enstatite, likely transported from the Nile estuary. The carbon isotope composition of aliquots taken from nineteen samples from these areas have an overall δ13C range from −62.0 to −0.1‰PDB, indicating a range of microbial/biogenic and thermogenic methane contributions. The range of δ18O from 2.7 to 7.0‰PDB reflects the range of temperatures of formation. The δ18O characteristics differ among areas. In general, high values; δ18O &gt;5‰PDB are recorded from area N2 of the Palmachim disturbance, indicating low temperature of formation. Low values of δ18O (&lt;5‰PDB) were measured from areas W2 and W3 of the Palmachim disturbance, together with samples from area N2 of the Palmachim disturbance, and samples from areas A1 and A2 offshore Acre indicate high temperature origin. Samples from an inactive chimney from area N2 range from pure dolomite to pure magnesian calcite. This trend is linked to δ13C increase from −39.9 to −0.1‰(PDB), and δ18O decrease from 6.2 to 4.7‰(PDB). These values indicate a decrease in the methane-derived carbon contribution and an increase in temperature. Kutnohorite, Ca(Mn2+, Mg, Fe 2+)(CO3)2 is a major component in samples from Acre, and less so in the Palmachim disturbance. An exploratory investigation of the relationship between Mn/Ca, δ18O and δ13C revealed that samples having Mn/Ca &lt; 0.1(wt./wt.) have δ13C&lt;−50‰PDB indicating a microbial methane source, while samples with Mn/Ca &gt; 0.1 have δ13C between −35 and −22‰PDB suggesting a thermogenic origin. These results suggest that the mineralogical, isotopic δ13, δ18O, and chemical (Mn/Ca indicative of kutnohorite) characteristics of surficial carbonate structures can indicate and distinguish between deep and shallow methane sources in the Eastern Mediterranean. © 2021, The Author(s).","Aragonite; Biogenic; Dolomite; Eastern Mediterranean; Israel; Kutnohorite; Magnesian calcite; Thermogenic methane; Vent carbonates; δ18O, δ13C 87Sr/86Sr","Calcite; Carbon; Carbonation; Feldspar; Gas industry; Isotopes; Magnesia; Methane; Temperature; Video recording; Authigenic minerals; Carbon isotope composition; Continental slope; Eastern Mediterranean; Low temperatures; Mn concentrations; Thermogenic methane; Thermogenic origin; Offshore oil well production; aragonite; authigenic mineral; carbon isotope; carbonate sediment; concentration (composition); continental slope; dolomite; isotopic composition; methane; mineralogy; oxygen isotope; surficial sediment; Acre [Northern District]; Haifa [Israel]; Israel; Mediterranean Sea; Northern District; Tel Aviv; Nautilus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101767028

An online survey was administered in Australia (N = 1000), the UK (N = 1000), and the USA (N = 1026) where there are ongoing field trials of this technique. Findings are similar across all three countries with many participants unfamiliar with enhanced weathering and unsure about supporting the use of enhanced weathering. Results show that positive affect is the main predictor for support of this technique, along with perceived benefits and level of concern about climate change. Open-ended questions asking why respondents would or would not support the use of enhanced weathering elicit mainly affective concepts, with enhanced weathering seen by individual respondents as either something mainly positive or mainly negative, with others saying it sounds risky and/or would have impacts on the environment. The way in which enhanced weathering is communicated is likely to influence support of the use of this strategy so must be undertaken carefully.

Grounded in an expert guided literature review of 198 studies and their corresponding 332 case studies, it assesses the linkages between low carbon transitions—including renewable electricity, biofuel, nuclear power, smart grids, electric vehicles, and land use management—with degradation, dispossession and destruction. It draws on a framework that envisions the political ecology of low-carbon transitions as consisting of four distinct processes: enclosure (capture of land or resources), exclusion (unfair planning), encroachment (destruction of the environment), or entrenchment (worsening of inequality or vulnerability). The study vigorously interrogates how these elements play out by country and across countries, by type of mitigation option, by type of victim or affected group, by process, and by severity, e.g. from modern slavery to organized crime, from violence, murder and torture to the exacerbation of child prostitution or the destruction of pristine ecosystems. It also closely examines the locations, disciplinary affiliations, methods and spatial units of analysis employed by this corpus of research, with clear and compelling insights for future work in the space of geography, climate change, and energy transitions. It suggest five critical avenues for future research: greater inclusivity and diversity, rigor and comparative analysis, focus on mundane technologies and non-Western case studies, multi-scalar analysis, and focus on policy and recommendations. At times, low-carbon transitions and climate action can promote squalor over sustainability and leave angry communities, disgruntled workers, scorned business partners, and degraded landscapes in their wake. Nevertheless, ample opportunities exist to make a future low-carbon world more pluralistic, democratic, and just. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Energy transitions; Low-carbon transitions; Mobility; Political ecology; Political economy; Renewable energy",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099618420

The present study reviews the state-of-art catalysts for NO reduction by CO, CH4, and H2. In terms of NO reduction by CO and CH4, it focuses on the preparation methodologies and catalytic properties of noble metal catalysts and non-noble metal catalysts. In the technology of NO removal by H2, the NO removal performance of the noble metal catalyst is mainly discussed from the traditional carrier and the new carrier, such as Al2O3, ZSM-5, OMS-2, MOFs, perovskite oxide, etc. By adopting new preparation methodologies and introducing the secondary metal component, the catalysts supported by a traditional carrier could achieve a much higher activity. New carrier for catalyst design seems a promising aspect for improving the catalyst performance, i.e., catalytic activity and stability, in future. Moreover, mechanisms of catalytic NO reduction by these three agents are discussed in-depth. Through the critical review, it is found that the adsorption of NOx and the decomposition of NO are key steps in NO removal by CO, and the activation of the C-H bond in CH4 and H-H bonds in H2 serves as a rate determining step of the reaction of NO removal by CH4 and H2, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the lack of randomized exposure often prevents the comparison of similar groups of exposed and unexposed units. This design barrier leads the environmental epidemiology field to mainly estimate associations between environmental exposures and health outcomes. A recently developed causal inference pipeline was developed to guide researchers interested in estimating the effects of plausible hypothetical interventions for policy recommendations. This article illustrates how this multistaged pipeline can help environmental epidemiologists reconstruct and analyze hypothetical randomized experiments by investigating whether an air pollution reduction intervention decreases the risk of multiple sclerosis relapses in Alsace region, France. The epidemiology literature reports conflicted findings on the relationship between air pollution and multiple sclerosis. Some studies found significant associations, whereas others did not. Two case-crossover studies reported significant associations between the risk of multiple sclerosis relapses and the exposure to air pollutants in the Alsace region. We use the same study population as these epidemiological studies to illustrate how appealing this causal inference approach is to estimate the effects of hypothetical, but plausible, environmental interventions. © 2020 The Authors.

While this could include many different types of interventions to reduce deforestation and degradation, a consensus has emerged that they should safeguard and “do no harm” to the forest-based livelihoods of local people. Many REDD+ projects have been designed to incentivize forest conservation and support local livelihoods by promoting sustainable use of the forest, hence increasing the revenues earned by local households from forest products. We examine two such projects in the Peruvian Amazon, using panel survey data from over 400 households gathered in 2011 and 2014. In the 3 years between surveys, we observed a severe decline in forest revenue. However, by using a BACI study design and matching, we show that this decrease was not caused by the REDD+ interventions. Thus, REDD+ “did no harm” to local people, at least in terms of forest revenues in the early phases of these two projects in the Peruvian Amazon. © Copyright © 2021 Solis, Cronkleton, Sills, Rodriguez-Ward and Duchelle.","average treatment effect on the treated; Brazil nut; carbon payments; difference-in-differences; Peruvian Amazon; quasi-experimental impact evaluation; REDD+; sustainable forest management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106058356

This is particularly important in Poland’s energy transition, since the country produces energy mainly from conventional sources, i.e., coal, gas, and crude oil. Adverse climate change caused by high emissions of the economy based on the combustion of hydrocarbons as well as the growing public awareness have made it necessary to look for new environmentally friendly energy sources. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that the use of alternative energy sources, biomass in particular, is compatible with sustainable development policy. Eight indicators for the EU-28 and for Poland were analysed in order to verify the progress in modifying the energy mix between 2010 and 2018 in the context of implementing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The analysis showed that both in the EU-28 and in Poland, the aggregated indicator taking into account the positive and negative change in the values of individual indicators improved between 2010 and 2018. In the EU-28, this indicator is higher (180.1) than in Poland (152.3). The lower value for Poland is mainly due to the fact that the main source of energy in Poland remains hard coal and lignite. However, the noticeable increase in recent years in the share of energy from renewable sources, biomass included, allows us to look with hope to a rapidly growing indicator measuring progress towards a sustainable development goal, and to improving environmental standards. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper aims to determine the health impacts of such air pollutants on the cyclist population of Dublin City through the use of floating bike data and emission modelling software. Methods: Through the use of COPERT Street Level vehicle emissions are estimated and Operational Street Pollution Model, NO2 and PM2.5 quantities and NO2 concentrations were modelled on four separate roads that had been identified as some of the busiest cycle corridors in Dublin city through the use of floating bike data. The NO2 quantities were then used to estimate the associated economic impact and concentrations were used to estimate the health impact on the exposed cyclist population using the WHO Burden of Disease (BOD) method. Results: The results suggested that as much as 18.4 million Euro worth of damage is done each year on just one of the four roads modelled in this research, indicating that the total damage being done in Dublin city could reach into the billions a year, as this is only considering NO2 pollution on one road. In terms of the BOD results, it was calculated that as many as 37 premature deaths could be caused due to exposure to the NO2 concentrations modelled, resulting in 412 Years of Life Lost (YLL). Conclusions: Through the use of modelled scenarios where the fleet configuration changes, the findings of this study create an argument that significant measures need to be taken to reduce the air pollution levels in Dublin in order to prevent the needless infliction of disease and premature death on the relevant exposed population. © 2021 The Authors",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099965716

This strategy is divided into three main areas named “growth.” One of these is sustainable growth. This is an area of sustainability, where the partial targets are referred to as the “20-20-20 approach,” and includes a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, an increase in energy efficiency, and the sharing of renewable energy sources. However, questions arise, including: How do member states meet these targets? Which countries are leaders in this area? According to these stated questions, the aim of this article is to assess how EU countries are meeting the set targets for sustainable growth resulting from the Europe 2020 strategy and to identify the countries with the best results in this area. We looked for answers to these questions in the analysis of sustainable indicators, which were transformed into a synthetic measure for comparability of the resulting values.

Regular collection of fuelwood for domestic needs of cooking, water and room heating, cattle-feed preparation, bathing, cleaning and washing is considered one of the major reasons for forest degradation, women drudgery and household carbon emissions. Alternative commercial sources of energy like LPG, electricity and kerosene oil fail to address the requirement of households in the temperate zone due to harsh winter conditions for 6–8 months in a year for demand of water and space heating. Therefore, the present study was initiated to install a locally designed, cost-effective solar water-heating systems with the aim of providing immediate clean energy solutions to the mountain households for water heating to achieve forest conservation, mitigate household carbon emission and women drudgery in fuelwood collection. Installation of 204 locally fabricated solar water-heating systems of 100 l/day capacity was completed in two sites in Man-di and Kullu districts of Himachal Pradesh, India. Installation of these systems on an average achieved saving of 31.47% and 45.41% fuelwood at selected villages of Kullu and Mandi sites respectively. Maximum fuelwood saving through solar water heating was observed in the winter season. This resulted in timesaving for women, and visible improvement in their health and hygiene through availability of hot water. Fabrication of solar water-heating systems provided new skills and avenues to the rural artisans.

The experimental site under silty clay loam in southeastern South Dakota was sampled before planting in early spring, after planting in early summer, and during the maize grain-filling stage in early autumn of 2017, from the surface 0–7.5-cm depth in 2017. In general, the cover crops had 9, 17 and 19% higher geometric mean of enzyme activities than the no-cover-crop plots at pre-planting, after planting and the grain-filling stage of maize, respectively. Although there were not many differences between “NT vs. CT” and “2-year vs. 3-year vs. 4-year rotation” treatments, additive effects between “tillage and cover crops” and “rotation and cover crops” were observed. The MBC and β-glucosidase activity were 31 and 54% higher, respectively, with cover crop vs. no cover crop under 4-year rotation after planting of maize. Similarly, significant interactions between “cover crop and tillage” for hot water-extractable nitrogen and urease activity at pre-planting, and β-D-glucosidase after planting of maize, were observed. At the grain-filling stage, the hot water-extractable contents were significantly greater under cover crop as compared to the no-cover-crop plots. Furthermore, this study also concluded that seasonal fluctuations are important for understanding the management impacts on soil carbon fractions and biochemical properties. Highlights: Soil microbial properties responded differently to tillage, rotation and cover crops during the maize growing season. Residues produced by cover crops during winter fallow impacted soil functioning and interacted with other management factors (rotation and tillage system). Rotation impacted the carbon availability after planting, whereas tillage affected the enzyme activities. Winter cover crops influenced labile soil organic matter (SOM) and enzymatic properties after 4 years. © 2020 British Society of Soil Science","cover crops; labile carbon fractions and enzymes; no-till; seasonal variations","additive; cover crop; enzyme activity; growing season; maize; seasonal variation; silty clay loam; soil carbon; soil organic matter; winter; South Dakota; United States; Avena sativa; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090781672

Situated at the crossroads of extensive urbanization, unequal development, and high climate vulnerability, Indian cities face an urgent imperative to adapt to current and projected climate change impacts. While a global assessment of urban adaptation notes, “of 43 Indian cities…we found no examples of municipal government adaptation being reported” (Araos et al., 2016: 380), Indian cities are increasingly reporting various planned and autonomous actions that have adaptation co-benefits. We review city plans and peer reviewed and gray literature to examine adaptation action in 53 Indian cities with a population of >1 million. We find: (1) approximately half of these cities report adaptation actions, 67% of which are in the implementation phase; (2) adaptation is typically implemented through sectoral projects focusing on particular risks; (3) some interventions have synergies with sustainable development and mitigation, representing opportunities for co-benefits; and (4) there remain gaps in using city-scale risk assessments to inform adaptation action.

Not explored in the environmental policy and alternative energy literature is the conflicted (or compassionate) conservative; the individual who espouses conservative values yet supports social justice-promotive public policies.

These regions are warming at over twice the global average rate, causing permafrost thaw, and exposing previously inert carbon to decomposition and emission to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases. However, it is unclear how peatland hydrological behaviour, vegetation structure and carbon balance, and the linkages between them, will respond to permafrost thaw in a warming climate. Here we show that permafrost peatlands follow divergent ecohydrological trajectories in response to recent climate change within the same rapidly warming region (northern Sweden). Whether a site becomes wetter or drier depends on local factors and the autogenic response of individual peatlands. We find that bryophyte-dominated vegetation demonstrates resistance, and in some cases resilience, to climatic and hydrological shifts. Drying at four sites is clearly associated with reduced carbon sequestration, while no clear relationship at wetting sites is observed. We highlight the complex dynamics of permafrost peatlands and warn against an overly-simple approach when considering their ecohydrological trajectories and role as C sinks under a warming climate. © 2021 The Author(s).

The developed immunosensor demonstrated high sensitivity towards DENV IgG within a wide linear working range (125-2000 ng mL-1) under the optimised sensing conditions. The limit of detection was determined to be 22.5 ng mL-1. The immunosensor also showed high specificity towards DENV IgG, capable of differentiating DENV IgG from the antibodies of other infectious diseases including the similarly structured Zika virus (ZIKV). The ability of the immunosensor to detect dengue antibodies in serum samples was also verified by conducting tests on mouse serum samples.

We introduce here concepts from control theory, a branch of applied mathematics that is effective at steering complex dynamical systems to desired states, and distinguish between open- and closed-loop control. We attempt (1) to show that current scientific work on carbon-climate feedbacks and climate policy more closely resembles the conceptual model of open- than closed-loop control, (2) to introduce a mathematical generalization of the carbon-climate system as a compartmental dynamical system that can facilitate the formal treatment of the closed-loop control problem, and (3) to formulate carbon-climate control as a congestion control problem, discussing important concepts such as observability and controllability. We also show that most previous discussions on climate change mitigation and policy development have relied on an implicit assumption of open-loop control that does not consider frequent corrections due to deviations of goals from observations. Using a reduced complexity model, we illustrate that the problem of managing the global carbon cycle can be abstracted as a network congestion problem, accounting for nonlinear behavior and feedback from a global carbon monitoring system. As opposed to scenarios, the goal of closed-loop control is to develop rules for continuously steering the global carbon-climate system away from dangerous climate change. © 2021, The Author(s).","Climate policy; Dynamical systems; Earth system dynamics; Global carbon cycle; Nonlinear control","Climate change; Climate control; Climate models; Complex networks; Control theory; Dynamical systems; Fossil fuels; Traffic congestion; Carbon-climate systems; Climate change mitigation; Closed-loop control; Complex dynamical systems; Dangerous climate changes; Fossil fuel emissions; Global carbon cycle; Reduced complexity modeling; Closed loop control systems",Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102390147

Here, we consider high-stakes investments across the water, energy, and food sectors for two major river basins in a climate transition zone in Africa. We integrate detailed interpretation of observed and modeled climate-system behavior with hydrological modeling and decision-relevant performance metrics. For the Rufiji River in Tanzania, projected risks for the mid-21st century are similar to those of the present day, but for the Lake Malawi-Shire River, future risk exceeds that experienced during the 20th century. In both basins a repeat of an early-20th century multi-year drought would challenge the viability of proposed infrastructure. A long view, which emphasizes past and future changes in variability, set within a broader context of climate-information interpretation and decision making, is crucial for screening the risk to infrastructure. © 2021 The AuthorsIn sub-Saharan Africa, exposure and vulnerability to climate risk are high across crucial economic sectors. Yet, investments are still made under the assumption that rainfall or streamflow will resemble historical patterns, and most climate-impact studies focus on changes in mean climate. Our analysis identifies critical climate risks to water-energy-food infrastructure performance in two large river basins targeted for major development and highlights the need for climate risk assessments to incorporate a long view of variability. © 2021 The AuthorsDespite awareness of climate impacts on development, climate variability and future change have received limited attention in investment decisions. We examined past and future climate variability with the aim of understanding the main source of climate risk to development plans across the water, energy, and food sectors in southern East Africa, a relatively neglected region in terms of climate science and targeted for extensive infrastructure development. Infrastructure performance shows high sensitivity to multi-year droughts that have occurred in the past, which would challenge the viability of proposed infrastructure. Contingency plans for the worst-case extremes need to be developed. Our assessment exemplifies the need for investors and donors to take a comprehensive approach to climate risk.

The methodology uses Climate Smart Agricultural Prioritization (CSAP) toolkit a multi-objective land-use allocation model, and detailed databases, characterizing the agricultural production processes at the land-unit scale. A case study has also been demonstrated for Bihar, a state in India. The quantification of trade-offs demonstrates that under different technology growth pathways alone the food self-sufficiency for Bihar cannot be achieved whilst the reduction in emission intensity targets are achievable up to 2040. However, both food self-sufficiency and reduction in emission intensity can be achieved if we relax constraints on dietary demand and focus on kilo-calories maximization targets. The district-level analysis shows that food self-sufficiency and reduction in emission intensity targets can be achieved at a local scale through efficient crop-technology portfolios. © 2021 by the authors.

Understanding the spatial pattern of heatwave is vital for providing the corresponding weather services, making climate change adaptation strategies and heat-health actions. In this study, we present an approach to estimate the heatwave spatial patterns by utilizing the WUDAPT Level 0 data and machine learning. The analysis is based on two years (2009 and 2016) of air temperature data from 86 meteorological monitoring stations in Guangdong province of China, a subtropical region with frequent hot and sultry weather in summer. First, heatwave conditions were quantified by calculating the number of hot days and frequency of heatwave events in each year and used as the response variables. Then, random forest models were built by using a geospatial dataset consisting of WUDAPT and urban canopy parameters (UCP) as predictor variables. Based on the resultant models, spatial patterns of heatwave were estimated and mapped at 100 m spatial-resolution. The results show that this approach is able to estimate heatwave spatial patterns using open data and inform urban policy and decision-making.

The accurate forecasting of air quality can guide the formulation of mitigation strategies and reduce exposure to air pollution. It is beneficial to explicitly consider both spatial and temporal information of multiple factors, e.g., the meteorological data, in the forecasting of air pollutant concentrations. The temporal information of relevant factors collected at a location should be considered for forecasting. In addition, these factors recorded at other locations may also provide useful information. Existing methods utilizing the spatio-temporal information of these relevant factors are usually based on some very complicated frameworks. In this study, we propose a novel and simple spatial attention-based long short-term memory (SA-LSTM) that combines LSTM and a spatial attention mechanism to adaptively utilize the spatio-temporal information of multiple factors for forecasting air pollutant concentrations. Specifically, the SA-LSTM employs gated recurrent connections to extract temporal information of multiple factors at individual locations, and the spatial attention mechanism to spatially fuse the temporal information extracted at these locations. This method is effective and applicable to forecast any air pollutant concentrations when spatio-temporal information of relevant factors has to be utilized. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed SA-LSTM, we apply it to forecast the daily air quality in Hong Kong, a high density city with peculiar cityscapes, by using the air quality and meteorological data. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed SA-LSTM outperforms the conventional models with respect to one-day forecast accuracy, especially for extreme values. Moreover, the attention weights learned by the SA-LSTM can identify hotspots of the air pollution process for reducing computational complexity of forecasting and provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of air pollution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Attention mechanism; Long short-term memory","Air quality; Location; Long short-term memory; Meteorology; Air pollutant concentrations; Complicated frameworks; Conventional models; High-density cities; Meteorological data; Mitigation strategy; Spatiotemporal information; Temporal information; Weather forecasting; air quality; atmospheric pollution; forecasting method; hot spot; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollutant; air quality; article; attention; forecasting; Hong Kong; human; short term memory; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097084463

The e-waste collection issue has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in developing countries, due to low collection rates. This study aims to search for progressive solutions in the e-waste collection sphere with close-to-zero transport and infrastructure costs and the minimization of consumers’ efforts towards an enhanced e-waste management efficiency and collection rate. Along these lines, the present paper develops a smart reverse system of e-waste from end-of-life electronics holders to local recycling infrastructures based on intelligent information technology (IT) tools involving local delivery services to collect e-waste and connecting with interactive online maps of users’ requests. This system considers the vehicles of local delivery services as potential mobile collection points that collect and deliver e-waste to a local recycling enterprise with a minimum deviation from the planned routes. Besides e-waste transport and infrastructure costs minimization, the proposed smart e-waste reverse system supports the reduction of CO2 through the optimal deployment of e-waste collection vehicles. The present study also advances a solid rationale for involving local e-waste operators as key stakeholders of the smart e-waste reverse system.

Industrialization over the past few decades has resulted in severe aerosol pollution in India. Understanding monsoonal sensitivity to aerosol emissions in general circulation models (GCMs) could improve predictability of observed future precipitation changes. The aims here are (1) to assess the role of aerosols in India's monsoon precipitation and (2) to determine the roles of local and regional emissions. For (1), we study the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project experiments. We find that the precipitation response to changes in black carbon is highly uncertain with a large intermodel spread due in part to model differences in simulating changes in cloud vertical profiles. Effects from sulfate are clearer; increased sulfate reduces Indian precipitation, a consistency through all of the models studied here. For (2), we study bespoke simulations, with reduced Chinese and/or Indian emissions in three GCMs. A significant increase in precipitation (up to ∼20 %) is found only when both countries' sulfur emissions are regulated, which has been driven in large part by dynamic shifts in the location of convective regions in India. These changes have the potential to restore a portion of the precipitation losses induced by sulfate forcing over the last few decades. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

Renewables, particularly wind and solar power, will be predominant components of this transition. How availability of the wind and solar resource will change in the future in response to regional climate changes is an important and underdiscussed topic of the decarbonization process. Here, we study changes in potential for wind power in China and India, evaluating prospectively until the year 2060. To do this, we study a downscaled, high-resolution multimodel ensemble of CMIP5 models under high and low emissions scenarios. While there is some intermodel variability, we find that spatial changes are generally consistent across models, with decreases of up to 965 (a 1% change) and 186 TWh (a 2% change) in annual electricity generation potential for China and India, respectively. Compensating for the declining resource are weakened seasonal and diurnal variabilities, allowing for easier large-scale wind power integration. We conclude that while the ensemble indicates available wind resource over China and India will decline slightly in the future, there remains enormous potential for significant wind power expansion, which must play a major role in carbon neutral aspirations. © 2021 The Author(s).

While the convergence of shared mobility, vehicle automation, and electrification has the potential to drastically reduce transportation impacts, it requires careful integration with rapidly evolving electricity systems. Here, we examine these interactions using a U.S.-wide simulation framework encompassing private electric vehicles (EVs), shared automated EVs (SAEVs), charging infrastructure, controlled EV charging, and a grid economic dispatch model to simulate personal mobility exclusively using EVs. We find that private EVs with uncontrolled charging would reduce GHG emissions by 46% compared to gasoline vehicles. Private EVs with fleetwide controlled charging would achieve a 49% reduction in emissions from baseline and reduce peak charging demand by 53% from the uncontrolled scenario. We also find that an SAEV fleet 9% the size of today s active vehicle fleet can satisfy trip demand with only 2.6 million chargers (0.2 per EV). Such an SAEV fleet would achieve a 70% reduction in GHG emissions at 41% of the lifecycle cost as a private EV fleet with controlled charging.

A Sabatier fixed-bed reactor model with randomly stacked cylindrical particles was established by discrete element method (DEM), and the variation of the substances distribution, reaction characteristics and carbon deposition in the micro-scale catalyst was simulated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The effects of catalyst hole number and operating conditions on CO2 conversion and CH4 yield were also discussed. The result shows that as the reaction proceeds, the concentration distribution of the substances in the catalyst changes from a ring to a uniform, and the distribution of the reaction rate values in the catalyst changes from a V-shape to a U-shape. In the steady state, the catalyst is only effectively used in about 10% of the outer layer. The carbon deposition in the outer layer of the catalyst and the inlet of the reactor is more serious. And the average porosity value in the catalyst decreased by 0.012 as the reaction progressed to 1000 s. In the steady state, CH4 yield from high to low catalyst bed arrangement is 4 holes, 7 holes, 1 hole and solid. The CH4 yield can be increased by increasing the heat transfer coefficient and decreasing the inlet flow rate, and the reaction can reach a steady state faster by increasing the inlet temperature and pressure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cylindrical catalyst; Fixed-bed; Methanation; Micro-scale; Numerical simulation; Sabatier reaction","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Chemical reactors; Computational fluid dynamics; Deposition; Finite difference method; Heat transfer; Reactor cores; Carbon deposition; Concentration distributions; Cylindrical particles; Fixed bed reactor; Inlet temperature; Operating condition; Reaction characteristics; Reaction system; Catalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094563491

Cities have been promoting low carbon city (LCC) strategies to reduce carbon emissions and various methods have been introduced to assess the performance of LCC strategies. However, most of the existing assessment methods focus on overall LCC performance at city level, but the effects of individual dimensions like industrial structure and energy efficiency are ignored. The research question in this study therefore is whether an alternative method can be established to measure both the overall and dimensional LCC performance. This paper introduces a method for assessing LCC performance by using Capability Maturity Model (CMM), which is called LCC-CMM. The proposed method of LCC-CMM can help identify LCC maturity grade through assessing the performance of individual LCC dimensions which contributes to overall performance. There are four procedures in applying LCC-CMM, including to identify the Key Process Areas (KPAs) in the context of LCC, denoted as LCC-KPAs, to define the indicators for measuring the performance of LCC-KPAs, to calculate the performance score for each LCC-KPA, and to define criteria for specifying different grades of LCC capability maturity. The proposed method is proven effective through a case demonstration. The method can help policy makers to identify weak areas in LCC practice and introduce tailor-made policy measures to improve the weak areas. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Capability Maturity Model (CMM); Key Process Area (KPA); LCC maturity grade; Low carbon city (LCC)","Carbon; Energy efficiency; Environmental management; Software engineering; Urban growth; Capability maturity models; Carbon emissions; Individual dimensions; Industrial structures; Key process areas; Low-carbon cities; Research questions; Sustainable urban development; Coordinate measuring machines; carbon emission; energy efficiency; industrial structure; numerical model; performance assessment; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099156385

Design/methodology/approach: This study builds a linear optimization model to analyze the tradeoffs in developing CO2-enhance oil recovery (EOR) projects in China for a range of policy options to match points of supply with the points of demand (oil fields). The model works on optimizing CO2 application costs by meeting four principal components; CO2 storage, CO2 capture, transport costs and additional oil recovery. Findings: This study reveals new opportunities and economic sources to feed CO2-EOR applications and offers reasonable options to supply CO2 for potential points of demand. Furthermore, power plants and coal to liquid industries had the most significant and economic contributions to potential CO2-EOR projects in China. Total annual emission reduction is expected to be 10% (based on 10 Gton annual emissions). The emission reductions and potential CO2 storage from the different industries as follow; 94% from power plants, 4% from biofuel and 2% from coal to liquid plants. Social implications: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one practice aiming to reduce the amounts of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere and reduce the related social costs. However, given the relatively high cost associated with this practice, coupling it with EOR could offer a significant financial incentive to facilitate the development of CCS projects and meet climate change objectives. Originality/value: The model used in this study can be straightforwardly adapted to any geographic location where industry and policymakers are looking to simultaneously reduce CO2 emissions while increasing hydrocarbon recovery. The model is highly adaptable to local values in the parameters considered and to include additional local considerations such as geographic variation in capture costs, taxes and premiums to be placed on CO2 capture in so-called “non-attainment zones” where pollution capture make could make a project politically and economically viable. Regardless of how and where this model is applied, it is apparent that CO2 from industrial sources has substantial potential value as a coproduct that offsets its sequestration costs using existing, commercially available CO2-EOR technology, once sources and sinks are optimally paired. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","China; CO2-EOR; Economics; GAMS; Optimization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099417090

Findings were then presented primarily under two bold themes: Household fuel consumption: existing theories and evidence; and health impact of indoor air pollution. Several health effects were reported of indoor air pollution including respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, endocrine system disruption and pregnancy complications. These exposures almost double the health risks predominantly among children and women of rural communities as they are directly involved in household activities causing air pollution.

However, the organic-rich aqueous pyrolysis liquid (APL) and HTL aqueous phase (HTL-AP) produced currently have no apparent use and are challenging to manage. Furthermore, the toxic organic compounds in them can be harmful to the environment. Anaerobic digestion (AD) may be a viable method to manage the liquids and recover energy in APL and HTL-AP in form of methane-rich biogas. Integrating thermochemical processes with AD could promote a circular economy by recovering resources and reducing environmental pollution. The challenge, however, is the presence of toxic compounds recalcitrant to anaerobic biodegradation such as phenols and nitrogen-containing organics that can inhibit methane-producing microbes. This review presents information on APL and HTL-AP characterization and biodegradability. Feedstock composition and process operational parameters are major factors affecting APL and HTL-AP composition, subsequent toxicity, and degradability. Feedstocks with high nitrogen content as well as increased thermochemical processing temperature and retention time result in a more toxic aqueous liquid and lower methane yield. Dilution and low AD organic loading are required to produce methane. More comprehensive APL and HTL-AP chemical characterization is needed to adopt suitable treatment strategies. Pretreatments such as overliming, air stripping, partial chemical oxidation, adsorption, and solvent extraction of toxic constituents as well as co-digestion and microbial acclimatization successfully reduce toxicity and increase methane yield.

We find that the mean ratio of the black hole mass (M BH) to the total stellar mass (M stellar) is, which is similar to the local black hole-to-bulge mass ratio. This suggests that if the host galaxies of these moderately luminous AGNs at z ∼ 1.4 are dominated by bulges, they already established the local black hole mass-bulge mass relation; if they are disk dominant, their black holes are overmassive relative to the bulges. The AGN bolometric luminosities and SFR show a good correlation with ratios higher than that expected from the local black hole-to-bulge mass relation, suggesting that these AGNs are in a SMBH-growth dominant phase. © 2021.

Methods: Twenty-four IVIG commercial lots from eight manufacturers corresponding to 12 brands were analyzed. The plasma was collected in 10 countries/regions. Depending on each pathogen, antibody levels were measured using specific commercial IgG-specific enzyme immunoassay kits or by cell culture neutralization test and guinea pig skin neutralization test. A principal component analysis was performed. Results: For polio and diphtheria (reference markers of the US authorities), all IVIGs had relevant titers in accordance with reference levels. IVIGs from Canada, Australia, and the USA were positive for titers against globally distributed pathogens or those under vaccination programs in the developed world (parainfluenza, Epstein–Barr, varicella-zoster, influenza B, parvovirus B19, and measles viruses). IVIG from Taiwan and Hong Kong showed low antibody titers for these pathogens but high titers for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. IVIG from India had high titers for pathogens frequently found in developing countries (West Nile, dengue, chikungunya, and hepatitis E viruses and Streptococcus pneumoniae). IVIGs from Argentina, Spain, Israel, and Czechia showed intermediate antibody concentrations. Conclusion: The antibody profile in IVIG was greatly influenced by regional characteristics including climate, vaccination programs, and the prevalence of pathogens in the different countries and regions. © 2021 The Authors","Antibody titer; Blood plasma; Intravenous immunoglobulin","diphtheria antibody; diphtheria toxin; elastase; exotoxin; immunoglobulin; immunoglobulin antibody; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M; antibody; immunoglobulin; animal experiment; animal tissue; antibody blood level; antibody titer; Argentina; Article; Canada; cell culture; chikungunya; Chikungunya virus; clinical assessment; Clostridium tetani; controlled study; Corynebacterium diphtheriae; Cytomegalovirus; data analysis software; dengue; Dengue virus; developing country; diphtheria; Enterovirus B; enzyme immunoassay; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Epstein Barr virus; geographic distribution; guinea pig; Haemophilus influenzae type b; Hepatitis A virus; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis E virus; Hong Kong; human; Human parvovirus B19; Human poliovirus 1; Human respiratory syncytial virus; immunoglobulin blood level; India; infectious agent; Influenza A virus; influenza B; Influenza B virus; Israel; measles; Measles virus; Mumps virus; nonhuman; Parainfluenza virus infection; Paramyxovirinae; plasma; poliomyelitis; principal component analysis; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Rubella virus; serodiagnosis; Spain; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Taiwan; vaccination; Varicella zoster virus; West Nile fever; West Nile virus; Asia; chemistry; economics; genetics; immunology; Western Hemisphere; Americas; Antibodies; Asia; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Immunoglobulins, Intravenous; Neutralization Tests; Plasma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100831123

While much of the climate change and migration discourse is invested in quantitative predictions and debates about whether migration is adaptive or maladaptive, less attention has been paid to the voices of the people moving in the context of climate change with a focus on their health and wellbeing. This qualitative research aims to amplify the voices of migrants themselves to add nuance to dominant migration narratives and to shed light on the real-life challenges migrants face in meeting their health needs in the context of climate change. Methods: We conducted 58 semi-structured in-depth interviews with migrants purposefully selected for having moved from rural Bhola, southern Bangladesh to an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis under the philosophical underpinnings of phenomenology. Coding was conducted using NVivo Pro 12. Findings: We identified two overarching themes in the thematic analysis: Firstly, we identified the theme “A risk exchange: Exchanging climate change and health risks at origin and destination”. Rather than describing a “net positive” or “net negative” outcome in terms of migration in the context of climate change, migrants described an exchange of hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities at origin with those at destination, which challenged their capacity to adapt. This theme included several sub-themes—income and employment factors, changing food environment, shelter and water sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) conditions, and social capital. The second overarching theme was “A changing health and healthcare environment”. This theme also included several sub-themes— changing physical and mental health status and a changing healthcare environment encompassing quality of care and barriers to accessing healthcare. Migrants described physical and mental health concerns and connected these experiences with their new environment. These two overarching themes were prevalent across the dataset, although each participant experienced and expressed them uniquely. Conclusion: Migrants who move in the context of climate change face a range of diverse health risks at the origin, en route, and at the destination. Migrating individuals, households, and communities undertake a risk exchange when they decide to move, which has diverse positive and negative consequences for their health and wellbeing. Along with changing health determinants is a changing healthcare environment where migrants face different choices, barriers, and quality of care. A more migrant-centric perspective as described in this paper could strengthen migration, climate, and health governance. Policymakers, urban planners, city corporations, and health practitioners should integrate the risk exchange into practice and policies. © 2021 by the authors.

Over its lifetime, a gasoline particulate filter (GPF) collects ash components of fuel, lubrication oil, and materials originating from the catalytic coating and from engine abrasion. In the development and application process, synthetic ashing from GPFs is challenging. The ash of the lubrication oil can be increased in various ways, like oil-doped fuel, a separate oil burner, or changes in the piston-cylinder system of the engine. However, these methods show major disadvantages. For this reason, an improved approach is presented in this study, which allows a quick response to changes in combustion (e.g., engine knocking) and producing ash, which is more realistic due to its primary particle size and the density of ash plugs, in a shorter time. Therefore, an approach to accelerate ash loading by active oil injection using a multi-point injection (MPI) system is introduced. With the help of this methodology, an ashing capacity of 1.21 g/h is implemented, which is a high rate compared to other investigations. The primary particle size (evaluated by means of a transmission electron microscope), is in the same size range as those detected at the full-load curve during regular operation. A computer tomographic (CT) analysis of the incinerated particulate filter also shows that a very high density of ash plugs can be realized, which has also been found in the literature for real applications. In addition, with the help of a mass spectrometer (MS) and an intermediate weighing of the particulate filter, the current ash loading of the GPF could be determined with an accuracy of 1%. © 2021 The Authors.

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) cultivation, woody biomass captured during removal of the encroaching eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) to restore grasslands and thinning of the native oak forest can provide an integrated source of feedstock and improve ecosystem services. In north-central Oklahoma, we quantified productivity and ecosystem water use of switchgrass stands and degraded ecosystems encroached by eastern redcedar and compared these to native oak forest and tallgrass prairie ecosystems. We measured aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) using allometric equations (trees) and clip plots (herbaceous), and evapotranspiration (ET) using a water balance approach from gauged watersheds, and calculated water use efficiency (WUE = ANPP/ET) from 2016 to 2019. Among vegetation cover types, ANPP averaged 5.1, 5.4, 6.0, and 7.8 Mg ha−1 year−1 for the prairie, oak, eastern redcedar, and switchgrass watersheds and was significantly greater for switchgrass in 2018 and 2019 (2 and 3 years post establishment) when it reached 8.6 Mg ha−1 year−1. Averaged across 2017–2019, ET was significantly greater in the forested watersheds than the grassland watersheds (1022 mm year−1 for eastern redcedar, 1025 mm year−1 for oak, 874 mm year−1 for prairie, and 828 mm year−1 for switchgrass). The mean WUE was significantly greater (9.47 kg ha−1 mm−1) for switchgrass than for the prairie, eastern redcedar, and oak cover types (6.03, 6.02, and 5.31 kg ha−1 mm−1). Switchgrass offered benefits of greater ANPP, less ET, and greater WUE. Our findings indicate that an integrated biofuel feedstock system that includes converting eastern redcedar encroached areas to switchgrass and thinning the oak forest can increase productivity, increase runoff to streams, and improve ecosystem services. © 2020 The Authors.

Yet, the same models' future runoff and bulk soil moisture projections instead show regional signals of varying sign, and their vegetation projections show widespread greening, suggesting that the dryness indices could overstate climate change's direct impacts. Most modeling studies have attributed this gap to the indices' omission of CO2-driven stomatal closure. However, here we show that the index-impact gap is still wide even in future-like model experiments that switch off CO2 effects on plants. In these simulations, mean PDSI, Aridity Index, and SPEI still decline broadly with strong warming, while mean runoff, bulk soil moisture, and vegetation still respond more equivocally. This implies that CO2-plant effects are not the dominant or sole reason for the simulated index-impact gap. We discuss several alternative mechanisms that may explain it. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, research has shown that long waiting times, circuitous routes and privacy concerns might lead most patrons to choose exclusive-ride services over shared services (ride-hail or autonomous), thus increasing rather than decreasing vehicle mileage. This paper uses Uber and Lyft experience from 2014 to 2020 to examine the effectiveness of shared (or “pooled”) services in reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in four cities with large concentrations of ride-hail trips and suburban areas of California. Taking into account three key inputs -- pooling rates, modal shifts and deadhead miles – results show that pre-pandemic levels of pooling led to at least a doubling of VMT when comparing ride-hail trips with patrons’ previous mode, with increases of 97% in Chicago, 114% in New York City, 118% in San Francisco, 157% in Boston and 118% in California suburbs. These large VMT increases are driven by the addition of dead-head miles before each pick-up and the absence of offsetting VMT reductions among travelers who switch to ride-hail from public transportation, biking and walking. VMT increases are only modestly mitigated by the use of ride-hail for “first mile/last mile” trips to connect to public transportation or by reduced cruising for parking by drivers in their personal vehicles. In sum, ride-hail adds to vehicle mileage for trips associated with ride-hail even taking into account pooling. This pattern is likely to endure in a world of autonomous vehicles given that auto users tend to switch to solo services due to considerations of travel time, reliability, comfort and privacy, while pooled options mainly draw patrons from sustainable modes like public transportation. The implication for public policy is that in dense urban areas, it remains important for policy-makers to prioritize space-efficient modes of public transportation, walking and biking. At the same time, ride-hail can clearly be valuable to meet specific needs such as providing paratransit services to people with disabilities, providing first and last mile connections to transit services and connecting late-night workers to jobs. These results will be important as cities emerge from the coronavirus pandemic and navigate a path to economic recovery, social equity, and environmental sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Ridehailing; Shared autonomous vehicles; Shared mobility; Transportation network companies (TNCs); Vehicle miles traveled","cycle transport; mobility; public transport; reliability analysis; suburban area; traffic congestion; traffic management; travel time; urban transport; walking; Boston; California; Chicago; Illinois; Massachusetts; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; San Francisco [California]; United States; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099139842

While the load targets were guided by an ensemble of models, none of them considered the effects of climate change. Some watershed models developed to guide load reduction strategies have simulated climate effects, but without extending the resulting loads or their uncertainties to HAB projections. In this study, we integrated an ensemble of four climate models, three watershed models, and four HAB models. Nutrient loads and HAB predictions were generated for historical (1985–1999), current (2002–2017), and mid-21st-century (2051–2065) periods. For the current and historical periods, modeled loads and HABs are comparable to observations but exhibit less interannual variability. Our results show that climate impacts on watershed processes are likely to lead to reductions in future loading, assuming land use and watershed management practices are unchanged. This reduction in load should help reduce the magnitude of future HABs, although increases in lake temperature could mitigate that decrease. Using Monte-Carlo analysis to attribute sources of uncertainty from this cascade of models, we show that the uncertainty associated with each model is significant, and that improvements in all three are needed to build confidence in future projections. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Error analysis; Forecasting; Integrating models; Monte Carlo","Algae control; Climate change; Lakes; Land use; Soil conservation; Uncertainty analysis; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; Ensemble of models; Future projections; Harmful algal blooms; Historical periods; Interannual variability; Monte carlo analysis; Sources of uncertainty; Watershed management; Climate models; algal bloom; annual variation; climate change; climate modeling; lake water; prediction; uncertainty analysis; watershed; algal bloom; article; climate; forecasting; land use; nutrient; prediction; uncertainty; watershed management; Canada; lake; uncertainty; Canada; United States; phosphorus; Canada; Harmful Algal Bloom; Lakes; Phosphorus; Uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096384622

This study conducts a multi-scale (national-regional-city), multi-species, and multi-platform analysis of air pollutants and meteorological data by synergizing surface and satellite observations. Our analysis suggests a significant reduction in surface measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (46–61 %) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (42–60 %) during the lockdown period that are also corroborated by the reduction in satellite observed aerosol optical depth (AOD) (3–56 %) and tropospheric NO2 column density (25–50 %) data over multiple cities. Other species, namely coarse particulate matter (PM10) (24–62 %), ozone (22–56 %) also showed a substantial reduction whereas carbon monoxide (16–46 %), exhibited a moderate decline. In contrast, sulfur dioxide (SO2) levels did not show any defined reduction trend but rather increased in Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata. The temporary air quality improvement achieved by the painful natural experiment of this pandemic has helped demonstrate the importance of reducing emissions from other sectors along with transportation and industry to achieve the national air quality targets in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Air quality; COVID-19; India; Lockdown; Satellite","Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Meteorology; Nitrogen oxides; Satellites; Sulfur dioxide; Surface measurement; Aerosol optical depths; Air quality improvement; Anthropogenic emissions; Coarse particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Meteorological data; Satellite observations; Substantial reduction; Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098969482

For empirical estimations, we have used the data of 179 countries which further divided in sub categories; income-level, OECD-level and regional-level to obtain the comprehensive empirics. The coefficients of labour and capital are significant and positive, validating the Solow growth theory. For education and carbon emission, the coefficients are insignificant in short run, while significant and positive in long run, mentioning that the reforms related to education system and climate change mitigation policies need long time to have its influence on economy. In case of health issues, the coefficients are significant and negative, indicating that higher health issues have negative impact on economic growth. The empirics of education have confirmed significant and negative relationship with greenhouse gas emission which identifies that greenhouse gas emission can reduced by educating by rising education standards. In addition, we confirm the adverse impact of greenhouse gas emission on health. The study provides policy implications for overcoming problems in economic growth, health, education and climate change mitigation as they are linked with each other, directly or indirectly. The priority policy should be increase education having positive impact on health following greenhouse gas emission reduction and finally providing for sustainable economic growth.

In this study, we estimate damages for nine climate impact sectors within the contiguous United States (US) using downscaled climate projections from six global climate models, at integer degrees of US national warming. Each sector is analyzed based on socioeconomic conditions for both the beginning and the end of the century. The potential for adaptive measures to decrease damages is also demonstrated for select sectors; differences in damages across adaptation response scenarios within some sectors can be as much as an order of magnitude. Estimated national damages from these sectors based on a reactive adaptation assumption and 2010 socioeconomic conditions range from $600 million annually per degree of national warming for winter recreation to $8 billion annually per degree of national warming for labor impacts.

The Cl sample was prepared from pure chemical powder in the form of a solutiondeposited on the metal sub-target. A zinc selenium lens was used to focus the CO2 laser beam (10.6Mm, 2.5 J, 10 Hz, 200 ns) onto the deposited sample under the surrounding gas of helium (pressure of 1 atm) for generated luminous plasma. An optical multichannel analyzer (OMA) system was used for collecting plasma and acquiring the emission spectrum. It was found that luminous plasma can be produced upon focusing the laser irradiation onto the deposited layer of the sample on the subtarget metal while leaving no ablation from the sub-target metal. Many ionic emission lines from Cl can be detected in the visible region.The ionic emission lines occur withfavorable spectrochemical features, namely strong emission intensity and low background level. Thus, this new approach is promising for conducting Cl analysis using a CO2 LIBS. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Atomic emission spectroscopy; Carbon dioxide lasers; Electromagnetic wave emission; Laser beams; Metals; Tea; Deposited layer; Emission intensity; Emission spectrums; Ionic emission lines; Laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS); Luminous plasmas; Optical multichannel analyzer; Pure chemicals; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103092251

Results of the study found a quadratic relationship between income growth and ecological footprint and support validity of EKC. Energy consumption positively contributes to ecological footprint, while population growth plays no significant role in determining environmental quality. The long-run estimates of the study are validated through robustness analysis by employing dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) and fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) techniques.

The fishery of this demersal species, carried out by the Spanish and Moroccan artisanal fleets, is highly vulnerable to overexploitation whose effects can be enhanced by environmental and regulatory changes. This study evaluates from an univariate perspective the variation patterns of Blackspot seabream landings (from 1983 to 2016) in the Strait of Gibraltar and investigates the effects environmental factors (sea temperature anomaly and NAO index) and regulatory changes on the landings. For this purpose, we used a wide set of univariate seanonal and non-seasonal approaches like Holt-Winters, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models and submodels. The Holt-Winters, autoregressive and ARIMA models were able to detect a strong linear dependence between current landings and previous landings as well as seasonal effects, while the GARCH models indicated the presence of intense uncertainty or volatility around two periods (1993–1998 and 2007–2011), associated with possible effects of underlying biological, environmental-climatic and regulatory factors. Therefore, the use of a combination of univariate modelling techniques has enabled us to establish potential factors associated with the variability in the landings, which could significantly help move the management of this fishery towards an ecosystem-based approach. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","artisanal fishery; deep-sea; fish population; fishery politics; fishing pressure; long-term series; uncertainty analysis","artisanal fishery; environmental legislation; exploitation; historical perspective; perciform; sea surface temperature; seasonality; vulnerability; Strait of Gibraltar; Pagellus bogaraveo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091609374

The ship uses natural gas as the main fuel commonly called as a gas-powered ship. Gas has lower specific prices compare with any type of diesel fuel. But due to handling, storage, and distribution costs then gas prices for ships become higher even still a bit cheaper than diesel fuels. Besides prices, technically gas is cleaner so it may give the lower emission levels. Dual fuel technology is the best choice in occupied gas as ship fuel due to the existence of the IGF Code. Established Dual-fuel diesel engine is very expensive and available for big power capacity. This research develops a small dual-fuel diesel engine from a conventional engine with power less than 10 HP. The piston crown is a part of the engine that was modified so that the engine can use natural gas in the best performances as the conventional one. NOx as the most hazard emission in the diesel combustion process is controlled to be as the lowest as possible. The quality of air may be significantly affected by those small engine pollutions because of the large number of vessels in that dense environment in the typical fishery villages.

In countries like United States and China many automakers are launching hybrid and electric vehicles and pursuing new technologies to reduce costs, reduce weight and improve energy efficiency. There are numerous studies about CO2 generation, comparing Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) and the complete electrified vehicles production, including batteries, components and transportation, and the battery recycle process, which is still unknown. Other point to be highlighted is that the final cost of the products raises the question about the feasibility of electrification and how much the customer is willing to pay for the technology, besides the infrastructure investment by Government to provide charge stations. Brazil approved in December of 2018 the Brazilian Energy Efficiency Regulatory Program, ROTA 2030, which starts on 2022 with 11% improvement target in fuel consumption over the current INOVAR AUTO Program targets, and possibly same squeeze will be applied for the second phase in 2027, which will drive the industry for a high investment on development of new technologies, such as hybrid solutions. In order to minimize costs, while electrified powertrains do not achieve large scale, or waiting for new technologies with lower costs, internal combustion engines still may have opportunities to improve efficiency to keep playing. The scope of this paper is to compare the cost and efficiency of some enablers to improve fuel economy, including electrification, from a vehicle powered by ICE. © 2021 SAE International.

The content is arranged in three parts addressing 'Stylised Market Equilibrium', 'The Real Market Economy', and 'Present Affluence Versus the Future'. In Rediscovering Sustainability the authors help bridge the gap in understanding between scientists and the green movement on the one side and many economists on the other. Greens worry about catastrophic climate change and anthropocene mass extinction. Economists express reservations about spending substantial amounts of money on preventing environmental degradation. Aart and Wiebina Heesterman argue that there are inherent limitations in standard economics which cause blind spots in its environmental economics sub-field, as well as issues to do with simple lack of knowledge. In this timely book, the limitations of the neoclassical economics framework are examined. The authors explore the relationship between Keynesian aggregate economics and financial sustainability, as well as that between scale economies, locational economics and the understated cost of fuel for transport. The impact of economic theory on practice is examined. Conventional economic theory and political compromise bear unhelpfully on an energy market constrained by emissions targets. Rediscovering Sustainability is an invaluable aid to understanding for those teaching, studying, campaigning, policy-making, or involved with the science or politics of environmental and sustainability issues. It is also a book for those concerned with the application of economic theory in any context. © 2021 Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., New York.

The parties will report their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in terms of plans and progress towards these targets during the postponed COP26 (Conference of the Parties under the UNFCCC) in Glasgow in November 2021. These commitments, however, do not take significant portions of the consumption-related emissions related to countries imports into account. Similarly, the majority of companies that report their emissions to CDP (Formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) also do not account for their embodied value-chain-related emissions. Municipalities, on the path towards carbon neutrality in accordance with the methods outlined by C40, also do not include imported and embodied CO2 in their total emission tallies. So, who is responsible for these emissions—the producer or the consumer? How can we ensure that the NDCs, municipalities’ and companies’ reduction targets share the responsibility of the emissions in the value chain, thus ensuring that targets and plans become sustainable, climate fair, and just in global value chains? Today the responsibility lays with the producer, which is not sustainable. We have the outline for the tools needed to quantify and transparently share the responsibility between producers and consumers at corporate, municipal and national levels based on an improved understanding of the attendant sources, causes, flows and risks of GHG emissions globally. Hybrid life cycle analysis/environmentally extended input–output (LCA/EEIO) models can for example be further developed. This will, in the end, enable everyday consumption to support a more sustainable, green and low carbon transition of our economy. © 2021 by the author.

Innovative Europeanfunded projects, therefore, should start to consider these concepts. This paper provides an innovative review of European projects with the aim of identifying those with actual implementation of RE and energy storage systems in urban environments and their concern for aesthetic impact. The search considered the five most relevant programs related to RE and climate change mitigation, including almost 14,000 projects. Furthermore, a survey and some interviews allowed to collect data about the selected projects. 0.1% of reviewed projects aimed at the actual installation of RE on an urban scale. However, there is a recent growing trend. The most used RE was solar, especially photovoltaic, while the most common system for energy storage was lithium batteries. We can affirm that these European projects do not currently show any particular concern for the aesthetic impact they cause in cities, nor for the social perception assessment. It would be advisable to consider technologies as products and basic components of work and daily life, and not only as a means of intervention to promote RE. © 2021 Energies.

Nonetheless, knowledge and perception of the public to climate change influence behavioural intention to adapt. While literature is replete with public perception and adaptation strategies to climate change, there is a dearth of information exploring the influence of gender on climate change knowledge. This paper employs quantitative and qualitative data to examine the influence of gender on knowledge in climate trends in Beitbridge Rural District, Zimbabwe, using questionnaire surveys. This survey tool consisted of demographic questions on gender and other variables. Our results indicate that compared to women, actual knowledge of trends in selected variables of climate change was higher among men.

The mixed layer also shapes marine ecosystems by hosting most of the ocean’s primary production4 and providing the conduit for oxygenation of deep oceanic layers. Despite these important climatic and life-supporting roles, possible changes in the mixed layer during an era of global climate change remain uncertain. Here we use oceanographic observations to show that from 1970 to 2018 the density contrast across the base of the mixed layer increased and that the mixed layer itself became deeper. Using a physically based definition of upper-ocean stability that follows different dynamical regimes across the global ocean, we find that the summertime density contrast increased by 8.9 ± 2.7 per cent per decade (10−6–10−5 per second squared per decade, depending on region), more than six times greater than previous estimates. Whereas prior work has suggested that a thinner mixed layer should accompany a more stratified upper ocean5–7, we find instead that the summertime mixed layer deepened by 2.9 ± 0.5 per cent per decade, or several metres per decade (typically 5–10 metres per decade, depending on region). A detailed mechanistic interpretation is challenging, but the concurrent stratification and deepening of the mixed layer are related to an increase in stability associated with surface warming and high-latitude surface freshening8,9, accompanied by a wind-driven intensification of upper-ocean turbulence10,11. Our findings are based on a complex dataset with incomplete coverage of a vast area. Although our results are robust within a wide range of sensitivity analyses, important uncertainties remain, such as those related to sparse coverage in the early years of the 1970–2018 period. Nonetheless, our work calls for reconsideration of the drivers of ongoing shifts in marine primary production, and reveals stark changes in the world’s upper ocean over the past five decades. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon flux; climate change; decadal variation; global climate; hydrodynamics; mixed layer; oxygenation; stratification; upper ocean; vertical mixing; article; human; latitude; sea; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty; warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103354729

Partial least squares structural equation modeling is used to verify the hypotheses of the study. Findings: By using variance-based structural equation modeling, this study showed that the VBN theory is fully supported in the cultural context of Pakistan and behavioral context of ESCCB. More specifically, personal introjected norms of the customers proved to be strong predictors of ESCCB while personal integrated norms predicted eco-social purchase intentions well. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the only study of its kind that examines the VBN model in the context of a developing country, Pakistan, and for a category of behaviors rarely tested before, i.e. ESCCBs related to purchase and use of personal cars. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Altruistic values; Biospheric values; Egoistic values; ESCCB; Personal norms; VBN theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100213826

The cell fabricated with 1.5 wt % of Au-doped ZnO–Sm nanoparticles film achieved an optimal efficiency of 4.35%, which is about 76% higher than that of 0.0 wt % of Au-doped ZnO–Sm-based cell (2.47%). This increase might be due to the formation of a blocking layer at the ZnO–Sm/Au interface, which inhibits the recombination of electrons. This increase may also be attributed to the addition of rare-earth ions in ZnO to enhance the non-absorbable wavelength region of light via up/down-conversion of near-infrared and ultraviolet radiations to visible emission and reduce the recombination loss of electron in the cell. The efficiency of cells may be increased by the blocking layer and up/down-conversion process and thus promote the overall performance of the cells.

Trends and variability of extreme temperature events in the agro-ecological zones of Pakistan are not fully understood, despite their importance. This study investigates the annual and seasonal trends of temperature extremes, and the role of Pacific variability during 1980–2019. The homogeneity of 40 synoptic stations, spatially distributed over Pakistan was assessed by removing non-climatic shifts from the data. There is distinct increases (decreases) in the upper (lower) tails are noticed in a spatially aggregated perspective. The strongest warming trends of 0.35 (0.49) ∘C decade−1 for the hottest nights (days) occur during spring, which is the hottest season of the year. The significant warming (hotter) trends are apparent for the agro-ecological zones located to central, western, and southeastern-Pakistan. The principal component analysis showed a robust increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme temperatures, with a total variance of 94.7%. In the spring season, we found strong connections between La Niña (El Niño) events over the western Pacific Ocean and changes in extreme temperatures. Analysis reveals that the strength of La Niña episodes has a much larger influence on the intensity of extremely high-temperature events over arid to semi-arid climatic zones. This information is of great use for the seasonal prediction of extremely hot days in the region and will help policymakers to formulate climate change adaptation plans. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"Ecology; Risk management; Springs (components); Agro-ecological zones; Climate change adaptation; Extreme temperature events; Extreme temperatures; High temperature events; Seasonal prediction; Synoptic station; Temperature extremes; Climate change; air temperature; climate change; El Nino; extreme event; La Nina; regional climate; Pacific Ocean; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098071108

Location: Atlantic coastal habitats in Huelva (Spain). Methods: We identified the species composition of 216 paired (non-invaded and invaded) 10 × 10 m plots along the coast. For each species, we calculated its climatic niche based on the two main axis of a PCA constructed with nine climatic variables. We defined the community ensemble niche by the union of the overall climate niches of co-occurring species within a plot. We compared niche overlap metrics between non-invaded and invaded paired communities. Results: There was an almost complete overlap in the community ensemble niches between non-invaded and invaded plots for the four invaders. Plots invaded by Carpobrotus spp. presented the lowest niche stability and those invaded by A. calendula had the highest. Plots invaded by Carpobrotus spp. showed the highest values of niche unfilling and expansion. In contrast, plots invaded by O. dillenii exhibited the lowest niche unfilling. Species similarity between non-invaded and invaded plots was on average 58%. The community ensemble niches differed depending on the invasive species and were related to differences in community species similarity between non-invaded and invaded plots. Overall, there was a positive correlation between community species similarity and climatic niche stability, and a negative correlation between community difference in taxonomic richness and climatic niche stability. Conclusions: Species assemblages in coastal vegetation did not change their community ensemble climatic niches after invasion by plants with contrasted life forms. This pattern is likely the result of invasion which did not trigger major changes in species richness and composition, or alternatively, because the species that were locally displaced by invasion have been substituted by others with similar climatic requirements. © 2021 International Association for Vegetation Science","biological invasions; climatic niche; community assembly; ordination techniques; Raup-Crick similarity index; Spanish coastal vegetation; species composition; stability; Sørensen similarity index","assembly rule; biological invasion; climate conditions; coexistence; invasive species; niche; niche overlap; plant community; Andalucia; Huelva [Andalucia]; Spain; Arctotheca calendula; Calendula; Carpobrotus; Conyza bonariensis; Opuntia dillenii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104961213

This paper presents the results of a detailed performance analysis based on 6 months of field test data of a pre-commercial, dual source solar-assisted heat pump. The data gathered during field-testing as well as the functionality of the system were studied extensively to develop and calibrate an hourly energy model. The model replicates the performance and operating modes of the solar-assisted air source heat pump. It allows for an hourly assessment of the energy savings, greenhouse gas reduction potential and cost competitiveness of this system as compared to other high performance HVAC systems in a variety of climate locations and archetype house loads. A parametric analysis is undertaken to assess the impact of key components on system viability. Results indicate that for some regions and archetype house loads, the dual-source solar-assisted heat pump can lead to significant energy savings and GHG emissions reductions when compared to high performing HVAC systems. These savings may enable a favorable payback period when a competitive capital cost is considered.

Reduction is an essential reaction in the conversion of CO2 into value-added materials. The first part of this research is focused on organocatalyst designing, which is performed by a reaction between some of the π-conjugated molecules and borane. This step produces a bridged structure for the developed organocatalysts (B-H bridged organocatalysts). π contributions of electron localized function (ELFπ) and nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICSπZZ) analyses are valuable for understanding and justifying the calculated ∆G≠ and ∆E≠ values of the organocatalysts formation step. In the second part of this research, CO2 reduction was investigated using designed B-H bridged organocatalysts. The reduction reaction can proceed through two different barrier energies. The results revealed that, among 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9-BBN) and BH2 segments of the B-H bridged organocatalysts, hydride transfer of 9-BBN moiety is more favorable kinetically.

This paper develops a numerical optimization model that utilizes experimental data pertaining to the CO2 hydrogenation reaction (catalyst type, conversion, selectivity, and space velocity) to guide engineers to pick the optimal industrial scale CCU process. Four carbon conversion pathways that produce value-added chemicals are assessed: conversion into methanol, methane, carbon monoxide, and dimethyl ether. This techno-economic analysis is founded on elaborate sizing methods and process design principles of heat exchangers, compressors, reactors, and separators. Based on the collected data reported in the literature, the state-of-the-art model incorporates and assesses feed and catalyst costing, plant sizing and costing, and revenues from the produced commodity chemicals at market price. A thorough optimization analysis is conducted to determine the optimal conversion pathway subject to corresponding constraints. The objective of this problem targets cost minimization with respect to various production constraints. The results of the model show that the optimal CCU path is associated with the CO2-to-MeOH/DME reactions, with the model almost strictly allocating the available CO2 mass at the different production rates to processes generating these products. This result is due to the processes' high reaction selectivity, which has been at the forefront of research in CO2 hydrogenation, in addition to the relatively high market price of both these products. Such results reinforce the promise of George Olah's Methanol Economy. The optimization model thus presents a novel basis for a comprehensive and quantitative multi-variable CCU plant assessment, utilizing optimized carbon conversion reaction data. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon utilization; Catalysis; Numerical model; Optimization; Process sizing","Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Chemical contamination; Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Economic analysis; Fuels; Hydrogenation; Methanol; Optimization; Commodity chemicals; Numerical optimizations; Optimization analysis; Optimization modeling; Production constraints; Reaction selectivity; Techno-Economic analysis; Value-added chemicals; Catalyst selectivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100028840

Tree planting on degraded land has been identified as an effective carbon capture strategy, but it is unclear how various associated restoration treatments influence carbon sequestration. In this study, we measured carbon pools in jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) stands subject to different restoration treatments within severely damaged upland areas in the metal mining region of Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Treatments included: i) soil amendment (liming, fertilizing and grass/legume seeding) followed by jack pine planting, ii) jack pine planting alone, iii) soil amendment only, and iv) untreated plots with some natural regeneration as a result of improving air quality in the region. Twenty-four years after the initial treatments, we measured the carbon storage in coarse and fine woody debris, herbs, shrubs, forest floor (LFH), mineral soil, and trees. The carbon pool in planted trees was 1.5 times higher in plots when soil amendments were applied. This increase in the tree carbon pool was the result of greater carbon sequestration per individual jack pine tree rather than changes in tree density or arrival of new species. Similarly, naturally regenerated white birch (Betula papyrifera Marshall) in the amended plots stored 1.7 times more carbon than white birch in the untreated plots. Tree planting proved essential on this landscape with natural tree regeneration rates very low even 50 years after local pollution was massively reduced. However, tree planting surprisingly did not significantly affect total carbon storage in these exposed upland sites. Total ecosystem carbon varied from 21.4 Mg ha−1 to 124.5 Mg ha−1 across all plots (mean of 67.6 ± 4.8 Mg ha−1) but no statistically significant differences were observed among the treatments. Soil organic carbon (SOC) proved to be the largest carbon pool across plots and stored on average 66% of total ecosystem carbon. However, at this early stage the restoration treatments had no influence on SOC pools on this highly degraded landscape, which still appears to be severely affected by ongoing erosion of surface soil and metal contamination. The restoration treatment also did not significantly affect the understory or downed woody debris carbon pools. This study demonstrates that the current restoration treatments used in Sudbury do influence the amount of carbon sequestrated mainly through tree restoration on this industrially degraded landscape, but long-term storage potential is still limited by poor soil conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Acidification; Carbon sequestration; Impacted landscape; Jack pine; Soil organic carbon; Tree restoration; White birch","Air quality; Carbon capture; Climate change; Debris; Ecosystems; Lakes; Magnesium; Reforestation; Restoration; Seed; Soils; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Downed woody debris; Metal contamination; Natural regeneration; Restoration treatments; Soil organic carbon; Statistically significant difference; Organic carbon; air quality; carbon storage; climate change; contaminated land; forest floor; organic carbon; regeneration; soil amendment; soil erosion; tree; understory; woody debris; Air Quality; Ecosystems; Lakes; Magnesium; Reforestation; Restoration; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Sudbury; Betula papyrifera; Betula pendula; Pinus (genus); Pinus banksiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099252861

The proven and proposed functions of CAs in these organisms are listed. The possibility of the involvement of several chloroplast CAs in acceleration of the conversion of bicarbonate to CO2 and in supply of CO2 for fixation by Rubisco is particularly considered. Special attention is paid to CAs in various parts of thylakoids and to discussion about current knowledge of their possible physiological roles. The review states that, despite the significant progress in application of the mutants with suppressed CAs synthesis, the approach based on the use of the inhibitors of CA activity in some cases remains quite effective. Combination of these two approaches, namely determining the effect of CA activity inhibitors in plants with certain knocked-out CA genes, turns out to be very useful for understanding the functions of other CAs. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon dioxide; Carbonic anhydrases; Chloroplasts; Inhibitors and activators; Photosynthesizing cells; Thylakoids","carbonate dehydratase; chemistry; metabolism; plant; plant cell; Carbonic Anhydrases; Plant Cells; Plants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094189951

In this study, measurements from TIMED/SABER (the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry instrument on TIMED satellite) were used to investigate the variation of the NO radiance cooling in thermosphere as a function of altitude, latitude, and local time. Using the methods of principal component analysis and spherical harmonic regression, we have developed an empirical model to capture the most significant variation in NO radiance cooling for the altitude range 100–280 km. The model reproduced the variations of NO radiation at different latitudes and altitudes. Moreover, the integrated model NO radiative flux is in good agreement with satellite measurements with a correlation coefficient up to 0.96.

Among these power systems, natural gas combined cycles will play a fundamental role because of their faster operation and higher efficiency. Optimisation-based control strategies can enhance the flexible power dispatch of these systems and improve their performance during transient operation. This work proposes a model predictive control (MPC) strategy to stabilise these power plants with post-combustion CO2 capture based on temperature swing chemical absorption and provide offset-free reference tracking. A delta-input formulation with disturbance modelling is proposed, as it provides more efficient computation with offset-free control. Data-based models were developed to replicate the performance of the actual power and capture plants. Prediction of nonlinear behaviour was accomplished by creating a network of local linear models, which allowed the formulation of the dynamic optimisation program in the MPC strategy as a convex quadratic programming problem. A case study demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed MPC to balance drastic changes on power demand and keep specified capture ratios. Furthermore, the reduced deviations achieved in the reboiler temperature suggest that the nominal value of this parameter could be increased to improve the desorption process without risks of reaching temperatures where the solvent would degradate. © 2020 The Author(s)","Advanced control strategy; Amine absorption process; Dynamic modelling and simulation; Gas turbine combined cycle; Monoethanolamine (MEA); Post-combustion CO2 capture","Carbon dioxide; Model predictive control; Natural gasoline plants; Predictive control systems; Quadratic programming; Renewable energy resources; Thermoelectric power plants; Convex quadratic programming; Efficient computation; Low-carbon electricities; Natural gas combined cycles; Nonlinear behaviours; Reboiler temperature; Renewable energy source; Thermal power plants; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099630970

Such interventions are also crucial in the view of increasing cities resilience with respect to the intensification of frequent extreme weather events, such as cold spells and heatwaves. Indeed, a wide portion of our cities is dated and lacking with respect to performances. These are the motivations behind the proposed sustainable approach, which deals with the environmental perspective, but also with social and economic ones, by proposing the retrofit of the Public Residential Building stock (Edilizia Residenziale Pubblica, ERP). The objective is to improve the energy performance of ERP stock by means of construction materials coming from local km0 agricultural waste and by-products. The research was conducted by means of in field and numerical analyses of the energy performances of a relevant case study building. Different layers of bio-based, recycled construction materials for the envelope were tested with respect to their efficacy in improving the energy performance of a case study building. The results demonstrate that the most performing envelope solutions and their combination are able to reduce up to 36% of the yearly energy consumption for heating. © 2021 by the authors.

Scenarios for CCS deployment consistent with global climate goals involve gigatonne-scale deployment of CCS within the next several decades. CCS technologies typically involve large water consumption during their energy-intensive capture process. Despite potential concerns, the water footprint of large-scale CCS adoption consistent with stringent climate change mitigation has not yet been explored. This study presents the water footprints (m3 water per tonne CO2 captured) of four prominent CCS technologies: Post-combustion CCS, Pre-combustion CCS, Direct Air CCS, and Bioenergy with CCS. Depending on technology, the water footprint of CCS ranges from 0.74 to 575 m3 H2O/tonne CO2. Bioenergy with CCS is the technology that has the highest water footprint per tonne CO2 captured, largely due to the high water requirements associated with transpiration. The widespread deployment of CCS to meet the 1.5 °C climate target would almost double anthropogenic water footprint. Consequently, this would likely exacerbate and create green and blue water scarcity conditions in many regions worldwide. Climate mitigation scenarios with a diversified portfolio of CCS technologies have lower impacts on water resources than scenarios relying mainly on one of them. The water footprint assessment of CCS is a crucial factor in evaluating these technologies. Water-scarce regions should prioritize water-efficient CCS technologies in their mitigation goals. In conclusion, the most water-efficient way to stabilize the Earth's climate is to rapidly decarbonize our energy systems and improve energy efficiency. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage; Carbon dioxide removal; Climate change; Negative emission technologies; Sustainability; Water footprint; Water scarcity","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Earth (planet); Emission control; Energy efficiency; Precombustion; Water resources; Capture and storage technologies; Carbon capture and sequestrations; CCS technologies; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Green and blue waters; Pre combustions; Water consumption; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094844004

In Central Italy, the species has been recently involved in a chikungunya outbreak. A 3 yr Ae. albopictus monitoring was carried out in 21 municipalities of the Lazio region (Central Italy), belonging to three provinces. Samplings were performed on a weekly basis using ovitraps, in order to investigate climatic and spatial variables driving egg abundance and Ae. albopictus period of activity. A temperature of 10.4°C was indicated as lower threshold for the onset of egg-laying activity, together with a photoperiod of 13:11 (L:D) h. The whole oviposition activity lasted 8 mo (May-December), with 95% of eggs laid between early June and mid-November and a peak at the end of August. Egg abundance was positively influenced by accumulated temperature (AT) of the 4 wk preceding sampling and negatively by precipitation during the week before. Egg-laying activity dropped with decreasing AT, increasing rainfall, and with a photoperiod below 10:14 (L:D) h. Our results pinpointed the importance of fine-scaled spatial features on egg abundance. Some of these fine-scaled characteristics have been highlighted, such as the presence of vegetation and human footprint index. Our model estimated an almost doubled maximum number of laid eggs for the maximum value of human footprint. Compelling evidence of the relevance of fine-scaled characteristics was reported, describing cases where human-made breeding sites driven the abundance of Ae. albopictus. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Mosquito; Ovitrap; Phenology; Rainfall; Temperature","Aedes; animal; egg laying; human; humidity; introduced species; Italy; physiology; season; temperature; Aedes; Animals; Humans; Humidity; Introduced Species; Italy; Oviposition; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102964509

Nevertheless, the impact of biochar application on intensively cropped prairie eco-regions is not well documented, particularly when co-applied with chemical fertilizer. Our objective was to determine the effect of biochar on cumulative CO2-C, N2O-N and CH4-C emissions, water-extractable OM, and available N (AN; NH4-N + NO3-N) and P (AP; PO4-P) in the presence or absence of NP-fertilizer. Biochar was applied to two surface Chernozems (0–15 cm) of contrasting texture [i.e., sandy clay loam (Raymond) and clayey (Lethbridge)] at six rates (0, 0.15, 0.5, 3, 10 and 20 Mg ha−1) in combination with (+NP) or without (−NP) urea-N (150 kg N ha−1) and KH2PO4 (50 kg P ha−1). A total of 72 soil columns were incubated at 21 °C for 86 d. Biochar addition increased soil total C up to 24.9 g kg−1 and 28.7 g kg−1 in Raymond and Lethbridge, respectively, but did not affect water-extractable OM. Cumulative N2O-N and CH4-C emissions were not influenced by biochar, regardless of whether or not NP-fertilizer was added (p &gt; 0.05). Cumulative CO2-C emissions varied between soil textures and were increased or decreased non-linearly by biochar addition under –NP only. Available P increased within +NP soil with increasing biochar rates reaching 43.9 mg kg−1 in Raymond and 79.5 mg kg−1 in Lethbridge when biochar was applied at 20 Mg ha−1. A similar but less pronounced response was observed for AN. Our results indicate that biochar-only application is not a practical management approach for improving soil fertility and nutrient cycling in surface Chernozems. Nevertheless, co-applying biochar with NP-fertilizer appears to improve soil P availability in the short-term. © 2020","Biochar; Canadian Prairies; Chernozems; Greenhouse gases; Soil nutrients","best management practice; biochar; clay loam; greenhouse gas; humus; prairie; pyrolysis; sandy clay loam; soil amendment; soil fertility; soil texture; Alberta; Canada; Lethbridge",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096615182

Efficient methods are currently being developed, but the captured gas has to be dumped in safe and permanent storage environments. Alternatively, it has to be purified before it can be recycled catalytically, using renewable energy, to high-value chemicals as feedstock for the synthesis of polymers, fine chemicals, or in large quantities liquid solar fuels. The combustion of solar fuels is carbon-neutral. If produced at locations where renewable energy is cheap, they become an important economic opportunity. The requirement to achieve a carbon-zero energy supply also for air traffic allows planning for an as yet unknown higher price compared to that of fossil fuels. Use of solar fuels in closed cycle applications may also relieve the energy situation in the large number of off-grid households in rural Africa. The availability of energy, in particular of electricity, is essential for advanced living conditions, prevents migration to urban areas, and therefore protects a rich variation of tribal cultural, religious and social traditions.

In this work, an urban water cycle (UWC) strategy based on the best management practices (BMPs) of water-sensitive urban design (WSUD) is proposed for the transition of a coastal city in the south of Portugal into a water-sensitive city (WSC), in line with the Municipal Strategy for Climate Change Adaptation of Loulé (EMAAC of Loulé). The city’s watershed was identified using the ArcMap Hydrology toolset with geospatial data provided by Loulé’s Municipal Council Operational Unit for Adaptation to Climate Change and Circular Economy (UOACEC). A broad characterisation of the study area was conducted, identifying existing resources to further develop a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, op-portunities, threats) analysis. The Hydrology toolset outputs, precipitation events records, and survey results were used to identify flood-prone areas. The opportunities and threats identified were further used to develop the transition strategy, which is focused on critical areas identified and supported by BMPs, including source control, attenuation, treatment and infiltration measures, perme-able pavements, rainwater harvesting systems, and bioretention basins. The approach is designed to increase the city’s resilience to climate extremes, as well as community engagement towards UWC management. © 2021 by the authors.

These emissions, while globally important, are largely the result of decisions made at a more microeconomic level - the result of individual consumption preferences and production technologies used to make the goods we consume. Using a micro-founded DSGE framework that is calibrated with data from the United States, I model the accumulation of carbon dioxide emissions while accounting for market imperfections and frictions in the form of monopolistic competition, labor income taxation, and price-stickiness. Within this second-best setting the issues of carbon taxation and revenue recycling are addressed. I propose a dynamic, rules-based, and revenue neutral carbon tax to reduce carbon emissions and measure the resulting welfare effects. A measure of compensating variation indicates that consumers are made better off following the implementation of a dynamic carbon tax with lump-sum redistribution regardless of how the externality effect of emissions is modeled. © 2020","Carbon tax; Climate change; Environmental macroeconomics","Carbon dioxide; Competition; Emission control; Global warming; Recycling; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions; Carbon taxation; Externality effects; Micro-economic levels; Monopolistic competition; Production technology; Weather patterns; Taxation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099262995

Urban areas, which concentrate population, economic activity and infrastructures, are sometimes at high-risk locations. Yet they are to be considered as vulnerable systems in need of harmonized structures supporting their efforts towards mitigating climate effects and/or adapting their territories to them. One current structure is the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (CoM) initiative, tackling in a global and harmonized way local adaptation to climate change. Do CoM cities that developed acceptable climate change adaptation plans have similar characteristics? It is still unclear which might be the drivers or key attributes potentially leading to successful planning within the initiative. In this paper, we explore attributes of the first 51 cities that have submitted their adaptation plans to CoM, in order to identify common elements among accepted plans. Therefore, our hypothesis is that there must be attributes determining the acceptance of adaptation plans. In order to do so, the cities were classified as compliant and non-compliant with the CoM principles. Fisher's and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were applied to identify attributes that are statistically different between both groups. Results show that the engagement of multiple stakeholders and citizens, particularly at the local level, might significantly facilitate the acceptance of adaptation plans in the initiative. We also found that the benefits of stakeholder and citizen engagement could be greater in small municipalities because citizens and stakeholders have more opportunities to participate. © 2020 The Author(s)","Adaptation; Climate change; Covenant of Mayors; Stakeholder and citizen participation","article; city; climate change; human; Kolmogorov Smirnov test; local adaptation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099600795

They have been subject to widespread exploitation and degradation with resulting losses in characteristic biota and ecosystem functions such as climate regulation. More recently, large-scale programmes have been established to restore peatland ecosystems and the various services they provide to society. Despite significant progress in peatland science and restoration practice, we lack a process-based understanding of how soil microbiota influence peatland functioning and mediate the resilience and recovery of ecosystem services, to perturbations associated with land use and climate change. We argue that there is a need to: in the short-term, characterise peatland microbial communities across a range of spatial and temporal scales and develop an improved understanding of the links between peatland habitat, ecological functions and microbial processes; in the medium term, define what a successfully restored ‘target’ peatland microbiome looks like for key carbon cycle related ecosystem services and develop microbial-based monitoring tools for assessing restoration needs; and in the longer term, to use this knowledge to influence restoration practices and assess progress on the trajectory towards ‘intact’ peatland status. Rapid advances in genetic characterisation of the structure and functions of microbial communities offer the potential for transformative progress in these areas, but the scale and speed of methodological and conceptual advances in studying ecosystem functions is a challenge for peatland scientists. Advances in this area require multidisciplinary collaborations between peatland scientists, data scientists and microbiologists and ultimately, collaboration with the modelling community. Developing a process-based understanding of the resilience and recovery of peatlands to perturbations, such as climate extremes, fires, and drainage, will be key to meeting climate targets and delivering ecosystem services cost effectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon cycling; Microbiology; Peat; Peatland restoration and management; Resilience","rain; carbon; anaerobic metabolism; biodegradation; canopy; carbon cycle; carbon cycling; climate change; ecosystem restoration; environmental change; environmental resilience; greenhouse gas; hydrolysis; microbial community; monitoring; nonhuman; Note; peatland; photosynthesis; plant growth; priority journal; remote sensing; risk factor; soil microflora; species habitat; symbiosis; temperature; United Kingdom; ecosystem; fire; soil; wetland; Microbiota; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Ecosystem; Fires; Soil; Wetlands",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096127920

These shortcomings are a result of complex photophysics, leading to rate asynchrony between oxidation and reduction, as well as redox processes driven out of electronic trap states rather than excited states. We show that a well-defined triplet excited state in cyanamide-modified carbon nitride is realized with appropriately sized particles. The utility of this long-lived excited state is demonstrated by its ability to drive a hydroamidation photoredox cycle. By the tuning of the particle size of CNx, the oxidation-reduction photochemistry of carbon nitride may be balanced to achieve a redox-neutral closed photocatalytic cycle. These results uncover a triplet excited state chemistry for appropriately sized CNx particles that preludes a rich energy and electron transfer photochemistry for these materials. ©",,"Carbon nitride; Chemical reactions; Electron transitions; Electron transport properties; Light absorption; Particle size; Photophysics; Quantum chemistry; Charge recombinations; Electron transfer; Electronic traps; Interfacial electron transfer; Modified carbon; Oxidation and reduction; Oxidation reduction; Photo-catalytic; Excited states; carbon; carbon nitride; cyanamide; unclassified drug; amidation; Article; catalyst; controlled study; diffuse reflectance ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; electron transport; hydroamidation; hydrogen evolution; infrared spectroscopy; oxidation reduction reaction; particle size; photocatalyst; photochemistry; photophysics; physics; synthesis; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; X ray powder diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103517473

The program, which began in 2015, has involved teams from 31 middle and high schools from across the district to use youth participatory evaluation to examine school climate, racial disproportionality, discipline issues, and student and teacher relationships, among other issues. This paper is a result of a multi-year, ongoing research-practitioner partnership focused on continuous program improvement and reflection. In the paper, we draw upon learning from the first five years to conceptualize a multi-level, iterative change model that highlights navigating tensions and challenges such as power, racial injustice, and authentic youth voice within a school district. We reflect on the learning to date and explore the implications for engaging youth participatory research practices within school districts.

Potential explanations (for example, warmer environments1, younger populations2–4) have yet to be framed within a comprehensive analysis. We synthesized factors hypothesized to drive the pace and burden of this pandemic in SSA during the period from 25 February to 20 December 2020, encompassing demographic, comorbidity, climatic, healthcare capacity, intervention efforts and human mobility dimensions. Large diversity in the probable drivers indicates a need for caution in interpreting analyses that aggregate data across low- and middle-income settings. Our simulation shows that climatic variation between SSA population centers has little effect on early outbreak trajectories; however, heterogeneity in connectivity, although rarely considered, is likely an important contributor to variance in the pace of viral spread across SSA. Our synthesis points to the potential benefits of context-specific adaptation of surveillance systems during the ongoing pandemic. In particular, characterizing patterns of severity over age will be a priority in settings with high comorbidity burdens and poor access to care. Understanding the spatial extent of outbreaks warrants emphasis in settings where low connectivity could drive prolonged, asynchronous outbreaks resulting in extended stress to health systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",,"Africa south of the Sahara; age distribution; Article; comorbidity; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; disease burden; health care personnel; health care system; health service; human; lowest income group; middle income group; priority journal; seasonal variation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social behavior; World Health Organization; adult; Africa south of the Sahara; aged; diagnosis; epidemic; epidemiology; female; genetics; history; infection control; isolation and purification; male; middle aged; mortality; pandemic; pathology; prognosis; risk factor; severity of illness index; very elderly; virology; Adult; Africa South of the Sahara; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Comorbidity; COVID-19; COVID-19 Serological Testing; Disease Outbreaks; Effect Modifier, Epidemiologic; Female; History, 21st Century; Humans; Infection Control; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Pandemics; Prognosis; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Severity of Illness Index",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100299162

The aeroacoustic prediction of such a complex aeronautical system depends on geometry fidelity and the ability of the mesh and numerical method to resolve important flow features responsible for noise generation. To understand the role of small components in the far-field noise predictions, different setups are analyzed including a detailed full complexity landing gear and a simplified, yet realistic, configuration. For the latter case, two different setups in terms of mesh resolution and topology are analyzed. For the finer mesh, refinement is applied in regions with strong pressure fluctuations and also close to edges where shear layers develop flow instabilities. We also compare noise predictions obtained by a landing gear installed on a full aircraft with those computed only for a setup with the bottom half of the fuselage. An assessment of the solutions obtained from solid and permeable FWH surfaces is presented for different configurations of permeable surfaces. One objective of this work consists in the identification and analysis of noise sources in the landing gear. For this task, we first employ acoustic analogy to individual components of the landing gear to identify potential sources of tonal noise. Then, proper orthogonal decomposition is applied to identify mechanisms of noise generation at specific frequencies. It is shown that turbulent coherent structures are responsible for tonal noise generation by the towing link, wheel cavities and landing gear compartment. For the external cavity of the wheel, a Rossiter mode is excited and leads to resonance. We demonstrate that removing small-scale components of the full complexity geometry affects the flow characteristics inside the landing gear compartment and, consequently, its noise emission. In this case, the presence of small scale components leads to finer turbulent eddies that generate more noise at higher frequencies. These finer scales also reduce the coherence of larger turbulent structures, reducing amplitude of the low frequency band of the spectrum. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Delayed detached eddy simulation; Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings acoustic analogy; Flow modal decomposition; Landing gear noise","Acoustic emissions; Acoustic noise; Acoustic noise measurement; Acoustic properties; Aeroacoustics; Computational fluid dynamics; Forecasting; Fuselages; Landing; Mesh generation; Numerical methods; Shear flow; Wheels; Flow charac-teristics; Individual components; Numerical noise prediction; Pressure fluctuation; Proper orthogonal decompositions; Source identification; Turbulent coherent structures; Turbulent structures; Landing gear (aircraft)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100193887

However, factors determining the occurrence and maintenance of each vegetation type are yet to be elucidated. To disentangle the role of environmental factors (soil properties and groundwater depth) constraining tree colonization of wet grasslands in the Cerrado, we assessed tree establishment during the early seedling and sapling stages and the influence of these factors on leaf gas exchange and leaf water potential of tree saplings. Three functionally distinct tree species were studied: (1) flood-tolerant species characteristic of gallery forests, (2) flood-intolerant species characteristic of seasonally dry savannas, and (3) generalist species found in both gallery forests and seasonally dry savannas. Savanna species was constrained by waterlogging, especially at the sapling stage, with restricted stomatal conductance and leaf water potential, resulting in low carbon assimilation, decreased plant size, and high mortality (above 80%). The gallery forest and the generalist species, however, were able to colonize the wet grasslands and survive, despite the low seedling emergence (below 30%) and sapling growth constrained by low gas exchange rates. Soil waterlogging is, therefore, an effective environmental filter that prevents savanna trees from expanding over wet grasslands. However, colonization by trees adapted to a shallow water table cannot be constrained by this or other soil properties, turning the wet grasslands dependent on natural disturbances to persist as an alternative state, sharing the waterlogged environments with the gallery forests in the Cerrado region. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Alternative stable-states; Flood tolerance; Grassland-forest boundary; Groundwater depth; Neotropical savanna; Seedling establishment","cerrado; gas exchange; generalist; savanna; seedling emergence; shallow water; soil property; water depth; water table; waterlogging; woodland; ground water; water; forest; grassland; soil; tree; Forests; Grassland; Groundwater; Soil; Trees; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101219668

Soil moisture variability has a direct impact on agriculture, water security and ecosystem services. Nevertheless, there is currently little information on how soil moisture across different biomes responds to drought. In this study, we used satellite soil moisture data from the European Space Agency, from 2009 to 2015, to analyze differences in soil moisture responses to drought for each biome of Brazil: Amazon, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Cerrado, Pampa and Pantanal. We found an overall soil moisture decline of-0:5 % yr-1 (p &lt; 0:01) at the national level. At the biome level, Caatinga presented the most severe soil moisture decline (-4:4 % yr-1), whereas the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes showed no significant trend. The Amazon biome showed no trend but had a sharp reduction of soil moisture from 2013 to 2015. In contrast, the Pampa and Pantanal biomes presented a positive trend (1.6 % yr-1and 4.3 % yr-1, respectively). These trends are consistent with vegetation productivity trends across each biome. This information provides insights into drought risk reduction and soil conservation activities to minimize the impact of drought in the most vulnerable biomes. Furthermore, improving our understanding of soil moisture trends during periods of drought is crucial to enhance the national drought early warning system and develop customized strategies for adaptation to climate change in each biome. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

In the current study, two different energy system scenarios for a district in Montreal/Canada are compared to choose the most cost-effective and energy-efficient energy system scenario for the studied area. In the first scenario, a decentral energy system comprised of ground-source heat pumps provides heating and cooling for each building, while, in the second scenario, a district heating and cooling system with a central heat pump is designed. Firstly, heating and cooling demand are calculated in a completely automated process using an Automatic Urban Building Energy Modeling System approach (AUBEM). Then, the Integrated Simulation Environment Language (INSEL) is used to prepare a model for the energy system. The proposed model provides heat pump capacity and the number of required heat pumps (HP), the number of photovoltaic (PV) panels, and AC electricity generation potential using PV. After designing the energy systems, the piping system, heat losses, and temperature distribution of the centralized scenario are calculated using a MATLAB code. Finally, two scenarios are assessed economically using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) method. The results show that the central scenario’s total HP electricity consumption is 17% lower than that of the decentral systems and requires less heat pump capacity than the decentral scenario. The LCOE of both scenarios varies from 0.04 to 0.07 CAD/kWh, which is cheaper than the electricity cost in Quebec (0.08 CAD/kWh). A comparison between both scenarios shows that the centralized energy system is cost-beneficial for all buildings and, after applying the discounts, the LCOE of this scenario decreases to 0.04 CAD/kWh. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet it has not been well-received by the climate change expert community. This is evident in the authoritative reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which emphasize SRM's governance, political, social, and ethical challenges. I find seven such challenges identified in the IPCC reports: that SRM could lessen mitigation; that its termination would cause severe climatic impacts; that researching SRM would create a “slippery slope” to its inevitable and unwanted use; that decisions to use it could be contrary to democratic norms; that the public may not accept SRM; that it could be unethical; and that decisions to use SRM could be unilateral. After assessing the extent to which these challenges are supported by existing evidence, scholarly literature, and robust logic, I conclude that, for six of the seven, the IPCC's claims variously are speculative, fail to consider both advantages and disadvantages, implicitly make unreasonable negative assumptions, are contrary to existing evidence, and/or are meaninglessly vague. I suggest some reasons for the reports' failure to meet the IPCC's standards of balance, thoroughness, and accuracy, and recommend a dedicated Special Report on SRM.

One proposal to overcome this energy insecurity is to integrate energy markets among ASEAN countries. In order to do this integration, a major energy policy reform, particularly the elimination of energy subsidy policies, is needed. The main goal of this paper, hence, is to analyze the impact of an energy subsidy reduction policy in ASEAN, particularly in terms of economic growth, environmental improvement and welfare distribution. To achieve this goal, this paper uses a multi-country computable general equilibrium (CGE) for Inter-Regional System Analysis for ASEAN (IRSA-ASEAN) to conduct the analysis. This paper finds that countries in which energy subsidies significantly exist, i.e., Indonesia and Malaysia, stand to gain much from eliminating these subsidies.

Flensburg experiences regular coastal flooding during storm events, which is expected to increase with sea-level rise (SLR). To develop robust adaptation strategies under the uncertainties of future SLR and socioeconomic development in the city, local socioeconomic scenarios can help explore plausible future socioeconomic conditions and how these conditions drive adaptation strategies. We employ a multi-scale co-production approach for developing such local scenarios. Using the global SSPs as boundary conditions, we construct local SSP narratives based on local SSP elements that we compile during the process. We integrate local stakeholder knowledge into the local SSPs in an iterative manner with the help of focus group discussions, a scenario workshop, and email feedback. This process results in four local SSP narratives that explore alternative trends in socioeconomic development in Flensburg and are embedded in developments at national to global scales. Due to their local relevance, the extended local SSPs can serve as a climate service to support Flensburg in developing adaptation plans to cope with the future impacts of SLR. © 2020 The Author(s)","Climate service; Co-production; Extended Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs); Living lab; Local socioeconomic scenarios; Multi-scale","adaptive management; socioeconomic indicator; socioeconomic status; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis; Flensburg Fjord; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100065963

The species exhibits a wide range of growth forms, but the tree-like habit, appropriately named daisy trees, is heavily underestimated, even though slightly different tree definitions are handled. Very little is known about their precise species number or conservation status in Mexico, so we update here the list of known Mexican daisy tree species, summarize their very diverse uses, present a general panorama of their present and future distribution, and discuss their conservation status. A bibliographic review and herbarium study were carried out, carefully curated taxonomical ocurrence maps were prepared for each species, and a climatic suitability modelling approach was used to characterise the spatial patterns of Mexican Asteraceae trees. With 149 daisy tree species, the country ranks second at a global level; within the country, their greatest diversity is found in central and western Mexico. A decrease in diversity is estimated in areas that currently host the highest species richness, whereas the hotspot regions are estimated to show an increase in species diversity, so climate change is not a threat to all Mexican daisy tree species. © 2021 by the authors.

A major advantage of short-chain alcohols is that they can be produced from renewable resources, i.e., cultivated commodities or biomass-based biorefineries. However, before entering the market, the effects of short-chain alcohols on engine performance, exhaust emissions, noise and sound quality need to be understood. This work sheds light on the relationship between the physicochemical properties of the alcohol/diesel fuel blends (ethanol and 1-propanol) on engine performance, exhaust emissions and, for the first time, on noise and sound quality. It has been demonstrated that when the content of alcohol in blends increased, soot and soluble organic material emissions drastically decreased, mainly due to the increase of oxygen content in the fuel. Reduction in soot emissions combined with higher thermodynamic efficiency of alcohol fuels, with respect to diesel fuel, enable their utilization on compression ignition engines. There is also an improvement in the soot-NOx trade off, leading to large reductions on soot with a small effect on NOx emissions. The oxygen content within the fuel reduces CO and THC emissions at extra-urban driving operation conditions. However, hydrocarbons and CO emissions increased at urban driving conditions, due to the high heat of vaporization of the alcohol fuels which reduces cylinder temperature worsening fuel atomization, vaporization and mixing with air being more significant at lower cylinder temperature conditions (low engine loads and speeds). Similarly, the higher the presence of alcohol in the blend, the higher the noise emitted by the engine due to their low tendency to auto-ignition. The optimization of alcohol quantity and the calibration of engine control parameters (e.g., injection settings) which is out of the scope of this work, will be required to overcome noise emission penalty. Furthermore, under similar alcohol content in the blend (10% v/v), the use of propanol is preferred over ethanol, as it exhibits lower exhaust emissions and better sound quality than ethanol. © 2021 by the authors.

The microstructure of the fabricated MPS junction is confirmed by transmission electron microcopy (TEM) measurement. The MPS junction exhibited a good rectification nature over the Ti/p-InP metal/semiconductor (MS) junction. The derived barrier height (BH) of MPS junction (0.78 eV) is higher than the MS junction (0.70 eV), that indicates the BH is influenced by the polymer layer. The BH is extracted by the I–V, Z(V)–Vd plot, Cheung’s function, α(V)–V plot, Norde method and Ψs–V plot and found the values are comparable with one another, which indicates their steadiness and validity. The estimated interface state density (NSS) of the MPS junction is less than the MS junction, suggesting that the α-amylase layer decreased the NSS value. The forward log (I)–log (V) plot of the MS and MPS junctions reveals the ohmic nature at lower-bias region and space-charge-limited conduction at higher-bias region. Results reveal that the reverse leakage current conduction mechanism of the MS and MPS junctions is governed by Poole–Frenkel emission in lower-bias region, whereas, at higher bias region, Schottky emission is dominant current conduction mechanism. These exploration results establish that the α-amylase polymer layer is potential for use in organic–inorganic devices. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",,"Interface states; Transport properties; Barrier heights; Current conduction mechanisms; Current transport properties; Interface state density; Reverse leakage current; Schottky emissions; Space charge limited conduction; Transmission electron; Amylases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102181364

Few studies have been given to macro-level aggregate analysis through national scale MSW recycling, environmental, and economic indicators. This study employs bootstrapping autoregressive distributed lag modeling for investigating the cointegration relationship among MSW recycling, economic growth, carbon emissions, and energy efficiency utilized quarterly data from 1990 to 2017. The result implies that a one percent increase in MSW recycling contributes to economic growth and reduce carbon emissions by 0.317% (0.157%) and 0.209% (0.087%) in the long-run (short-run). Similarly, a one percent improvement in energy efficiency stimulates economic growth by 0.489% (0.281%) and mitigates carbon emissions by 0.285% (0.197%) in the long-run (short-run). A higher per capita income and population growth caused higher emissions by 0.197% and 0.401% in the long-run. The overall results reveal stronger impacts in the long-run than the short-run with significant convergence towards long-run equilibrium, suggesting a prominent long-run transmission of economic and environmental fallouts. This study confirms a uni-directional causality from MSW recycling to economic growth, carbon emissions, and energy efficiency. These outcomes signify that any policy intervention related to MSW recycling produces significant changes in the level of economic growth and carbon emissions. The finding provides valuable insight for policymakers to counteract carbon emissions through recyclable waste management that simultaneously create significant economic value. © 2020","Bootstrapping autoregressive distributed lag; Carbon emissions; Economic growth; Energy efficiency; Municipal solid waste recycling","Carbon; Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; Population statistics; Recycling; Waste management; Aggregate analysis; Autoregressive distributed lag models; Cointegration relationship; Economic indicators; Environmental quality; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Per capita income; Policy intervention; Municipal solid waste; bootstrapping; carbon emission; economic growth; energy efficiency; environmental quality; municipal solid waste; recycling; Article; bootstrapping autoregressive distributed lag; carbon footprint; causality; economic development; energy yield; environmental impact; income; municipal solid waste; policy; population growth; recycling; statistical analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098507475

In the past 40 decades, there have been many innovations in the development of low-cost and efficacious technologies for WASH and household air pollution, but many of these technologies have been associated with disappointing health outcomes, often because low-income households have either not adopted, or inconsistently adopted, these technologies. In this Viewpoint, we argue that public health researchers (ourselves included) have had an oversimplified understanding of poverty; our work has not focused on insights into the lived experience of poverty, with its uncertainties, stresses from constant scarcity, and attendant fears. Such insights are central to understanding why technologies for safe water or clean cooking are unused by so many households that could benefit from them. We argue that, rather than improved versions of household-scale delivery models, transformative investments in safe water and clean cooking for all require utility-scale service models. Until then, research should focus on interim safe water and clean cooking options that are directed towards the utility-scale service model. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Other such parameters include the number of injections, rate of injection and injection pattern, etc. In the present study, a multi-cylinder, turbocharged, four-stroke, direct injection (DI) diesel engine was used to investigate the combined influence of FIT and IOP on performance and emissions characteristics. The experimentation was conducted for two IOPs (250 and 300 bar) with four FITs such as 20°, 23°, 26°, and 29° before top dead center (BTDC) at different engine speed and load conditions. To obtain the emissions characteristics, the engine was tested in accordance with the 8-mode steady-state cycle. Moreover, 250 bar and 23° BTDC were the original IOP and FIT, respectively. For all IOP conditions, in comparison to the results with the original FIT, the advancement or retardation in FIT provided the negative results in terms of brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC). Increasing the IOP from 250 to 300 bar, improved the performance parameters for retarded and original FITs (20° and 23° BTDC) and caused the deterioration in performance for advanced FITs. In terms of emissions characteristics, filter smoke number (FSN) and emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) decreased on advancing the FIT and increasing the IOP. On the other hand, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) increased on advancing the FIT and increasing the IOP for all experimental conditions.

Rapidly growing urban areas are liable to greater risk of climate change. Fine-scale rainfall forms the most important input to achieve greater accuracy in urban flood model simulation results. The major concern with modeling urban floods, particularly in developing countries like India is the unavailability of fine-scale rainfall data. This explains the need for developing a methodology to disaggregate large scale precipitation data into a fine-scale interval of time. A statistical rainfall disaggregation method is employed to scale down IDF parameters under climate change conditions. Synthetic rainfall hyetographs are developed from scaled IDF values and used as input to simulate the 1D[sbnd]2D urban flood model. In this study, we used the combination of flow velocity (V), inundation depth (D), and the product (D × V) framed to quantify the flood-hazard for part of Hyderabad, India. The flood vulnerability produced by the hydraulic model is analysed and matched with the 2016 flooding event.

In this definition, the principal goal of CSA is identified as food security and development, while productivity, adaptation, and mitigation are identified as the three interlinked pillars necessary for achieving this goal. In the context provided by the CSA, soils are seen as a lever to improve the carbon footprint of agriculture, namely through their role as carbon sinks. Improving soils and in particular agricultural soils’ content in soil organic carbon (SOC) in one of the measures enabling to improve the environmental impact of agricultural practices. In this context, composts can be seen as an important feedstock for sustainable farming. To support the development of organic amendment strategies enabling to increase soils’ SOC content, this work proposes a novel methodology to optimize the monthly scheduling of composts and mineral fertilizers amendments. The schedule proposed maximizes soil health - via improved SOC content - while ensuring optimal gross operating surplus from agriculture. This problem is subjected to certain operational, regulatory and soil-dynamics constraints which leads to a complex optimization problem and has to be solved in a relatively short time period for decision-making purposes. This is a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) which is based on a soil-simulation model from which the analytic functions are not explicitly available for the optimization model. Operational and regulatory constraints are explicitly defined and integer and continuous variables are needed in the modeling. In order to effectively solve it in a deterministic way, a novel surrogate-modeling approach for the objective functions and constraints is proposed. Another novelty comes from the implementation of a continuous-variable-reduction procedure in order to build effective surrogates. The optimisation model results obtained from a real case study show that local optimal solutions can be identified with short computation times. The evaluated scenario shows that the optimized strategy could increase by 8% the carbon in soil after 13 years while increasing by 7% the estimated agricultural profit when compared to expert based application schedules. © 2020 China Agricultural University","Agricultural scheduling; Compost amendments; Mixed-Integer-Nonlinear programming; Smart agriculture; Surrogate-based optimization","Agricultural robots; Carbon footprint; Composting; Decision making; Food supply; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Organic carbon; Productivity; Scheduling; Soil mechanics; Soils; Agricultural practices; Complex optimization problems; Compost amendments; Local optimal solution; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Non-linear optimization problems; Smart agricultures; Surrogate-based optimization; Agriculture; agricultural practice; alternative agriculture; compost; food security; modeling; optimization; organic carbon; soil organic matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081890331

Securing access to essential services such as energy, water, and food, while achieving sustainable development, require that policy and planning processes follow an integrated approach. The 'Climate-, Land-, Energy- and Water-systems' (CLEWs) framework assists the exploration of interactions between (and within) CLEW systems via quantitative means. The approach was first introduced by the International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct an integrated systems analysis of a biofuel chain. The framework assists the exploration of interactions between (and within) CLEW systems via quantitative means. Its multi-institutional application to the case of Mauritius in 2012 initiated the deployment of the framework. A vast number of completed and ongoing applications of CLEWs span different spatial and temporal scales, discussing two or more resource interactions under different political contexts. Also, the studies vary in purpose. This shapes the methods that support CLEWs-type analyses. In this paper, we detail the main steps of the CLEWs framework in perspective to its application over the years. We summarise and compare key applications, both published in the scientific literature, as working papers and reports by international organizations. We discuss differences in terms of geographic scope, purpose, interactions represented, analytical approach and stakeholder involvement. In addition, we review other assessments, which contributed to the advancement of the CLEWs framework. The paper delivers recommendations for the future development of the framework, as well as keys to success in this type of evaluations. © 2021 The Author(s).

Increased agricultural productivity could compensate for this. Our study aims to evaluate the regional combined GHG emissions of increasing agricultural yields for food crop and beef production and using the generated surplus land for biomass production to replace fossil fuels in the Orinoquia region of Colombia until 2030. The results show that surplus land for biomass production is obtained only when strong measures are applied to increase agricultural productivity. In the medium and high scenario, a land surplus of 0.6 and 2.4 Mha, respectively, could be generated. Such intensification results in up to 83% emission reduction in Orinoquia’s agricultural sector, largely coming from increasing productivity of cattle production and improving degraded pastures. Biofuel potential from the surplus land is projected at 36 to 368 PJ per year, with a low risk of causing indirect LUC, and results in GHG emission reductions of more than 100% compared to its fossil fuel equivalent.

To do so, it is important to have tools that allow the carbon footprint of cities to be assessed as accurately as possible. This study aims to quantify the carbon footprint (CF) associated with the activities developed in a Spanish city (Cadiz, Southwest Spain) by means of two available environmental methodologies, namely Environmentally Extended Input-Output Analysis (EEIOA) and Life Cycle assessment (LCA). When EEIOA is considered, two downscaling factors were proposed for the analysis due to the nature of the data handled (monetary data), based on the incomes (DF1) and expenditures (DF2) per inhabitant at city level. Regarding LCA, the rates of consumption of goods and production of waste per inhabitant have been processed to estimate the CF. The CF scores identified were 5.25 and 3.83 tCO2-eq·inhabitant−1·year−1 for DF1 and DF2 respectively, according to EEIOA, and 5.43 tCO2-eq·inhabitant−1·year−1, considering LCA. Therefore, a similarity can be concluded between the results obtained with both methodologies despite the inherent differences. Considering the results, the downscaling procedure based on income per inhabitant should be preferred, pointing to EEIOA as a good alternative to LCA for evaluating the CF at city level, requiring less time and effort. In contrast, EEIOA reports more limitations when critical flows were identified, which LCA can solve. Finally, this study can be of great interest to policy makers and city governments to know the CF and the main flows that contribute and in this way, can develop new policies and city models for reducing GHG emission new policies and city models for reducing GHG emission and addressing climate change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Greenhouse gas emissions; Spain; Sustainable city; Urban environmental management; Urban metabolism","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Climate models; Economic analysis; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; City model; Climate change mitigation; Critical flow; Down-scaling; GHG emission; Input output analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Policy makers; Life cycle; carbon emission; carbon footprint; climate change; comparative study; environmental management; greenhouse gas; input-output analysis; life cycle analysis; urban policy; article; carbon footprint; climate change; environmental management; government; life cycle assessment; metabolism; quantitative analysis; Spain; Andalucia; Cadiz [Andalucia]; Cadiz [Cadiz (PRV)]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093943220

In this study, the effect of ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (800 ppm) CO2 concentrations were evaluated on the C4 xero-halophyte Kochia prostrata treated with moderate salinity (200 mM NaCl) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced osmotic stress. Our results indicated that plants grown at elevated CO2 concentration had different responses to osmotic stress and salinity. The synergistic effect of elevated CO2 and osmotic stress increased proline accumulation, but elevated CO2 did not mitigate the negative effects of osmotic stress on dark respiration intensity and photosystem II (PSII) efficiency. This indicates a stressful state, which is accompanied by a decrease in the efficiency of light reactions of photosynthesis and significant dissipative respiratory losses, thereby resulting in growth inhibition. Plants grown at elevated CO2 concentration and salinity showed high Na+ and proline contents, high water-use efficiency and time required to reach the maximum P700 oxidation level (PSI), and low dark respiration. Maintaining stable water balance, the efficient functioning of cyclic transport of PSI, and the reduction of dissipation costs contributed to an increase in dry shoot biomass (2-fold, compared with salinity at 400 ppm CO2 ). The obtained experimental data and PCA showed that elevated CO2 concentration improved the physiological parameters of K. prostrata under salinity. © 2021 by the authors.

The plastic waste management becomes a pressing concern in the present scenario in developing countries like India. This research article evaluates the potential of synthetic fuel (SF) derived from waste plastics collected from the local shops. In this current investigation, the SF blends are tested in a direct injection diesel engine to analyze the performance and emission characteristics of the engine. Three different blends were made namely SF20, SF40, and SF60 on a volumetric basis and the tests were carried out. From the experimental results, it was found that brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of the fuel blends was reduced as compared with neat diesel operation regardless of loads whereas SF20 showed a similar trend as that of diesel operation. The analysis of the emission characteristics revealed that the SF20 blends reduced dangerous smoke and carbon monoxide emission as compared with other test fuels. From the overall results, SF20 showed superior performance and emission aspects as compared with other SF blends whereas the engine operated smoothly up to 60% of SF blending at all loading conditions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Brake thermal efficiency; Emissions; Synthetic fuel; Waste plastic pyrolysis","carbon monoxide; diesel engine; fuel; plastic waste; smoke; waste management; India; biofuel; carbon monoxide; gasoline; plastic; exhaust gas; India; Biofuels; Carbon Monoxide; Gasoline; India; Plastics; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083519428

They are widely used due to their innate properties such as high efficiency, high power output, and durability. However, they are considered one of the key contributors to transport-related emission and have recently been identified as carcinogenic. Thus, it is important to modify the designs and processes before, during, and after combustion to reduce the emissions to meet the strict emission regulations. The paper discusses the pros and cons of different strategies to reduce emissions of a diesel engine. An overview of various techniques to modify the pre-combustion engine design aspects has been discussed first. After that, fuel modifications techniques during combustion to improve the fuel properties to reduce the engine-out emission is discussed. Finally, post-combustion after-treatment devices are briefly discussed, which help improve the air quality of our environment. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we applied ground- and satellite-based data of five criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, SO2, O3, and CO) and meteorological factors from March 8 to May 15, 2020 (before, partial-, and full-lockdown). The generalized additive models (GAMs), wavelet coherence, and random forest (RF) model were employed to explore the relationship between air quality indicators and COVID-19 transmission in Dhaka city. Results show that overall, 26, 20.4, 17.5, 9.7 and 8.8% declined in PM 2.5, NO2, SO2, O3, and CO concentrations, respectively, in Dhaka City during the partial and full lockdown compared to the period before the lockdown. The implementation of lockdown policy for containing COVID-19 transmission played a crucial role in reducing air pollution. The findings of wavelet coherence and partial wavelet coherence demonstrate no standalone coherence, but interestingly, multiple wavelet coherence indicated a strong short-term coherence among air pollutants and meteorological factors with the COVID-19 outbreak. Outcomes of GAMs indicated that an increase of 1-unit in long-term exposure to O3 and CO (lag1) was associated with a 2.9% (95% CI: −0.3%, −5.6%), and 53.9% (95% CI: 0.2%, −107.9%) decreased risk of COVID-19 infection rate during the full-lockdown period. Whereas, COVID-19 infection and MT (mean temperature) are modulated by a peak during full-lockdown, which is mostly attributed to contact transmission in Dhaka city. RF model revealed among the parameters being studied, MT, RH (relative humidity), and O3 were the dominant factors that could be associated with COVID-19 cases during the study period. The outcomes reported here could elucidate the effectiveness of lockdown scenarios for COVID-19 containment and air pollution control in Dhaka city. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; CO; COVID-19; Humidity; Ozone; PM2.5","Air quality; Decision trees; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Transmissions; CO concentrations; Criteria air pollutants; Generalized additive model; Long term exposure; Mean temperature; Meteorological factors; Quality indicators; Wavelet coherences; Air pollution control; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; COVID-19; disease transmission; humidity; ozone; particulate matter; viral disease; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; air temperature; Article; artificial intelligence; Bangladesh; climate; clinical effectiveness; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; health care policy; human; human activities; humidity; infection rate; infection risk; lockdown; long term exposure; Monte Carlo method; Morlet wavelet transform; pandemic; particulate matter; predictive value; priority journal; random forest; remote sensing; support vector machine; validation process; virus transmission; weather; air pollutant; city; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; Bangladesh; Dhaka [Bangladesh]; Dhaka [Dhaka (ADS)]; Coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Bangladesh; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094560102

Therefore, we bring together experiments and first-principles calculations to reveal the origin of long-range ferromagnetism in the Co2-based Heusler alloy Co2HfSn. The precise value of the critical exponents β=0.471(4), γ=1.02(4), and δ=3.273(5) with the Curie temperature (Tc=430 K) were determined experimentally by means of different analytical methods such as modified Arrott plot analysis, the Kouvel-Fisher method, and critical isotherm analysis. The deduced critical exponents belong to the theoretical prediction of the three-dimensional mean-field model. The magnetic exchange distance is found to decay as J(r)∼r-4.52, indicating the long-range magnetic interaction in Co2HfSn. Moreover, the magnetic entropy change -ΔSM features a maximum at Tc, i.e., -ΔSMmax∼ 29.87(6) J kg-1K-1 at 5 T, whereas power law fitting of -ΔSMmax with H gives n′=0.663(5), also confirming the mean-field-type magnetic interaction in Co2HfSn. Meanwhile, in order to explore the origin of long-range ferromagnetic ordering in Co2HfSn, spin-polarized density functional theory calculations were employed in this study. No stable antiferromagnetic solution with stable local magnetic moments at the Co or Hf site was observed in our fixed spin moment simulation, revealing that Co2HfSn is a highly itinerant magnet with a long-range ferromagnetic solution together with robust half-metallic conduction stable against thermal excitation higher than room temperature. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis shows that Co2HfSn belongs to an unconventional family of itinerant magnetism. Both the 100% spin-polarized metallicity and ferromagnetism arise from the Co d orbitals, causing it to be unique compared to the conventional itinerant family of Ni, Co, or Fe, where magnetism and metallicity originate from different orbitals characters. © 2021 American Physical Society.",,"Antiferromagnetism; Astrophysics; Calculations; Carbon dioxide; Cobalt; Density functional theory; Electromagnets; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Hafnium alloys; Magnetic moments; Mean field theory; Metal analysis; Spin polarization; Ternary alloys; Tin alloys; Antiferromagnetic solutions; First-principles calculation; Half-metallic Heusler compounds; Local magnetic moments; Long range ferromagnetic order; Magnetic entropy change; Magnetic interactions; Spin-polarized density functional theory; Cobalt alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103771410

It is also central to many technological processes. Therefore, innovative nanomaterials that can absorb, generate, or further exploit light are of utmost importance, having the potential to become pervasive in our lives. This is the case for carbon nanocolloids, which are ubiquitous, biocompatible, and inexpensive, which are the three important prerequisites for their broader application in different fields of technology. Yet, despite intense research for a number of years, a unifying picture describing the excited-state properties of these nanocolloids is lacking. It is possibly the time when this approach should be reversed, embracing the inherent diversity of excited states in carbon-based particles, which enable us to focus on engineering their optical properties based on their structural variability. A deeper understanding of the molecular features of carbon nanocolloids is emerging as one of the key factors, which will allow unlocking excited-state processes appearing out of reach, unfolding the full potential of optical processes in this potent family of nanomaterials. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Carbon nanocolloids represent a promising family of nanomaterials, since they are biocompatible, inexpensive, and tailorable. Central to their properties is the ability to absorb light, emit photons, and manage change or photons. Here, the excited-state properties of carbon nanocolloids are reviewed, encompassing all the most relevant light-induced processes and outlining key challenges. The need to attribute the observed optical processes to specific structural features is identified as an enabling step in this exciting area of nanoscience. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.In recent years, carbon dots, graphene quantum dots, and other carbon nanocolloids have attracted a mounting interest as readily available, non-toxic, and tailorable carbon-based nanomaterials. One of the most fascinating features of carbon nanocolloids is their luminescence, the origin of which remains a source of dispute. The lack of understanding of the optical properties of carbon nanocolloids hampers their use in technological, environmental, and biomedical processes. Here, we review the current knowledge of excited states in carbon nanocolloids and related properties, inviting researchers to embrace the complexity of carbon nanocolloids. We point to the fundamental problems associated with their structure, photophysics, and photochemistry and highlight multiple directions of current and future research of this exciting class of nanomaterials. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","carbon dots; carbon nanocolloids; carbon nanoparticles; charge transfer; energy transfer; fluorescence; SDG7: Affordable and clean energy; SDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099510044

A setup based on the Rain In Cumulus over the Ocean field campaign is used to simulate a shallow trade wind cumulus field with the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic Large Eddy Model in a control and a perturbed 4 K warmer climate, while degrading horizontal resolution from 100 m to 5 km. As the resolution is coarsened, the base-state cloud fraction increases substantially, especially near cloud base, lateral mixing is weaker, and cloud tops reach higher. Nevertheless, the overall vertical structure of the cloud layer is surprisingly robust across resolutions. In a warmer climate, cloud cover reduces, alone constituting a positive shortwave cloud feedback: the strength correlates with the amount of base-state cloud fraction and thus is stronger at coarser resolutions. Cloud thickening, resulting from more water vapour availability for condensation in a warmer climate, acts as a compensating feedback, but unlike the cloud cover reduction it is largely resolution independent. Therefore, refining the resolution leads to convergence to a near-zero shallow cumulus feedback. This dependence holds in experiments with enhanced realism including precipitation processes or warming along a moist adiabat instead of uniform warming. Insofar as these findings carry over to other models, they suggest that storm-resolving models may exaggerate the trade wind cumulus cloud feedback. © Author(s) 2021.",,"climate feedback; climate modeling; cloud microphysics; cloud radiative forcing; cumulus; large eddy simulation; shortwave radiation; storm; trade wind; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104046962

This study examines whether this decline is consistent across lighter and heavier drinkers in line with the theory of the collectivity of drinking cultures. Methods: Data were collected through annual nationally representative surveys conducted between 2006 and 2018 of 33 109 individuals aged 18–85 years. We estimated generalised linear regression with Gamma distribution and used log alcohol volume consumed during the previous 30 days as the dependent variable for five percentile groups: heavy drinkers (95th), near heavy drinkers (90th), moderate drinkers (80th), light drinkers (60th for men and 70th for women) and non-drinkers. Dummy variables for years, percentile groups and their interactions were used as independent variables. The controls were age, education, income, body weight, marital status, household demographic structure, residence, ethnicity and regional climate. Results: Reductions in alcohol consumption were observed in all percentiles, but the scale of change was proportionally smaller among heavier drinkers than among lighter drinkers. However, consumption fell by a smaller amount among lighter drinkers than among heavier drinkers. Results of the regression analysis fit with the descriptive statistics. Interactions between the time period and the percentile groups were significant after 2010. Trends were similar for both sexes. Discussion and Conclusions: Downward trends across percentiles were in the same direction but the magnitude of change varied. Obtained evidence fails to support a polarisation and points towards soft collectivity hypothesis in the reduction in drinking in Russia. © 2021 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs","alcohol consumption; collective drinking behaviour; polarisation; Russia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101484491

From acoustic emission signals acquired by two R15i-AST sensors at two ends of a fluid pipeline, the proposed method scans peaks in the individual signal channels in the time-frequency domain and filters out noise to obtain acoustic emission events. Subsequently, adjacent events are combined into grouped events, and these are picked and paired together on two sensor channels to localize emission sources using the time difference of arrival technique. To improve the location accuracy, the mechanism only determines the arrival time of Rayleigh waves with a similar frequency in event pairs. Furthermore, the Rayleigh wave velocity is calibrated by a pencil lead breaking procedure. Additionally, false emission sources are eliminated by considering the wave energy attenuation characteristics in their propagation path. After locating the emission sources, the approach observes their distribution according to the position and time of occurrence. The variation in acoustic emission activity against applied load, which is established by counting the returned sources, can indicate irregular structural changes in a material. The location of the structural change can be surmised by the emission source distribution and density according to the position along the pipeline. Experimental results show that the proposed method correctly diagnoses faults in the considered pipeline from acoustic emission signals, whereas a conventional approach (performed by detecting hits with a threshold) inaccurately localizes acoustic emission sources and imprecisely exposes signs of abnormal structural transformations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Acoustic emission analysis; Emission source localization; Pipeline crack detection; Pipeline crack localization; Pipeline health inspection","Crack detection; Frequency domain analysis; Location; Pipelines; Rayleigh waves; Wave energy conversion; Wave propagation; Acoustic emission signal; Acoustic emission sources; Conventional approach; Crack detection and localization; Propagation paths; Rayleigh wave velocity; Structural transformation; Time frequency domain; Acoustic emission testing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090420451

Reducing ozone pollution in rural regions, where local emissions are already low, poses challenge. We use meteorological back-trajectories, air quality model sensitivity analysis, and satellite remote sensing data to investigate the ozone sources in Yuma, Arizona and find strong international influences from Northern Mexico on 12 out of 16 ozone exceedance days. We find that such exceedances could not be mitigated by reducing emissions in Arizona; complete removal of state emissions would reduce the maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) ozone in Yuma by only 0.7% on exceeding days. In contrast, emissions in Mexico are estimated to contribute to 11% of the ozone during these exceedances, and their reduction would reduce MDA8 ozone in Yuma to below the standard. Using satellite-based remote sensing measurements, we find that emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx, a key photochemical precursor of ozone) increase slightly in Mexico from 2005 to 2016, opposite to decreases shown in the bottom-up inventory. In comparison, a decrease of NOx emissions in the US and meteorological factors lead to an overall of summer mean and annual MDA8 ozone in Yuma (by ∼1–4% and ∼3%, respectively). Analysis of meteorological back-trajectories also shows similar transboundary transport of ozone at the US-Mexico border in California and New Mexico, where strong influences from Northern Mexico coincide with 11 out of 17 and 6 out of 8 ozone exceedances. 2020 is the final year of the U.S.-Mexico Border 2020 Program, which aimed to reduce pollution at border regions of the US and Mexico.

The study investigated the aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra and Aqua satellites, PM2.5 and PM10 from Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), and NO2 and O3 from TROPOMI-5P, from March to June 2019-2020. Additionally, aerosol subtypes from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder (CALIPSO) were used to explore the aerosol types. The strict lockdown (26 March-30 May 2020) led to a significant reduction in AOD (up to 47%) in all major cities, while the partial lockdown (June 2020) led to increased and decreased AOD over the study area. Significant reductions in PM2.5 (37- 77%) and PM10 (33%-70%) were also observed throughout the country during the strict lockdown and partial lockdown. The NO2 levels decreased by 3%-25% in March 2020 in the cities of Rajshahi, Chattogram, Sylhet, Khulna, Barisal, and Mymensingh, in April by 3%-43% in Dhaka, Chattogram, Khulna, Barisal, Bhola, and Mymensingh, and May by 12%-42% in Rajshahi, Sylhet, Mymensingh, and Rangpur. During the partial lockdown in June, NO2 decreased (9%-35%) in Dhaka, Chattogram, Sylhet, Khulna, Barisal, and Rangpur compared to 2019. On the other hand, increases were observed in ozone (O3) levels, with an average increase of 3%-12% throughout the country during the strict lockdown and only a slight reduction of 1%-3% in O3 during the partial lockdown. In terms of aerosol types, CALIPSO observed high levels of polluted dust followed by dust, smoke, polluted continental, and clean marine-type aerosols over the country in 2019, but all types were decreased during the lockdown. The study concludes that the strict lockdown measures were able to significantly improve air quality conditions over Bangladesh due to the shutdown of industries, vehicles, and movement of people. © 2021 by the authors.","Aerosols; CALIPSO; COVID-19; Ozone; Particulate matter","Air quality; Dust; Nitrogen oxides; Optical radar; Radiometers; Smoke; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol types; Aqua satellites; Atmosphere monitoring; Cloud-aerosol lidar; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Movement of peoples; Spatio-temporal changes; Aerosols",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102145716

The art gallery is the embodiment of a city's cultural level, and it is also important spiritual support for facing a well-off society and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The development of a city is concentrated in pieces of unique and charming artworks, which are witnesses to the times' changes. Therefore, designing an art museum that can meet all cultural functions and be energy-saving, green, and environmentally friendly becomes more and more important. Based on this research background, the thesis conducts environmental protection design of the art museum to realize the control of the project site planning and the unique climate adaptability design of the art museum, which helps to ensure that the design project from the macro to the micro-level better reflects the energy-saving design. The effect plays a positive role in promoting the development of art gallery design theory and is of great significance to improving the practice methods of green public art gallery design. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In Pakistan, severe impacts of climate change have become evident in the recent past. Large-scale floods in the Indus river system have caused massive damages in the past decade. Also, frequent droughts and heatwaves are among other consequences of the changing climate in the country. Understanding the perspective of local communities regarding climate change adaptation strategies is pivotal to effective policymaking. We surveyed the rural community in the Indus Basin, in southern Punjab, Pakistan, to assess the climate change adaptations currently practiced. We found that the respondents perceive droughts, floods, and disease outbreaks (which are frequently followed by flooding events) as major climate change-induced threats. The respondents used flood and drought-resistant crop varieties, field boundaries (spate irrigation), migration to safe places, and loans as key adaptation strategies. We also assessed the socioeconomic determinants of climate change adaptation behaviour using a binary logistic regression model. Gender, occupation, and education influenced the adaptations to climate change. The present study highlights the need for monetary support to flood-prone communities, better medical facilities, provision of drought and flood-resistant crop varieties, and awareness campaigns to enhance adaptive capacity in the study area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation strategies; Climate change; Floods; Indus basin; Pakistan; Rajanpur; Rural community",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097470587

In Finland, mechanical exhaust ventilation system is commonly used in older apartment buildings. Hence, there could be an energy saving potential by an exhaust air heat pump system (EAHP). In this work two cases have been studied. Buildings were built in 1960's and 1970's and in renovation equipped with hybrid heating system: district heating and exhaust air heat pump system. Two years measurement data, 2018 and 2019, was collected to evaluate the performance of exhaust air heat pump systems. According to measurement data the monthly coefficient of performance (COP) was calculated as well as seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) was defined. The monthly COP values varied from 3,1 to 4,6 and SCOP values were about 3,7. Heating energy cost savings were 23-31 %. Energy performance class before and after EAHP installation was calculated. If at least 50 % of heating energy consumption was covered by EAHP then also energy performance class was improved. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Air conditioning; Apartment houses; Coefficient of performance; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Heat pump systems; Heating; Pumps; Ventilation; Apartment buildings; Coefficient of performances (COP); Energy performance; Energy saving potential; Heating energy consumption; Measurement data; Mechanical exhausts; Seasonal coefficients; Ventilation exhausts",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103571214

This approach addressed climatic, energy, materials and construction issues in a low-cost way. Building interiors were often made comfortable by using passive internal climate regulation methods, which could be key to resolving some of the current issues of the modern world. Design/methodology/approach: Tamil Nadu is a land full of local architecture, with Konearirajapuram settlement a thriving specimen of its vernacular architecture, as one of the original Vathima villages (planned Brahmin villages). Here the authors present an appraisal of this settlement's native architecture with its various passive design elements. A questionnaire survey was also conducted among local residents, living in both vernacular and contemporary residential buildings, to understand the quality of indoor environmental comfort in the different building types (single courtyard, multiple courtyards and multiple story houses with courtyards). Findings: The results of this study show that energy-efficient bioclimatic design strategies of traditional buildings can be analyzed with the help of climatic data and analysis tools such as Mahoney tables and Olgyay's bioclimatic chart. The study shows that vernacular design techniques and principles conserve more energy than modern buildings. The findings suggest that practical solutions for improving contemporary residential developments can be found in traditional architectural approaches and that these approaches should be incorporated in new developments to achieve energy efficiency and a sustainable future. Research limitations/implications: A detailed survey and the user preferences are plotted in detail in this paper; similarly, Mahoney table and its requirements are analyzed with respect to context; and the results are elaborated and justified. Originality/value: This study analyzes an entire settlement of Konearirajapuram with 300 units of vernacular residences high in comfort even at extreme climates. Assessment is carried in both qualitative case and quantitative case. Even though there are no previous studies analyzed to identify the effectiveness of the artisanal builders of bioclimatic architecture. Hence, this study brings out the solution for current energy problems from the traditional settings, because the traditional buildings requires no active systems for indoor comfort except a fan, which is negligible in terms of energy use. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bioclimatic design strategies; Energy-efficient vernacular techniques; Native architecture; Receptive building design; Thermal comfort analysis using Mahoney tables and Olgyay's chart","Architectural design; Energy utilization; Historic preservation; Housing; Rural areas; Surveys; Architectural approach; Bio-climatic architectures; Design/methodology/approach; Environmental comfort; Questionnaire surveys; Residential development; Traditional buildings; Vernacular architecture; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088699145

In the framework of the EU City-zen project, a number of so-called Roadshows has been organised in ten cities within and outside Europe in order to plan and kick-off their transition towards an energy- and climate-neutral economy. During the Roadshows, a group of experts is engaged to perform co-working activities and participative labs involving local stakeholders. These activities support cities in identifying their own decarbonisation pathways, mainly by combining three mutual processes, i.e. energy design, urban design and carbon accounting. The latter, in particular, has been used to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions of cities and neighbourhoods and to estimate the mitigation effect of a combination of measures towards the desirable condition of carbon neutrality. This exploratory and proactive design process has been successfully demonstrated through intensive workshops and can be potentially replicated in other cities. This paper provides a schematic overview of the main results achieved in the Belgian town of Roeselare, but more significantly it describes the techniques needed to make that cooperative process understandable, impactful and implementable. It is likely that 2050 European goals will drastically change urban environments and socio-economic dynamics in cities, due to the fragmentation of energy sources. Hence, from this standpoint there is a vital need for integrated technologies and infrastructures, a circular economy and community-based processes such as food production, sharing of facilities and valorisation of ecosystem services. The City-zen Roeselare Roadshow brought over 300 stakeholders into the process of re-imagining and visualising their 2050 future city with these solutions. Stakeholders, with no particular expertise in carbon accounting or sustainability, would now have the capability of understanding and applying these solutions in a combined effort to meet the zero-carbon challenge. The approach is generally replicable elsewhere being highly visual, impactful, transferable, and multi-stakeholder friendly. Given that data are made locally available, the combination of this general approach, site-specific assessments and the involvement of both experts and local stakeholders (i.e. policy makers, citizens, etc) allow the transition to start by referring to any real city or neighbourhood. © 2020","Decarbonisation strategy; Energy potential map; Greenhouse gas inventory; Roadshow; Sustainable city","Decarbonization; Economics; Ecosystems; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Carbon neutralities; Cooperative process; Ecosystem services; Energy transitions; Integrated technologies; Mitigation effects; Multi-stakeholder; Urban environments; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097469314

The article asks the following question: what is the full range of determinants of delivery by non-state actor focused on adaptation to climate change and disaster risk reduction? Drawing on data collected through interviews with, and a survey of, core partners in a selection of non-state actor actions, the article puts forward a taxonomy that can help gauge the likelihood that a non-state actor action may be able to deliver on its intended objectives. The findings presented in the article reveal that several of the determinants of delivery by non-state actors are outside of the sphere of influence of the core partners in these actions.

Both articles seek to look at a familiar topic-the Paris Agreement and climate litigation-in new and fresh ways. This second article examines how the Paris Agreement is influencing fact-finding in administrative and judicial decision-making, transforming corporate governance to be better attuned to climate risk and contributing to a ripple effect in climate litigation. The article first considers how the Paris Agreement has altered the factual considerations of climate change by demonstrating global agreement on the causal link between anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and the catastrophic consequences of climate change. Secondly, it illustrates how the Paris Agreement is affecting legal responsibilities by focusing on the influence of the Paris Agreement on corporate directors' duties. Thirdly, it notes the ripple effect of climate litigation, contributing to the continued development of climate law. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

The rapidly growing population and their needs constitute one of the major drivers of land-use changes in the Asia region. Agricultural productivity has increased at a slightly faster pace than population growth in Asia through agricultural intensification. Intensive farming practices have put pressure on ecosystems leading to declining total factor productivity, land degradation, soil erosion, loss of soil fertility, and GHG emissions. Policy measures to address unsustainable land transformations have been minimal and countries are yet to be successful in arresting the negative trends. Through coordinated land management and integrated land decision support systems, countries can address food-fuel conflicts, arrest negative environmental consequences, enhance rural prosperity, and achieve sustainable development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Drivers; Intensification; Land transformations; Pressures","agricultural intensification; agricultural land; agricultural production; land management; land use change; policy approach; productivity; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098661798

To combine both, a concept for the enhancement of an aircraft engine by steam injection with inflight water recovery is being developed. The so-called Water-Enhanced Turbofan (WET) concept promises a significant reduction of CO2 emissions, NOx emissions, and contrail formation. Representative missions for an A320-type aircraft using the proposed new engine were calculated. Applying a first-order one-dimensional climate assessment prospects the reduction of more than half of the Global Warming Potential over one hundred years, compared to an evolutionarily improved aero-engine. If CO2-neutrally produced sustainable aviation fuels are used, climate impact could be reduced by 93% compared to today’s aircraft. The evaluation is a first estimate of effects based on preliminary design studies and should provide a starting point for discussion in the scientific community, implying the need for research, especially on the formation mechanisms and radiation properties of potential contrails from the comparatively cold exhaust gases of the WET engine. © 2021 by the authors.

The real-time fuel consumption and emissions of the transit bus configurations are calculated by dynamic vehicle simulation using Simcenter Amesim software. By considering the effect of road gradient, a 12% difference in computed fuel consumption is shown for bus travel in the two opposing directions of the bus line.

While historical TWS variations have been increasingly studied, future changes in TWS and the linkages to droughts remain unexamined. Here, using ensemble hydrological simulations, we show that climate change could reduce TWS in many regions, especially those in the Southern Hemisphere. Strong inter-ensemble agreement indicates high confidence in the projected changes that are driven primarily by climate forcing rather than land and water management activities. Declines in TWS translate to increases in future droughts. By the late twenty-first century, the global land area and population in extreme-to-exceptional TWS drought could more than double, each increasing from 3% during 1976–2005 to 7% and 8%, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of climate change mitigation to avoid adverse TWS impacts and increased droughts, and the need for improved water resource management and adaptation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"climate change; climate forcing; drought; hydrological cycle; water availability; water management; water resource; water storage; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100196380

They provide boundary conditions for climate and geodynamic modelling, for analysing surface processes and biotic interactions. However, the temporal and spatial distribution of key features such as seaways and mountain belts that govern climate changes and biotic interchange differ between various paleogeographies that require regular updates with new data and models. We developed a reproducible and systematic approach to paleogeographic reconstruction and provide a set of worldwide Cenozoic paleogeographic maps at 60, 40 and 20 Ma. We followed a six-stage methodology that integrates an extensive review of geological data into a coherent plate tectonic model using the open source software GPlates. (1) We generated a global plate kinematic model, and reconstructed intensely-deformed plate boundaries using a review of structural, paleomagnetic and other geologic data in six key regions: the Andes, the North American Cordillera, the Scotia Arc, Africa, the Mediterranean region and the Tibetan-Himalayan collision zone. (2) We modified previously published paleobathymetry in several regions where continental and oceanic crust overlap due to differences in the plate models. (3) We then defined paleoshorelines using updated fossil and geologic databases to locate the terrestrial to marine transition. (4) We applied isostatic compensation in polar regions and global eustatic sea level adjustments. (5) Paleoelevations were estimated using a broad range of data including thermochronology and stable isotopes, combined with paleobotanical (mostly pollen and leaf physiognomy), structural and geomorphological data. We address ongoing controversies on the mechanisms and chronology of India-Asia collision by providing alternate reconstructions for each time slice. We finally discuss the implications of our reconstructions on the Cenozoic evolution of continental weatherability and review methodological limitations and potential improvements. Future addition of new data, tools and reconstructions can be accommodated through a dedicated interactive website tool (https://map.paleoenvironment.eu/) that enables users to interactively upload and download data and compare with other models, and generate their own plots.

CN-34E, New York, NY  10013, United States","Previous source apportionment analyses of New York City (NYC) PM2.5 have found that transported pollution can account for up to half of total fine particulate matter (PM2.5) mass. In recent years, several local and federal emissions regulations on both the transportation and energy sector have been introduced, such as the Clean Heavy-Duty Bus and Truck Rule, and policies related to the NYC Clean Heat Program. Since the implementation of these regulations, there have been limited studies on regional transport of particulate air pollution into NYC. This paper aims to quantify long-term changes in local and regional contributions to PM2.5 in NYC. The composition of PM2.5 in NYC over the period 2002–2018 was evaluated using data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) and the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS). Background site data obtained from EPA CSN was used to assess regional transport. Two estimates of transported PM2.5 were calculated, one assuming that transported PM2.5 consists solely of ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate as a lower bound and the other taking into account organic matter (OM) as an upper bound. Using this method, regional transport was estimated to account for 25–46% of total PM2.5 measured in NYC in 2018, down from 46 to 57% in 2002. Secondary PM2.5 output from the Community MultiScale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for the years 2008, 2011, and 2017 was used as an additional upper-bound estimate of regional transport (56%, 35%, and 30%, respectively). In addition to CMAQ model estimates of sulfate, nitrate, and primary emitted PM2.5, land-use regression (LUR) models for sulfur, vanadium, copper, nickel, and PM2.5 measurements at 60 locations across NYC during the winter and summer seasons of 2008–2015 were assessed for changes in local emissions. The results indicate decreased emissions from residual oil burning, traffic, and ships. As a consequence of regional and local changes, PM2.5 in NYC had fallen to approximately 55% of its 2002 levels by 2018. The observed temporal and spatial trends of PM2.5 and its components point to the effect of regulations as well as economic influences on fuel usage, such as the decline of coal in favor of natural gas, in reducing air pollution over the last two decades. While other major PM2.5 constituents have declined, OM is becoming an increasingly dominant component with potential implications for PM2.5 toxicity. Further improvements in NYC air quality could be achieved by targeting sources of ambient OM, such as commercial cooking, traffic, and biomass burning for residential heating. © 2021","Community multiscale air quality model (CMAQ); Land use regression; Long-term trends; New York city; PM2.5; Transported air pollution","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Chemical speciation; Environmental Protection Agency; Land use; Natural gas wells; Nitrates; Oils and fats; Sulfur compounds; Truck transportation; Community multi-scale air qualities; Emissions regulations; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Particulate air pollution; Residential heating; Source apportionment; Temporal and spatial; US Environmental Protection Agency; Particles (particulate matter); ammonium nitrate; ammonium sulfate; copper; nickel; nitrate; organic carbon; sulfate; sulfur; vanadium; air quality; atmospheric pollution; background level; biomass burning; emission inventory; federal system; long-term change; particulate matter; policy implementation; pollutant source; pollutant transport; source apportionment; trend analysis; air pollution; air quality; Article; biomass; chemical composition; controlled study; cooking; environmental aspects and related phenomena; heating; land use; mathematical model; New York; oil burning; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; regression analysis; ship; summer; traffic; winter; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100446049

Adoption of renewable energy at the local level provides opportunities for both distributed energy schemes and domestic microgeneration. However, alternative models of ownership, governance and operation are not well developed. Locally managed energy solutions need to respond to varied end users' requirements to ensure that needs are met, so understanding of different types of end users is a prerequisite to the development of robust business models. This paper presents a review of existing models of decentralised energy generation in which actors such as community groups, energy cooperatives, charities and municipalities participate as owners and coproducers. End users can become involved in the design, development and delivery of energy services in a variety of ways. The focus is active user engagement through coconstruction, coproduction and coprovision of energy services. The following categories will be reviewed with reference to current understandings of both sustainable entrepreneurship and social enterprise: (a) energy service companies (ESCos) as commercial actors that undertake management of these projects, (b) energy cooperatives and (c) municipal energy.

The study is based on conducting a survey of 58 municipalities, studying their AM plans and interviewing municipalities and experts. The findings show that the state of awareness and practice of AM in Ontario has progressed well. Almost all municipalities in Ontario are involved or working on AM systems, and some have reached advanced levels of AM practices. However, several issues persist. Capacity building is at the core of the gaps. There is a need for training professionals on AM concepts and tools. Also, providing guidelines and support for change management in decision-making practices is needed. Smaller municipalities are still facing issues defining the levels of service and linking them to decision making. The next need for AM in Ontario is to link it to climate change strategies and programmes. While some of the municipalities are aware of climate change, they mostly have taken no practical steps regarding adaptation or mitigation. Among key challenges to the success of the Ontario AM strategy is the management of data. There is inconsistency in the specifications for data and limited quality assessment or interoperability guidelines. © 2021 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.",,"Asset management; Decision making; Interoperability; Capacity building; Change management; Decision-making practices; Ontario; Ontario , Canada; Quality assessment; Climate change; assessment method; climate change; conceptual framework; management practice; mitigation; planning practice; strategic approach; Canada; Ontario [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108563863

Radar databases and traffic counts using statistical modeling is an alternative and low-cost approach to produce traffic activities data in each urban street to be used as input to predict vehicular emissions. In this work, we carried out a spatial statistical analysis of local radar data and calculated traffic flow using local radar data combined with different statistical models. Future scenarios about vehicle emission inventory to define public policies were also proposed and analyzed for Belo Horizonte (BH), a Brazilian State capital, with the third-largest metropolitan region in the country. The Normal-Neighborhood Model (i.e., the mixed effect model with random effect in the neighborhood, radar type, and in the regional area) was used to calculate traffic flow in each urban street. Results showed average reductions in CO (4.5%), NMHC (3.0%), NOx (3.0%) and PM2.5 (6.2%) emissions even with an increase in fleet composition (25% in average). The decrease is a result of the implementation of emission control programs by the government, improvements vehicles technologies, and the quality of fuels. Prediction of traffic data from radar databases has proven to be useful for avoiding the high costs of performing origin-destination surveys and traffic modeling using commercial software. Radar databases can provide many potential benefits for research and analysis in environmental and transportation planning. These findings can be incorporated in future investigations to implement public policies on vehicular emission reduction in urban areas and to advance environmental health effects research and human health risk assessment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Mixed-effects model; Mobility solutions; Radar traffic data; Vehicular emission inventory","Air quality; Costs; Database systems; Emission control; Forecasting; Health risks; Public policy; Quality control; Random processes; Risk assessment; Statistical methods; Traffic control; Urban planning; Vehicles; Air pollutant emission; Environmental health; Human health risk assessment; Metropolitan regions; Research and analysis; Spatial statistical analysis; Statistical modeling; Transportation planning; Radar; air quality; atmospheric pollution; database; emission inventory; radar; traffic emission; urban area; air pollution control; article; environmental health; government; health hazard; human; neighborhood; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; public policy; risk assessment; software; telecommunication; urban area; Belo Horizonte; Brazil; Minas Gerais",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096367873

An ever more frequent impact is water resource scarcity due to an increasingly uncertain climate, overexploitation and contamination of resources, as well as lack of infrastructure. Thus, in the water supply sector, the robustness and resilience of systems depends on ‘preparedness’ measures able to establish a link between resources availability, utility costs, water tariffs (or other sources of revenue) and demand. In this study, the interplay regarding the instability of environmental phenomena, water supply and demand management is established to model tariffs in a novel flexible framework. The social, economic and environmental impacts are assessed related to costs, demand, and water resources availability. The São Paulo metropolitan area (Brazil) case-study is assessed, particularly the Cantareira reservoir system. Water supply tariffs and operational adjustments are proposed on an ‘ex-ante time frame’. By providing a rationale to price changes related to resource variability (e.g., scarcity-related) the often reliance on heuristics or simplified decision-making models is avoided. The results achieved highlight that water supply tariffs can be planned according to climatic and hydrologic information, utility costs, water demand, rational and flexible tariff design, to avoid unnecessary constraints on utilities, allowing to defer investment requirements. Benefits accrued to customers are: reductions from 10% to 44% in lower consumption levels (usually connected to high-value uses) and, when in resource scarcity situations, increases in higher consumption blocks from 3% to 106%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Impact assessment; Mixed integer linear programming; Water resources; Water supply system; Water tariffs","Climate change; Costs; Decision making; Economics; Environmental impact; Investments; Reservoirs (water); Water supply; Consumption levels; Decision making models; Environmental phenomena; Flexible framework; Reservoir systems; Water resources availability; Water supply and demands; Water supply sector; Water resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099513195

These gases can be produced by microbial organic carbon decomposition, but little is known about the microbiota and its participation in GHG production and consumption in these environments. In this paper we analyzed the sediment microbiota of three eutrophic tropical urban freshwater reservoirs, in different seasons and evaluated the correlations between microorganisms and the atmospheric CH4 and CO2 flows, also correlating them to limnological variables. Our results showed that deeper water columns promote high methanogen abundance, with predominance of acetoclastic Methanosaeta spp. and hydrogenotrophs Methanoregula spp. and Methanolinea spp. The aerobic methanotrophic community was affected by dissolved total carbon (DTC) and was dominated by Crenothrix spp. However, both relative abundance of the total methanogenic and aerobic methanotrophic communities in sediments were uncoupled to CH4 and CO2 flows. Network based approach showed that fermentative microbiota, including Leptolinea spp. and Longilinea spp., which produces substrates for methanogenesis, influence CH4 flows and was favored by anthropogenic pollution, such as untreated sewage loads. Additionally, less polluted conditions favored probable anaerobic methanotrophs such as Candidatus Bathyarchaeota, Sva0485, NC10, and MBG-D/DHVEG-1, which promoted lower gaseous flows, confirming the importance of sanitation improvement to reduce these flows in tropical urban freshwater reservoirs and their local and global warming impact. © Copyright © 2021 Pierangeli, Domingues, Jesus, Coelho, Hanisch, Pompêo, Saia, Gregoracci and Benassi.","anthropic pollution; greenhouse gases; metagenomics; network analysis; sediment microbiota","carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; cyanic acid; DNA 16S; fertilizer; fresh water; methane; organic carbon; RNA 16S; Actinobacteria; algal bloom; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; Bacteroidetes; Betaproteobacteria; bioremediation; biotransformation; community structure; cyanobacterium; decomposition; Deltaproteobacteria; denitrification; electric conductivity; electrochemical analysis; eutrophication; Gammaproteobacteria; gene sequence; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; limit of detection; marine environment; metagenomics; methanogen; methanogenesis; Methanosaeta; Methanosarcina; Methanosarcinales; methanotroph; microbial community; microbial diversity; microorganism; network analysis; nonhuman; oxidation; oxygen consumption; phytoplankton; pollution; Proteobacteria; sanitation; sea surface temperature; season; sediment; sewage; suspended particulate matter; taxonomy; warming; waste water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103512753

Especially urbanized estuaries localized at the land-sea interface and subjected to microplastic emissions from various sources exhibit a high microplastic discharge potential to adjacent coasts. To adapt effective measures against microplastic emissions a more detailed knowledge on the importance of various microplastic sources is necessary. As field data is scarce we combined different approaches to assess microplastic emissions into the Warnow estuary, southwestern Baltic Sea. Resulting microplastic emission estimates are based on in-situ measurements for the catchment emissions, whereas for the remaining microplastic sources within the estuary literature data on microplastic abundances, and various parameters were used (e.g. demographical, hydrological, geographical). The evaluation of the different emission scenarios revealed that the majority of microplastic is likely discharged by the Warnow river catchment (49.4%) and the separated city stormwater system (43.1%) into the estuary, followed by combined sewer discharges (6.1%). Wastewater treatment plant emissions exhibit the lowest percentage (1.4%). Our approach to estimate anti-fouling paint particles emissions from leisure and commercial shipping activities was associated with highest uncertainties. However, our results indicate the importance of this source highlighting the necessity for future research on the topic. Based on our assumptions for microplastic retention within the estuary, we estimate a potential annual emission of 152–291 billion microplastics (majority within the size class 10–100 µm) to the Baltic Sea. Considering all uncertainties of the different applied approaches, we could assess the importance of various microplastic sources which can be used by authorities to prioritize and establish emission reduction measures. Additionally, the study provides parameters for microplastic emission estimates that can be transferred from our model system to other urbanized Baltic estuaries. © Copyright © 2021 Piehl, Hauk, Robbe, Richter, Kachholz, Schilling, Lenz, Fischer, Fischer, Labrenz and Schernewski.","anti-fouling paint particles; baltic sea; combined sewer overflow; emission estimates; microplastic; sewer system; warnow estuary",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105952635

However, many fundamental details of fluid composition, flow pathways, and reactivity with slab-forming rocks remain to be thoroughly understood. In this study we investigate a multi-kilometer-long, high-pressure metasomatic system preserved in the lawsonite-eclogite metamorphic unit of Alpine Corsica, France. The fluid-mediated process was localized along a major intra-slab interface, which is the contact between basement and cover unit. Two distinct metasomatic stages are identified and discussed. We show that these two stages resulted from the infiltration of deep fluids that were derived from the same source and had the same slab-parallel, updip flow direction. By mass balance analysis, we quantify metasomatic mass changes along this fluid pathway and the time-integrated fluid fluxes responsible for them. In addition, we also assess carbon fluxes associated with these metasomatic events. The magnitude of the estimated fluid fluxes (104–105) indicates that major intra-slab interfaces such as lithological boundaries acted as fluid channels facilitating episodic pulses of fluid flow. We also show that when fluids are channelized, high time-integrated fluid fluxes lead to carbon fluxes several orders of magnitude higher than carbon fluxes generated by local dehydration reactions. Given the size and geologic features of the investigated metasomatic system, we propose that it represents the first reported natural analogue of the so-called high permeability channels predicted by numerical simulations. © 2021.

Requiring participation does not address the underlying problem of power and politics in DRC. The absence of cross-sectoral ministries involvement in REDD+ coupled with their limited impacts on overall policy outcomes demonstrates challenges in ensuring political commitment and national ownership of government in REDD+ in DRC. REDD+ is treated as a project conducted by external actors rather than being embedded in national politics. Effective, efficient and equitable implementation of REDD+ in DRC not only requires inclusive decision-making processes but also sustained political commitment and ownership by government. SUMMARY The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has implemented Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), a process that requires inclusive decision making and accountability. Our research analyses the participation of policy actors in DRC by asking: (1) Who is involved in national REDD+ policy making and what is their interest in participating in core policy events? (2) What level of participation do the different political actors have in core policy events? (3) To what extent do the outcomes, of REDD+ policy events incorporate different preferences of policy actors? We found that although actors' interest in REDD+ policy events have increased over time, their concerns have rarely been taken into account in decision-making processes. The presence of local civil society and indigenous group organizations is weak while international organizations play a major role in the REDD+ arena. REDD+ is treated as a project rather than being embedded in national politics. © 2021 Commonwealth Forestry Association.

Since forests and other systems do not exist in isolation, comprehensive jurisdictional approaches to forest, and land-use governance can help promote sustainability. The ability of jurisdictions to provide evidence of progress toward sustainability is essential for attracting public and private sector investments and maintaining local stakeholder involvement. The Sustainable Landscapes Rating Tool (SLRT) provides a way to assess enabling conditions for jurisdictional sustainability through an evidence-based rating system. We applied this rating tool in 19 states and provinces across six countries (Brazil, Ecuador, Indonesia, Cote d'Ivoire, Mexico, Peru) that are members of the Governors' Climate and Forests Task Force (GCF TF). Each SLRT assessment was completed using publicly available information, interviews with stakeholders in the jurisdiction, and a multi-stakeholder workshop to validate the indicator ratings. This paper explores the effects of stakeholder involvement in the validation process, along with stakeholder perceptions of the tool's usefulness. Our analysis shows that the validation workshops often led to modifications of the indicator ratings, even for indicators originally assessed using publicly available data, highlighting the gap between existence of a policy and its implementation. Also, a more diverse composition of stakeholders at the workshops led to more changes in indicator ratings, which indicates the importance of including different perspectives in compiling and validating the assessments. Overall, most participants agreed that the tool is useful for self-assessment of the jurisdiction and to address coordination gaps. Further, the validation workshops provided a space for discussions across government agencies, civil society organizations (CSOs), producer organizations, indigenous peoples and local community representatives, and researchers about improving policy and governance conditions. Our findings from the analysis of a participatory approach to collecting and validating data can be used to inform future research on environmental governance and sustainability. © Copyright © 2021 Peteru, Duchelle, Stickler, Durbin, Luque and Komalasari.","data validation; environmental governance; jurisdictional approach; participation; stakeholders",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106168816

However, little is known about how this group perceives climate change adaptation, let alone novel interventions. Understanding how practitioners evaluate and weigh the risks of climate change for forests, their levels and patterns of support for different climate-adaptive interventions, and their views about key factors to consider in implementing novel interventions, is essential for understanding how and why different forest jurisdictions are responding to climate change. Using a comparative case study of three Canadian provinces—Alberta, British Columbia, and Québec—we use an online survey to quantify the judgments of forest practitioners (n = 531) as above. We focus on assisted migration (AM), a climate-adaptive reforestation option that involves the intentional movement of tree species to more suitable areas within or outside of natural range based on climatic projections and genomic information. Overall, we find widespread support for AM across all three provinces, with more support for AM within as compared with outside of natural range. The central challenges of implementing AM are primarily perceived to be technical (e.g., climate projections, ecological data, and modeling), with other factors (e.g., economic viability, capacity and willingness of the forest sector, public opinion) being of secondary concern. While perceptions and patterns of support vary by province, our findings suggest that forest practitioners are embracing novel reforestation practices such as AM in response to new realities brought about by climate change. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Assisted migration; Canada; Climate-adaptive reforestation; Cross-jurisdictional comparison; Forest practitioners; Perceptions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098687171

In this work, a linear program optimizing peer-to-peer trading between prosumers of a local energy community with PV systems and battery energy storage systems (BESSs) is developed. The community members are characterized by their individual willingness-to-pay for purchasing PV electricity generated by the community, which reflects their ambitions to reduce marginal emissions from the grid. By adding the willingness-to-pay, prosumers do not prefer their own PV generation over the community's generation. The objective function of the optimization model maximizes the social welfare, which means maximizing the self-consumption of the entire community and optimally allocating generation between prosumers. The method is applied to community set-ups including households and small businesses. Results of an arbitrary case-study show improvements in the overall profitability of the PV systems and BESSs. BESSs further decrease imports from the grid by 15% due to flexibilities. The willingness-to-pay is a promising tool to save marginal emissions from the grid, and the case-study shows annual savings of up to 38%. The results show that the community set-up is able to sustain without any subsidies and it can compete in the electricity market. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy communities; Low-carbon society; Optimization model; Peer-to-peer trading; PV sharing; Willingness-to-pay","Commerce; Electric energy storage; Linear programming; Photovoltaic cells; Annual savings; Battery energy storage systems; Decentralized energy system; Linear programs; Local community; Objective functions; Optimization modeling; Willingness to pay; Peer to peer networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098475178

Unexpectedly, the daily average ozone concentration profile was practically indistinguishable from that of the past two years for the same time span in the calendar. So, we compared surface meteorology data, CO, NOx and O3 hourly concentrations in the MCMA from the ozone season (from March 1 to May 31) for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Also, TROPOMI satellite data on column count of CO, NO2 and HCHO, above a sparse grid of surface points in the MCMA, were also compared for March, April, and May 2020 with those from 2019. Population density used as a background variable to increase understanding of the observed differences allowed us to propose that reductions in NOx were so drastic that ozone formation moved rapidly from a VOC sensitive region towards a NOx sensitive region. The relevance of that unplanned policy provides impacts of contingent short-term emissions control actions during very high pollution episodes. Further analysis of these and other related data concerning VOC speciation and emissions patterns during the coronavirus lockdown may provide guidelines to enhance emission control policies in the post-COVID-19 times to come. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Mexico City metropolitan area; Ozone; Pollutant emissions","Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Population statistics; Emissions control; Mexico City metropolitan areas; Ozone concentration; Ozone formation; Pollution episodes; Population densities; Sensitive regions; Surface points; Air pollution; carbon monoxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; emission control; emission inventory; guideline; metropolitan area; nitrogen oxides; ozone; pollution incidence; air pollution control; air quality; Article; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental impact; human; lockdown; Mexico; oxidation reduction reaction; pandemic; population density; practice guideline; priority journal; public policy; seasonal variation; air pollutant; air pollution; city; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; pandemic; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; Coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Mexico; Ozone; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095885657

A wind tunnel test with a 3.6% difference is applied to verify the obtained numerical results. A multiple-criteria evaluation methodology is presented to select the optimal alternatives for the marshaled forms of high-speed trains, which considers economic, social and environmental factors. The 1318-km (820-mile) Beijing-Shanghai line and a 350-kph high-speed train are employed in this research.

How China reach clean air targets, fulfill its commitment to reduce CO2 emission in the Paris Agreement, and achieve higher targets, such as peak CO2 emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero emission by 2060? A range of sustainability experiments have been conducted to support China's sustainability transition. As the biggest one among them, the Yangtze River Economic Belt runs across the middle of the country from east to west, with an area of 2,050,000 km2 or 21.39% of China's territory, and covers 11 provinces and cities. Although many studies have been conducted relevant to the Belt, few studies have described the research landscape, trends, and relevant topics of interest and gaps. To address these gaps, we review, synthesize, and analyze the latest publications on the Belt and find environmental governance has been the key topic in current publications. Significantly, atmospheric and climate governance may be used as a lens to understand China's environmental governance, human-environmental interactions and trade-offs between environmental protection and socio-economic development in the Belt. Based on this lens, we find that: I. current research on the Belt has started and increased rapidly in the past five years, but our knowledge on it as a cross-boundary, cross-level and cross-sector sustainability experiment is somewhat limited; II. distribution of risk and responsibility across different regions in atmospheric and climate governance has not been well-addressed; III. new carbon emission accounting methods, especially methods based on a consumption-based approach, could be adopted to offer more comprehensive and just understandings about sectoral differences and environmental benefits; IV. influence of topography and meteorology on ambient air quality in the Belt cannot be ignored and should be included by the following research; and V. trade-offs and competing interests among different actors should be recognized and balanced to facilitate sustainable industrial upgrading, innovation and transforming without compromising individual well-being and regional development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution control; Carbon emissions; Environmental governance; Yangtze river economic belt","Air quality; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coal industry; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Industrial research; Regional planning; Topography; Environmental benefits; Environmental governances; Environmental interactions; Global carbon emission; Industrial upgrading; Regional development; Socio-economic development; Sustainability transition; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100159021

Inefficient burning of solid biomass for cooking releases household air pollution that is hazardous to health, while putting pressure on forest resources. This paper provides an overview of the household-cooking-energy transition in Nepal to date. Despite numerous efforts by the government and other actors to speed this transition, energy data spanning the years 2000-18 reveal that ∼69% of households nationwide still rely on solid fuels for cooking today. The proportion of solid-fuel users is especially high in rural regions, reaching >80%. Moreover, if the current rate of progress is not accelerated, the use of solid fuels will remain high even in 2030, preventing the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7. Cooking-fuel choices are heavily constrained by accessibility, demographic and socio-economic factors. Thus, this paper recommends that evidence-based and integrated policies and strategies be urgently deployed to foster a more effective and rapid transition towards clean energy, which is critical to achieving SDG 7. © 2020 The Author(s).","clean energy; household; rural; SDG; solid fuel; urban","Biohazards; Climate mitigations; Cooking energies; Cooking fuels; Evidence-based; Forest resources; Rapid transitions; Rural regions; Socio-economic factor; Fuels",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105013942

Irrigation is a common means of mitigating damage, but draws on limited water resources, is costly, and energy intensive. Here we examined the projected impact of climate change on the incidence of frost temperatures during the coldest winters, defined by the 98th percentile of cool season (November–April) frost hours, under both early- and mid-21st century time periods, as compared to contemporary conditions, across a range of threshold temperatures. We focused on three high-value perennial orchard crops – almonds, avocados, and oranges – to assess the effects of climate change on the incidence of temperatures below crop-specific threshold temperatures and for crop-specific critical development phases, and what these temporal changes in frost exposure may mean for the water and energy requirements for mitigating damages. Across time periods and temperature thresholds, frost exposure declines in California's agricultural regions, with an average of reduction in frost exposure of 63% by the mid-21st century. The majority of almond and orange acreage saw 50–75% reductions in frost exposure by mid-century, while avocado acreage experienced >75% fewer frost hours. This yielded attendant reductions in water use and energy costs, and growers in the highest acreage counties may save more than 50,000 acre feet of water and $4.2 million in electricity costs for water pumping per year, collectively. Although climate change is projected to increase growing season crop water demands, pest pressures, and have an overall net-negative impact on agriculture, the potential reduction in frost exposure and the accompanying water and energy costs to mitigate frost damages may allow growers to reprioritize some of their long-term decisions around farm management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Almonds; Avocados; Irrigation; Oranges","Agricultural robots; Citrus fruits; Cost reduction; Crops; Cultivation; Frost effects; Orchards; Water resources; Development phasis; Frost temperature; Impact on agriculture; Long-term decisions; Potential reduction; Temperature thresholds; Threshold temperatures; Water and energies; Climate change; water; agricultural application; climate change; climate effect; crop production; environmental factor; frost; irrigation; orchard; temperature effect; almond; Article; avocado; California; climate change; controlled study; crop; electricity; energy cost; environmental exposure; freezing; frost; incidence; nonhuman; orange (fruit); orchard; priority journal; seasonal variation; temperature; water supply; winter; California; United States; Citrus sinensis; Persea americana; Prunus dulcis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098164476

Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is thought to be a main causative agent, but limited surveillance of EV-D68 in the United States has hampered the ability to assess their causal relationship. Using surveillance data from the BioFire Syndromic Trends epidemiology network in the United States from January 2014 to September 2019, we characterized the epidemiological dynamics of EV-D68 and found latitudinal gradient in the mean timing of EV-D68 cases, which are likely climate driven. We also demonstrated a strong spatiotemporal association of EV-D68 with AFM. Mathematical modeling suggested that the recent dominant biennial cycles of EV-D68 dynamics may not be stable. Nonetheless, we predicted that a major EV-D68 outbreak, and hence an AFM outbreak, would have still been possible in 2020 under normal epidemiological conditions. Nonpharmaceutical intervention efforts due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are likely to have reduced the sizes of EV-D68 and AFM outbreaks in 2020, illustrating the broader epidemiological impact of the pandemic. © 2021 The Authors.",,"acute flaccid myelitis; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; Enterovirus D68; epidemic; epidemiological surveillance; geographic distribution; human; immunity; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; myelitis; nonhuman; pandemic; polymerase chain reaction; population size; prediction; sensitivity and specificity; United States; biological model; central nervous system infection; disease predisposition; Enterovirus D; epidemiological monitoring; myelitis; neuromuscular disease; physiology; spatiotemporal analysis; virology; Central Nervous System Viral Diseases; Disease Susceptibility; Enterovirus D, Human; Epidemiological Monitoring; Humans; Models, Biological; Myelitis; Neuromuscular Diseases; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102614639

This study assesses the emission characteristics of cities in the Northern Hemisphere during two winter seasons from December 2018 to March 2020 using a combination of CO2 observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) along with CO and NO2 observations from the Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (S-5P TROPOMI). We calculate the estimates of urban enhancement concentrations of CO2, CO, and NO2 from anthropogenic emissions in cities. Moreover, using ratios of CO/CO2 and NO2/CO2 according to each city, we analyze the relationship between CO2 and air pollutants and find that cities show distinct emission patterns according to where they are located in different regions of the world. Our analysis shows that a positive relationship exists in the comparisons of CO/CO2 and NO2/CO2 ratios to city population and GDP. However, when cities in the Northern Hemisphere are divided into “developed” and “developing” regions, a difference in pattern is found where most developed cities show a smaller increase of both CO/CO2 and NO2/CO2 ratios with the increase of GDP, while developing cities show a larger increase of ratios per increase of GDP. Especially, developing cities facing rapid economic development like Mumbai and Tianjin show high emission ratios that almost match that of developed cities. The higher incline of increase in emission ratios in developing cities can be attributed to the low combustion efficiency of fossil fuels along with less stringent pollution control measures. This implies that pollution control measures are crucial for effective management of air quality degradation with economic advancement within these developing cities. The analysis also highlights the importance of urban geological features in cities such as that of Tehran and Milan which can trap air pollution under appropriate meteorological conditions. Despite the short period of analysis, our study demonstrates that satellite observations of CO2 and air pollutants together can provide clues about factors controlling the co-emission of air pollutants and carbon in cities and suggests that the application of the proposed methods with longer periods of observation will support coupled air quality and climate mitigation strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollutants; Cities; CO2; Emission characteristics; OCO-2; TROPOMI","Air pollution control; Air quality; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Orbits; Anthropogenic activity; Anthropogenic emissions; Combustion efficiencies; Emission characteristics; Meteorological condition; Monitoring instruments; Satellite observations; Spaceborne observations; Quality control; air quality; anthropogenic effect; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; economic development; emission; nitrogen dioxide; Northern Hemisphere; observational method; OCO; pollution control; Sentinel; China; India; Iran; Maharashtra; Milan [Milano]; Mumbai; Tehran [Iran]; Tianjin; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098047634

Syntrophic-methanogenic associations have been viewed as a key regulator of methane generation in paddy fields. However, the effects of rice phenology on the diversity and abundance of syntrophic and methanogenic communities remain largely unknown. This study investigated the changes in syntrophic-methanogenic associations at different rice growth by comparing the 16S RNA sequences of total (DNA-based) and active (RNA-based) microbial communities in rhizosphere and bulk soils. Moreover, the concentrations of specific syntrophs and methanogens were quantified using qPCR assay. Statistical significant differences in the alpha and beta diversities were observed between DNA-based and RNA-based syntrophic communities. The relative abundance of syntrophs in rhizosphere soil was significantly higher at RNA level compared to that at DNA level, indicating that syntrophs display considerably high specific activities. Syntrophic bacteria accounted for 6.23–6.81% of the active communities in rhizosphere soil and 6.12–6.71% in bulk soil. Besides, the quantities of methanogens increased over the entire period of rice growth, and peaked at flowering stage. Such changing pattern was consistent with the total number of short-chain fatty acids-degrading syntrophs at flowering stage, suggesting that rice phenology can affect both syntrophic and methanogenic activities. Furthermore, not only environmental factors (e.g., pH and SOC), but also organic acids (e.g., citrate and succinate), shaped the composition and abundance of syntrophic and methanogenic communities in paddy soils. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","16S rRNA (gene) sequencing; Bulk soil; Phenological stages; qPCR; Rhizosphere soil; Syntrophic-methanogenic associations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099232242

Local governments are now looking for an index to encourage building owners to increase green areas, including green roofs and green walls. Currently, several building green value (BGV) indices can be used to assess building greenness, including the green coverage ratio (GCR), biotope area factor (BAF), green factor (GF), and green plot ratio (GnPR). However, these indices use different sub-indexes and weights, such that the values they output vary significantly. To analyze their applicability, this study compares output values of the BGV indices and estimated GHG emission reductions for three typical buildings under three conditions: no green roof or green wall; a green roof; and a green roof and green walls. The GCR does not include green walls and thus cannot reflect reductions in GHG emissions from green walls. The BAF values are highly correlated to associated GHG emission reductions. The trend of GF values vs. associated GHG emission reductions is less consistent than that using the BAF method because the weights of GF are not consistent with associated thermal resistance improvements. The correlation between GnPR values and associated GHG emission reductions is the strongest among all BGV indices because the ratio of leaf area indexes for green roofs to that of green walls is close to the ratio of U-value reductions from green roofs and green walls. © 2020 The Author(s)","Building green value; Green roof; Green wall; Greenhouse gas emission reduction","Emission control; Gas emissions; Roofs; Walls (structural partitions); Adverse environmental impacts; Building owners; Coverage ratio; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Highly-correlated; Impervious surface; Leaf Area Index; Local government; Greenhouse gases; building; comparative study; correlation; emission control; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; greenspace; local government; urban area; wall",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097777745

In the degraded forests, thinning has a positive effect on the provision of ecosystem services such as timber and bioenergy production, climate change mitigation, and recreational attractiveness. • Context: The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment highlights the importance of the ecosystem services for human well-being and for maintaining conditions for life on Earth. Silvicultural treatments can improve the provision of ecosystem services to increase local communities’ well-being. • Aims: The aim of this study is to understand the effects of two-forest restoration practices (selective thinning and thinning from below) on three ecosystem services (wood production, climate change mitigation, and recreational opportunities) in an Italian case study. • Methods: A multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was performed to compare the effects of three forest restoration scenarios (baseline, selective thinning, thinning from below) on ecosystem services. Wood production was estimated considering the local market prices and the wood volumes harvested, while climate change mitigation was quantified through the C-stock and C-sequestration changes in carbon pools due to the silvicultural treatments. The recreational activities were assessed through a questionnaire survey. A sample of 200 visitors was interviewed face-to-face to estimate the impact of thinning on recreational activities. • Results: The results of the MCDA show that the selective thinning scenario is the optimal forest restoration practice to increase the recreational attractiveness and the wood production in the study area. • Conclusion: The results concerning the effects of the silvicultural treatments on ecosystem services supply are an important tool to support decision makers. © 2021, INRAE and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Biophysical assessment; Carbon sequestration; Carbon stock; Economic evaluation; Multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); Recreational activities","climate change; decision analysis; ecosystem service; forest ecosystem; forest management; multicriteria analysis; restoration ecology; thinning; timber; woody plant; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100099395

There is, however, no framework to assess the quality of these data, models, and approaches that takes into account the issues that arise when this information is produced. An evaluation of the quality of regional climate information is a fundamental requirement for its appropriate application in societal decision-making. Here, an analytical framework is constructed for the quality assessment of science-based statements and estimates about future climate. This framework targets statements that project local and regional climate at decadal and longer time scales. After identifying the main issues with evaluating and presenting regional climate information, it is argued that it is helpful to consider the quality of statements about future climate in terms of 1) the type of evidence and 2) the relationship between the evidence and the statement. This distinction not only provides a more targeted framework for quality, but also shows how certain evidential standards can change as a function of the statement under consideration. The key dimensions to assess regional climate information quality are diversity, completeness, theory, adequacy for purpose, and transparency. This framework is exemplified using two research papers that provide regional climate information and the implications of the framework are explored. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.","Adaptation; Climate models; General circulation models; Probability forecasts/ models/distribution; Regional effects; Social science","Decision making; Formal logic; Changing climate; Future climate; Key dimensions; Local climate; Quality assessment; Regional climate; Research papers; Time-scales; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104241125

Recent studies have reported the impact of climate change on plant biodiversity. Thus, understanding the distribution pattern of the endemic legume species of the GC region under current and future climate scenarios are imperative for long-term conservation management plans. We used 762 occurrence data of the 237 endemic legume species to elucidate the habitat suitability and impact of climate change on the species. Analyses used an ecological niche modeling ensemble method to map the current and future (2050–2070) distribution patterns of the endemic legumes under the RCP 4.5 scenario. Further, we generated the ensemble of four different species distribution modeling methods to predict areas where climatically suitable regions is lost or gained under future climate change. The model predicted the current suitable areas for endemic legumes to be Southern Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of Congo (COG), and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Our findings indicate precipitation of Warmest Quarter and seasonality as the significant climatic variables affecting the habitat suitability of endemic legumes in the GC regions. Results showed areas such as the coastal region of Cote d' Ivoire, southwest province of Cameroon, Central African Republic, COG (Ngounnie), central DRC, and southern Nigeria will experience >40% loss of climatically suitable areas by 2050. Also, species such as Baphia maxima, and Psophocarpus scandens were projected to experience a 70% reduction in their climatically suitable areas under future climate scenarios. Our study concludes that the projected distribution of the endemic legume species in the GC region will consequently decline in the future due to the gross effect of climate change. The anticipated changes in the distribution patterns of the endemic legumes could have significant ecological and socio‐economic significance. Therefore, we recommend improved conservation to protect the endemic legume species and its associated habitats in GC forest. © 2020 The Author(s)","Climate change; Guineo-Congolian; Leguminosae; SDM; Spatial distribution","Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Population distribution; Central African Republic; Democratic Republic of Congo; Distribution patterns; Ecological niche modeling; Future climate scenarios; Habitat suitability; Long-term conservation; Species distribution modeling; Climate change; biodiversity; climate effect; endemic species; forest ecosystem; future prospect; habitat structure; legume; population decline; socioeconomic status; Cameroon; Cote dIvoire; Gabon; Baphia; Fabaceae; Psophocarpus scandens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098724677

The model of the ""nature-population-production""system and the very interaction of the system are presented. Environmental problems, problems of ecology of production, and consumption of natural resources lead to an increase in the rate of growth of production, which, in turn, leads to an increase in demand for resources, and as a consequence, to their irrational use, and then to massive emissions into the environment as waste. In order to improve the environmental situation in the country, some areas for improving the greening of the production sector are presented, which increase the efficiency of consumption and use of natural resources, while reducing environmental pollution by emissions, effluents, and waste. The main indicators that determine the level of environmental management are presented - indicators of resource intensity, an indicator of the degree of restoration of natural resources, and indicators of saving primary natural resources. All three indicators are part of the specific consumption of natural resources and can be used at the enterprise to control the consumption of natural resources, as well as in order to minimize waste through the use of secondary resources and low-waste technologies. The established ways of improving the greening of the production sector are able to improve the ecological situation in the regions of the country and establish the relationship between man, nature and the production sector. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Effluents; Energy conservation; Energy management; Environmental management; Ecological situation; Environmental pollutions; Environmental problems; Environmental safety; Production sector; Resource intensity; Secondary resources; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103446254

The co-incineration of refuse derived fuel (RDF) has shown several economic and environmental advantages. The objective of this research is to assess the impact of RDF recovery on leachate quality using leachate tests and calculation of greenhouse gases (GHG) reduction in the kilns of a cement plant. The qualitative results of the eluate show that there is an impact on leachate quality depending on the type of waste. The values of the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), electrical conductivity and pH of the leachate from the raw waste after 120 hours of leaching are 29.33 gO2/kg DM, 14.00 g O2/kg DM, 4.27 ms/cm and 7.57. On the other hand, the values of the same quality parameters of the eluate generated by the waste without RDF are 19.33 g O2/kg DM, 20.67 g O2/kg DM, 2.77 ms/cm and 7.13; respectively. The calculation of GHG reduction shows that the substitution of 83,000 tonnes per year of petroleum coke by 15% of RDF (25,493 tonnes per year) can reduces 28,970 tCO2 eq. © 2021 Chulalognkorn University.

National fleet composition data, local EURO distributions, and traffic compositions were used to project vehicle fleet compositions for different roads in each borough. A large dataset of real‐world emission factors including over 90,000 remote‐sensing measurements, obtained from remote sensing campaigns in five UK cities, was used to parameterize the emission profiles of the studied scenarios. Results show that adoption of the fleet electrification approach would have the highest emission reduction potential on urban roads in WM boroughs. It would result in maximum reductions ranging from 35.0 to 37.9%, 44.3 to 48.3%, and 46.9 to 50.3% for NOx, PM, and CO2, respectively. In comparison, the EURO 6 replacement fleet scenario would lead to reductions ranging from 10.0 to 10.4%, 4.0 to 4.2%, and 6.0 to 6.4% for NOx, PM, and CO2, respectively. The studied mitigation scenarios have higher efficacies on motorways compared to rural and urban roads because of the differences in traffic fleet composition.

In this research work, the boiler of a combined-cycle power plant is controlled using three control strategies, which are designed and compared, for the variables drum water level (L) and superheated steam pressure (ps). A conventional PI controller is designed using the Lambda-tuning technique to obtain the optimal controller's gains. In addition, a fuzzy logic-based controller that considers the error and the error's rate-of-change is applied. Finally, a model predictive control (MPC) is applied, which objective function is to minimize the steady state error and the variation of the control actions, thus the fuel consumption is reduced. The controllers' performance is compared by analyzing maximum overshoot, settling time, steady-state error, and mainly fossil fuel consumption, which influences the operating cost. The results show a proper performance of the three control techniques. However, MPC control achieves a higher reduction of fuel consumption. © 2021 IEEE.","Combined-cycle power plant; Fuzzy controller; Model predictive control (MPC); Proportional-integral controller (PI)","Automation; Boiler control; Boilers; Combined cycle power plants; Controllers; Errors; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuzzy logic; Gas emissions; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Water levels; Control strategies; Control techniques; Conventional-PI controller; Drum water levels; Fuzzy logic based controller; Objective functions; Optimal controller; Steady state errors; Steam power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114201262

This study aimed at investigating the probabilistic affinity index between environmental health degradation (EHD) and AA globally. In this research, a global scientometric assessment of 607 academic research articles between 1991 and 2018 on EHD and other factors such as human and natural activities is presented in this study to characterise the intellectual dynamics by visualising and identifying the strength, evolution of the co-citation network, collaboration network and trends. An in-depth analysis of EHD and AA research was conducted to better understand the global trends and directions that have emerged over the past 28 years in this field. The results reveal that the number of publication in the field of EHD has increased significantly and it has become noticeably an interdisciplinary research in recent years. It further revealed that most of the authors and their affiliated institutions in this research area are from USA, China, Brazil, UK, Australia, Canada, France, India, Italy and Germany. Findings from the study show that the published research in the field has increased in number, tending mostly towards an interdisciplinary research subject. The most pressing link between EHD and human activities, as represented in existing literature, includes the consequences of EHD for biodiversity and ecosystems sustainability, and emission reductions in the environmental sector. This study reveals that the probabilistic similarity measures of EHD and AA are strongly correlated with each other.

Gold is concentrated at several stratigraphic levels; the largest deposit in Russia, Sukhoi Log, and its counterpart, Golets Vysochaishii, are confined to terrigenous deposits of the Riphean Khomolkho Formation. The characteristic components of the Khomolkho Formation are lenticular interlayers and layered disseminations of pyrrhotite and pyrite with clearly pronounced lithological–stratigraphic control of their distribution. The Golets Vysochaishii deposit is confined to the largest thickening of sulfide layers in carbonaceous chlorite–quartz–sericite phyllite schists of the lower part of the Khomolkho Formation. The sulfide content in the ore-bearing sequence is 5 wt %; native gold is enclosed in sulfide layers. According to the data of previous researchers, based on the distribution patterns of sulfur isotopes, sulfide ore-bearing deposits of the deposit were formed by hydrothermal–sedimentary pathways. The primary gold content of sulfide sediments is assumed in analogy with the neighboring Sukhoi Log and Verna deposits. The distribution of Au, As, Ag, and carbonaceous matter in the sulfide-bearing strata of the Golets Vysochaishii deposit is substratal, reflecting their accumulation during sedimentation. The rocks were metamorphically altered under the greenschist facies conditions, during which they recrystallized and sulfides and gold were redistributed with the rocks retaining their layered structure. There are no significant differences in the contents of the rock-forming components between the ore deposit and host rocks, which indicates the absence of metasomatic alteration in rocks associated with ore formation. Metamorphic processes at the deposits of the Khomolkho Formation were accompanied by replacement of ilmenite by rutile and pyrrhotite by pyrite, as well as a change in the composition of chlorites and carbonates with increasing iron content; these processes were regulated by the fugacity of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Metamorphic alteration, based fluid inclusion study data, took place in the temperature range 230–510°C with the participation of oxidized carbon dioxide–aqueous fluids (CO2/CH4 up to 17) with a salinity of 7–12 wt % equiv.

The calcium particle film application has been used to minimize the effects of adverse climate conditions on plants, with the potential to increase crop yield. This study aimed to evaluate calcium oxide particle films (CaO, particle size ≤ 2 µm, reflectance > 90%) on photoprotection and productivity of sweet potato crops in the Brazilian Northeast region. Three concentrations of CaO (5, 10, and 15%) and water (control) were applied. CaO films were daily monitored through a colorimeter and reapplied whenever the brightness was reduced to maintain their reflectance status. In the pre-harvest period, the chlorophyll content (a and b), leaf temperature, and chlorophyll a fluorescence was measured. At 10 and 15%, CaO films seem to promote an effect similar to an artificial shading on the sweet potato crop, increasing the content of chlorophylls a, b, and total, reducing the chlorophyll a/b ratio and leaf temperature. Both concentrations also promoted an efficient control of the energy absorption and electron transport flux into photosystems and electron transport chains. As a result of CaO film application, the productivity of sweet potato increased by 2%, 62%, and 43% to CaO 5, 10, and 15%. Therefore, CaO particle films at 10 or 15% seems to promote some photoprotection on sweet potato crops, leading to a yield increase. Thus, this tool may improve sweet potato cultivation in regions with adverse weather conditions. © 2020, Brazilian Society of Plant Physiology.","Calcium oxide; Chlorophyll a fluorescence; Ipomoea batatas; JIP test",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096001903

Considering the Atlantic influence, air temperature observations from Lisbon’s mesoscale network are used to investigate the interactions between background weather and the urban thermal signal (UTS) in summer. Days are classified according to the prevailing regional wind direction, and hourly UTS is compared between HW and non-HW conditions. Northern-wind days predominate, revealing greater maximum air temperatures (up to 40 °C) and greater thermal amplitudes (approximately 10 °C), and account for 37 out of 49 HW days; southern-wind days have milder temperatures, and no HWs occur. Results show that the wind direction groups are significantly different. While southern-wind days have minor UTS variations, northern-wind days have a consistent UTS daily cycle: a diurnal urban cooling island (UCI) (often lower than -1.0 °C), a late afternoon peak urban heat island (UHI) (occasionally surpassing 4.0 °C), and a stable nocturnal UHI (1.5 °C median intensity). UHI/UCI intensities are not significantly different between HW and non-HW conditions, although the synoptic influence is noted. Results indicate that, in Lisbon, the UHI intensity does not increase during HW events, although it is significantly affected by wind. As such, local climate change adaptation strategies must be based on scenarios that account for the synergies between potential changes in regional air temperature and wind. © 2021 by the authors.","Heatwaves; Lisbon; Local climate adaptation; Mediterranean cities; Urban climate; Urban heat island; Urban thermal signal","Climate change; Mediterranean cities; Mesoscale networks; Potential change; Thermal amplitude; Thermal signals; Urban cooling islands; Urban heat island; Wind directions; Atmospheric temperature; adaptive management; air temperature; climate change; heat island; heat wave; summer; urban area; wind direction; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102658951

Hence, we conducted a two-year field scale study quantifying effects of biochar (12 t ha−1), biochar (12 t ha−1) and N fertilizer (90 kg N ha−1), N fertilizer (90 kg N ha−1) alone and control (no amendment) on Corg, Corg pools, lability index (LI) and CO2 emissions of a humid tropical alfisol under rainfed rice cultivation. Results clearly demonstrate that biochar amendment combined with N fertilizer significantly increased Corg, particulate organic carbon, and particulate organic carbon to organic carbon proportion. Furthermore, this combination decreased dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon to organic carbon proportion, easily oxidizable carbon, easily oxidizable carbon to organic carbon proportion, microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass carbon to organic carbon proportion, LI, and CO2 emission when compared to other treatments. Our findings established relationship between labile Corg pools and CO2 emission. Overall, our study suggest that application of biochar and N fertilizer addition can decrease CO2 emission from SSA croplands under rainfed rice cultivation, increase essential labile Corg pools, protect labile Corg pools sensitive to losses and sequester Corg with positive implication for global change mitigation and soil quality improvement. © 2020 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water and Power Press","Environment; Global change; Greenhouse gas; Rainfed croplands; Sub-saharan Africa",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094564157

Bacteria have been shown to play key role in biogeochemical cycling and degradation of pollutants from petroleum sources. The present study investigated the degradation efficiency of a bacterial consortia recovered from heavily inundated site in Bie-Ama community, having total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) concentration of 22,000 mg/kg, a value higher than Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR)’s 1000 mg/kg intervention limit. Soil samples were collected at 15 cm depth with soil auger while microbial isolation was done using enrichment and vapor phase transfer methods in Bushnell Haas medium. Colorimetric method using 2, 6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) redox indicator was employed to determine biodegradation potentials of isolates. Bacterial isolates identified using 16S rRNA gene by Sanger sequencing were further screened for biosurfactant production and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation abilities. A consortium for efficient biodegradation of crude oil was constituted from individual isolates that totally decolorized DCPIP. Total culturable heterotrophic and hydrocarbon utilizing bacterial counts were 2.07 × 106 and 1.71 × 106 CFU/g soil respectively. Bacterial strains from the genera Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter produced biosurfactants while all strains utilized aromatics (benzene and naphthalene). A combination of Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Lysinibacillus and Enterobacter was the most efficient crude oil degrading consortium with significant mean difference (p = 0.05) as evidenced by GC-analysis confirming a more than 25% reduction in total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration of 1% crude oil within 48 h. Conclusively, the extant indigenous bacterial community in the impacted site has the natural capability to degrade hydrocarbons and could be further enhanced through biostimulation for in situ remediation. © 2020","Bacteria consortia; Bioremediation; Biostimulation; Total petroleum hydrocarbons",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098730654

Also, the extent to which farmers are integrated into this organizational collaboration network can influence their access to climate information. This paper aims to examine how organizational collaborations in the process of climate information generation and dissemination acts as either barriers or enablers of farmers’ access to and use of climate information in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: This study used key informant interview and questionnaire survey to interview the organizations in the climate change and agriculture sectors. Using network analysis as an analytical framework, the authors estimated the networks’ core-periphery, density, reciprocity and degree centrality. Findings: The authors observed that communication of climate information to farmers is mostly influenced by the collaborations between governmental organizations and nongovernmental organizations. Nevertheless, information flow and exchange through organizational collaboration network is having limited effect on improving farmers’ knowledge about climate risks, impacts and available risk response options. This is mostly because the feedback flow of information from farmers to national level organizations has not been effective in addressing localized climate/agro challenges. Originality/value: This paper provides a critical overview of key issues in influencing the relevancy and usefulness of climate information in the Ghanaian agriculture sector. Insights gained and recommendations made are essential for deploying effective climate services in Ghana and can be relevant for many African countries because of similar socioeconomic contexts. © 2020, Chidiebere Ofoegbu and Mark New.","Adaptation; Climate change; Farmers; Knowledge networks; Livelihood; Networks","climate change; communication network; farmers attitude; farmers knowledge; nature-society relations; network analysis; nongovernmental organization; questionnaire survey; reciprocity; risk assessment; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100166783

The results revealed that the Karoo Basin deepens to a depth of about 4600 m in the south-western region, near the front of the Cape Fold Belt. Also, the model gives indication that the Karoo dolerite intrusions are interconnected at depth and are mostly concentrated at the centre of the basin. The isochore thickness maps show that the Beaufort Group is the thickest group in the Karoo Supergroup, with a maximum thickness of about 6046±277 m, followed by the Ecca and Dwyka Groups with thicknesses of around 3720±183 m and765±69 m, respectively. The maximum depositional surface (elevation) for the Dwyka, Ecca and Beaufort sediments are approximately 1696 m, 1247 m and 1491 m, respectively, whereas the maximum depth below sea level are around 3668 m, 3209 m and 480 m, respectively. Furthermore, the isochore thickness maps indicate that the Ecca Group, which is the main target for hydrocarbon exploration in the Karoo, thickens toward the south, away from the centre of the basin and reaches thickness of greater than 3680 m. The correlation of the depositional surfaces with the isochore thickness maps revealed that the sediments in structural high areas were subsided, eroded and deposited in structural low areas. Consequently, the structural low areas are characterised by thick sediments cover and vice versa. © 2021 The Author(s)Gravity modelling; Isochore thickness; Depositional surface; Karoo Basin. © 2021 The Author(s)","Depositional surface; Gravity modelling; Isochore thickness; Karoo basin",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102360042

The technologies aim, inter alia, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase the use of renewable energy sources and take a step forward to the production of hydrogen as an alternative energy source in numerous applications. In view of the estimated demand for heat, electricity and hydrogen in the Savinja-Šalek region, Slovenia, the technologies to meet such demand are proposed in this article from a technical perspective. An energy and economic analysis of the operation of the Thermal Power Plant (TPP) will be done. The TPP is operating in a variable operating regime. The possibility of stationary operation of the power plant will be analysed, the surplus of produced electricity will be used for the hydrogen production. The process is based on the Rankine-Clausius cycle (RC) with dual superheating using water or steam as the working media. The idea in this article, is to generate in the above mentioned facility as much hydrogen, heat, cold and electricity as needed by the Savinja-Šalek region in industry, transport, etc. Thus, the power plant could operate optimally, constantly at 100% of power, which would allow simultaneous production of electricity, heat and hydrogen.

In a laboratory study using intact cores of peat soil from eight different sites in Sweden, factors controlling the emission of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) were examined. Soil properties, and the abundance of the total microbial community (16S rRNA gene abundance), and genes encoding for functions controlling N2O emissions (bacterial and archaeal amoA, nirS, nirK, nosZI, and nosZII) were analyzed and compared against measured greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions were measured at different drainage levels, i.e., higher soil water suction values, since drainage is an important factor controlling greenhouse gas emissions from peat soils. The results showed that N2O and CH4 emissions were generally low, except for N2O emissions at near water-saturated conditions, for which three soils displayed high values and large variations in fluxes. Relationships between N2O emissions and soil properties were mainly linked to soil pH, with higher emissions at lower pH.

Nowadays, climate change and the increase in greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions have led to measures such as determining CO2 taxes that make renewable-based energy systems more profitable. Southern Iran, with its arid climate, has a high potential for the integration of solar energy into the existing energy system in order to maximize its share on the energy system; therefore, in this research, five scenarios were defined and applied to model the energy system for 2025 and 2030. Each scenario was assumed to maximize the solar energy share for the supply of heating, cooling, and electricity demand, such as photovoltaics (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP). The bottom up EnergyPLAN was applied to model the energy system and scenario computations. The results of the scenarios were compared based on annual CO2 emissions, costs, total primary energy supply, and critical excess electricity production. Based on the results, all scenarios were able to reduce the CO2 emissions; however, the PV based scenario had the least costs and utilized 1954 MW of PV power plant to supply the demand with 599 M€/year costs. Natural gas was largest energy resource of the system; due to the 17% reduction in the total primary energy supply compared to BAU and Best Scenario (S5) for 2030, about 20 TWh/year of the natural gas was saved and was ready for export. According to the Paris Agreement, the permissible amount of CO2 emissions for this province in 2030 is about 9.76 Mt, which is 5.59 Mt in Best Scenario (S5). Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was run for the costs of the business as usual and PV based scenarios under different natural gas prices and emissions tax rates from 0.025 to 1.92 €/Gj and 4 to 20 €/kg of CO2, respectively. According to the findings, when the natural gas price increased to 0.521 €/Gj, the renewable-based plans became feasible, and increasing the CO2 tax caused the cost differences to rise. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CSP; Energy systems modeling; EnergyPLAN; PV; Renewable energy; Support vector machine","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Costs; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Natural gasoline plants; Petroleum deposits; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Taxation; Concentrated solar power; Electricity demands; Electricity production; Fossil fuel resources; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Heating and cooling; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Cost benefit analysis; alternative energy; arid environment; climate change; cooling; electricity; electricity supply; energy planning; energy resource; fossil fuel; heating; hydrocarbon resource; power plant; solar power; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097635496

These samples were collected around a chemical industrial park containing several chlorinated paraffin (CP) production plants, in a nearby city (Zhengzhou), and along a transect between the industrial park and city. Theoretical air concentrations were back-calculated from concentrations in bark using a predictive equation for estimating equilibrium bark-air partition coefficients. We developed this equation from a series of previously published Kbark-air measurements. Comparison of the normalized concentration profiles along south to north transects showed that wind played only a minor role in CP concentrations and profiles in the region. Three distinct source profiles were found in the complex source region. A fingerprint analysis technique was used to quantify the contribution of each source to the CP burden at various locations along the transect. We found that CP profiles at sites up to 6 km from the industrial park were strongly influenced by CP plant emissions, whereas the sites located in the rural zone and rural-urban interface were influenced by a mixture of CP plant emissions and the neighboring city. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric transport; Bark-air partitioning; Fingerprint analysis; Source apportionment; Tree bark","Industrial emissions; Paraffins; Transport properties; Chemical industrial park; Chlorinated paraffins; Concentration profiles; Fingerprint analysis; Medium-chain chlorinated paraffins; Partition coefficient; Predictive equations; Short-chain chlorinated paraffins; Urban growth; bark; chemical pollutant; comparative study; concentration (composition); equation; equilibrium; urban pollution; article; atmospheric transport; bark; chlorination; quantitative analysis; China; culture medium; environmental monitoring; industry; China; Henan; Zhengzhou; chlorinated hydrocarbon; paraffin; China; Culture Media; Environmental Monitoring; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Industry; Paraffin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094600995

At present, China needs to understand its own carbon neutrality status and then scientifically plan a path to achieve carbon neutrality. In order to evaluate the carbon neutrality capacity of China’s provinces, this paper firstly constructs an evaluation indicator system, which includes 20 indicators at six levels. Then, a combination of subjective and objective weighting methods, as well as an improved technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) model, are used to calculate evaluation results. On this basis, the reasons for their different carbon neutrality capacities are analyzed. The results show that the use of renewable energy, maintaining ecological environmental quality, and low‐carbon technology are important factors affecting China’s carbon neutrality capacity, and according to the evaluation results, China’s provinces are divided into three categories. Finally, corresponding suggestions for speeding up the pace of carbon neutrality are put forward. © 2021 by the authors.

To evaluate the effects of coated nitrate fertilizer application on N2O emissions from soils, N2O fluxes were measured in a carrot field from 2016 to 2017. Ammonium sulfate (AS), coated urea (CU; only in 2017), coated calcium nitrate (CC), and no-nitrogen (NN) fertilizers were investigated. No recognizable increase in N2O flux was observed for about 45 days after fertilization in all the plots in 2016. In 2017, significant simultaneous increases in N2O and nitric oxide fluxes (up to 142 and 436 µg N m−2 h−1, respectively) were found only in the AS plots in spring, indicating enhancement of N2O production via nitrification. After mid-July, the N2O fluxes increased temporarily with the increase in soil water content after rainfall in all the plots including the NN plots in 2016 (up to 183–342 µg N m−2 h−1) and 2017 (up to 56–86 µg N m−2 h−1), indicating N2O production mainly via denitrification. Cumulative N2O emissions did not differ significantly among all the treatments in 2016, whereas that in the CC plots was significantly lower than that in the AS plots by 36% in 2017. These results suggest that the application of coated calcium nitrate fertilizers can reduce emissions of N2O produced via nitrification and can thus reduce cumulative N2O emissions in fields where nitrification is the major N2O production process in the soil. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Calcium nitrate; Coated nitrate fertilizer; Denitrification; Nitric oxide; Nitrification; Nitrous oxide","denitrification; fertilizer application; nitrate; nitrification; nitrous oxide; rainfall; soil water; temperate environment; Daucus carota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100575072

Moving towards more sustainable energy solutions in the urban context by integrating renewable energy technologies supports decarbonizing the energy sector and climate change mitigation. A successful transition also needs adequate consideration of climate change including extreme events to ensure the reliable performance of energy systems in the long run. This review provides an overview of and insight into the progress achieved in the energy sector to adapt to climate change, focusing on the climate resilience of urban energy systems. The state-of-the-art methodology to assess impacts of climate change including extreme events and uncertainties on the design and performance of energy systems is described and discussed. Climate resilience is an emerging concept that is increasingly used to represent the durability and stable performance of energy systems against extreme climate events. However, it has not yet been adequately explored and widely used, as its definition has not been clearly articulated and assessment is mostly based on qualitative aspects. This study reveals that a major limitation in the state-of-the-art is the inadequacy of climate change adaptation approaches in designing and preparing urban energy systems to satisfactorily address plausible extreme climate events. Furthermore, the complexity of the climate and energy models and the mismatch between their temporal and spatial resolutions are the major limitations in linking these models. Therefore, few studies have focused on the design and operation of urban energy infrastructure in terms of climate resilience. Considering the occurrence of extreme climate events and increasing demand for implementing climate adaptation strategies, the study highlights the importance of improving energy system models to consider future climate variations including extreme events to identify climate resilient energy transition pathways. © 2021 The Author(s).","climate change adaptation; climate resilience; decentralized generation; extreme events; renewable energy; urban energy systems","Climate models; Energy policy; Extreme weather; Uncertainty analysis; Adaptation strategies; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Design and operations; Renewable energy technologies; Sustainable energy solutions; Temporal and spatial; Urban energy systems; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094621645

The stepwise incorporation of these effects into the catalyst structures results in a series of complexes that show an atypical inverse scaling relationship for CO2 reduction - the maximum activity of the resulting catalysts increases as the onset potentials are driven positive due to the ligand electronic substituent effects. Incorporating all three effects simultaneously into the catalyst structure results in a Co complex [Co(PDI-PyCH3+I-)] with dramatically enhanced activity for CO2 reduction, operating with over an order of magnitude higher activity (TOFcat = 4.1 × 104 s-1) and ∼0.2 V more positive catalytic onset (Eonset = -1.52 V vs Fc+/0) compared to the parent complex, an intrinsic activity parameter TOF0 = 6.3 × 10-3 s-1, and >95% Faradaic efficiency for CO production in acetonitrile with 11 M water. This makes [Co(PDI-PyCH3+I-)] among the most active molecular catalysts reported for the CO2 reduction reaction.

In response to this massive waste challenge, the scientific community is vigorously pursuing new technologies that can enable displacement of fossil-based carbon feedstocks with bio-based or waste-sourced feedstocks, greener manufacturing of plastics, and development of new approaches that will enable recycling of waste plastics to a much greater extent. The current study provides baseline supply chain energy and greenhouse gas emissions data for the consumption of major plastics in the United States, with the intention that these estimates will serve as a useful benchmark for evaluating new circular economy-focused technologies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.This study estimates the supply chain energy and greenhouse gas emissions for annual plastics consumption in the United States across 18 major polymer types. These data provide an important benchmark against which to compare new technologies that enable circularity in plastics materials flows through improved recycling processes and that enable new approaches to reduce carbon intensity in plastics manufacturing, for example, by using bio-based feedstocks instead of fossil-based feedstocks. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Reducing the carbon intensity of plastics production by sourcing sustainable feedstocks while simultaneously enabling effective polymer recycling represents a potential transformation of 21st century manufacturing. To evaluate technologies that could enable such changes, it is imperative to compare the sustainability of bio-based and/or circular plastic flows to those of incumbent manufacturing paradigms. To that end, we estimate the supply chain energy requirements and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with US-based plastics consumption. Major commodity polymers, each of which has a global consumption of at least 1 MMT per year, account for an estimated annual 3.2 quadrillion Btutus (quads) of energy and 104 MMTCO2e of GHG emissions in the US alone.

The key findings include: 1) confirmation of their η2,η3-low temperature-limiting unsymmetrical structures; 2) that most substituents on the propargyl unit have relatively small effects on their stability, while auxiliary ligands of 3 can have substantial stabilizing effects; 3) calculated atomic charges, frontier MO analysis, IR and NMR spectra together indicate extensive electronic delocalization in 2 and 3, with a majority of positive charge dispersed onto the -Co2(CO)5,6(L) unit and a greater residual charge and LUMO character on C1 of the propargyl unit; 4) the latter factors account for the regioselective C-1 attack of nucleophiles on 2 and 3; 5) that two isomerization processes, enantiomerization and syn/anti diastereomerization, are viable via corresponding parallel and perpendicular transition states, the former generally being the lower in energy by ca. 2-3 kcal/mol); 6) that C-3 substituents on the propargyl unit, with one exception (R1=OR), have small effects on these isomerization barriers, as is case for electron-poor phosphines, e.g. L=PF3; 7) that stronger donor phosphines increase rigidity, stability and isomerization barriers, but non-linearly; and 8) that an alternative dynamic isomerization process, involving tetrahedral-to-planar squashing of the Co2C2 cluster, could be energetically accessible. Insights into the underlying factors causing these effects are presented along with some prospects for new reactivity and selectivity possibilities. © 2020","Cluster fluxionality; Metal-stabilized carbocations; Propargyl-dicobalt; Propargyl-nucleophile coupling","Electronic properties; Isomerization; Isomers; Ligands; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Nucleophiles; Phosphorus compounds; Temperature; Auxiliary ligands; Carbonyl complexes; Electronic delocalization; IR and NMR spectra; Isomerization barriers; Stabilizing effects; Underlying factors; Unsymmetrical structure; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099148814

Proper sizing of various equipment is of great significance for its efficient operation of such systems. This paper took a business district as the research object, predicted and analyzed the hourly cooling/heating load of the system during typical days of different seasons. Based on comprehensive consideration of the user's usage pattern, load, equipment characteristics and other issues, gas engine was selected as the system's prime mover, and the system structure was designed accordingly. Mathematical model was developed including gas engine, gas boiler, absorption chiller and other equipment. The differential evolution (DE) algorithm was applied to optimize the equipment capacity of the energy system, with the multi-objective of lower annual total cost and less annual emission. The annual pollutant emission of the plan C is the lowest in the results, which is more suitable for the business district. Compared with the traditional energy system, the annual total cost and pollutant emission of the optimized system were about 22% and 27% lower, respectively.

Corporate GHG footprints, proxying for transition risk, are dominated by carbon emissions from energy use. Thus the growing attention on the carbon emissions of corporations from, principally, their energy use, motivates firms to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. However, only a subset of corporations disclose their GHG/carbon footprints. This paper uses machine learning to improve the prediction of corporate carbon emissions for risk analyses by investors. We introduce a two-step framework that applies a Meta-Elastic Net learner to combine predictions from multiple base-learners as the best emission prediction approach. It results in an accuracy gain based on mean absolute error of up to 30% as compared with the existing models. We also find that prediction accuracy can be further improved by incorporating additional predictors (energy production/consumption data) and additional firm disclosures in particular sectors and regions.

In considering this, we emphasize the role of network administrative organizations (NAOs) and posit that the multiple climate-related networks, which share members and operate in overlapping geographic and issue spaces, are bound together as part of a meta-network. We utilize social network analysis and data on membership in four climate-related TMNs to examine the factors that shape how cities can influence meta-network priorities.

It is essential to assess the evapotranspiration (ET), especially reference evapotranspiration (ET) to ensure efficient irrigation demand for this region. However, direct measurement of ET is a difficult task as empirical equation-based assessment requires a complex set of input data. As remote sensing (RS) technology has evolved as a viable alternative to the ground-based estimation of ET0, this study investigated whether it is possible to attain a reliable assessment of ET for the SW region of Bangladesh using satellite data. Land surface temperature (LST) data retrieved from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite have been evaluated as an alternative of air temperature in three empirical ET assessment methods, namely the Hargreaves–Samani (HS), Thornthwaite (TH), and Blaney–Criddle (BC) methods. ET assessed from these methods have been calibrated and validated against the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith (PM) method. Several statistical indices, viz. root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean relative error (MRE), and coefficient of determination (R2) have been used to evaluate the performance of ET assessment from the above-mentioned methods. MODIS-LST data have been found strongly correlated with air temperature (R2 = 0.95). A good correlation in ET assessment has been found between the PM method and HS (R2 = 0.85), TH (R2 = 0.81), and BC (R2 = 0.79) methods. With the calibrated result, the calibrated HS method provides the most accurate results compared to the other methods, with an average RMSE of 0.44 mm/day, MAE of 0.39 mm/day, and MRE of 12.34%. Considering the consistency of the findings with the previous studies, this method has been recommended for assessing ET under conditions of limited data availability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Empirical methods; Irrigation demand; MODIS; Reference evapotranspiration; Remote sensing; Southwest Bangladesh","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Errors; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Irrigation; Mean square error; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Water supply; Climate change impact; Coefficient of determination; Empirical equations; Groundwater consumption; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellites; Reference evapotranspiration; Root mean square errors; Statistical indices; Land surface temperature; air temperature; climate change; evapotranspiration; MODIS; Penman-Monteith equation; remote sensing; surface temperature; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102386690

We conducted a manipulative field experiment to test whether plants’ shade-tolerance influences their root AM fungal communities in open and shaded grassland sites. We found similar light-dependent shifts in AM fungal community structure for experimental bait plant roots and the surrounding soil. Yet, deviation from the surrounding soil towards lower AM fungal beta-diversity in the roots of shade-intolerant plants in shade suggested preferential carbon allocation to specific AM fungi in conditions where plant-assimilated carbon available to fungi was limited.

Some methods are based on the inverse modelling of emissions using various measurements and the results of numerical chemistry transport models (CTMs). Since the accuracy and precision of CTMs largely determine errors in the approaches for emission estimation, it is crucial to validate the performance of such models through observations. In the current study, the near‐surface CO2 mixing ratio simulated by the CTM Weather Research and Forecasting—Chemistry (WRF‐Chem) at a high spatial resolution (3 km) using three different sets of CO2 fluxes (anthropogenic + biogenic fluxes, time‐varying and constant anthropogenic emissions) and from Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) datasets have been validated using in situ observations near the Saint Petersburg megacity (Russia) in March and April 2019. It was found that CAMS reanalysis data with a low spatial resolution (1.9 × 3.8°) can match the observations better than CAMS analysis data with a high resolution (0.15 × 0.15°). The CAMS analysis significantly overestimates the observed near‐surface CO2 mixing ratio in Peterhof in March and April 2019 (by more than 10 ppm). The best match for the CAMS reanalysis and observations was observed in March, when the wind was predominantly opposite to the Saint Petersburg urbanized area. In contrast, the CAMS analysis fits the observed trend of the mixing ratio variation in April better than the reanalysis with the wind directions from the Saint Petersburg urban zone. Generally, the WRF‐Chem predicts the observed temporal variations in the near-surface CO2 reasonably well (mean bias ≈ (−0.3) − (−0.9) ppm, RMSD ≈ 8.7 ppm, correlation coefficient ≈ 0.61 ± 0.04). The WRF‐Chem data where anthropogenic and biogenic fluxes were used match the observations a bit better than the WRF‐Chem data without biogenic fluxes. The diurnal time variation in the anthropogenic emissions influenced the WRF‐Chem data insignificantly. However, in general, the data of all three WRF‐Chem model runs give almost the same CO2 temporal variation in Peterhof in March and April 2019. This could be related to the late start of the growing season, which influences biogenic CO2 fluxes, inaccuracies in the estimation of the biogenic fluxes, and the simplified time variation pattern of the CO2 anthropogenic emissions. © MDPI AG.

In order to achieve this goal, measures to reduce emissions have to be taken in all sectors of the national economy. In this context it is interesting to note that to date it is widely unknown how much emissions are caused by the Austrian tourism sector, despite its great importance in the country's economy, making up for 6.4% of the gross domestic product. The main reason for this situation is that most products and services consumed by tourists are not exclusive to tourism alone. Transport emissions, for instance, are caused by tourists, but also by commuters, transport of goods, and other reasons. The present paper explores how the complete emissions of tourism in Austria might be calculated for a given year, or even integrated into a regular monitoring scheme. In addition, first estimates are made, based on currently available data, following a destination-based accounting which takes into consideration not only emissions caused within Austria but also those generated abroad by travel of international tourists visiting the country. The results demonstrate the crucial importance of tourism as a contributor to the nation-wide carbon emissions, especially tourist transport by car and aircraft. In line with these findings, the paper indicates what measures should be taken to reduce the carbon footprint of the Austrian tourism sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air travel; Climate change mitigation; CO2 emissions; Tourism; Transport sector",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092270648

Most of them are vehicles powered by liquid fuels. Unfortunately, with the increasing intensity of car use, the amount of pollution generated in the transport sector is also increasing. In order to reduce the harmful impact on the environment, multi-track actions are necessary to reduce emissions from burning liquid fuels. One of such actions is presented concept of the operation of electric vehicles on the example of a local businessman and determination of ecological assessment indicators for the analysed solution. The simulations demonstrate that the changes in the transport fleet of the local enterprise will not bring about a reduction in pollution, but on the contrary, it will increase the total emission of pollutants by about 20%. This is due to the fact that electric energy for battery charging comes mainly from burning fossil fuels in domestic conditions. A positive impact on the environment was observed only when electric vehicles were powered from a specially selected photovoltaic installation dedicated to the needs of the customer working in a mixed system.

Box 59857, Nairobi, 00200, Kenya","This study was undertaken in Laikipia County, Kenya, to identify factors influencing the choices of strategies by pastoralists to adapt to climate change. The study particularly evaluates the role of perceived climate extremes (frequency of dry spells and droughts), early warning information, and access to private ranch grazing, in determining response decisions to climate change. Besides, we test if households jointly adopt climate change adaptation strategies. The primary data collected from 440 sample households was analyzed using the multivariate probit (MVP) model. In the MVP model, we consider the following measures: increased mobility (distance & frequency), storage/purchase of fodder, change in water management, partial shift to other livelihoods, and herd management. The results reveal that these adaptation strategies are jointly adopted by pastoralists as complements and substitutes. From the empirical result, the perceived increase in the number of dry spells and drought, access to early warning information, access to private ranch grazing, main market distance from homesteads, and the highest level of education in the household are the key determinants of the choices of adaptation strategies to cope with drought and climate change. From a policy perspective, this research contributes to the ongoing debate on best practices by addressing climate change-related challenges in semi-arid land management. Therefore, there is a need for early warning institutions to increase their visibility in the semi-arid areas by exploring effective methods of delivering climate risk information in good time. Improving access to market and private ranch grazing should be promoted in the Kenyan semi-arid areas. Given that pastoralists’ perceptions of climate change and climate risk is a decisive variable in adaptation decision-making, there is need to improve the understanding of pastoralists’ changing climatic conditions. Furthermore, since the results indicate that mobility and storage of fodder are substitutes, the adoption of hay production could become a key production strategy for pastoralists which will increase the competitiveness of their livestock in the market and increase milk production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation strategies; Climate change; Climate extremes; Early warning information; Kenya; Pastoralist","adaptive management; climate change; competitiveness; decision analysis; drought resistance; early warning system; land management; pastoralism; perception; semiarid region; strategic approach; Kenya; Laikipia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104007536

Current guidelines recommend these patients are best managed in a multidisciplinary team setting. This study reports experience in the management of SAP within the UK's first reported hub-and-spoke pancreatitis network. Design All patients with SAP referred to the remote care pancreatitis network between 2015 and 2017 were prospectively entered onto a database by a dedicated pancreatitis specialist nurse. Baseline characteristics, aetiology, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, interventions, complications, mortality and follow-up were analysed. Results 285 patients admitted with SAP to secondary care hospitals during the study period were discussed with the dedicated pancreatitis specialist nurse and referred to the regional service. 83/285 patients (29%; 37 male) were transferred to the specialist centre mainly for drainage of infected pancreatic fluid collections (PFC) in 95% (n=79) of patients. Among the patients transferred; 29 (35%) patients developed multiorgan failure with an inpatient mortality of 14% (n=12/83). The median follow-up was 18.2 months (IQR=11.25-35.51). Multivariate analysis showed that transferred patients had statistically significant longer overall hospital stay (p<0.001) but less ICU stay (p<0.012). Conclusion This hub-and-spoke model facilitates the management of the majority of patients with SAP in secondary care setting. 29% warranted transfer to our tertiary centre, predominantly for endoscopic drainage of PFCs. An evidence-based approach with a low threshold for transfer to tertiary care centre can result in lower mortality for SAP and fewer days in ICU. ©","acute pancreatitis; pancreatic disease; pancreatic pseudocyst","antibiotic agent; acute pancreatitis; adult; aged; Article; artificial embolization; ascites; blood culture; bypass surgery; cholecystitis; cholestasis; Clostridium difficile infection; controlled study; data analysis software; data base; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; endoscopic surgery; endoscopic ultrasound guided drainage; enterocutaneous fistula; false aneurysm; female; follow up; gastroduodenal pseudoaneurysm; hospital admission; hub and spoke pancreatitis network; human; in-hospital mortality; informed consent; intensive care unit; ischemic colitis; length of stay; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; multidisciplinary team; multiple organ failure; nurse specialist; nutritional requirement; outcome assessment; pancreas hemorrhage; pancreas juice; parenteral nutrition; patient referral; percutaneous drainage; pleura effusion; prospective study; pylorus stenosis; secondary care center; sepsis; severe acute pancreatitis; spleen artery aneurysm; sputum culture; stomach obstruction; tertiary care center; urine culture; vein occlusion; wound",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103672904

In this work, a single-step facile hydrothermal route was adopted for the synthesis of Co2GeO4, Co2GeO4/rGO, and Co2GeO4/MWCNT nanocomposites. The X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the spinel phase formation of Co2GeO4, Co2GeO4/rGO, and Co2GeO4/MWCNTs. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy results depict the growth of pristine Co2GeO4and Co2GeO4/rGO nanocomposites in the nanoscale size with sharp-edge plate-like morphology, while plate-like particles in Co2GeO4/MWCNT nanocomposites are grown on the surface and inside MWCNTs. The chemical bonding, oxidation state of elements in the composition, and the presence of rGO and MWCNTs are confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The galvanostatic measurements reveal that Co2GeO4, Co2GeO4/rGO, and Co2GeO4/MWCNT electrodes exhibit specific capacities of 314, 425 and 475 mA h g−1respectively at a rate of 0.05C. The rate capability and long cycle testing results show higher specific capacity and structural stability of Co2GeO4/MWCNT nanocomposites. Co2GeO4/MWCNT nanocomposites show a specific capacity of 108 mA h g−1at a high current density of 6.4C.

It was first reported in Wuhan, China, and later appeared in Central Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. The spatial COVID-19 distribution pattern highly resembles the global population distribution and international travel routes. We select 48 cities in 16 countries across 4 continents having infection counts higher than 10,000 (by 25 April 2020) as the COVID-19 epicenters. At the initial stage, daily COVID-19 counts co-varies strongly with local temperature and humidity, which are clustered within 0–10◦C and 70–95%, respectively. Later, it spreads in colder (−15◦C) and warmer (25◦C) countries, due to faster adaptability in diverse environmental conditions. We introduce a combined temperature-humidity profile, which is essential for prediction of COVID-19 cases based on environmental conditions. The COVID-19 epicenters are collocated on global CO2 emission hotspots and its distribution maximizes at 7.49◦C, which is 1.35◦C/2.44◦C higher than current (2020)/historical (1961–1990) mean. Approximately 75% of the COVID-19 cases are clustered at severe-extreme end of historical temperature distribution spectrum, which establish its tighter and possible association with extreme climate change. A strong mitigation measure is essential to abate the GHG emissions, which may reduce the probability of such pandemics in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

However, Version 6 of the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) has provided a new source of precipitation information with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, the performance of the GPM products (Final run) in the state of Paraná, located in the southern region of Brazil, from June 2000 to December 2018 was evaluated. The daily and monthly products of IMERG were compared to the gauge data spatially distributed across the study area. Quantitative and qualitative metrics were used to analyze the performance of IMERG products to detect precipitation events and anomalies. In general, the products performed positively in the estimation of monthly rainfall events, both in volume and spatial distribution, and demonstrated limited performance for daily events and anomalies, mainly in mountainous regions (coast and southwest). This may be related to the orographic rainfall in these regions, associating the intensity of the rain, and the topography. IMERG products can be considered as a source of precipitation data, especially on a monthly scale. Product calibrations are suggested for use on a daily scale and for time-series analysis. © 2021 by the authors.

Unfortunately, the policy responses to solving congestion and emissions issues are mainly dedicated to the movement of people. The most valued opportunities to reduce the negative effects of freight delivery (the goal of EU policy is CO2 free urban logistics by 2030) regards both the use of electric vehicles to perform the distribution and the introduction of distribution centres that encourage the use of light commercial vehicles. However, the combination of zero emission vehicles in logistic and transportation activities requires some additional challenges from the organizational and operational point of view. In order to avoid the delocalization of polluting emissions it is necessary that the production of electricity related to the new needs comes from renewable sources preferably distributed throughout the territory. This paper explores the integration of electric vehicles in logistics operations executed through light commercial vehicles, taking into consideration, during the design phase of a new concept delivery van, the technical connections with the production systems and its possible applications also in areas other than urban. The results of the case study presented encourage the development of a type of vehicle with features not yet covered by the market and which are of particular relevance for sustainable logistics applied to small towns or small islands, which are widespread in Italy. © 2021","Delivery Van; Electric vehicles; Freight distribution; LCV market; Sustainable logistics","Automobiles; Commercial vehicle operations; Electric vehicles; Freight transportation; Light weight vehicles; Sustainable development; Distribution centres; Environmental sustainability; Freight distribution; Light commercial vehicles; Logistics operations; Movement of peoples; Polluting emission; Zero emission vehicles; Commercial vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111353583

Herder communities are seldom explored in climate change related studies although their livelihoods largely depend on the natural environment. Thus, a case study of the Fulani Herder Community of Kpongu in the Wa Municipality was conducted. The design employed Participatory Rural Appraisal instruments for data collection and analysis. The results reveal multiple indicators of climate change, including longer dry seasons and dry spells, shrinking sizes of water bodies, formation of iron pans on top soils, stunted growth of grass species, smaller grass stalks and less concentration of grasses. These have culminated into scarcity of fodder and water and increased distances of cattle herding under excruciating sunshine and temperatures in search of feed and water as an adaptive mechanism. The paper underscores that herder knowledge of climate change reveals a drying trend in climate and de-concentration in vegetation, especially grass species. The paper advocates climate change adaptation planning and policy attention to providing supplementary sources of water and feed in support of cattle herding and herder communities for climate change adaptation. © 2021 The Authors.","Cattle herding; Climate change and variability; Community risk assessment; Fulani; Indigenous knowledge","Drought; Risk assessment; Cattle herding; Climate change adaptation; Community risk assessments; Community-based; Fulani; Grass species; Indigenous community; Indigenous knowledge; Knowledge based; Risks assessments; Climate change; cattle; climate change; concentration (composition); indigenous knowledge; mapping method; risk assessment; seasonal variation; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121219768

To accomplish this goal, numerous areas are required for Napier grass plantations. Before introducing crops, the land potential of the country and the impact of crops on the environment should be assessed. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model is very useful in investigating crop impacts and land potential. Unfortunately, the crop growth parameters of Napier grass are yet to be identified and, thus, conducting effective analysis has not been possible. Accordingly, in this study, parameter calibration and SWAT model validation of Napier grass production in Thailand was carried out using datasets from eight sites with 93 samples. Parameter sensitivity analysis was performed prior to parameter calibration, the results of which suggest that the radiation use efficiency and potential harvested index are both highly sensitive. The crop growth parameters were calibrated in order of their sensitivity index ranking, and the final values were obtained by reducing the root mean square error from 10.77 to 1.38 t·ha−1 . The validation provides satisfactory results with coefficient of determination of 0.951 and a mean error of 0.321 t·ha−1 . Using the developed model and calibrated parameters, local Napier grass dry matter yield can be evaluated accurately. The results reveal that, if only abandoned area in Thailand is used, then Napier grass can provide roughly 33,600–44,900 GWh of annual electricity, and power plant carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions can be reduced by approximately 21.2–28.3 Mt-CO2 .

These impacts can get even worse due to potential climate change impacts. The urban areas of the Simeto River Valley (SRV), the largest river valley in Sicily (Italy), have been repeatedly hit by intense rainfall events in the last decades that lead to urban flooding, causing several damages and, in some instances, threats to population. In this paper, we present the results of a 10-question survey on climate change and risk perception in 11 municipalities of the SRV carried out within the activities of the LIFE project SimetoRES, which allowed to collect 1143 feedbacks from the residents. The survey investigated: (a) the level of worry about climate change in relation to extreme storms, (b) elements of urban flooding risk preparedness: the direct experience of the residents during heavy rain events, their trust in a civil protection regional alert system, and their knowledge of the correct behavior in case of flood, and (c) the willingness of citizens to implement sustainable drainage actions for climate change adaptation in their own municipality and real estates. The results show that more than 52% of citizens has inadequate knowledge of the correct behavior during flooding events and only 30% of them feel responsible for mitigation of flooding risk. There is a modest willingness by the population to support the construction of sustainable urban drainage infrastructures. A statistical cross-analysis of the answers to the different questions, based on contingency matrices and conditional frequencies, has shown that a greater worry about climate change has no significant impact either on the behavior of people in dangerous situations occurring during flooding events or on the willingness to support financially sustainable solutions. These results suggest that to build a higher worry about climate change and related urban flooding risk is not sufficient to have better preparedness, and that more direct educative actions are necessary in the area. © 2021 by the authors.

The University Network for Human Rights worked with residents of this predominantly Black community in Cancer Alley to design and implement a survey-based health study of the area. The study aimed to (1) assess the relationship between household proximity to the facility and reported illness, and (2) advance the advocacy objectives of the community. Methods: The survey area consisted of households within a 2.5-km radius of the Denka facility. Sixty percent of the households within 1.5 km of the facility (""Zone 1"") and 20% of the households between 1.5 and 2.5 km from the facility (""Zone 2"") were randomly sampled. Survey implementers collected information on cancer diagnoses about all residents of each surveyed household. Information on chloroprene-linked medical symptoms was collected about respondents (those who took the survey) only. Results: Cancer prevalence among the survey sample is (1) significantly higher than what is considered likely using Monte Carlo simulations based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results prevalence data (p = 0.0306); and (2) associated with proximity to the facility, with significantly higher-Than-likely prevalence in Zone 1 (p = 0.0032) and lower prevalence in Zone 2. Levels of medical symptoms among respondents are high and also associated with proximity to the facility. Discussion: Our findings highlight the need for action to compel Denka to reduce chloroprene emissions to Environmental Protection Agency-recommended limits. Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with Cancer Alley communities' lived experiences of the debilitating health consequences of the area's industrial emissions. The burden of proof must shift to polluting industries. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.","Cancer Alley; community-engaged research; environmental justice; environmental racism; health disparities; industrial corridor","atmospheric pollution; cancer; disease prevalence; emission; health risk; health survey; household survey; industrial emission; risk factor; symptom; toxicity; Louisiana; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101553086

However, some authors have questioned the weight of evidence for Allee effects in wild populations. We therefore exploited a natural experiment provided by two adjacent breeding colonies of contrasting density to investigate the potential for Allee effects in an Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) population that is declining in response to climate change-induced reductions in food availability. Biometric time-series data were collected from 25 pups per colony during two consecutive breeding seasons, the first of which was among the worst on record in terms of breeding female numbers, pup birth weights and foraging trip durations. In previous decades when population densities were higher, pup mortality was consistently negatively density dependent, with rates of trauma and starvation scaling positively with density. However, we found the opposite, with higher pup mortality at low density and the majority of deaths attributable to predation. In parallel, body condition was depressed at low density, particularly in the poor-quality season. Our findings shed light on Allee effects in wild populations and highlight a potential emerging role of predators in the ongoing decline of a pinniped species. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Intermittent flow Rivers and Ephemeral Streams (IRES) are particularly vulnerable to spatiotemporal variation of climate variables, land use changes and other anthropogenic factors. In this work, the impact of climate change on the aquatic state of IRES is assessed by the combination of the hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the Temporary Rivers Ecological and Hydrological Status (TREHS) tool under two different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) using CORDEX model simulations. A significant decrease of 20–40% of the annual flow of the examined river (Tsiknias River, Greece) is predicted during the next 100 years with an increase in the frequency of extreme flood events as captured with almost all Regional Climate Models (RCMs) simulations. The occurrence patterns of hyporheic and edaphic aquatic states show a temporal extension of these states through the whole year due to the elongation of the dry period. A shift to the Intermittent-Pools regime type shows dominance according to numerous climate change scenarios, harming, as a consequence, both the ecological system and the social-economic one. © 2021 by the authors.

These emissions are a significant source of many air pollutants formed during incomplete combustion and has been identified as one of the leading environmental risk factors for these populations. One of the solutions is to utilise thermally processed solid fuels. This article discusses the concentrations of pollutants emitted as a result of the combustion of conventional fuels and new low-emission fuel in out-of-class heaters. To gain better insight into the relationships between fuel type and flue gas quality, chemometric methods and variance analysis were used. Principal component analysis confirmed that the fuel type significantly influences the level of dust emissions and the total organic carbon and sum of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the dust. Clustering analysis identified how the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons correlate with the amounts of dust and total organic carbon and showed that this correlation is proportional to the size of the molecule and consequently the number of aromatic rings. The use of low-emission fuel as a solid fuel in households, as our analyses have shown, can reduce the concentrations of dust, total organic carbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by up to 50 times, thereby reducing air pollutants in cities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutants; Chemometric; Households; Low-emission fuel; PAHs; Solid fuels","acenaphthene; anthracene; carbon dioxide; coal; fluorene; fuel; nitrogen oxide; phenanthrene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sulfur dioxide; sulfur oxide; tar; coal; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; air quality; atmospheric pollution; coal; coal combustion; combustion; concentration (composition); correlation; emission control; environmental risk; European Union; organic carbon; PAH; air pollutant; air quality; analytic method; Article; chemometric analysis; combustion; dust; environmental parameters; exhaust gas; furnace; heat; household; soot; total organic carbon; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; Poland; Poland [Central Europe]; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Poland; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098657376

The current paper reviews the status of B. dorsalis in Africa exploring invasion patterns and the role of climate and the environment in its invasion success. We also review current management practices highlighting recent developments and future prospects for its control. We note that the period 2003–2014 was marked by the rapid spread of B. dorsalis from East to West, as well as part of North, central and southern African regions. This invasion success probably stems from favourable environmental conditions in relation to climate and diverse host plants. In addition, competitive biotic factors including superior reproductive traits may give it a competitive edge over its interspecific competitors. Current management practices range from cultural, biological, interference methods, chemical, genetic engineering and integrated approaches. We therefore highlight opportunities for successful sustainable control with particular focus on new genomic approaches that require regionally coordinated efforts to curb future biological invasions. These new approaches may complement the efficacy of current practices such as sterile insect technique (SIT) in order to improve access to export markets and help transform African economies through sustainable fruit and vegetable trade. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Horticulture; Integrated pest management; Invasive species; Phytosanitary regulations","environmental conditions; fly; fruit production; genetic engineering; genomics; pest resistance; sustainable development; vegetable; Africa; Bactrocera dorsalis; Diptera; Hexapoda; Tephritidae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097479642

With the prevailing climate change conditions, environmental events are likely to become even more pervasive. Coastal regions, the source of numerous tangible and intangible benefits for human populations, are exposed to a wide range of risks. With the motivation that knowledge of risk at local levels could bring substantial benefits for risk reduction planning, the current study devised a framework for mapping composite disaster risk at the local scale using context-specific risk variables and tested it within a clearly defined coastal sub-district of southwestern Bangladesh. Utilizing easily accessible spatial and non-spatial secondary datasets, a risk map for the study area was formulated using geospatial techniques. The map revealed that within a small area of about 230 km2, the disaster risk varied considerably, which is attributable to the variability of geographic and socio-demographic features of the area. The map delineated 21% of the study area as very high risk, 20% as high, 21% as moderate, 20% as low, and 18% as very low risk. The technique for risk mapping adopted in this study is inexpensive to conduct, doable within a brief period, requires limited data inputs and is thus useable for countries like Bangladesh that have a dearth of data. The resulting map is an improvement over existing risk maps, which are currently available only at the regional scale, and hence provides a robust platform upon which to commence the process of disaster risk reduction in the area. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Coastal communities; Disaster risk; Risk mapping",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100409407

However, the construction sector is experiencing now a strong renovation process in methodology and tools due to the incorporation of the Building Information Modelling, Lean Construction and Integrated Project Delivery. Meanwhile, in production systems, “Industry 4.0” is a new paradigm that proposes automation, monitoring, sensorisation, robotisation, and digitalisation to improve production and distribution processes. In this context, some authors have proposed the concept of “Construction 4.0” as the counterpart of Industry 4.0 for the construction sector, although the methodological-technological implications are not clear.

Therefore, reducing the CO2 emissions in this sector will play a decisive role in achieving EU targets of reducing emissions by 40% by 2030. To better inform decisions regarding retrofit of the existing building stock, this study proposes Optimum Insulation Thicknesses (OIT) for typical walls in 25 regions in Ireland. The calculation of OIT includes annual heat energy expenditure, CO2 emissions, and material payback period. The approach taken is based on Heating Degree Day (HDD) and life cycle cost analysis methods for different combinations of insulation material, heat energy type, and Irish wall configuration. Results indicate that OIT increases with increased HDD and varies up to 30% from lower to higher HDD regions in Ireland. The type of wall materials, configuration, insulation type, and heat energy type all have a significant impact on annual cost saving potential (up to 170 €/m2) and carbon emission (up to 50 kg/m2). The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) technique is used to compare the significant mean difference between combinations under OIT and cost savings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions; Heating degree day; Ireland; Optimum insulation thickness; Retrofit","Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Insulation; Investments; Life cycle; Retrofitting; Walls (structural partitions); Building stocks; Carbon emissions; Heating degree-days; Insulation materials; Life cycle cost analysis; Payback periods; Reducing emissions; Residential sectors; Analysis of variance (ANOVA)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099779393

This paper teases out how South Africa landed the climate action SDG into its development trajectory, with a focus on mitigation policies, strategies and institutional setup. The study uses an online survey, key informant interviews, as well as policy documents and critical discourse analysis. The study concludes that South Africa has landed SDG 13 into its policies designed to respond to climate mitigation. However, there were several inherent challenges in the policies and strategies resulting in implementation inefficiencies, including the fact that the policy on climate change is driven more by international pressures and expectations rather than domestic awareness and activism. There are also challenges with institutional capacity to implement the policies at sub-national levels. Furthermore, reliance on a few experts makes the system vulnerable and fragile. The study also found that not enough is being done to support sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12) as there are energy intensive industries failing to comply with mitigation policies in place. Hence the paper recommends the need to fix the disjuncture between the energy policy and climate mitigation. © 2021 by the authors.

However, most of the existing studies relied on health administrative databases for the diagnosis of dementia. In a large French population-based cohort (the 3C Study), we assessed the effects of particulate matter ≤2.5 µm (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and black carbon (BC) on the risk of dementia diagnosed with reliable tools. Methods: Participants aged ≥65 years were recruited between 1999 and 2001 and followed for 12 years. At baseline and every 2 years, dementia was suspected on the basis of the neuropsychological and neurological examination and confirmed by an independent committee of clinicians. Exposure to NO2, BC and PM2.5 at the participants’ residential address was estimated using land use regression models. For each pollutant and year of follow-up, the 10-year moving average of past exposure was estimated. Multilevel spatial random-effects Cox proportional hazards models were used in which exposure was included as a time-varying variable. Analyses were adjusted for individual (age, sex, education, APOE4 genotype, health behaviours) and contextual (neighbourhood deprivation index) confounders. Results: At baseline, the median age of the 7066 participants was 73.4 years, and 62% were women. The median follow-up duration was 10.0 years during which 791 participants developed dementia (n = 541 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and n = 155 vascular/mixed dementia (VaD)). The 10-year moving average of PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 14.6 to 31.3 µg/m3. PM2.5 concentration was positively associated with dementia risk: HR = 1.20, 95% CI (1.08–1.32) for all-cause dementia, 1.20 (1.09–1.32) for AD, and 1.33 (1.05–1.68) for VaD per 5 µg/m3 PM2.5 increase. No association was detected between NO2 or BC exposure and dementia risk. Conclusion: In this large cohort of older adults, long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased dementia incidence. Reducing PM2.5 emissions might lessen the burden of dementia in aging populations. © 2021 The Author(s)","Air pollution; Black carbon; Cohort; Dementia; Elderly; Fine particulate matter; Incidence; Nitrogen dioxide","Air pollution; Diagnosis; Land use; Nitrogen oxides; Random processes; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Alzheimer's disease; Ambient air pollution; Cox proportional hazards models; Land-use regression models; Neurological examination; Neuropsychological; Particulate Matter; PM2.5 concentration; Neurodegenerative diseases; apolipoprotein E4; black carbon; nitrogen dioxide; aging population; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; concentration (composition); disease incidence; elderly population; epidemiology; health risk; mental disorder; mental health; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; pollution effect; age distribution; aged; aging; air pollution; Alzheimer disease; ambient air; Article; cohort analysis; confidence interval; controlled study; dementia assessment; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; educational status; female; follow up; France; genotype; hazard ratio; health behavior; human; land use; long term exposure; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; multiinfarct dementia; neighborhood deprivation index; particulate matter 2.5; PM2.5 exposure; pollutant; population research; proportional hazards model; prospective study; regression analysis; risk factor; sex difference; spatial analysis; statistical parameters; time factor; very elderly; adverse event; air pollutant; environmental exposure; particulate matter; France; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Male; Particulate Matter; Prospective Studies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100006111

CCU technology efficiencies and regional characteristics were evaluated by integrating process simulation and carbon footprint estimation to determine the optimal social implementation scenarios from the CO2 emissions reduction perspective. Methanol (MeOH) was chosen as the CCU product, and the energy efficiency of MeOH synthesis under various conditions was assessed. For social implementation scenarios, location of each technology, capacity of renewable energy and H2 manufacturing method, process configuration, CO2 source, and separation/recovery technology were used as conditions for the evaluation. Based on 11 cases with varying conditions, the partial oxidation and dry reforming of CH4 was determined to exhibit the greatest CO2 emission reduction potential. However, when considering renewable energy expansion, direct MeOH synthesis exhibited a greater CO2 reduction potential. Based on the results, CCU optimal social implementation scenarios evaluation guidelines were determined. These guidelines can be implemented at a large scale to determine the viability and effectiveness of CCU technologies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.","Abbreviations CCU Carbon capture and utilization; DR Dry reforming; DS Direct synthesis; LCA Life cycle assessment; LNG Liquid natural gas; LPG Liquid petroleum gas; PO Partial oxidation; PSA Pressure swing adsorption; SR Steam reforming; UAE United Arab Emirates","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide process; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Methanol; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emission reduction; Evaluation guidelines; Manufacturing methods; Process configuration; Regional characteristics; Scenario assessment; Technology efficiency; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099881446

Concomitantly, this approach could also meet steadily increasing global energy demands for value-added carbon-based chemical feedstocks as nonrenewable petrochemical resources are consumed. Reports on the molecular electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 mediated by chromium (Cr) complexes are scarce relative to other earth-abundant transition metals. Recently, our group reported a Cr complex that can efficiently catalyze the reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO) at low overpotentials. Here, we present new mechanistic insight through a computational (density functional theory) study, exploring the origin of kinetic selectivity, relative energetic positioning of the intermediates, speciation with respect to solvent coordination and spin state, as well as the role of the redox-active bipyridine moiety. Importantly, these studies suggest that under certain reducing conditions, the formation of bicarbonate could become a competitive reaction pathway, informing new areas of interest for future experimental studies. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Computation theory; Density functional theory; Electrocatalysts; Global warming; Redox reactions; Transition metals; Atmospheric concentration; Competitive reactions; Electrocatalytic reduction; Global energy demand; Molecular transitions; Petrochemical resources; Solvent coordination; Utilization strategy; Chromium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102963825

Abnormalities in any of these modulatory mechanisms can destabilize breathing, suggesting that modulatory mechanisms are not overly redundant but rather work in concert to maintain stable respiratory output.

Ninety-six samples were used in the study, 803.6 tonnes of scrap tires, as fuel. Knowing the Spanish vehicle fleet and considering undifferentiated tires, it is possible to predict the biomass content. The methodology has also been evaluated taking into consideration mono-brand samples. The simplicity of the methodology makes it possible to apply it in different regions and countries.

However, perennial crops mature over several years and their sustainability benefits can be negated through land reversion. A photoperiod-sensitive energy sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) may provide an annual crop alternative more ecologically sustainable than maize (Zea mays) that can more easily integrate into crop rotations than perennials, such as miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus). This study presents an ecosystem-scale comparison of C, N, water and energy fluxes from energy sorghum, maize and miscanthus during a typical growing season in the Midwest United States. Gross primary productivity (GPP) was highest for maize during the peak growing season at 21.83 g C m−2 day−1, followed by energy sorghum (17.04 g C m−2 day−1) and miscanthus (15.57 g C m−2 day−1). Maize also had the highest peak growing season evapotranspiration at 5.39 mm day−1, with energy sorghum and miscanthus at 3.81 and 3.61 mm day−1, respectively. Energy sorghum was the most efficient water user (WUE), while maize and miscanthus were comparatively similar (3.04, 1.75 and 1.89 g C mm−1 H2O, respectively). Maize albedo was lower than energy sorghum and miscanthus (0.19, 0.26 and 0.24, respectively), but energy sorghum had a Bowen ratio closer to maize than miscanthus (0.12, 0.13 and 0.21, respectively). Nitrous oxide (N2O) flux was higher from maize and energy sorghum (8.86 and 12.04 kg N ha−1, respectively) compared with miscanthus (0.51 kg N ha−1), indicative of their different agronomic management. These results are an important first look at how energy sorghum compares to maize and miscanthus grown in the Midwest United States. This quantitative assessment is a critical component for calibrating biogeochemical and ecological models used to forecast bioenergy crop growth, productivity and sustainability. © 2020 The Authors.

We assessed the biomass productivity of six willow cultivars in a 14.5-ha field in Pennsylvania through two rotation cycles of 3 yr each, comparing the realized and biophysical yield potential. We also evaluated the relationship of yield with plant density and the harvest efficiency. The realized yield of the best cultivars was about 8 Mg ha–1 yr–1, well below the calculated harvestable potential of 14 Mg ha–1 yr–1. Uniform stands of willow without planting gaps may maximize yield with 8 × 103 plants ha–1, but upright cultivars may benefit from higher densities. Harvest is relatively slow at 1 ha h–1 or 20 Mg h–1 in the longest rows with optimal ground conditions, which makes the harvest cost per hour high. Biotic stresses built up gradually during the 7 yr of the experiment affecting two cultivars severely. The cultivar S. miyabeana × S. viminalis ‘Preble’ was defoliated by a growing population of willow leaf beetle (Plagiodera versicolora), whereas the cultivar S. purpurea ‘Fish Creek’ was affected by two fungal diseases and suffered a major stand loss in the winter of 2019/2020. Both examples justify breeding for insects and diseases resistance. The moderate harvestable yield and high harvest cost imply that in the northeastern United States, the viability of willow for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage as a tool to reduce CO2 emissions may depend on the provision and monetization of additional ecosystem services. © 2021 The Authors.

Intense activities in megacities induce high levels of air pollutants in the atmosphere that harm human health, cause regional haze and acid deposition, damage crops, influence air quality in regions far from the megacity sources, and contribute to climate change. Since the Great London Smog and the first recognized episode of Los Angeles photochemical smog seventy years ago, substantial progress has been made in improving the scientific understanding of air pollution and in developing emissions reduction technologies. However, much remains to be understood about the complex processes of atmospheric oxidation mechanisms; the formation and evolution of secondary particles, especially those containing organic species; and the influence of emerging emissions sources and changing climate on air quality and health. While air quality has substantially improved in megacities in developed regions and some in the developing regions, many still suffer from severe air pollution. Strong regional and international collaboration in data collection and assessment will be beneficial in strengthening the capacity. This article provides an overview of the sources of emissions in megacities, atmospheric physicochemical processes, air quality trends and management in a few megacities, and the impacts on health and climate. The challenges and opportunities facing megacities due to lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic is also discussed.

Air pollution consists mainly of emissions of particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, ammonia and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The organic carbon fraction of particulate matter is a mixture of hundreds of organic compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), or polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), some of which are mutagenic and/or carcinogenic. Because this particulate matter represents a serious threat for human health, measures to reduce emissions and to eliminate contaminants need to be strongly reinforced, with a focus on novel biotechnologies.

The common dependency on fossil fuel energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the continuous rising demands for energy have posed challenges that put the world in a climate change trap. This work empirically analyzes the effect of innovation, oil price, oil price volatility and economic growth on GHG emissions over the period of 1991–2015. The study compares the emission level between European Union countries (EU) (26), oil-producing countries (22), China and the United States of America (USA) using the Driscoll–Kraay model. The main empirical finding points to a positive effect of innovation on GHG emission reduction initiatives in oil-importing economies. Particularly, EU countries significantly minimized emissions due to innovation, followed by China and the USA. Contrarily, the effect of innovation increases GHG emission in oil-exporting economies. The results also indicate broader significant effects of oil price and oil price volatility on GHG emission. Interestingly, the effect of oil price on GHG emission is asymmetrical between oil-exporting and-importing economies. Oil price increases in oil-importing countries decrease GHG emission; contrarily, its effect increases emissions in oil-exporting countries. Thus, oil-exporting countries lack motivation to decrease emission levels due to oil price escalation. Unlike the oil price, oil price volatility comparably decreases GHG emissions in oil-exporting and-importing economies. Thus, one might be tempted to take oil price volatility and the future uncertainty of oil price as a virtuous instance rather than oil price increment. Thus, policymakers need to pay attention to market forces and policy measures to monitor GHG emissions due to economic activities. The results are also robust under the alternative econometrics estimation model of generalized method of moments (GMM)-Differenced. © 2021 by the authors.

In this regard, the search for new solutions that prevent negative impact on the environment is one of the priority tasks for modern society. An alternative, but less efficient fuel compared to natural gas is biogas extracted from organic waste. The high content of carbon dioxide in biogas reduces the calorific value, while flame detachment from the burner is also observed. One of the promising options for reducing the negative impact of energy on the environment is the combined burning of natural gas and biogas. For the combined burning of natural gas and biogas in operating power-generating boiler, it is necessary to reconstruct the burner devices installed on them. For a high-quality reconstruction of burner devices, it is important to have theoretical data on the effect of combustion combinations on the content of toxic combustion products in the flue gases of power-generating boilers. In this paper, a turbulence model k - ϵ (realizable) is presented, which allows simulating the combustion process of a fuel-air mixture.

While there are frequent reports about up-regulation of defense signaling and production of defense metabolites in response to herbivory, much less is understood about the mechanisms by which growth and carbon assimilation are down-regulated. Here we demonstrate that insect herbivory down-regulates the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), a pathway making primarily metabolites for use in photosynthesis. Simulated feeding by the generalist herbivore Spodoptera littoralis suppressed flux through the MEP pathway and decreased steady-state levels of the intermediate 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP). Simulated herbivory also increased reactive oxygen species content which caused the conversion of β-carotene to β-cyclocitral (βCC). This volatile oxidation product affected the MEP pathway by directly inhibiting DXP synthase (DXS), the rate-controlling enzyme of the MEP pathway in Arabidopsis and inducing plant resistance against S. littoralis. βCC inhibited both DXS transcript accumulation and DXS activity. Molecular models suggested that βCC binds to DXS at the binding site for the thymine pyrophosphate cofactor and blocks catalysis, which was confirmed by direct assays of βCC with the purified DXS protein in vitro. Another intermediate of the MEP pathway, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2, 4-cyclodiphosphate, which is known to stimulate salicylate defense signaling, showed greater accumulation and enhanced export out of the plastid in response to simulated herbivory.

Increasing clean energy infrastructure for EVs is a possible solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help improve air quality in urban areas. Electric vehicles charged by electricity from photovoltaic (PV) systems can produce less emissions than conventional EVs charged by the utility grid. Thus, the combination of solar power and EV charging stations is one of the possible methods to achieve sustainable development in the current EV market. EVs in cities in Vietnam have developed very quickly in recent times, but the charging station infrastructure is still very limited, and most existing charging stations use electricity from the utility grid. In this paper, the optimal configuration of PV-powered EV charging stations is analyzed technically and economically under different solar irradiation conditions in Vietnam. The study results show that the optimal configuration and investment efficiency of PV-powered EV charging stations in each urban area are greatly affected by the solar irradiation value and feed-in tariff (FIT) price of rooftop solar power. In Vietnam, a region with high solar irradiation, such as Ho Chi Minh, is more likely to invest in PV-powered EV charging stations than other areas with lower solar irradiation, such as Hanoi. © 2021 by the authors.

Heritage sites can be constructed with non-sustainable materials, and they occupy valuable space that city planners could otherwise use. Heritage trails offer a solution. In addition to providing access to cultural sites, these trails are beneficial to the environment for two reasons. First, they promote emissions-free activities. Second, they are green spaces that offset carbon emissions.

Associated declines in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have prompted calls to action to use the pandemic experience to accelerate decarbonization. Such action depends on understanding how GHG emissions reductions were achieved and whether they can be sustained. In this work, we focus on the industrial sector by comparing United States (US) industrial energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and key materials production between the first two quarters (Q1 and Q2) of 2020, when pandemic response became active, relative to 2019. We show a striking decoupling between energy use and GHG emissions in the US industrial sector between Q2 2020 and Q2 2019, yet pandemic decarbonization in the industrial sector is unlikely to be durable. Observations suggest three major takeaways for US industrial decarbonization: (1) efforts to decarbonize transportation will contribute to industrial decarbonization due to the large impacts of petroleum refining; (2) increasing demands for materials that use energy resources as feedstocks (e.g., plastics) can result in an apparent decoupling in energy demand and GHG emissions that is not indicative of a durable pathway for reducing GHG emissions; and (3) temporary reduction in demand for industrial infrastructure materials would have resulted in greater reductions of GHG emissions than the relative change in fuels used during this period. Cumulatively, while shifts that would lower GHG emissions occurred, no substantial structural changes to industrial activity were observed. As such, society still requires systemic change to interdependencies on other sectors and the methods we use to produce and deploy our industrial materials. © 2021 The Author(s).

Regarding the latter, regional climate models have no way of assimilating future aerosol concentrations, so dust aerosol emissions must be parameterized using local landscape and meteorological conditions. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of different dust emission settings within the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) to facilitate future dynamical downscaling work. This study performs nine WRF-Chem hindcasts, each utilizing a different dust emission configuration, from 1 March to 31 May 2015, coinciding with a Saharan air layer (SAL) dust outbreak during the 2015 Caribbean drought. WRF-Chem aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Gálvez-Davison Index (GDI), a convective forecasting parameter, are validated against analogous MODIS, AERONET, and ERA5 products. In aggregate, the GOCART dust emission scheme with Air Force Weather Agency modifications (GOCART-AFWA) achieved the best balance between AOD and GDI accuracy when employing the default tuning constant (1.00). As the schemes emitted dust more aggressively, WRF-Chem produced warming at 500 hPa, reducing GDI over the central and eastern Atlantic near the modeled dust trajectory. Though AOD was generally too low over the southwest Atlantic, the eastern Caribbean occupies a transition zone between negative and positive AOD biases where this field was hindcast with relative accuracy. Meanwhile, areas with positive AOD biases were associated with negative GDI biases (and vice versa) indicating the covariability between SAL dust loadings and thermodynamic conditions in the tropical north Atlantic. © 2021.

The findings demonstrated that an increasing temperature and a decreasing rainfall trends were perceived by farmers across the study decades. Higher deforestation rate, rash natural resource exploitation, poor soil and water management rehearses and alarming population growth in descending order were identified as climate change causes. Livestock and crop yield decline, livestock/human diseases epidemics and death, as well as recurrent conflicts due to grazing land were its associated impacts. The status and nature of climate change causes, indicators and impacts were however significantly diverse within similar awareness groups. To mitigate its adverse impacts, the farmers were thus applied livestock, crop and non-agriculture related adaptation strategies. Shortage of finance and eligible household labor combined with the absence of climate related information, training and extension services were hindered farmers to take any measure to the climate change. Therefore, to encourage the farmers’ responsiveness, the finding underlines the importance of supplying applicable as well as legitimate natural resource exploitation system, followed by access to climate related information, awareness rising trainings, credit and input delivery services at local and community level. © 2021 The Author(s)Abergelle district, adaptation strategies, climate change, climate change perception, rainfall anomaly index. © 2021 The Author(s)","Abergelle district; Adaptation strategies; Climate change; Climate change perception; Rainfall anomaly index",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102572359

Data were obtained with different X-ray satellites, namely XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, Swift, and Chandra, and cover different time intervals, from a few days to years. From 2006 to 2013 the source had a 2-10 keV flux of ∼1.5 × 10-11 erg cm-2 s-1, consistent with archival observations based on HEAO and BeppoSAX data, though a 2019 Chandra snapshot caught the source in an extreme low flux state a factor of ∼10 fainter than its historical level. Based on phenomenological and physically motivated models, we find the X-ray spectrum of MCG-01-24-12 to be best modelled by a power-law continuum emission with Γ = 1.76 ± 0.09 with a high energy cut-off at Ec = 70-14+21 keV that is absorbed by a fairly constant column density of NH = (6.3 ± 0.5) ×â€† 1022 cm-2. These quantities allowed us to estimate the properties of the hot corona in MCG-01-24-12 for the cases of a spherical or slab-like hot Comptonising plasma to be kTe = 27-4+8 keV, τe = 5.5 ± 1.3 and kTe = 28-5+7 keV, τ = 3.2 ± 0.8, respectively.

Furthermore, if incineration is to be the primary waste end-life disposal method, it is critically important to exclude plastic wastes from incineration wastes and improve the energy recovery efficiency, while the landfilling with landfill gas collection still can be a good option for MSW disposal, or expanding the processing capacity of composting plant, to achieve the better outcomes of greenhouse gas mitigation.

However, previous studies have rarely distinguished different energy consumption levels (ECLs) in investigations of energy-saving psychological motivation. To promote the energy-saving of households with different ECLs, a two-stage study was conducted in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. First, we clustered the annual electricity consumption of all households in the sample communities (4,422) and classified the household ECLs into three levels: high, medium, and low. Then, based on the theory of planned behavior, we investigated and analyzed the differences in the psychological factors affecting actual household electricity consumption of the three household types with different ECLs.

In addition, significant differences existed in energy conservation psychology among the three types of ECLs.

In particular, an increase in relative abundance and cover of deciduous shrub species (shrubification) has been recorded. We inferred genetic variation of common shrub species (Alnus alnobetula, Betula nana, Salix sp.) through time. Chloroplast genomes were assembled from modern plants (n = 15) from the Siberian forest-tundra ecotone. Sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA; n = 4) was retrieved from a lake on the southern Taymyr Peninsula and analyzed by metagenomics shotgun sequencing and a hybridization capture approach. For A. alnobetula, analyses of modern DNA showed low intraspecies genetic variability and a clear geographical structure in haplotype distribution. In contrast, B. nana showed high intraspecies genetic diversity and weak geographical structure. Analyses of sedaDNA revealed a decreasing relative abundance of Alnus since 5,400 cal yr BP, whereas Betula and Salix increased. A comparison between genetic variations identified in modern DNA and sedaDNA showed that Alnus variants were maintained over the last 6,700 years in the Taymyr region. In accordance with modern individuals, the variants retrieved from Betula and Salix sedaDNA showed higher genetic diversity. The success of the hybridization capture in retrieving diverged sequences demonstrates the high potential for future studies of plant biodiversity as well as specific genetic variation on ancient DNA from lake sediments. Overall, our results suggest that shrubification has species-specific trajectories. The low genetic diversity in A. alnobetula suggests a local population recruitment and growth response of the already present communities, whereas the higher genetic variability and lack of geographical structure in B. nana may indicate a recruitment from different populations due to more efficient seed dispersal, increasing the genetic connectivity over long distances. © 2021 The Authors.

Institutions often utilize the concept of the ecological 'footprint' to quantify and track nitrogen emissions resulting from their activities and guide plans and commitments to reduce emissions. Often, large-scale changes and commitments to reduce nitrogen footprints are not feasible at small institutions due to monetary and manpower constraints. We partnered with managers in the dining and facilities departments at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), a small research institution in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, to develop five low-effort strategies to address nitrogen emissions at the institution using only resources currently available within those departments. Each proposed strategy achieved emissions reductions in their sector and in the overall nitrogen footprint of the MBL. If all modelled strategies are applied simultaneously, the MBL can achieve a 7.7% decrease in its nitrogen footprint. Managers at MBL considered strategies that required no monetary input most feasible. The intersection of carbon and nitrogen emissions also means the modelled strategies had the co-benefit of reducing the MBL's carbon footprint, strengthening the argument for applying these strategies. This paper may serve as a model for similar institutions looking to reduce the ecological impact of their activities. © 2021 The Author(s).

To investigate the impact of the lockdown on aerosol chemistry, the number fraction, size distribution and formation process of oxalic acid (C2) containing particles and its precursors were studied using a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS) at the urban site of Liaocheng in the North China Plain (NCP). Our results showed that five air pollutants (i.e., PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO) decreased by 30.0–59.8% during the lockdown compared to those before the lockdown, while O3 increased by 63.9% during the lockdown mainly due to the inefficient titration effect of O3 via NO reduction. The increased O3 concentration can boost the atmospheric oxidizing capacity and further enhance the formation of secondary organic aerosols, thereby significantly enhancing the C2 particles and its precursors as observed during the lockdown. Before the lockdown, C2 particles were significantly originated from biomass burning emissions and their subsequent aqueous-phase oxidation. The hourly variation patterns and correlation analysis before the lockdown suggested that relative humidity (RH) and aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) played a key role in the formation of C2 particles and the increased aerosol acidity can promote the conversion of precursors such as glyoxal (Gly) and methyglyoxal (mGly) into C2 particles in the aqueous phase. RH and ALWC decreased sharply but O3 concentration and solar radiation increased remarkably during the lockdown, the O3-dominated photochemical pathways played an important role in the formation of C2 particles in which aerosol acidity was ineffective. Our study indicated that air pollution treatment sponges on a joint-control and balanced strategy for controlling numerous pollutants. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19 lockdown; Formation mechanisms; Glyoxal and methyglyoxal; Oxalic acid; Ozone","Aerosols; Air pollution control; Atmospheric humidity; Oxalic acid; Particle size analysis; Photochemical forming; Sulfur dioxide; Urban growth; Aerosol mass spectrometers; Air pollutant emission; Aqueous phase oxidations; Biomass burning emissions; Correlation analysis; Liquid water content; Photochemical pathways; Secondary organic aerosols; Air pollution; carbon monoxide; glyoxal; methylglyoxal; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; oxalic acid; ozone; sulfur dioxide; aerosol composition; aerosol formation; aldehyde; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; oxalic acid; ozone; photochemistry; size distribution; viral disease; air pollution; air quality; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; humidity; lockdown; meteorological phenomena; oxidation; particle size; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; photochemical formation; priority journal; secondary organic aerosol; solar radiation; water content; aerosol; air pollutant; China; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; human; particulate matter; photochemistry; China; Liaocheng; North China Plain; Shandong; Coronavirus; Porifera; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; China; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Photochemical Processes; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096558685

However, this topic has not been adequately addressed in previous studies. Therefore, it is of great significance to conduct an empirical investigation of the interactions between urbanisation, industrialisation and CEs. Aided by the gravity model, the barycentre trajectories of urbanisation, industrialisation and CEs are analysed. Additionally, the total transfer amounts of industry and CEs are quantitatively examined by using an improved shift-share analysis method, and the spatial aggregation features of urbanisation, industrialisation and CEs are elucidated by constructing a three-dimensional (3D) contribution matrix model. The key conclusions are as follows: (1) The barycentre of industrialisation and urbanisation migrated to the southwest, while that of CE migrated to the northwest and the speed of this movement was faster than that of urbanisation and industrialisation. (2) Industrial transfer mainly occurred in 2005–2012, while the turning point of industrial upgrading appeared in 2013. Furthermore, midwestern regions mainly underwent industrial transfer, while northwest regions always showed CEs transfer from 2005 to 2016. (3) To achieve coordination among urbanisation, industrialisation and emission reductions, 30 provinces are grouped into 8 types according to the 3D contribution matrix model, and optimisation strategies are proposed to highlight regional disparities. These findings have significant implications for making informed decisions regarding urbanisation and industrialisation development as well as emissions-reduction policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; Industrialisation; Spatiotemporal agglomeration; Transfer; Urbanisation","Carbon; Economics; Emission control; Regional planning; Empirical investigation; Industrial transfers; Industrial upgrading; Regional disparities; Regional economic development; Spatial aggregation; Spatiotemporal effects; Threedimensional (3-d); Transfer matrix method; agglomeration; carbon emission; economic development; emission control; industrialization; spatiotemporal analysis; urbanization; analytic method; Article; carbon footprint; China; cluster analysis; empirical research; environmental impact; gravity model; industrial production; industrialization; organizational policy; priority journal; process optimization; quantitative analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098091093

It is able to deal with the intertemporal incomparability when adopting a global technology. In the empirical study, we categorized China's 27 manufacturing sectors into five groups and evaluated their emission performance under different mitigation strategies during 2003–2016. According to the empirical results, we found that there is still much potential (about 70%–80%) for improving the CO2 emission performance considering the entire manufacturing industry. From the perspective of different groups, the global technologies/innovators group shows the highest emission efficiency, while the energy-/resource-intensive commodities’ group performed the worst. Besides, different sectors showed significant technology heterogeneity. Finally, the desirable CO2 mitigation strategies varied with the different groups. For the labor-intensive tradables’ group, we found that the desirable strategy is to decrease the input of energy and other production factors, i.e. scale-oriented strategy. For the regional processing group, the innovation-oriented strategy is more efficient. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; CO2 emission performance; Manufacturing sectors; Meta-frontier; Natural and managerial disposability","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Emission efficiencies; Emission performance; Integrated approach; Manufacturing industries; Manufacturing sector; Mitigation strategy; Production factors; Regional processing; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098758303

The hurricane contributed to the loss of housing, power, family and friends, and sense of security. This study aimed to identify the predictors of Puerto Ricans' perceived stress changes and mental health as self-reported after Hurricane Maria. Methods: Data collected by Kaiser Foundation-Washington Post in 2018 were obtained and analyzed using SAS v9.4 complex survey procedures. After the population weight was applied, multinomial logistic regressions were employed to identify predictors of participants' perceived stress changes and self-reported level of mental health. Results: Those whose general stress level was reported as worse after Hurricane Maria were more likely to have reported having generally poor mental health (OR 20.67; 95% CI 95% 8.60-49.69) and to have been impacted by the hurricane in various ways (OR 1.85; 95% [1.21, 2.85]).Those who reported their general level of mental health as poor were more likely to report their general stress level as worse (OR 10.54; 95% CI [4.06-27.37]), and reported having to leave or evacuate as a result of Hurricane Maria (OR 2.44; 95% CI [1.20-5.65]). Discussion: A significant effect was shown for those who reported worse stress levels than those with better stress levels after the hurricane, and for those who reported good, fair, or poor general mental health. Conclusion: Owing to the impact of environmental disaster and current pandemic crisis on Puerto Rican citizens, it is imperative for both local and federal governments to enact plans to lessen resident mental health burden to reassure and facilitate access to mental health services after natural disasters. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.","hurricane; mental health; natural disaster; Puerto Rico; stress","climate change; detection method; environmental change; health services; health survey; hurricane; mental health; natural disaster; perception; spatiotemporal analysis; Puerto Rico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101538919

Recalcitrant compounds such as high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HMW-PAHs) and heavy alkanes commonly remain after standard soil bioremediation at concentrations above regulatory limits. The present study assessed the potential of native fungal bioaugmentation as a strategy to promote the bioremediation of an aged industrially polluted soil enriched with heavy hydrocarbon fractions. Microcosms assays were performed by means of biostimulation and bioaugmentation, by inoculating a defined consortium of six potentially hydrocarbonoclastic fungi belonging to the genera Penicillium, Ulocladium, Aspergillus, and Fusarium, which were isolated previously from the polluted soil. The biodegradation performance of fungal bioaugmentation was compared with soil biostimulation (water and nutrient addition) and with untreated soil as a control. Fungal bioaugmentation resulted in a higher biodegradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and of HMW-PAHs than with biostimulation. TPH (C14-C35) decreased by a 39.90 ± 1.99% in bioaugmented microcosms vs. a 24.17 ± 1.31% in biostimulated microcosms. As for the effect of fungal bioaugmentation on HMW-PAHs, the 5-ringed benzo(a)fluoranthene and benzo(a)pyrene were reduced by a 36% and 46%, respectively, while the 6-ringed benzoperylene decreased by a 28%, after 120 days of treatment. Biostimulated microcosm exhibited a significantly lower reduction of 5- and 6-ringed PAHs (8% and 5% respectively). Higher TPH and HMW-PAHs biodegradation levels in bioaugmented microcosms were also associated to a significant decrease in acute ecotoxicity (EC50) by Vibrio fischeri bioluminiscence inhibition assays. Molecular profiling and counting of viable hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria from soil microcosms revealed that fungal bioaugmentation promoted the growth of autochthonous active hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. The implementation of such an approach to enhance hydrocarbon biodegradation should be considered as a novel bioremediation strategy for the treatment of the most recalcitrant and highly genotoxic hydrocarbons in aged industrially polluted soils. © Copyright © 2021 Medaura, Guivernau, Moreno-Ventas, Prenafeta-Boldú and Viñas.","aged-polluted soil; fungal-bacterial interactions; high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; indigenous hydrocarbonoclastic fungi; mycoremediation; native-fungal-bioaugmentation","benzo[a]pyrene; benzo[k]fluoranthene; phenanthrene; serotonin; acute toxicity; Article; community dynamics; ecotoxicity; enzyme activity; fungus isolation; gas chromatography; genotoxicity; germination; marine environment; mass fragmentography; microbial community; microbial diversity; microcosm; nonhuman; prevalence; respirometry; Sanger sequencing; sequence homology; soil microflora; spore germination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104191506

These crops are considered very susceptible to oxygen-deficient soil conditions resulting from flooding. We investigated physiological and biochemical responses to flooding of six Prunus spp. rootstocks including Flordaguard, are commonly used as a rootstock for peaches in the subtropics. Flooding caused a reduction in net CO2 assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (gs), and leaf nutrient contents in all rootstocks tested. Antioxidant activity, osmolyte concentrations, lipid peroxidation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity increased in response to flooding in all rootstocks. After exposure to flooding, rootstocks MP-29 and R5064-5 had higher A, gs, antioxidant activities, and osmolyte concentration, and lower lipid peroxidation and ROS activity than the other rootstocks. These two rootstocks also had higher leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) contents than the other rootstocks. Although leaf iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) contents increased in all rootstocks exposed to flooding, MP-29 and R5064-5 exhibited the lowest increases in leaf Mn and Fe concentrations. Thus, rootstocks MP-29 and 5064-5 are better suited to subtropical areas prone to flooding than the other rootstocks, including Flordaguard. In the two rootstocks that were the most tolerant of flooding, greater antioxidant activities and osmolyte concentrations appeared to efficiently mitigate oxidative damage caused by oxygen deficiency. Also, osmolyte concentration and lipid peroxidation appear to be potential indicators of sensitivity to flooding stress in Prunus rootstocks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Antioxidant; Net CO2 assimilation; Osmolytes; Oxidative damage; Proline; Stomatal conductance","antioxidant; biochemical composition; biochemistry; deciduous tree; environmental indicator; flooding; physiology; rootstock; subtropical region; Prunus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098847314

Higher CO2 increases leaf area (LAI), thereby increasing transpiration and water losses. Simultaneously, elevated CO2 reduces stomatal conductance and transpiration, thereby increasing rootzone soil moisture. Which mechanism dominates in the future is highly uncertain, partly because these two processes are difficult to explicitly separate within dynamic vegetation models. We address this challenge by using the GISS ModelE global climate model to conduct a novel set of idealized 2×CO2 sensitivity experiments to: evaluate the total vegetation biophysical contribution to regional climate change under high CO2; and quantify the separate contributions of enhanced LAI and reduced stomatal conductance to regional hydroclimate responses. We find that increased LAI exacerbates soil moisture deficits across the sub-tropics and more water-limited regions, but also attenuates warming by ∼0.5–1°C in the US Southwest, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and northern South America. Reduced stomatal conductance effects contribute ∼1°C of summertime warming. For some regions, enhanced LAI and reduced stomatal conductance produce nonlinear and either competing or mutually amplifying hydroclimate responses. In northeastern Australia, these effects combine to exacerbate radiation-forced warming and contribute to year-round water limitation. Conversely, at higher latitudes these combined effects result in less warming than would otherwise be predicted due to nonlinear responses. These results highlight substantial regional variation in CO2-driven vegetation responses and the importance of improving model representations of these processes to better quantify regional hydroclimate impacts. © 2021.

Here we use a soil–vegetation gradient in an Australian sub-alpine ecosystem to examine links between composition of soil microbial communities, and the fluxes of greenhouse gases they regulate. For each soil/vegetation type (forest, grassland, and bog), we meas-ured carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 fluxes and their production/consumption at 5 cm intervals to a depth of 30 cm. All soils were sources of CO2, ranging from 49 to 93 mg CO2 m−2 h−1. Forest soils were strong net sinks for CH4, at rates of up to −413 µg CH4 m−2 h−1. Grassland soils varied, with some soils acting as sources and some as sinks, but overall averaged −97 µg CH4 m−2 h−1. Bog soils were net sources of CH4 (+340 µg CH4 m−2 h−1). Methanotrophs were dominated by USCα in forest and grassland soils, and Candidatus Methylomirabilis in the bog soils. Methylocystis were also de-tected at relatively low abundance in all soils. Our study suggests that there is a disproportionately large contribution of these ecosystems to the global soil CH4 sink, which highlights our dependence on soil ecosystem services in remote locations driven by unique populations of soil microbes. It is paramount to explore and understand these remote, hard-to-reach ecosystems to better understand biogeochemical cycles that underpin global sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

This study examines the fuel interchangeability potential of a novel annular cylindrical burner made of a Ni-Al intermetallic with advanced high-temperature properties. The burner is designed to operate in the internal combustion mode when the reactions are aerodynamically stabilized in the volume of the cylindrical cavity. The stability limits, radiation efficiency, and CO/NOX emissions of the burner were studied within the firing rate range of 160–420 kW/m2 and the equivalence ratio range of 0.5–1.0. Experiments were carried out for the natural gas and its blends with CO2, H2 and H2-CO, whose flame speeds differ by a factor of three. The addition of H2 and CO to natural gas was found to reduce emissions and expands the radiant operation mode to a lean region without loss in radiation efficiency. The addition of CO2 to natural gas also reduces NOX, but CO emission increases, radiation efficiency decreases and the infrared range is narrowed. For all studied fuels, within the ranges of firing rates of 260–420 kW/m2 and equivalence ratios of 0.70–0.95, the burner operates in stable radiant mode with a radiation efficiency up to 30–45%, NOX emission of 10–50 ppm, and CO emission of 0–40 ppm. In general, the results confirm the fuel flexibility of the new radiant burner to be much the same as for other radiant burners; however, the radiation efficiency is substantially higher than that for cylindrical radiant burners of other designs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas; Efficiency; Emission; Radiant burner; Stability; Syngas","Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Natural gas; Cylindrical cavities; Equivalence ratios; Fuel flexibility; Internal combustion; Lean premixed combustion; Ni-Al intermetallics; Radiation efficiency; Renewable energies; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095995098

Waste includes abundant volumes of paper sludge, as well as the product of its incineration, namely paper sludge ash. These two waste materials are both predominantly landfilled. There is thus a drive for additional valorisation routes for these materials. This short communication focuses on the potential use of paper sludge ash in alkali-activated cement concrete; this type of concrete was estimated to potentially reduce CO2 emissions by up to 5–6 times, while it can also incorporate waste materials or industrial by-products in its composition. The paper presents a laboratory study assessing the feasibility of structural alkali-activated cement concrete with ground granulated blastfurnace slag (a by-product of steel production) and paper sludge ash. Paper sludge ash is used mainly as a source of Ca(OH)2 in the alkaline activator solution, and secondly as an additional source of aluminosilicates. A number of factors potentially affecting the activation process and the resulting concrete quality were investigated, including different dosage of activators, curing conditions and curing time. Mixes with paper sludge ash in the activator system developed high early concrete strengths at ambient temperatures and maintained adequate strengths for structural concrete. Further mix optimisation and mechanical and durability testing, accompanied by material characterisation, are required to establish the advantages of using this waste material in structural alkali-activated cement concrete. © The Author(s) 2021.","alkali-activated cements; concrete; ground granulated blast furnace slag; paper sludge ash; Solid waste management","Cement industry; Cements; Concrete industry; Concrete mixtures; Curing; Durability; Hydrated lime; Industrial emissions; Municipal solid waste; Paper and pulp industry; Paper and pulp mills; Slags; Steelmaking; Activation process; Alkali activated cements; Alkali-activated slag concretes; Alkaline activators; Ground granulated blast furnace slag; Industrial by-products; Material characterisation; Structural concretes; Waste incineration; alkali; aluminum sodium silicate; carbon dioxide; cement; concrete; potassium hydroxide; concrete; industrial waste; municipal solid waste; pulp and paper industry; slag; sludge; waste management; Article; ash; compressive strength; feasibility study; municipal solid waste; paper mill; pulp and paper industry; recycling; scanning electron microscopy; slag; sludge; solid waste; solid waste management; tensile strength; waste management; building material; incineration; industrial waste; Ash; Calcium Hydroxide; Concrete; Curing; Durability; Paper Industry; Sludge; Wastes; Alkalies; Construction Materials; Incineration; Industrial Waste; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100522110

In an industry growth currently supported by subsidies, cost-efficient battery plant sizes are vital for the establishment of a self-sustaining industry and a transition into a long-term climate-neutral society. For optimal plant sizing, no consensus has yet been achieved in the battery literature and a detailed analysis of economies of scale is unavailable. To close this gap, a process-based cost modeling approach is taken that reflects the determinants of economies of scale. In state-of-the-art, minimum viable plant sizes are demonstrated to be below 2 GWh year−1 but may exceed 15 GWh year−1 in the future. This study finds that economies of scale are related to the capacity of the roll-to-roll processes in electrode manufacturing and can be maximized if the respective equipment operates at its capacity limit. This capacity depends on materials, cell design and roll-to-roll process parameters. Since these parameters improve over time, increased plant sizes will become necessary to achieve cost-efficient production levels. Required plant investments are found to decrease on a per GWh basis, whereas significantly increased funds will become necessary to reach efficient plant sizes in the future. Finally, implications are presented that support future battery cost reductions and a self-sustaining market breakthrough of battery-powered products. © 2021 The Author(s)","Battery cost; Battery manufacturing; Economies of scale; Minimum efficient scale; Plant size","Cost reduction; Investments; Manufacture; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Battery production; Economies of scale; Plant investments; Process Innovation; Process-based cost models; Renewable energy source; Roll-to-roll process; State of the art; Economics; alternative energy; economic analysis; electric vehicle; electrode; energy storage; industrial development; innovation; manufacturing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099796430

Mexico is reallocating its public expenditure to attend country-wide social needs causing budgetary constraints, which hinders PES and ENAREDD+ as funding sources. This led the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC) to consider a PES with a matching funds approach to provide sufficient financial resources for adaptation measures. To estimate the available funds, INECC developed an exercise of economic valuation of ecosystem services. The watershed of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco, Mexico, was the chosen location given its ecological and touristic importance and because of its urgent need to implement adaptation measures due to its heighted vulnerability to climate change. This article intends to showcase the value that upstream ecosystem services provide to tourism, the potential to implement adaptation measures in the region and to estimate local available funds to develop ecosystem-based adaptation measures (EbA). A literature review was conducted to understand the regional environmental, social, and economic dynamics and to identify the main ecosystem services; then, the value of ecosystem services was estimated via the willingness to pay and accept (WTP and WTA) using contingent valuation. Also economic data regarding forestry and agriculture was collected to calculate the forest conservation opportunity cost.

Transport and mobility represent the main sources of these emissions, particularly in urban settings. National and local public administrations need accurate and more responsive tools to quantify GHG emissions. Digitisation and ICTs are key elements in the development of such tools, which, additionally, have to be based on robust methodologies validated by the scientific community. This research presents a bottom-up methodology for the quantification of road traffic's GHG emissions with higher levels of immediacy and spatial resolution when compared to other already existing methods. The methodology uses data from the urban traffic control and monitoring systems as a baseline to calculate emissions. A pilot test has been conducted in Valencia city (Spain). Its results show a highly detailed picture of GHG emission in the city with high temporal (hour) and space (street) resolutions. The emission patterns reflect the dynamics of the city and its citizenship mobility. Since the tools developed for the pilot test can be adapted to other cities, public decision-makers could benefit from a precise diagnosis system based on traffic data to offer and evaluate solutions to reduce road transport GHG emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Decision making tool; GHG; Real time emission monitoring; Urban road transport","Decision making; Gas emissions; Public administration; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Urban transportation; Diagnosis systems; Emission pattern; ITS applications; Scientific community; Spatial resolution; Sustainable cities; Transport and mobilities; Urban traffic control; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098689291

Oases settlements face several environmental challenges such as climate change, which can render them insufferably hot and unlivable within decades. Therefore, this study aims to assess the outdoor thermal comfort variation within three different oases urban fabrics of Tolga Oases Complex in Algeria. The overarching aim is to quantify thermal comfort and guide landscape, and urban designers improve outdoor thermal comfort. The methodology relies on microclimatic measurements and weather datasets (TMY2, TMY3, TMYx), combining observations and numerical simulations. A total of 648 Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) values were calculated in three different urban fabrics in Tolga Oases Complex, Algeria. Between 2003 and 2017, a remarkable microclimatic change was found, causing a high and accelerated heat stress level of 76%. The study results inform architects, urban planners and climatologists about climate change effects and urban sprawl impact on the oases lands. Moreover, urban strategies should seek mitigation and adaptation benefiting from the existing green infrastructure of palm groves. © 2021 by the authors.","Area occupancy; Arid climate; ENVI-met; Oasis settlement; PET; RayMan; Sky view factor","adaptive management; climate change; greenspace; heating; oasis; quantitative analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; urban agriculture; urban area; urban sprawl; Algeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103297149

In this regard, we studied the use of hot air, microwaves, superheated steam, infrared, and magnetic induction, and their combinations for the case of the pizza industry. Pizzas cook in hot air impingement ovens were selected as a base case scenario. The quality properties of the pizzas produced by each technology were determined using instrumental techniques. Energy consumption and CO2 emissions were measured as well. Then, we explored the combination of technologies that minimize cooking time and found that it can be reduced by 50% when using infrared in the last stage of the cooking process in hot air impingement ovens. This combination of cooking methods reduces the 27% energy consumption and 27.1% of the CO2 emissions while retaining the desired quality properties of the pizza. Practical applications: This work was developed in collaboration with a well-known international manufacturer of cooking equipment. This company, like several other communities, is aware that due to environmental and economic problems, the development of cleaner and more efficient technologies is urgent. However, most of the time, changes in any cooking equipment are related to changes in the quality of the final product. Thus, beyond the need for guiding principles to measure energy efficiency, there is a need for guidelines to measure product quality. Our work addresses those needs for the case of pizza, which is an international bakery product. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",,"Air pollution; Bakeries; Bakery products; Carbon dioxide; Cooking; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; Ovens; Productivity; Cooking technology; Economic problems; Efficient technology; Guiding principles; Instrumental techniques; Quality properties; Reducing energy consumption; Superheated steam; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100311688

However, how aridity influences the phylogenetic structure of functional groups (i.e. annual and perennial species) is far less understood than its effects on species richness. As perennials have to endure stressful conditions during the summer drought, as opposed to annuals that avoid it, they may be subjected to stronger environmental filtering. In contrast, annuals may be more susceptible to interannual climatic variability. Here we studied the phylogenetic structure of the annual and perennial components of understorey plant communities, along a regional aridity gradient in Mediterranean drylands. Specifically, we asked: (1) How do species richness (S) and phylogenetic structure (PS) of annuals and perennials in plant communities respond to aridity? (2) What is the contribution of other climatic and topo-edaphic variables in predicting S and PS for both components? (3) How does the taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover of annuals and perennials vary with spatial and environmental distances? We assessed annuals' and perennials' species richness, the phylogenetic structure at deep and shallow phylogenetic levels, and taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover along spatial and environmental distances. We found no relationship between annuals' richness and aridity, whereas perennials' richness showed a unimodal pattern. The phylogenetic structure of annuals and perennials showed contrasting responses to aridity and negatively correlated with topo-edaphic variables. We found phylogenetic clustering at intermediate-to-higher aridity levels for annuals, and at lower aridity levels for perennials. Both taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover in annuals and perennials correlated with the environmental distance rather than with spatial distance between communities, suggesting adaptation to local factors. Overall, our results show a decoupling in the response of the phylogenetic structure of annual and perennial components of plant communities to aridity in Mediterranean drylands.

We investigated tourism climate conditions in Fars province from 2006 to 2016 using tourism climate index (TCI). Also, modified inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation is applied to generate the optimal spatial pattern of the TCI distribution. The relationship between the interpolation accuracy and a critical IDW parameter, called power value (β), was evaluated for optimization. The results revealed that during four months of May, April, October, and November, 70–83% of cities in Fars province show excellent and ideal climatic comfort. In the four months of July, December, January, and March, about 45–54% of Fars province provide good and very good conditions for tourism activities. The spatial distribution of TCI also shows that the cities in the northern part generally have the most desirable conditions during the hot season, while the southern cities of Fars province are more suitable for tourism during the cold season. Also, analysis of optimization steps demonstrated that power value (β) affects interpolation accuracy. As our study suggests, using the optimal power values (β) of 1 and 2 can lead to optimal spatial interpolation of the TCI distribution. Overall, we found IDW and TCI as reliable tools for assessing bioclimatic comfort conditions, considering β-value as an influential factor that should be evaluated to achieve optimal interpolation results. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bioclimatic comfort; IDW; Optimized spatial pattern; Power value (β)","climate change; cold front; ecotourism; optimization; seasonality; spatial analysis; tourism development; Fars; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101524737

In recent times, Australia has suffered several network failures and power outages that have placed human lives and community infrastructure at extreme risk. Subsequently, a diverse array of energy storage systems have been commended as a potential solution for electricity network performance and resilience issues. At this critical juncture, this review suggests that an assemblage of currently lacking targeted energy storage systems and supply development policies will be required to grow and advance future domestic energy storage assets and infrastructure; while also providing a mechanism to address changing climatic conditions, variations in electricity demand and associated demand response, and a reduced dependency on coal-fired power generation. Importantly, the recognition of energy storage systems services value across the energy supply chain will be a critical component of future systems growth. In addition, while some specific regulatory changes to create a new energy capacity market will be required, the majority of electricity market rules and procedures will need to be maintained to allow entry of energy storage systems in scheduled and semi-scheduled modes. The review also identified the requirement for strong governance that supports continued renewable energy and energy storage investment, intergovernmental cooperation, and technical network upgrades. Ideally, the implementation of these policy options and regulations should result in a robust and resilient power grid, reduced emissions and economically efficient energy storage systems rollouts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Energy storage systems; Policy; Regulatory; Renewable energy","Climate change; Coal industry; Coal storage; Commerce; Data storage equipment; Electric energy storage; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Investments; Storage as a service (STaaS); Supply chains; Climatic conditions; Coal-fired power generation; Development policies; Electricity demands; Electricity market rules; Electricity networks; Energy storage systems; Energy supply chains; Outages",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098464068

Representation of these emission processes is essential for management and mitigation of CH4 emissions and is typically done using standardized emission factors applied at large spatial scales (e.g., state level). However, CH4-emitting activities and management decisions vary across facilities, and current inventories do not have sufficiently high spatial resolution to capture changes at this scale. Here, we develop a spatially explicit database of dairies in California, with information from operating permits and California-specific reports detailing herd demographics and manure management at the facility scale. We calculated manure management and enteric fermentation CH4 emissions using two previously published bottom-up approaches and a new farm-specific calculation developed in this work. We also estimate the effect of mitigation strategies the use of mechanical separators and installation of anaerobic digesters on CH4 emissions. We predict that implementation of digesters at the 106 dairies that are existing or planned in California will reduce manure CH4 emissions from those facilities by an average of 26% and total state CH4 emissions by 5% (or _ 36:5 GgCH4/yr). In addition to serving as a planning tool for mitigation, this database is useful as a prior for atmospheric observation-based emissions estimates, attribution of emissions to a specific facility, and validation of CH4 emissions reductions from management changes.

An inventory of tailing deposits and CO2 sources existing in Chile was constructed to determine the most suitable site for the installation of a future mineral carbonation plant and to evaluate the technical, economic, and environmental feasibility of CO2 capture, separation, and transport from the source to the mineral carbonation plant. The data of the inventory of tailings deposits in Chile were obtained from the National Service of Geology and Mining. For the thermoelectric plants installed in Chile, data of energy production were obtained from the Energy National Commission. Through the use of the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method and sensitivity analysis, the optimum location in the region of Antofagasta to install a mineral carbonation plant was identified. In addition, the results show that in the region of Antofagasta five tailing deposits have the potential to sequester between 66 to 99 Mt of CO2. Meanwhile, thermoelectric plants in 2018 produced about 9.4 Mt of CO2 that is available to be sequestered, with a maximum generation potential of 21.9 Mt of CO2eq per year.

The state-of-the-art catalyst (platinum based) have various limitations such as low abundance, extortionate price and sensitive towards impurities. Therefore, design of high performance non-platinum electrocatalyst is the most challenging issue for low temperature fuel cell. In this work, we discuss the nitrogen doping at defect sites of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) using melamine foam as a template for efficient CNT assembly with subsequent role of different nitrogen containing agents such as melamine and hexamine. Templated assembly of functionalized CNT through melamine foam provides easy approach towards nitrogen doping that followed effective exposure of active sites (like pyridinic-N and oxidic-N) for electroreduction of oxygen. As-prepared N-CNT catalysts (prepared using both the precursors) show better ORR activity than Pt/C in alkaline medium. A sharp reduction peak in their cyclic voltammogram under O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution proves their activity towards ORR electrocatalysis. More interestingly, the onset potentials of ~0.92 V and ~1.1 V versus RHE for N-CNT obtained by hexamine and melamine respectively indicate superior onsets than that of Pt/C (~1.04 V vs RHE). Furthermore, the best N-CNT catalyst (obtained by melamine) reveals better stability up to 15,000 cycles than Pt/C with zero response towards methanol, exhibiting an excellent methanol tolerance. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Kinetics; Melamine foam; Nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes; Oxygen reduction reaction","Catalysis; Defects; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Foams; Fuel cells; Methanol; Nanotubes; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Oxygen reduction reaction; Platinum; Potassium hydroxide; Temperature; Cyclic voltammograms; Electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reactions; Electroreduction of oxygens; Low temperature fuel cells; Methanol tolerance; Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs); Oxygen Reduction; State of the art; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100149664

RHS was used to replace 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30% by mass of Portland cement. The use of the waste material from burning rice husk in the mixtures contributes to a cleaner and more sustainable environment. The rheological behavior of fresh mixtures was investigated along with the time (15, 60, 120 e 180 min) by flow table test, modified Vicat and squeeze flow tests. In this research, an extension version of squeeze flow test was proposed, in which the samples are submitted to load and unload test (tensile test). The flow table results obtained showed that the workability of the mortars decreases as the RHS content increases. About 4% of the workability loss is related to the granular structure of mortars, and 96% about the porous structure of the RHS. In the Modified Vicat test, lower cone penetrations were observed as the RHS content increased, indicating the increase in the viscosities of mortars. Through the squeeze flow test, it was observed an increase in the mortar stiffness with the increase in RHS content and the increase in time. The maximum tensile load obtained in the unload squeeze flow test was higher as the replacement of Portland cement by RHS increased. Therefore, the mortars with higher RHS content are possibly able to retain more water, which may increase the adhesion with the substrate in the hardened state. In sum, the study shows that it is possible to produce eco-friendly mortar with a high quantity of RHS by increasing the time for application. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Modified vicat; Portland cement replacement; Reduce CO2 emissions; Rice husk silica; Squeeze flow","Mixtures; Portland cement; Rheology; Silica; Sustainable development; Tensile testing; Cone penetration; Granular structuress; Porous structures; Rheological behaviors; Rheological property; Rice husk silica; Sustainable environment; Workability loss; Mortar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098190586

Air quality level is determined by measures of several air pollutant concentrations. To create awareness among people, an automation system that forecasts the quality is needed. The COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions it has imposed on anthropogenic activities have resulted in a drop in air pollution in various cities in India. The overall air quality index (AQI) at any particular time is given as the maximum band for any pollutant. PM2.5 is a fine particulate matter of a size less than 2.5 micrometers, the inhalation of which causes adverse effects in people suffering from acute respiratory syndrome and other cardiovascular diseases. PM2.5 is a crucial factor in deciding the overall AQI. The proposed forecasting model is designed to predict the annual PM2.5 and AQI. The forecasting models are designed using Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average and Facebook’s Prophet Library through optimal hyperparameters for better prediction. An AQI category classification model is also presented using classical machine learning techniques.

In this paper, we estimate the commuter travel emissions of an out-of-town centre and evaluate the modelled emission against the targets set out by the UK government for 2030 (Climate Change Act), and 2050 (Committee on Climate Change, Kyoto protocol). For the study, primary data is provided by a leading retail centre in the UK in the form of home postcode, and mode selected by its staff for the commute. Each trip's details are extracted using a macro code linking the journey details with google map. An emission model is constructed through the Department for Transport's, Transport Appraisal Guidelines. Modelling for: a) Present mode share, b) Car only, and c) Bus only, with horizon modelling from 2010-2030. There are 3,444 staff working in the centre, 1743 (51%) use a car and 1701 (49%) bus for the everyday commute. Presently the average emission per person is 3 kg CO2e, modelled to decrease to 2.3 kg CO2e per journey by 2050. It is concluded from the study that a) average emissions for the same trip are expected to decrease, b) the emissions for bus journey are much lower than that of car, c) the targets set out for 2030, and 2050 will not be met if the present travel patterns continue. The modelling has considered advancements in technology, cleaner fuels, and electric vehicles' uptake. The deviation from 2030 and 2050 target is modelled as 29% and 56% respectively. The setout emissions targets are achievable only if a significant change in travel behaviour occurs supplemented by the uptake of sustainable transport modes such as cycling.

This is particularly related to the labour market, which may witness significant changes. Empirically, this issue has until now received limited attention. The links between poverty and climate change are explored mainly through the lenses of climate change adaptation, or via the effects of rising energy prices on the purchasing power of poor households. We aim to address this gap by using results from a simulation of the global energy transition required to meet the 2-degree target, and compare this to a 6-degree baseline scenario. The simulation with a multi-regional input–output model finds that, overall, this transition results in a small net job increase of 0.3% globally, with cross-country heterogeneity. We complement this macro-level analysis with cross-country household data to draw implications of the effects on poverty through labour market outcomes. The few job losses will be concentrated in specific industries, while new jobs will be created in industries that currently witness relatively high in-work poverty rates, such as construction. We show that high in-work poverty in the industries of interest, and especially in middle-income countries, is often associated with low skills and an insufficient reach of social protection mechanisms. We conclude that green transitions must ensure that the jobs created are indeed decent including fair wages, adequate working conditions, sufficient social protection measures, and accessible to the vulnerable and poorest households. © 2021 The Author(s).

The objective of this study was to: (a) examine historical weather data for the Canadian Prairie provinces and determine if there has been a change in the annual accumulation of CHU (ΣCHU), and (b) use updated technology and improved access to weather data to revise ΣCHU maps. Daily temperature data, recorded over the past century at 8,750 weather stations across Canada and consolidated into 1,413 sites were downloaded. There were 466 sites in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. The daily CHU were summed over the growing season for each site by year. The annual growing season for corn in the Prairies increased by 3–12 d over the past century, with greatest increases in southern and western locations. The change coincided with warmer springtime temperatures, allowing for earlier seeding, and warmer autumn temperatures, allowing for delayed harvest. During the past century, ΣCHU increased by 200–400 depending upon location, and the area with ΣCHU suitable for growing corn for silage has more than doubled to 915 thousand km2 (46% of the total area). These results provide tangible proof of climate change and its impacts on the potential for growing corn on the Prairies. The new ΣCHU maps can help farmers select regionally adapted corn hybrids.

Herein, an excellent catalytic activity of a 2D copper (Cu)-based conductive MOF, copper tetrahydroxyquinone (Cu-THQ), is reported for aqueous CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at low overpotentials. It is revealed that Cu-THQ nanoflakes (NFs) with an average lateral size of 140 nm exhibit a negligible overpotential of 16 mV for the activation of this reaction, a high current density of ≈173 mA cm−2 at −0.45 V versus RHE, an average Faradaic efficiency (F.E.) of ≈91% toward CO production, and a remarkable turnover frequency as high as ≈20.82 s−1. In the low overpotential range, the obtained CO formation current density is more than 35 and 25 times higher compared to state-of-the-art MOF and MOF-derived catalysts, respectively. The operando Cu K-edge X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal the existence of reduced Cu (Cu+) during CO2RR which reversibly returns to Cu2+ after the reaction.

In the past, many machine learning models are reported in the literature for pan evaporation modeling using the different combinationof available climatic variables. In order to develop a novel model with improved accuracy and reduced computational complexity, the functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) is chosen as an architecture to estimate daily pan evaporation in three agro-climatic zones (ACZs) of Chhattisgarh state in east-central India. Single neuron and single layer in its structure make it less complex as compared to other multilayer neural networks and neuro-fuzzy based hybrid models. Estimation results obtained with the FLANN model are compared with those obtained by multi-layer artificial neural networks (MLANN) and two empirical methods using the same raw data and corresponding features. Statistical indices like root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and efficiency factor (EF) is also computed to evaluate the model performance. It is demonstrated that pan evaporation estimates obtained with the proposed FLANN models provide an improved estimation of pan evaporation (RMSE = 0.85 to 1.27 mmd-1, MAE = 0.63 to 0.95 mmd-1 and EF = 0.70 to 0.89) as compared to MLANN (RMSE = 0.94 to 1.58 mmd-1, MAE = 0.73 to 1.14 mmd-1 and EF = 0.62 to 0.88) and empirical (RMSE = 1.19 to 2.19 mmd-1, MAE = 0.91 to 1.62 mmd-1 and EF = 0.49 to 0.88) models in different ACZs. © 2020 China Agricultural University","Empirical models; Functional link artificial neural network model; Low complexity; Multi-layer artificial neural network model; Pan evaporation estimation","Complex networks; Evaporation; Fuzzy neural networks; Mean square error; Network layers; Water management; Artificial neural network modeling; Empirical model; Functional link artificial neural networks; Low complexity; Pan evaporation; Multilayer neural networks; artificial neural network; complexity; empirical analysis; estimation method; evaporation; resource management; water resource; Chhattisgarh; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081934541

Precision of target delineation by seismic data for exploratory drilling strongly depends on resolution of the seismic image. However, resolution of the seismic image is restricted by the band-limited nature of the seismic signal and inherent deficiencies in signal enhancement and random noise attenuation methods. Generally, it is required to increase resolution of the seismic data both in time and frequency domains. General solution to achieve this goal is employing time – frequency transformation (TFT) methods. The most applicable and conventional TFT method is the short time Fourier transform (STFT). Nevertheless, the STFT method does not provide sufficient resolution for further seismological interpretation on data. Thus, reassignment and simultaneous synchrosqueezing transform methods were introduced that increase resolution in time by reassignment of coefficients to their true position. However, they are still not appropriate for obtaining required resolution in seismic signal. The local maximum synchrosqueezing transform (LMSST) was introduced as an efficient method for signal analysis. The LMSST method yet was not used for analysis of seismic data and the procedure of its parameters optimization for applying on seismic data is unclear. Therefore, in the presented study, we propose a strategy for defining optimum parameters of the LMSST method and the procedure of its application on seismic data, where high resolution seismic image is required for hydrocarbon exploration. The proposed strategy was applied on two synthetic data examples, considering the quality factor expression and contamination by random noise and a field data example from a natural gas reservoir. Result of applying the proposed strategy on synthetic and field data examples and comparison of results with the leading-edge methods, revealed that this strategy could be considered as an alternative to the common signal enhancement methods. Additionally, the proposed method consists of the advantage of easy implementation and full reconstruction of the original signal. It was also proved that the proposed strategy is a robust method against added random noise compared to other competitive methods when applied on nonstationary seismic signal. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","LMSST; Low frequency shadow; Reassignment method; Seismic signal analysis; STFT","Data handling; Economic geology; Hydrocarbon refining; Image enhancement; Natural gas fields; Petroleum analysis; Petroleum prospecting; Petroleum reservoirs; Seismic prospecting; Seismic response; Signal analysis; Frequency transformations; High resolution seismic; Hydrocarbon exploration; Parameters optimization; Seismic investigations; Seismic-signal analysis; Short time Fourier transforms; Time and frequency domains; Seismic waves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097716525

Methodology: Tree biomass was quantified using nondestructive methods. Carbon concentration in plants was computed using muffle furnace as suggested in combustion method. Results: The contribution of trees in agriculture land-use system was 11.68 mg ha-1 biomass. It comprised of 9.06 mg ha-1 and 2.62 mg ha-1 in aboveground and below ground biomass, respectively.The regression coefficients for all selected models were statistically significant, which showed strong correlation of aboveground biomass with dendrometric variables. Interpretation: Biomass pattern clearly reflects that more carbon is allocated to above ground components than belowground components. The enormous contribution of trees in agriculture land use system clearly amplifies its use for bioenergy.

Therefore, effective measures and policies that allow for a change in people’s mobility towards sustainable mobility must be derived. To understand how different people respond to measures and policies, and to increase the effectiveness of such policies, individual mobility needs and mobility determinants have to be considered. For this, the definition of individual mobility styles as holistic descriptions considering travel behavior, attitudes, as well as life stages is useful. This study presents a segmentation approach that identifies eight urban mobility styles by using data from a multidimensional survey conducted in Berlin and San Francisco. We applied a cluster analysis with both behavioral and attitudinal characteristics as segmentation criteria. By analyzing the characteristics, we identified a mobility style—the Environmentally Oriented Multimodals—that is environmentally oriented, but not yet all people in this cluster are sustainable in their mobility. Thus, they are the group with the highest potential to accept and use sustainable mobility. Additionally, we found that within the Environmentally Oriented Multimodals, the change from one life stage to another is also likely to be accompanied by a car acquisition. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we designed two different types of N-doped graphene surfaces, the graphitic-like nitrogen-doped graphene GnN and the pyridinic-like nitrogen-doped graphene GnN,n'V. We found that in the Au28/GnN system, the Au atoms interact with C atoms. However, in the Au28/GnN,n'V system, the Au atoms interact with the N atoms. Specifically, the different bonding modes result in the charge state of the Au cluster being negative on the GnN surface, whereas on the GnN,nV surface, the Au cluster is of positive charge. Therefore, it is possible to change the type of carbon-nitrogen bonding structure to control the charge types of gold clusters on nitrogen-doped graphene. In these two systems, the O2 molecules prefer to be activated at the unsaturated and electron-rich bridge sites of the Au cluster. O2 adsorption further enhances the charge transfer along the original directions at the Au28 cluster/N-doped graphene substrate interfaces. However, the charge states of Au clusters slightly affect the activation of O-O bonds.

However, the electrocatalytic performance of materials, especially the metal materials, toward the CO2RR is still limited due to the complex reaction processes and broad product distribution. Very recently, surface modification of metal materials has emerged as an effective way to boost their electrocatalytic CO2RR performance. Herein, recent advances in the surface modification of metal materials, which includes surface molecular functionalization, surface elemental doping, and surface plasma treatment, for CO2RR are presented. The surface modification-induced variations of surface states and electrocatalytic performances of metal materials, together with the underlying mechanisms, are highlighted. It is believed that the development of surface modification could promote the rational design and preparation of advanced CO2RR electrocatalysts toward practical applications. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), which can utilize renewable electricity to convert the greenhouse gas CO2 to high-value chemicals and fuels, provides a promising solution to solve environmental and energy problems simultaneously. Recently, surface modification has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of materials, especially metal materials, toward the CO2RR. In this review, three surface modification strategies of metal materials are summarized; i.e. surface molecular functionalization, surface elemental doping, and surface plasma treatment. Future efforts should focus on investigating the underlying mechanism of surface modification, fine modification of metal materials, and application of advanced technologies in surface modification. The development of surface modification will significantly promote the production of advanced CO2RR catalysts toward practical applications, benefiting the establishment of a sustainable society. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted great attention because it can transform the greenhouse gas CO2 to value-added chemicals, such as carbon monoxide, formic acid, ethylene, ethanol, and n-propanol.

The important goals in the coordinated development of this industry include the large-scale development of green buildings, the use of energy technologies to reduce carbon emissions, and an effective reduction of carbon intensity. Prefabricated buildings have become popular in this industry due to their low energy consumption, emission, and pollution and environment-friendly nature. This paper examines those factors that influence the carbon emissions from the construction of prefabricated buildings across three phases, namely, production in plants, logistics transportation, and assembly construction, builds an evaluation index system for studying the carbon emissions in the materialization phase of prefabricated buildings, and employs the hierarchical fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to construct an evaluation model. Results show that the overall energy consumption of prefabricated buildings is lower than that of traditional concrete pouring-type buildings. The hierarchical fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is scientific and reasonable when used to measure the comprehensive benefits of carbon emissions from prefabricated buildings. By taking a project in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province as an example, the comprehensive evaluation results show that the carbon emissions of this project are at moderate levels. The carbon emissions from prefabricated buildings can be reduced by expanding the market scale of the building industry, adjusting its use of building materials, and setting up special funds for these buildings. The findings of this work provide a certain reference value for analysing the differences between prefabricated and traditional buildings in terms of their carbon emissions in the materialization phase, for evaluating how the carbon emissions of the former can be reduced, and for formulating and executing building emission reduction plans. © 2021 Technoscience Publications.

The current understanding of the <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">COS</span> budget, however, lacks <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">COS</span> sources, which have previously been allocated to the tropical ocean. This paper presents a first attempt at global inverse modelling of <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">COS</span> within the 4-dimensional variational data-assimilation system of the TM5 chemistry transport model (TM5-4DVAR) and a comparison of the results with various <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">COS</span> observations. We focus on the global <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">COS</span> budget, including <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">COS</span> production from its precursors carbon disulfide (<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">CS2</span>) and dimethyl sulfide (<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">DMS</span>). To this end, we implemented <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">COS</span> uptake by soil and vegetation from an updated biosphere model (Simple Biosphere Model-SiB4). In the calculation of these fluxes, a fixed atmospheric mole fraction of 500 pmol mol<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">-1</span> was assumed. We also used new inventories for anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions. The model framework is capable of closing the <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">COS</span> budget by optimizing for missing emissions using NOAA observations in the period 2000-2012. The addition of 432 Gg a<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">-1</span> (as S equivalents) of <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">COS</span> is required to obtain a good fit with NOAA observations. This missing source shows few year-to-year variations but considerable seasonal variations. We found that the missing sources are likely located in the tropical regions, and an overestimated biospheric sink in the tropics cannot be ruled out due to missing observations in the tropical continental boundary layer. Moreover, high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere require extra <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">COS</span> uptake or reduced emissions. HIPPO (HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations) aircraft observations, NOAA airborne profiles from an ongoing monitoring programme and several satellite data sources are used to evaluate the optimized model results. This evaluation indicates that <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">COS</span> mole fractions in the free troposphere remain underestimated after optimization. Assimilation of HIPPO observations slightly improves this model bias, which implies that additional observations are urgently required to constrain sources and sinks of <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">COS</span>. We finally find that the biosphere flux dependency on the surface <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">COS</span> mole fraction (which was not accounted for in this study) may substantially lower the fluxes of the SiB4 biosphere model over strong-uptake regions. Using <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">COS</span> mole fractions from our inversion, the prior biosphere flux reduces from 1053 to 851 Gg a<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">-1</span>, which is closer to 738 Gg a<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">-1</span> as was found by <span classCombining double low line""cit"" idCombining double low line""xref-text.1""><a hrefCombining double low line""#bib1.bibx10"">Berry et al.</a> (<a hrefCombining double low line""#bib1.bibx10"">2013</a>)</span>.

Light limitation caused by accumulated litter under N enrichment is proposed as a main reason for the decreases of biodiversity and ecosystem C sequestration. However, mechanisms underlying this light limitation effect are not well understood, especially under different N input rates. We conducted a field manipulation experiment with N addition as the primary factor nested with litter manipulation as the secondary factor in an alpine meadow in 2017, measured ecosystem C fluxes and investigated the plant communities about 10 days after the N addition treatment, to examine the responses of biodiversity and ecosystem C sequestration to litter manipulation and N addition. Our results showed that alleviation of light limitation by removing litter increased plant species richness under N enrichment, which principally caused by higher species gains and lower losses. Common and rare species contributed most of the increased species as light limitation was relieved. N addition had no significant impact on net ecosystem productivity (NEP), whereas alleviation of light limitation and the subsequent increase in plant coverage and density under N enrichment stimulated gross primary productivity (GPP) but did not affect ecosystem respiration (ER), causing positive responses of NEP. This study highlights the promoting effect of the enhanced light availability through litter removal on species diversity and ecosystem C sequestration under N enrichment. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying light limitation influence on biodiversity and ecosystem C sequestration under N enrichment. We suggest that grassland management by removing the accumulated litter is an adaptive way to enhance light availability, mitigate diversity loss and thus increase C sequestration under eutrophication. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem C sequestration; Grassland management; Light limitation; Litter manipulation; N addition; Species turnover","alpine environment; biodiversity; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; forest ecosystem; grassland; leaf litter; light availability; meadow; net ecosystem exchange",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098469814

However, the Fe II line at 247.8572 nm interferes with the LIBS C measurement, resulting in C content overestimation. Due to the resolution limitation of common LIBS instruments, Fe II could not be identified and eliminated spectroscopically, and in natural soil the conventional method confirming constant emission intensity ratio of two Fe emission lines (Fe I line at 247.8572 nm and another Fe line which the upper energy level close or equal to the former) could not be used directly. Thus, in order to obtain the C content in soil, a high-resolution spectrometer (0.012 nm resolution) was employed to identify the C and Fe emission lines near 247.8561 nm in the standard reference soils 2709a (San Joaquin Soil) and 2711a (Montana II soil). For interference correction the emission line of Fe at 249.7819 nm was selected due to its constant ratio with delay time, and the least square method was employed to obtain the β coefficient of Fe 247.8572 nm emission line and the α coefficient of C 247.8561 nm emission line. The results demonstrated that suitable emission lines near 247.8561 nm could be identified using the high-resolution spectrometer, and the Fe interference could be reduced, even if the pure Fe 247.8572 nm intensity was unknown for the soil sample. The coefficient of α = 1600 and β = 3.02 were calculated from the case study and then the C content was corrected. With the Fe interference, the percentage of overestimated C was in the range of 15% to 58% in the used soil samples. This method minimizes C overestimation, and is less affected by soil heterogeneity and matrix effects, demonstrating its potential use in soil C quantification. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon atomic line; Fe interference; High-resolution spectrometer; Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy; Least square method","Atom lasers; Atomic emission spectroscopy; Electromagnetic wave emission; Iron compounds; Least squares approximations; Soil surveys; Soils; Spectrometers; Alpha coefficients; Constant-emissions; Conventional methods; High-resolution spectrometer; Iron interferences; Laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS); Least square methods; Soil heterogeneity; Iron metallography; emission inventory; heterogeneity; induced response; iron; laser method; least squares method; sampling; soil analysis; soil carbon; spectral resolution; spectroscopy; Montana; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098052591

This study investigated the combined application of EENFs with improved water and fertilizer management in an intensively irrigated spring maize rotation over five years in Northwestern China. High-frequency measurements of N2O fluxes were made throughout each year (both during crop growth and the fallow season) in five treatments: no N fertilizer as a control (CK), conventional N fertilization and irrigation (Con), optimum N fertilization and irrigation (Opt, 33% reduction in N fertilizer and 25% reduction of irrigation water), optimum N fertilization and irrigation with nitrification inhibitor (Opt + NI), and optimum N fertilization and irrigation with slow-release fertilizer (Opt-SRF). Annual mean cumulative N2O emissions reached 0.31 ± 0.07, 3.66 ± 0.19, 1.87 ± 0.16, 1.23 ± 0.13, and 1.61 ± 0.16 kg N2O–N ha−1 for CK, Con, Opt, Opt + NI, and Opt-SRF, respectively, with annual mean nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of 36, 54, 61 and 59% for Con, Opt, Opt + NI, and Opt-SRF, respectively. The Opt, Opt + NI and Opt-SRF treatments significantly reduced cumulative N2O emissions by 49%, 66%, and 56% (P &lt; 0.05), respectively, and increased NUE by 51%, 70%, and 66% (P &lt; 0.05), respectively, relative to Con. However, mean above-ground N uptake (288–309 kg N ha−1) and mean grain yields (12.7–12.8 Mg ha−1) did not differ significantly between the Con, Opt, Opt + NI, and Opt-SRF treatments during the five-year study. High N2O emissions mainly occurred within a few days of fertilization with irrigation, which could have been produced by microbially-mediated nitrifier or nitrifier denitrification processes. The fallow seasons had significantly lower cumulative N2O emissions, which were mainly attributed to the low temperature, low N inputs of crop residues, and low soil moisture conditions. Our study clearly indicated that the combined application of EENFs with optimum N fertilization and irrigation management can reduce environmental impacts while maintaining high crop yields in dryland regions such as Northwest China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; Enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizers (EENFs); N2O emission; Nitrification inhibitors (NIs); Slow-release fertilizer (SRF); Spring maize","Agricultural wastes; Crops; Efficiency; Irrigation; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Soil moisture; Temperature; Denitrification process; Enhanced efficiency; Fertilizer management; High frequency measurements; Irrigation management; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Slow release fertilizers; Nitrogen fertilizers; enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizer; nitrogen fertilizer; unclassified drug; crop yield; fertilizer application; irrigation; maize; nitrification; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; oxygen; agricultural land; Article; China; controlled study; denitrification; environmental impact; environmental management; fallow; farming system; harvest; irrigation (agriculture); maize; measurement; microbial activity; nitrification; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; plant growth; season; soil fertilization; soil moisture; spring; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099198582

These relatively short time-scales make these systems ideal laboratories to probe the coupling between accreting material and outflowing jets as the accretion rate varies. In particular, the origin of the hard X-ray emission is poorly understood and highly debated. This spectral component, which has a power-law shape, is due to Comptonization of photons near the black hole, but it is unclear whether it originates in the accretion flow itself, or at the base of the jet, or possibly the interface region between them. In this paper, we explore the disc-jet connection by modelling the multiwavelength emission of MAXI J1836-194 during its 2011 outburst. We combine radio through X-ray spectra, X-ray timing information, and a robust joint-fitting method to better isolate the jet's physical properties. Our results demonstrate that the jet base can produce power-law hard X-ray emission in this system/outburst, provided that its base is fairly compact and that the temperatures of the emitting electrons are subrelativistic. Because of energetic considerations, our model favours mildly pair-loaded jets carrying at least 20 pairs per proton. Finally, we find that the properties of the X-ray power spectrum are correlated with the jet properties, suggesting that an underlying physical process regulates both. © 2021 2020 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.","acceleration of particles; accretion, accretion discs; ISM: jets and outflows; X-rays: binaries; X-rays: individual (MAXI J836-194)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100718609

The Community Land Surface Model (CLM) has proposed an alternative approach for utilizing monthly climate outputs as forcing data since version 4.5, and it is called the anomaly forcing CLM. However, such an approach has never been validated for crop yield projections. In our work, we created anomaly forcing datasets for three climate scenarios (1.5 °C warming, 2.0 °C warming, and RCP4.5) and validated crop yields against the standard CLM forcing with the same climate scenarios using 3-hourly data. We found that the anomaly forcing CLM could not produce crop yields identical to the standard CLM due to the different submonthly variations, crop yields were underestimated by 5 %-8 % across the three scenarios (1.5, 2.0 °C, and RCP4.5) for the global average, and 28 %-41 % of cropland showed significantly different yields. However, the anomaly forcing CLM effectively captured the relative changes between scenarios and over time, as well as regional crop yield variations. We recommend that such an approach be used for qualitative analysis of crop yields when only monthly outputs are available. Our approach can be adopted by other land surface models to expand their capabilities for utilizing monthly climate data. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

In this paper, we systematically investigate the catalytic performance of different active sites, both on the undoped and N-doped graphene sheets, under non-strained (0%) and 1%, 5% and 10% lattice strain (LS) via density functional theory calculations. The results uncover that N-doping and LS synergistically modulate the electronic structures of graphene, enhancing the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. Among all models in this work, the site with the highest catalytic activity toward CO2RR is shown to be the carbon atom at the ortho-position (labeled as G2) relative to the nitrogen heteroatom (denoted by N1) on the graphene under 10% LS due to its lowest overpotential of 1.19 eV. Moreover, the projected density of states and the charge density differences of all systems are calculated to explore the mechanism for the enhancement of CO2 reduction performance. These analyses indicate that the localization of electron density on the G2 site makes it be the most active site on the N-doped graphene sheet for CO2RR. Hence, our computations demonstrate that by both nitrogen doping and LS increasing on the graphene sheet is a promising way for positive modulating its catalytic activity of the CO2RR. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","CO2 reduction reaction; density functional theory; lattice-strain; nitrogen-doped graphene; synergistic effect","Calculations; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Density functional theory; Doping (additives); Electronic structure; Greenhouse gases; Lattice theory; Nitrogen; Reduction; Catalytic performance; Charge density difference; Electrocatalytic reduction; First-principles investigations; Graphene sheets; Nitrogen-doping; Projected density of state; Synergistic effect; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096773472

Comparing with other geological reservoirs, the deep saline aquifers have huge storage potential and currently the most promising one. Since technical and economical viability of geologic CO2 storage depends highly on the CO2 storage capacity, this paper mainly uses the storage mechanism method to estimate the CO2 storage capacity of the Ordovician Majiagou Formation in order to give data support for GCS project in the Ordos Basin. The results show that the total effective CO2 storage capacity of the deep brine layer of the Ordovician Majiagou Formation in the Ordos Basin is 15.98-109.22Gt. The Majiagou Formation has sufficient storage capacity to accommodate decades of CO2 emissions generated by multiple coal-fired power plants in the Ordos Basin. For CO2 geological storage, the structural trapping mechanism contributes the largest amount of CO2 storage, and the amount of CO2 storage contributed by the two mechanisms of bound gas trapping and solubility trapping is almost negligible.

It is found that a 10% depletion in global (mid-low and polar latitudes) tropopause layer ozone causes a significant cooling of the tropical cold-point tropopause with a maximum cooling of 0.3 K, and a corresponding reduction in LSWV with a maximum value of 0.06 ppmv. The depletion of tropopause layer ozone at mid-low latitudes results in cooling of the tropical cold-point tropopause by radiative processes and a corresponding LSWV reduction. However, the effect of polar tropopause layer ozone depletion on tropical cold-point tropopause temperature and LSWV is opposite to and weaker than the effect of tropopause layer ozone depletion at mid-low latitudes. Finally, the joint effect of tropopause layer ozone depletion (at mid-low and polar latitudes) causes a negative cold-point tropopause temperature and a decreased tropical LSWV. Conversely, the impact of a 10% increase in global tropopause layer ozone on LSWV is exactly the opposite of the impact of ozone depletion. After 2000, tropopause layer ozone decreased at mid-low latitudes and increased at high latitudes. These tropopause layer ozone changes at different latitudes cause joint cooling in the tropical cold-point tropopause and a reduction in LSWV. Clarifying the impacts of tropopause layer ozone changes on LSWV clearly is important for understanding and predicting SWV changes in the context of future global ozone recovery. © 2021 by the authors.","Stratospheric water vapor; Tropopause layer ozone; Tropopause temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Climate models; Clouds; Ozone; Tropics; Water vapor; Global climate changes; Maximum cooling; Mid-low latitude; Ozone depletion; Ozone recovery; Polar latitude; Radiative process; Whole atmosphere community climate models; Ozone layer; air temperature; climate change; climate modeling; ozone; radiative transfer; stratosphere; tropopause; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102660067

An identification with people all over the world (i.e., global identity) and an openness toward less consumption (i.e., sufficiency orientation) may represent psychological drivers of a socio-ecological transformation. We examined the compatibility of both concepts as well as their relation to people’s support of a decarbonised mobility system and their flight mobility behaviour – a CO2-intensive behaviour that may be particularly difficult to refrain from for globally identified people, but less so for sufficiency-oriented people. In an online study conducted in Germany (N = 317), we found that global identity and sufficiency orientation were positively related. Both were negatively related to past flight-related CO2 emissions and positively related to refraining from flying and the support of decarbonised mobility policies. Accounting for both showed that sufficiency orientation in particular was related to fewer flight-related CO2 emissions and refraining from flying. Furthermore, we examined people’s travel experiences. While global identity was unrelated to the frequency and duration of international travelling, it was positively related to the frequency and quality of contact with local people met on journeys. An experimental variation of whether participants first answered questions on global identity or on travel experiences revealed that remembering past international travelling led to higher reported levels of global identity. Taken together, global identity seems to profit from in-depth international contact with people, but can be decoupled from resource-intensive travel behaviour. Globally identified and sufficiency-oriented people may support a socio-ecological transformation. Our results indicate a compatibility of global identity and sufficiency orientation. Experimental and longitudinal research should examine causal links to foster our understanding of the conditions under which both can be strengthened. © Copyright © 2021 Loy, Tröger, Prior and Reese.","flight shame; global identity; mobility; policy support; pro-environmental behaviour; socio-ecological transformation; sufficiency orientation; travelling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104157918

While Paschen's law (PL) has historically predicted breakdown voltage based on the Townsend avalanche, field emission must be incorporated for gap sizes below ∼15 μm. Extensive studies have modified PL to explicitly include field emission for planar geometries; however, many practical experiments use pin-to-plate geometries. We modify a previous theory coupling PL and field emission to account for pin-to-plate geometries by replacing the field enhancement factor, which has been used primarily as a fitting parameter, with the appropriate vacuum electric field. This requires explicitly accounting for the spatial dependence of ionization and non-uniform space charge in Poisson's equation. We derive a breakdown equation of the form previously obtained for planar geometry [Venkattraman and Alexeenko, Phys. Plasmas 19, 123515 (2012)] that agrees well with experimental data with the work function as the fitting parameter. The work function was consistently lower (∼2 eV) than anticipated (∼4.5 eV) but was generally fairly consistent (∼± 7%). We then derived closed form solutions in the limit of low ionization, corresponding to the field emission regime, and recovered an analytic solution for a parallel plate geometry in the limit of small gap distance that differed from prior analytic results because of the explicit consideration of spatial dependence in charge density. This theory may ultimately be applied to other nonplanar geometries by applying the appropriate equation for the vacuum electric field. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Electric fields; Electron emission; Field emission; Ionization of gases; Poisson equation; Work function; Analytic solution; Closed form solutions; Field enhancement factor; Fitting parameters; Nonplanar geometry; Parallel plate geometry; Planar geometries; Spatial dependence; Geometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102397251

At global scales, neither ADRE nor AOD show a significant trend. Over the northern hemisphere (NH), ADRE increases by 0.18 ± 0.17 Wm−2 per decade (less reflection to space) but shows no significant change over the southern hemisphere. The increase in the NH is primarily due to emission reductions in China, the United States, and Europe. The COVID-19 shutdown shows no noticeable impact on either global ADRE or AOD, but there is a substantial influence over northeastern China in March 2020. In contrast, February 2020 anomalies in ADRE and AOD are within natural variability even though the impact of the shutdown on industry was more pronounced in February than March. The reason is because February 2020 was exceptionally hot and humid over China, which compensated for reduced emissions. After accounting for meteorology and normalizing by incident solar flux, February ADRE anomalies increase substantially, exceeding the climatological mean ADRE by 23%. February and March 2020 correspond to the only period in which adjusted anomalies exceed the 95% confidence interval for 2 consecutive months. Distinct water-land differences over northeastern China are observed in ADRE but not in AOD. This is likely due to the influence of surface albedo on ADRE in the presence of absorbing aerosols. © 2021. The Authors.

However, such probes were relatively rarely reported so far, and the emission maximum is still limited (mainly located at 900−1000 nm). To solve the problem, herein, we proposed a flexible strategy to modulate the emission wavelength of NIR-II fluorescent probes, and four proof-of-concept probes (WH-1, WH-2, WH-3, and WH-4) based on D−π-A molecular skeleton were obtained. These probes can be activated by H2S and the emission maximum located from 925 to 1205 nm, which was attributed to the cooperation of elongating the π-conjugated system and enhancing the electron-donating ability of the donor region. In these probes, WH-3 exhibited the combination of long excitation/emission (925/1140 nm) and moderate quantum yield as well as high sensitivity toward H2S, enabling us to track and image H2S in vivo with high contrast. We expected that such a molecular design strategy will become an important approach to developing activatable NIR-II fluorescent probes with long emission. © 2021 American Chemical Society",,"Fluorescence; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Hydrogen sulfide; Infrared devices; Deep tissue imaging; Electron-donating ability; Emission wavelength; Flexible strategies; Fluorescent probes; Molecular skeleton; Pi-conjugated system; Proof of concept; Probes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101520782

This raises a question that how effective the NH3 emission controls can be on the mitigation of PM2.5 pollution along with the reduction of SO2 and NOx emissions. Here we use a regional air quality model to investigate this issue focusing on the PM2.5 pollution in North China for January and July 2015. We find that the efficiency of the PM2.5 reduction is highly sensitive to the NH3 emission and its reduction intensity. Reductions in the population-weighted PM2.5 concentration (PWC) in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region are only 1.4-3.8 µg m−3 (1.1%-2.9% of PM2.5) with 20%-40% NH3 emission reductions, but could reach 8.1-26.7 µg m−3 (6.2%-21%) with 60%-100% NH3 emission reductions in January 2015. Besides, the 2015-2017 emission changes (mainly reduction in SO2 emissions) could lower the PM2.5 control efficiency driven by the NH3 reduction by up to 30% for high NH3 emission conditions, while lead to no change or increase in the efficiency when NH3 emissions become low. NOx emission reductions may enhance the wintertime PM2.5 pollution due to the weakened titration effect and can be offset by simultaneously controlling NH3 emissions. Our results emphasize the need to jointly consider NH3 with SO2 and NOx emission controls when designing PM2.5 pollution mitigation strategies. © 2021 The Author(s).

In this strategy, based on the carboxyl (–COOH) groups in Ru(dcbpy)32+ and oxygen, nitrogen-containing groups on NCQDs surface, an intermolecular hydrogen bonds-induced self-enhanced ECL composite was generated in the solid contact layer for the first time. Since Ru(dcbpy)32+ and NCQDs were co-existing in the same composite, the electron-transfer distance between them was shortened and the energy loss was decreased, thereby higher ECL efficiency was acquired. This working process greatly avoided the introduction of signal amplifier and simplified the experimental operation. On this basis, 17β-estradiol (E2) was selected as a target model to fabricate a self-enhanced ECL aptamer sensor for the investigation of its analytical performances. Resultantly, excellent detection properties of E2, including wider linear range of 1.0 × 10-14 − 1.0 × 10-6 mol L-1 and lower detection limit of 1.0 × 10-15 mol L-1 with superior selectivity, were successfully achieved.

This paper estimated the potential environmental benefits of the widespread adoption of ULE in the Jing-Jin-Ji Region. Atmospheric modeling scenarios were analyzed for three cases: a “standard” scenario assuming no ULE deployment, a “best case” scenario assuming complete adoption of ULE across all power plants in the region, and a “natural gas” scenario, assuming emissions factors consistent with natural gas-fired power generation. The simulations show that the widespread adoption of ULE technologies can be an effective and economically competitive option for reducing the impacts of coal-fired power generation on air quality. © 2017, Higher Education Press.","air quality; atmospheric model; coal; Jing-Jin- Ji Region; PM2.5; ultra-low emissions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038007899

China’s rapid agricultural modernization has been accompanied by the continuous growth of rural economic aggregate and carbon emissions from the planting industry. However, the quantitative relationship between these two factors and its internal mechanism are not yet fully understood. In this paper, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method is used to calculate the carbon emissions of the planting industry in China from 1998–2019. Based on this, the Tapio decoupling analysis model was constructed to study the decoupling relationship between economic development and carbon emissions of the planting industry in China from 1998–2019 and the associated spatial and temporal evolution patterns. The effect of the complete decomposition model (without residuals), in terms of carbon emissions from the planting industry, on the process of economic development and its transmission mechanism are introduced. The results show that: (1) The carbon emissions of the planting industry in China increased with the economic development occurring from 1998–2005, where agricultural economic development was highly dependent on resource factors and the environment. The growth trend of carbon emissions of the planting industry slowed from 2006 to 2019, while economic development has gradually realized the decoupling of carbon emissions from the planting industry. (2) From 1998–2019, in Heilongjiang, Sichuan, and Hunan, the economic development was given priority, showing strong and negative decoupling with carbon emissions from farming. The economic development in most regions were given priority, showing strong decoupling with carbon emissions from farming. Up to 2019, decoupling was observed with a significant trend of spatial agglomeration. (3) Economic scale effects had a positive influence on the carbon emissions of the planting industry, while the technology effect and population effect had an inhibiting influence on the carbon emissions of the planting industry. The key policy implication of this paper is that improvement of the quality of economic development serves as the premise for the transformation of the economic development mode. It is necessary to reasonably regulate the economic growth rate and expansion scale, reduce resource consumption and pollutant emission technology, and to make full use of resources, in order to provide a basis for the formulation of reasonable emission reduction policies. An effective way to realize the sustainable development of the agricultural economy would be to improve the technical efficiency, control the population scale appropriately, and optimize the agricultural industrial structure. © 2021 by the authors.

However, our knowledge of green development efficiency (GDE) in Gansu province is poor. In remedy, this study, based on the panel data of 12 major cities in Gansu from 2010 to 2017, employed the super-efficient Slack-based measure (SBM) to analyze and evaluate GDE from the input–output perspective. Furthermore, we analyzed the input redundancy and output deficiency of identified inefficient cities in 2017 and conducted spatial autocorrelation analysis of GDE of the cities under study. Results show differences in the GDE of the major cities in Gansu, with an average value of 0.985. Green development efficiency in Lanzhou, Qingyang, Jinchang, Jiuquan, and Tianshui was relatively higher than in other cities. Green development efficiency in Zhangye, Wuwei, Jiayuguan, Baiyin, Dingxi, Longnan, and Longnan was less than one due to their redundant labor and capital input and excessive pollutant emission output. The overall GDE in Gansu depicts “high east and low west” zones. Each city in Gansu needs to formulate targeted policies and regulations to improve resource utilization, innovation capacity, reduce pollutant emission, optimize the industrial structure, and promote inter-city cooperation to construct a sustainable green economy. © 2021 by the authors.

The impact of feedstock type (reed straw and municipal solid waste (MSW)), feeding rate (0.1-1 t/h), and flue gas recycle ratio (FGR) (10%-30%) is investigated. The economic analysis of the integrated system is also performed. The results indicate that higher oxygen consumption is required for biomass gasification to reach the same temperature as MSW gasification. The gasification temperature is 750 °C-950 °C under 10%-30% FGR. The CO + H2 content in syngas from biomass gasification is slightly higher than that from MSW gasification. For the integrated system, more natural gas (NG) can be saved and more fossil CO2 can be reduced under biomass gasification. When the feedstock input is 1 t/h, the fossil CO2 emission can be reduced by 70% when taking biomass, the CO2 reduction is double of that when taking MSW. The total OPEX cost can be 26% saved by biomass and 62% saved by MSW due to the government subsidy. If CO2 tax is considered, the advantage of biomass for saving OPEX cost will be more obvious. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

In this study, phytolith assemblages in topsoils and associated plant communities at 55 sites in Northeast China were compared. The results indicate that samples from herbaceous and woody communities could be reliably differentiated by topsoil phytoliths. Notably, different phytolith types exhibit varying degrees of representational bias in terms of the aboveground plant community. Some morphotypes (e.g., bilobate, rondel and lanceolate) over-represent the richness of the corresponding plant; some morphotypes, including microhair, conical epidermal, silicified stomata and epidermal phytoliths, under-represent the parent plant abundance; additional morphotypes (e.g., elongate, saddle and trapeziform sinuate) are consistent with the changes of associated plants. Based on the representational bias, we calibrated the percentages of topsoil phytoliths and established a phytolith-based transfer function for precipitation in Northeast China. A palaeoclimate reconstruction in the Changbai Mountains (in the eastern part of Northeast China) based on the above phytolith-based transfer function for precipitation shows that the region has gone through continuous climatic changes since the late glacial period: from cold and dry conditions to warm and dry conditions, then to warm and wet conditions, and finally to cool and dry conditions. The phytolith-based reconstructed climate changes since the late glacial period correspond well to those reconstructed by other records from the same stratigraphic profile, and our phytolith-based climatic reconstruction also confirms the reliability of abrupt cold climatic shifts at 8.2, 6.8, 5.6, 4.6 and 4.2 ka. In conclusion, our results provide the basis for the reliability of phytoliths for reconstructing climatic changes in the northern temperate region. Highlights: Calibrating soil phytolith assemblages for any quantitative palaeovegetation reconstruction using phytoliths is necessary. Phytolith morphotypes in topsoils may over- or under-represent or agree with the abundance of modern plant taxa. Phytolith-based climatic reconstruction corresponds well with the abrupt climate changes evident since the Late Glacial period and other proxy records. © 2020 British Society of Soil Science","calibration; Northeast China; palaeoclimate; soil phytoliths","late glacial; paleobiology; paleoclimate; phytolith; plant community; reconstruction; stomata; topsoil; transfer function; Changbai Mountains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090137213

Unlike many other countries' targets of reducing the amount the carbon emissions, China has engaged in achieving the goal of carbon emission intensity regulation including economic development and carbon emission reduction. In recent years, carbon tax policy has been implemented by about 30 national and sub-national jurisdictions in controlling carbon emissions and has shown promising results. In this context, this research evaluates whether the carbon tax is an effective way for China to accomplish the win-win target of carbon reduction and GDP growth. Specifically, a model is established based on the energy substitution theory and input-output theory to evaluate the effectiveness of carbon tax on the eight economic sectors of China. The carbon emission reduction and economic performance before and after carbon taxation are compared. Moreover, the effects of different carbon tax rates on economic development are analyzed. The results are as follows: (1) The total amount of carbon emission decreases while the carbon tax is levied, and a positive correlation is found between the tax rate and the emission reduction amount. (2) The carbon tax has a significant impact on economic development, and a negative correlation is found between the tax rate and economic development. However, the loss of the economic output caused by the carbon tax gradually reduces over time. (3) Carbon tax policy would be effective for China to accomplish the win-win goal of carbon reduction and GDP growth. Moreover, the carbon tax rate should be set at a low level to achieve the target by the lowest economic cost. On this basis, several policy recommendations are proposed by this research. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emission; Carbon tax; Energy substitution theory; Scenario analysis","Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Taxation; Carbon emission intensities; Carbon emission reductions; Economic performance; Emission reduction; Negative correlation; Policy recommendations; Positive correlations; Total amount of carbons; Carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic development; economic growth; energy efficiency; environmental economics; pollution tax; scenario analysis; Article; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; correlational study; cost effectiveness analysis; country economic status; economic development; energy resource; environmental impact; environmental policy; fiscal policy; pollution control; priority journal; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095754462

In most cases, these methods can only tune their structures, electronic states and thereby catalytic properties in a gradual way. Here we report that the solid–liquid phase transition of Ga–Sn/Ga–In alloys can induce an instant and radical transformation of their atomic and electronic structures during electrocatalysis, which dramatically impacts their catalytic properties. The transition of Sn/In active components from phase-segregated clusters to dispersed single atoms during melting results in a unique electronic structure through further reduction of both metallic Sn/In and Ga. Such atomic/electronic structure transitions can correlate well with suppression of the hydrogen evolution reaction and an enhanced formate Faradaic efficiency from &lt;35% to &gt;95%.

However, the mechanisms by which natural vegetation restoration affects the extent, rate, and temperature sensitivity of DOM biodegradation are poorly understood. Elucidating these mechanisms is important for SOM management, especially in light of future climate warming scenarios. In this study, a laboratory DOM solution incubation experiment was conducted to comprehensively investigate the effects of temperature and natural vegetation restoration spanning a period of 160 y on DOM biodegradation in the Loess Plateau, China. The results indicated that dissolved organic C (DOC) biodegradation significantly decreased with vegetation restoration after an incubation period of 60 d. Further, biodegradation of dissolved organic N (DON) and dissolved organic P (DOP) significantly decreased after farmland abandonment. Specifically, the lowest values were observed in pioneer (Populus davidiana) and mingled (Populus davidiana and Quercus liaotungensis) forests. Generally, an increase in temperature significantly promoted the biodegradation of DOC, DON, and DOP by enhancing the microbial utilisation efficiencies of recalcitrant humic substrates (i.e., low-molecular-weight humic materials). Our results suggest that DOM biodegradability and its temperature sensitivity were regulated by DOM substrate quality (i.e, recalcitrant humic materials), and microbial properties (i.e., gram-negative bacterial and fungal PLFA, enzyme activities). Additionally, our results suggest that climax forest communities (Quercus liaotungensis) played a vital role in reducing DOC and DOP losses. This could be attributed to the low Q10 of the DOC and DOP biodegradation rates. © 2020","Dissolved organic carbon; Dissolved organic nitrogen; DOM biodegradation; Secondary vegetation succession; Temperature sensitivity; Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy","Biodegradability; Biogeochemistry; Dissolution; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Organic compounds; Restoration; Substrates; Temperature; Vegetation; Dissolved organic C; Dissolved organic matters; Dissolved organic N; Effects of temperature; Low molecular weight; Soil organic matters; Temperature sensitivity; Vegetation restoration; Biodegradation; alkaline phosphatase; beta glucosidase; dissolved organic carbon; dissolved organic matter; dissolved organic nitrogen; dissolved organic phosphate; fatty acid; humic acid; n acetyl beta glucosaminidase; organic carbon; organonitrogen derivative; organophosphate; unclassified drug; carbon; agricultural land; Article; biodegradability; chemical composition; China; climax community; ecosystem restoration; environmental temperature; enzyme activity; excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy; forest; fungal community; Gram negative bacterium; Gram positive bacterium; humic substance; incubation temperature; incubation time; laboratory; loess; microbial activity; microbial biomass; microbial community; nonhuman; oak; parallel factor analysis; pioneer species; Populus; Populus davidiana; priority journal; Quercus liaotungensis; spectrofluorometry; temperature sensitivity; vegetation; bioremediation; forest; soil; temperature; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria; Populus davidiana; Quercus wutaishanica; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon; China; Forests; Soil; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099252962

The results shows that the main factors of central heating includes energy consumption structure, heat generation method, heat transport carrier, heating degree days and heating area; The main factor that increases the energy consumption of central heating in each province is the same, namely Heating area (HA). However, the main factors that reduce energy consumption in each province are different; using gas instead of coal for clean heating can reduce some greenhouse gas emissions while bringing huge gas supply pressure.

Here, functional gene microarrays (GeoChip 5.0) and amplicon sequencing were employed to define the taxonomic and functional attributes within three micro-niches of T. ganbajun. The diversity and composition of bacterial taxa and their functional genes differed significantly (p < 0.01) among the compartments. Among 31,117 functional genes detected, some were exclusively recorded in one sporocarp compartment: 1,334 genes involved in carbon (mdh) and nitrogen fixation (nifH) in the context; 524 genes influencing carbon (apu) and sulfite reduction (dsrB, dsra) in the hymenophore; and 255 genes involved in sulfur oxidation (soxB and soxC) and polyphosphate degradation (ppx) in the pileipellis.

However, CO2 concentrations in urban areas are affected by many factors, such as weather, biological sinks and background CO2 fluctuations. Thus, it is difficult to directly observe the CO2 reductions from sparse ground observations. Here, we focus on urban ground transportation emissions, which were dramatically affected by the restrictions, to determine the reduction signals. We conducted six series of on-road CO2 observations in Beijing using mobile platforms before (BC), during (DC) and after (AC) the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions. To reduce the impacts of weather conditions and background fluctuations, we analyze vehicle trips with the most similar weather conditions possible and calculated the enhancement metric, which is the difference between the on-road CO2 concentration and the ""urban background""CO2 concentration measured at the tower of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP), Chinese Academy of Sciences. The results showed that the DC CO2 enhancement was decreased by 41 (±1:3) parts per million (ppm) and 26 (±6:2) ppm compared to those for the BC and AC trips, respectively. Detailed analysis showed that, during COVID-19 restrictions, there was no difference between weekdays and weekends during working hours (09:00-17:00 local standard time; LST). The enhancements during rush hours (07:00-09:00 and 17:00-20:00 LST) were almost twice those during working hours, indicating that emissions during rush hours were much higher. For DC and BC, the enhancement reductions during rush hours were much larger than those during working hours. Our findings showed a clear CO2 concentration decrease during COVID-19 restrictions, which is consistent with the CO2 emissions reductions due to the pandemic. The enhancement method used in this study is an effective method to reduce the impacts of weather and background fluctuations. Low-cost sensors, which are inexpensive and convenient, could play an important role in further on-road and other urban observations. © 2021 Author(s).",,"atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); COVID-19; traffic emission; weather; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103308211

Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a CO2-concentrating mechanism that facilitates plant adaptation to water-limited environments. We hypothesized that the ectopic expression of a CAM-specific phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), an enzyme that catalyzes primary CO2 fixation in CAM plants, would enhance both photosynthesis and abiotic stress tolerance. To test this hypothesis, we engineered a CAM-specific PEPC gene (named AaPEPC1) from Agave americana into tobacco. In comparison with wild-type and empty vector controls, transgenic tobacco plants constitutively expressing AaPEPC1 showed a higher photosynthetic rate and biomass production under normal conditions, along with significant carbon metabolism changes in malate accumulation, the carbon isotope ratio δ13 C, and the expression of multiple orthologs of CAM-related genes. Furthermore, AaPEPC1 overexpression enhanced proline biosynthesis, and improved salt and drought tolerance in the transgenic plants. Under salt and drought stress conditions, the dry weight of transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing AaPEPC1 was increased by up to 81.8% and 37.2%, respectively, in comparison with wild-type plants. Our findings open a new door to the simultaneous improvement of photosynthesis and stress tolerance in plants. © 2021 by the authors.

It provides implications for countries to address climate issues and improve development quality. The present work uses a multi-region input-output table provided by World Input Output Database to calculate the global value chain participation and the embodied carbon emission intensity of 42 different countries, for the period between 2000 and 2014. In addition, we decompose the carbon emission intensity into the carbon emission intensity embodied in domestic demand and foreign exports demand, and the carbon emission intensity of foreign exports demand is further divided into three types of embodied carbon emission intensity. Then, we analyze how global value chain participation affects the embodied carbon emission intensity, and examine different impacts across different development countries and different types of embodied carbon emission intensity. We also explore the different impacts under different embodied carbon emission intensity distributions. The results show that global value chain participation has a significantly negative impact on the embodied carbon emission intensity. Compared with the developed “north” countries, the global value chain participation of developing “south” countries have a larger negative impact of embodied carbon emission intensity. From the perspective of different types of demand, the impact of global value chain participation on carbon emission intensity embodied in foreign exports demand is greater than that embodied in domestic demand. The quantile regression results show that the global value chain participation at the high quantiles has a greater impact on the embodied carbon emission intensity, which indicates countries with higher embodied carbon emission intensity should participate in the global value chain to expand the production scale while reducing carbon emissions. These results provide relevant material and insights to countries about how their participation in the global production fragmentation affects their greenhouse gas emission profile, which can be used to elaborate structured political measures to address, at the same time, global market inclusion and climate change mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Embodied carbon emission intensity; Global value chain participation; Input-output method; Panel quantile regression","Climate change; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Carbon emission intensities; Climate change mitigation; Development countries; Division of labor; Global production; Global value chain; Input-output table; Quantile regression; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097091824

The directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP) method for mechanism reduction determines the active species based on the static target species. Inspired by the better performance of automatic target species selection method (ATSS) in dynamic adaptive chemistry simulation and the effectiveness of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) in assessing the importance of elementary reaction, the present work proposes a new reduction procedure. This procedure utilizes the ATSS method, which has not been applied to obtaining the overall reduced mechanism. Total 5610 status points are sampled densely during the ignition process to obtain resulting local reduced mechanisms in present work. The overall active species are selected according to the total occurrence probability. The primary active reactions determined by the active species are further eliminated using the GSA method. By comparing the auto-ignition delay times (AIDT) of reduced methane mechanisms obtained by DRGEP and new reduction procedures under typical initial conditions. The simulation results prove the superiority of the combination of ATSS and GSA methods. The ATSS method can avoid improper selection of active species compared with traditional DRGEP method. © 2021, The Aeronautical and Astronautical Society of the Republic of China.

Therefore, we measured the green innovation efficiency of 30 provinces and cities in mainland China from 2005 to 2018, using selected panel data within a super-efficient SBM model that incorporated undesirable outputs. We used a double differential model to evaluate the impacts of carbon trading policies on the green innovation efficiency of seven carbon trading pilot regions. These impacts were confirmed using the double differential propensity score matching method. Our findings were as follows. (1) The implementation of carbon trading policies has a significant and continuous effect of promoting and improving green innovation efficiency in the pilot areas. (2) Carbon trading induces technological innovation effects, enabling green innovation potential to be realized. Regional green innovation efficiency is further improved through energy substitution and structural upgrading effects and subsequently through all three of the above effects. (3) The synergy between the three major effects of carbon trading policies amplifies regional green innovation efficiency. Therefore, the Chinese government should accelerate its efforts to develop and improve carbon markets, promote carbon trading policies, and actively foster synergy among the three effects to achieve green and sustainable regional development. © 2021 by the authors.","Carbon trading; Difference in differences model; Green innovation efficiency; Propensity score matching","emissions trading; empirical analysis; energy planning; environmental economics; green economy; panel data; state role; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102677225

Six RACs in four different climate zones are analysed, comparing historical electricity load and demand profiles with the lockdown period. The facilities in warm regions showed largest reductions in energy use and peak demands. There was a peak demand timing shift in temperate regions and hot regions’ changes were negligible for energy use or peak demands.

Also, KPIs in relation to cooling degree days (or total cooling and heating degree days) have been examined and are not recommended for temperate regions or temperate seasons.

Local community resilience to spills and the equitable application of knowledge worldwide are constrained by several barriers. These range from access, governance, cost minimisation, through austerity and poverty in affected areas, to realpolitik (e.g. vested interests, nationalism, corruption, security breakdown and war). Ongoing incidents show inequalities in spill risk and OSR capability. Advances in knowledge have belatedly brought us to the conclusion that the logical way to reduce adverse impacts of oil in an era of global warming is to accelerate decarbonisation. This would rapidly and simultaneously reduce the frequency, magnitude and consequences of oil spills. Meanwhile, mitigating spills, managing OSR, and restoring local communities and ecosystems at spill sites are fundamental obligations for the oil industry. These obligations should be routinely enforced by all responsible governments, and backed by inter-governmental agencies and conventions.

We developed an Ecopath model in north-eastern Brazil, and applied a temporally dynamic model (Ecosim) to evaluate the potential effects of different fishing effort control policies and environmental changes on marine resources and ecosystem between 2015 to 2030 with a case study for small-scale shrimp fishing, novelty for tropical region. These scenarios included different management options related to fishing controls (changing effort and closed season) and environmental changes (primary production changes). Our findings indicate that it is possible to maintain the same level of landings with a controlled reduction of bottom trawlers activities, for example, close to 10 %, without compromising the ecosystem structure. This scenario provided better results than 3–4 months of closing the fishing season, which led to significant losses in catches of high market-value target species (white shrimp, Penaeus schmitti and pink shrimp, Penaeus subtilis). However, intense negative effects on biomass, catch and biodiversity indicators were reported in scenarios with decreasing primary production, from 2 %, reinforcing the need to simulate and project the possible impacts caused by environmental change. However, the control of bottom trawling activity may help to reduce, even at low levels, the highly adverse effects due to primary production reduction. The impacts of climate change in a near future on organisms and ecosystems is an imminent reality, and therefore the search for measures for mitigating and even minimizing these impacts is crucial. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artisanal fisheries; Brazil; Climate change; Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries; EwE; Trawling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097049531

The core was dated by annual layer counting based on seasonal oscillations of dust, calcium, and stable isotopes. Geochemical and mineralogical data show that dust is regionally sourced in winter and summer. During austral summer (wet season), an increase in the relative proportion of giant dust particles (20 um) is observed, in association with oscillations of stable isotope records (D, 18O). It seems that at Nevado Illimani both the deposition of dust and the isotopic signature of precipitation are influenced by atmospheric deep convection, which is also related to the total amount of precipitation in the area. This hypothesis is corroborated by regional meteorological data. The interpretation of giant particle and stable isotope records suggests that downdrafts due to convective activity promote turbulent conditions capable of suspending giant particles in the vicinity of Nevado Illimani. Giant particles and stable isotopes, when considered together, can be therefore used as a new proxy for obtaining information about deep convective activity in the past. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

China, as one of the major agricultural and energy production countries, contributes considerably to the global anthropogenic CH4 emissions by rice cultivation, ruminant feeding, and coal production. Understanding the characteristics of China's CH4 emissions is necessary for interpreting source contributions and for further climate change mitigation. However, the scarcity of data from some sources or years and spatially explicit information pose great challenges to completing an analysis of CH4 emissions. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of China's anthropogenic CH4 emissions by synthesizing the most current and publicly available datasets (13 inventories). The results show that anthropogenic CH4 emissions differ widely among inventories, with values ranging from 44.4-57.5 Tg CH4 yr-1 in 2010. The discrepancy primarily resulted from the energy sector (27.3 %-60.0 % of total emissions), followed by the agricultural (26.9 %-50.8 %) and waste treatment (8.1 %-21.2 %) sectors. Temporally, emissions among inventories stabilized in the 1990s but increased significantly thereafter, with annual average growth rates (AAGRs) of 2.6 %-4.0 % during 2000-2010 but slower AAGRs of 0.5 %-2.2 % during 2011-2015, and the emissions became relatively stable, with AAGRs of 0.3 %-0.8 %, during 2015-2019 because of the stable emissions from the energy sector (mainly coal production). Spatially, there are large differences in emissions hotspot identification among inventories, and incomplete information on emission patterns may mislead or bias mitigation efforts for CH4 emission reductions. The availability of detailed activity data for sectors or subsectors and the use of region-specific emission factors play important roles in understanding source contributions and reducing the uncertainty in bottom-up inventories.

Employing data from 1980 to 2017, this paper investigates the impact of NG consumption on SSA's CO2 emissions using data-driven nonparametric additive regression(NPAR) which can reveal both linear and nonlinear effects. Augmenting NPAR with translog production function(TPF) estimates of interfuel substitution elasticities and bias technological progress over sample period(advantage of TPF), we further provide evidence of the indirect effect of NG consumption on SSA's CO2 emissions through mechanism analysis. From the empirical results, the linear effect shows NG positively impact CO2 emissions while the nonlinear effect indicates a downward decreasing trend (meaning expansion in NG consumption will gradually lower CO2 emissions). Nonlinearly, urbanization and energy efficiency also show positive “inverted U-Shaped” and “downward slopping” respectively meaning sustainable urban energy and energy efficiency practices improvement can lead to CO2 reduction respectively in SSA. The reducing effect of NG consumption on CO2 (the nonlinear effect) is realized through the enhancement of positive bias technological progress of NG over coal and oil but not merely substitution of coal and oil for NG. Technological progress improvement in NG use will also reduce the positive linear effect of urbanization and energy efficiency on CO2 emissions of SSA. Oil is more likely to be substituted for NG than that of coal in SSA. The scenario analysis shows a total of 6.9%, 7.6% and 8.3% of energy conservation is realized in 2022, 2026 and 2030 with a corresponding CO2 reduction of 18.7%, 20.7% and 22.9% respectively for a continuous 10% investment in NG. Institutional, market-oriented and technology challenges hinder NG development among major producers in SSA. Based on the results, several policy measures are put forward to promote SSA's low-carbon energy transition. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions; Inter-fuel-substitution elasticity; Natural gas consumption; Nonparametric additive regression; Sub-Saharan Africa; Technological progress bias","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Economics; Energy efficiency; Investments; Proven reserves; Additive regression; Low carbon energies; Natural gas consumption; Non-hydro renewables; Sub-saharan africa; Technological progress; Technology challenges; Trans-log production functions; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; coal; natural gas; oil; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy efficiency; energy use; environmental economics; natural gas; regression analysis; urbanization; Africa south of the Sahara; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; elasticity; energy conservation; environmental parameters; environmental policy; linear system; natural gas consumption; nonlinear system; priority journal; statistical bias; trend study; urbanization; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096860346

Therefore, it is crucial to understand how this resource will evolve in a warming climate. In the present study, offshore wind resource in the Southwestern African region is analysed for the present and future climates. A ROM (REMO-OASIS-MPIOM) climate simulation in uncoupled and coupled atmosphere–ocean mode, at 25 km horizontal resolution, and a multi-model ensemble built with a set of regional climate models from the CORDEX-Africa experiment at 0.44° resolution were used. The projected changes of the offshore wind energy density throughout the twenty-first century are examined following the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Characterised by strong coastal-parallel winds, the Southwestern African offshore region shows high values of wind energy density at 100 m, up to 1500 Wm−2 near the coast, particularly offshore Namibia and west South Africa. Conversely, along Angola’s coast the available offshore wind energy density is lower. Throughout the twenty-first century, for the weaker climate mitigation scenario (RCP8.5), an increase of the offshore wind resource is projected to occur along Namibia and South African western coasts, more pronounced at the end of the century (+ 24%), while a decrease is projected along Angola’s coasts, reaching a negative anomaly of about − 32%. Smaller changes but with the same pattern are projected for the stronger climate mitigation scenario (RCP4.5). The future deployment of offshore floating hub turbines placed at higher heights may allow higher production of energy in this region.

This paper aims to evaluate the impacts of land use change and climate change on flooding in the Segamat River Basin, Johor, Malaysia, with 1D–2D hydrodynamic river modeling, using InfoWorks Integrated Catchment Modeling (ICM). The study involved the development of flood maps for four different scenarios: (1) future land use in 2030; (2) the impacts of climate change; (3) three mitigation strategies comprising detention ponds, rainwater harvesting systems (RWHSs), and permeable pavers; and (4) a combination of these three mitigation strategies. The obtained results show increases in the flood peaks under both the land use change and climate change scenarios. With the anticipated increase in development activities within the vicinity up to 2030, the overall impact of urbanization on the extent of flooding would be rather moderate, as the upper and middle parts of the basin would still be dominated by forests and agricultural activities (approximately 81.13%). In contrast, the potential flood‐inundated area is expected to increase from 12.25% to 16.64% under storms of 10‐, 50‐, 100‐, and 1000‐year average recurrence intervals (ARI). Interestingly, the simulation results suggest that only the detention pond mitigation strategy has a considerable impact on reducing floods, while the other two mitigation strategies have less flood reduction advantages for this agricultural‐based rural basin located in a tropical region. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the underlying mechanisms of how these shifts impact carbon cycling are not well-documented. We conducted a long-term grazing experiment with four sheep stocking rates in the semi-arid grasslands of Inner Mongolia, China, to examine grazing effects on the ratio of C3 to C4 species (C3:C4), shoot biomass, root biomass, root:shoot, soil respiration, soil C, soil N and soil C:N between 2014 and 2018. We explored the responses of these carbon metrics to C3:C4 under different grazing treatments and the mechanisms driving grazing-induced carbon loss using structural equation models. Livestock grazing directly shifted plant community composition (i.e. increasing C3:C4) and reduced vegetation carbon (i.e. shoot biomass), whereas grazing effects on below-ground carbon were mediated by the interactions of the soil profile (i.e. depth dependence) and year-to-year variation (e.g. rainfall regulation). Grazing-induced increases in C3:C4 suppressed soil carbon loss by inhibiting the rate of soil respiration. Furthermore, grazing intensity indirectly altered these relationships. Specifically, C3:C4 was positively related to shoot biomass and negatively associated with root:shoot, soil C and soil N, whereas these relationships were only significant in no-grazed plots. Meanwhile, soil respiration was negatively associated with C3:C4, soil C, soil N and soil C:N, but a positive relationship with shoot biomass; these relationships were significant only in grazed plots. Synthesis and applications. Our study highlights the importance of the functional linkages between community characteristics and ecosystem processes, that is, shifts in plant community composition play a key role in regulating grassland carbon cycling. These findings provide a useful field-observed resource for model development and could improve the guidelines for livestock management and policies regarding climate mitigation. © 2021 British Ecological Society","C3 plant; C4 plant; depth dependence; grazing intensity; Mongolian Plateau; rangelands; sheep; soil respiration","C3 plant; C4 plant; carbon cycle; community composition; grassland; grazing; guideline; livestock farming; plant community; precipitation intensity; sheep; soil respiration; China; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100044390

In this study, we developed and evaluated the intercity transferability of annual-average LUR models for ambient respirable suspended particulates (PM10), fine suspended particulates (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) in the Taipei-Keelung metropolitan area of northern Taiwan in 2019. Ambient PM10, PM2.5, NO2and O3measurements at 30 fixed-site stations were used as the dependent variables, and a total of 156 potential predictor variables in six categories (i.e., population density, road network, land-use type, normalized difference vegetation index, meteorology and elevation) were extracted using buffer spatial analysis. The LUR models were developed using the supervised forward linear regression approach. The LUR models for ambient PM10, PM2.5, NO2and O3achieved relatively high prediction performance, with R2 values of &gt;0.72 and leaveone- out cross-validation (LOOCV) R2 values of &gt;0.53. The intercity transferability of LUR models varied among the air pollutants, with transfer-predictive R2 values of &gt;0.62 for NO2and &lt;0.56 for the other three pollutants. The LUR-model-based 500m500m spatial-distribution maps of these air pollutants illustrated pollution hot spots and the heterogeneity of population exposure, which provide valuable information for policymakers in designing effective air pollution control strategies. The LUR-model-based air pollution exposure estimates captured the spatial variability in exposure for participants in a cohort study. This study highlights that LUR models can be reasonably established upon a routine monitoring network, but there exist uncertainties when transferring LUR models between nearby cities. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the intercity transferability of LUR models in Asia. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Nanofuels, which are suspensions of energetic nanomaterials in liquid media, was proposed and became a promising alternative fuel. Optimizing the blend of nanoparticles and hydrocarbon fuels can dramatically decrease the world's demand for fossil fuels without modifying state-of-the-art engines, and it can also significantly reduce pollutant emissions. However, our knowledge about nanofuels remains limited. Here, we experimentally investigated the spray and combustion characteristics of boron/ethanol nanofuels. We explore the effects of the size and the doping concentration of boron particles on suspension quality and the corresponding spray and combustion behavior. The nanofuels were prepared using boron particles, 100 nm and 400 nm in diameter, at particle loading concentration of 0.5 wt% and 1.0 wt%, respectively. The spray flame was operated on a modified McKenna burner using a coaxial air-assisted atomization method. The burner features a retractable fuel capillary injector, and the influence of capillary recess length on spray flames was studied in this work. Mie scattering was applied to investigate the spray characteristics of the ethanol and boron/ethanol nanofuels in non-reacting and reacting flows. Chemiluminescence was adopted to study the heat release of the target flames and the ignition delay of the boron particles during combustion. High-speed measurements offer us an opportunity to investigate the instantaneous phenomena during spray and combustion, and thus Mie scattering and chemiluminescence were operated at 50 kHz in our study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Boron nanoparticle; Chemiluminescence; Ignition delay; Mie scattering; Nanofuel; Spray","Boron; Brillouin scattering; Chemiluminescence; Flame spraying; Fossil fuels; Suspensions (fluids); Combustion and emission performance; Conventional fuel; Doping concentration; Energetic nanomaterials; High speed measurements; Pollutant emission; Spray and combustion; Spray characteristics; Ignition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096862486

Existing studies mainly focus on identifying critical sectors in an economy that directly generate CO2 emissions (production-based accounting) or indirectly drive CO2 emissions through supply chains (consumption-based accounting). Though results from these studies are essential for guiding emission mitigation, a new perspective is also important for identifying key transmission sectors that facilitate CO2 emissions in supply chains. In this study, we use a betweenness-based method and a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model of China in 2012 to identify the critical transmission sectors for CO2 emissions. We identify sectors of Chemical industry in Shandong and Jiangsu, Metallurgy in Jiangsu, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Liaoning, and Electricity and hot water production in Beijing as key transmission sectors. We also find that only the first three production layers (PLs) account for over 95% of the total embodied CO2 emissions for each critical transmission sector. Improving production efficiency in these sectors has significant potential to reduce CO2 emissions both downstream and upstream of their supply chains. Our method and results provide an alternative perspective for sector-specific policy recommendations on mitigating CO2 emissions caused by the trade among provinces and sectors. Furthermore, this study plays significant strategy contributions on social-economic costs of carbon emission and carbon reductions. © 2020","Betweenness-based method; Embodied CO2 emissions; Input-output analysis; Structural path analysis","Carbon; Chemical industry; Fossil fuels; Rivers; Supply chains; Transmissions; Carbon emissions; Emission mitigation; Environmental pressures; Hot-water production; Policy recommendations; Production and consumption; Production efficiency; Production layers; Carbon dioxide; carbon emission; chemical industry; emission control; industrial production; input-output analysis; metallurgy; path analysis; strategic approach; supply chain management; utility sector; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Henan; Jiangsu; Liaoning; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098451745

Wudang) in Central China. The characteristics, sources of VOCs and their contributions to ozone formation were investigated for the first time in this area. Based on the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, 29 O3 non-attainment days were identified. The average mixing ratio of 82 total VOCs (∑VOCs) was 12.17 ± 3.66 ppb. Higher mixing ratios of individual species were found compared with those measured at global baseline sites. The results revealed that the dominant VOCs components were alkanes and OVOCs, accounting for 79.92%. Five sources, i.e. industrial processes, fuel evaporation, vehicular exhaust, solvent utilization and biogenic emission were identified by the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. From potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis, local area and the adjacent provinces especially Shaanxi province, had some extent influence on Mt. Wudang. The OH radical loss rate (LOH) and ozone formation potential (OFP) calculations revealed that biogenic emission and vehicular exhaust were both the major sources for ozone formation. Through the Observation-Based Model (OBM) simulation, the daytime average net ozone production rate was 4.1 ppb/h and the ozone production pathway was dominated by the reaction of HO2 + NO.

Moreover, three zeolite additives, namely, ZSM-5, Al-MCM-41, and Al-SBA-15, were selected to compare their effects on catalytic co-pyrolysis and coking characteristics with hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite. Results showed that co-pyrolysis of CV and MSW demonstrated significant synergistic effects at 260–330 °C, especially at the ratio of 5:5. Two model-free methods, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), were used to calculate the kinetic parameters. Product distribution results demonstrated that co-pyrolysis could improve pyrolysis products by increasing monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons as well as reducing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrogen compounds. Compared with other three kinds of zeolite additives, hierarchical ZSM-5 with both micropores and mesopores achieved superior monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon selectivity (34.14%) and inferior acid selectivity (9.54%) for co-pyrolysis, thereby satisfying the preferred criteria. In addition, the difference from the thermogravimetric curve between after pyrolysis and fresh zeolites indicated that hierarchical ZSM-5 also had the best coking resistance. In brief, co-pyrolysis of chlorella vulgaris and municipal solid waste with hierarchical ZSM-5 was definitely a feasible way for high-quality bio-oil generation.

Among different household activities, household individual travel demands due to private or public transportation affect the environment via both direct or indirect emissions. To develop insights from a city-level perspective, carbon emissions released due to household travel demands in 47 Japanese cities were estimated in this study using the most recent available data. Given the differences in traveling preferences, spatial distribution and cluster analyses by city were also conducted. The results indicate that cities with a larger carbon footprint usually had a smaller population, whereas in megacities, less carbon per capita was released. The direct combustion of gasoline and train use were the most important factors influencing regional differences in direct and indirect emissions, respectively. The findings also indicate that customized carbon mitigation strategies that consider individual preferences and city size have a better chance of achieving decarbonization of citizen transportation in Japan. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Cities; Household travel demand; Japan; Private transportation","Climate change; Cluster analysis; Emission control; Motor transportation; Carbon mitigation; Direct combustion; Global climate changes; Household activities; Household sectors; Individual preference; Public transportation; Regional differences; Carbon footprint; carbon emission; carbon footprint; cluster analysis; combustion; fuel consumption; global climate; megacity; spatial distribution; travel demand; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099853207

Here, the possible impact of China's investment was revealed by comparing the CO2 emissions of B&amp;R region in different Chinese investment scenarios. The results showed that CO2 emissions of B&amp;R region will cumulatively increase by 1973 Gt in 2018–2100 in the “No-Chinese Investment Scenario (NIS)”. Regionally, the India (IND), Middle East Central Asia (MECAsia), and Southeast Asia and its surrounding (SEAsia) has the largest increment. Comparing with the NIS, the CO2 emissions of B&amp;R region will cumulatively decrease by 44.16 Gt and 79.48 Gt, respectively, in the “Business-as-usual Chinese Investment Scenario (BIS)” and “Strengthening Chinese Investment Scenario (SIS)”. Regionally, the cumulative CO2 emissions of all subregions will decrease in BIS and SIS, of which SEAsia and MECAsia have the largest decrement. Technique and structural effects of China's investment have positive impact on cumulative CO2 emission reduction of B&amp;R region, especially in the structural effect. The scale effect has the negative contribution, but it cannot neutralize the positive impact induced from technique and structural effects. As a result, China's future investment is conductive to reducing CO2 emission of B&amp;R region and holding the temperature increase below 2 °C. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Belt and road initiative; Chinese investment; CO2 emission reduction","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Roads and streets; Business-as-usual; Carbon reduction; CO2 emission reduction; CO2 emissions; Scale effects; Southeast Asia; Structural effect; Temperature increase; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097111414

The PM2.5 measured by the in situ instrument and the PM2.5 simulated by the conversion formula showed a good correlation. The correlation coefficients R were 0.93 (Dalian), 0.90 (Qingdao), and 0.88 (Shanghai). A regular seasonality of the three trace gases is found, but not for aerosols. Consid-erable amplitudes in the weekly cycles were determined for NO2 and aerosols, but not for SO2 and HCHO. The aerosol profiles were nearly Gaussian, and the shapes of the trace gas profiles were nearly exponential, except for SO2 in Shanghai and HCHO in Qingdao. PM2.5 presented the largest transport flux, followed by NO2 and SO2. The main transport flux was the output flux from inland to sea in spring and winter. The MAX-DOAS and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) models’ results were compared. The overestimation of NO2 and SO2 by CAMS is due to its overestimation of near-surface gas volume mixing ratios. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, we employed a solvent evaporation induced self-assembly method to prepare a novel S-scheme heterojunction composite by combining sulfur-doped porous graphite carbon nitride (S-pCN) with tungsten oxide (WO2.72) semiconductors which manifest effective interface contact and excellent photocatalytic performance. During the formation of the heterojunction, the electron defect state of surface oxygen vacancies on WO2.72 can be filled by the lone pair electrons of sulfur and nitrogen elements on S-pCN. Through the adjustment of composite ratios, appropriate surface oxygen vacancies were retained on WO2.72, thereby fascinate the migration of electrons and the generation of free radicals. The internal electric field (IEF) and the band bending effects accelerate the transfer of photogenerated charges at the interface, thereby promotes the recombination of useless photogenerated carriers, retains photogenerated electron (e−) and hole (h+) with the higher redox potentials, improves the separation and utilization efficiency of the photogenerated carriers and enhances the photocatalytic activity of the system.

We built a theoretical framework based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and performed both binary and count estimations to explore the determinants affecting farmers' adoption of LCTs. Our results indicated that most rice farmers strongly agreed they observed shifting local weather conditions (52.74% of respondents) and irregular rainfall patterns (52.56%) within the last year. Further, over two-thirds of the respondents perceived that agricultural production contributes to climate variability (26.73% strongly agreed, and 40.54% agreed with that statement). In terms of the adoption intensity of LCTs, we found that about 96% of rice farmers implemented at least one low-carbon technology. Importantly, farmers' perceptions of climate change were positively associated with climate change adaptation.

Based on 759 questionnaires collected from three cities (Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and Shanghai) with different population sizes in China, we develop a modified theory of planned behavior (MTPB) model framework integrating low-carbon transport policies, psychological aspects, personal norms, and travel habits. A more advanced partial leastsquare method of structural equation model (PLS-SEM) and a multiple-group analysis (MGA) model are applied to estimate the effects and heterogeneities of these factors on low-carbon travel behavior intention among three cities and four age groups. The results show that the roles of low-carbon policies, subjective norms, and personal norms on behavior intention of adopting low-carbon travel modes are more salient. The effect of low-carbon policy on behavior is much weaker than it is on intention, and it does not follow that such intention will often be followed up with action. There is regional and generational heterogeneity in terms of the influence on low-carbon travel behavior intention. In particular, the benefits of low-carbon policies are more remarkable in the middle-sized city, young adult group, and pre-older adult group. The low-carbon travel behavior intention in the large-sized city, junior-middle adult group, and senior-middle adult group are affected by subjective norms more easily. The large-sized city and young adult group have better personal norms in favor of low-carbon travel. The findings could provide helpful insights into developing heterogeneous transport policies to encourage different travelers to switch from auto to low-carbon travel modes. © 2021 by the authors.

Comprehensive life cycle techno-economic and environmental optimization analysis for this technology are of great importance to improve system performance. In this study, we first proposed an integrated hybrid life cycle optimization framework to understand trade-offs between the techno-economic and environmental performance of adiabatic compressed air energy storage plant in China, by combining integrated hybrid life cycle analysis with multi-objective optimization. The results show that solutions with investment cost, carbon dioxide emission, water and energy consumption of 1.47 k$/kW, 1.48 kg/kWh, 0.097 m3/kWh and 2.08 × 104 kJ/kWh, respectively, are promising for a practical adiabatic compressed air energy storage system design in China. An analysis of the materials and energy contribution towards the environmental impact at selected optimum points are carried out in detail to elucidate means for reducing the life-cycle emission of the plant; besides, an impact comparison for plant installation in different provinces was performed to provide guidance for policymakers in site selection. As a result, the life-cycle carbon dioxide emission, water and energy consumption of the plant were found to be large in the provinces with a high proportion of thermal power generation — for example, Shandong and Jiangsu — yet the most environmental benefit is achieved in these provinces if the system is combined with the local power grid. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adiabatic compressed air energy storage; Integrated hybrid; Life cycle optimization; Techno-economic and environmental performance","Carbon dioxide; Compressed air; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Global warming; Investments; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Pressure vessels; Renewable energy resources; Site selection; Storage (materials); Carbon dioxide emissions; Environmental benefits; Life cycle emissions; Optimization analysis; Optimization framework; Plant installations; Renewable energy generation; Thermal power generation; Compressed air energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099002158

The production scheduling optimization method is an effective way to reduce carbon emissions and relieve environmental pressure. The paper proposed a low-carbon dynamic scheduling optimization method to solve machine failure interference and to minimize the total cost of production and carbon emissions in the discrete manufacturing workshop. The rolling window mechanism driven by abnormal events and rescheduling strategy are used to update the original schedule in real-time when the machine fails. In the carbon emission measurement method, the machine's carbon emission parameters in different states are considered. The traditional genetic algorithm is improved in the initial population strategy and crossover operator. The experimental results show that the proposed low-carbon dynamic scheduling method based on the improved genetic algorithm can effectively reduce carbon emissions under the premise of ensuring the completion of production tasks as soon as possible. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Deterioration; Dynamics; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Global warming; Production control; Scheduling; Carbon dioxide emissions; Cost of productions; Discrete manufacturing; Environmental pressures; Initial population; Manufacturing enterprise; Production Scheduling; Traditional genetic algorithms; Manufacture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103236621

This issue is quantitively assessed here by using three CTMs. We show that SO2 emissions from global GEOS-Chem adjoint model and OMI SO2 data, when combined with spatial variation of bottom-up emissions, can largely improve WRF-Chem and WRF-CMAQ forecast of SO2 and aerosol optical depth (in reference to moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data) in China. This suggests that the efficacy of satellite-based inversion of SO2 emission appears to be high for CTMs that use similar or identical emission inventories. With the advent of geostationary air quality monitoring satellites in next 3 years, this study argues that an era of using top-down approach to rapidly update emission is emerging for regional air quality forecast, especially over Asia having highly varying emissions. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, since the urban traffic is affected by multiple factors, whether the application of low-carbon transport policy could obtain corresponding or higher output is uncertain. To clarify the effects of low-carbon transport to the improvement of urban traffic ecological environment, the main indicators that measure the contribution of low-carbon transport to urban traffic ecological environment were extracted from five aspects including people, cars, roads, transportation infrastructure and traffic environment. The Guangzhou city in China was taken as an example to select index data, the regression analysis was adopted by SPSS software.

However, the extensive nonrandom missingness of OMI-NO2 data (e.g., an approximate per-pixel missing proportion of 59% for mainland China in 2015) due to cloud contamination or high reflectance limits applicability of these data in estimation of ground-level NO2. This paper proposes the use of a full residual deep learning method to impute missing satellite-borne NO2 data (OMI-NO2) and to estimate (map) ground-level NO2 with uncertainty (coefficient of variation) at a high spatial (1 × 1 km2) and temporal (daily) resolution. For the large study region (mainland China except Hainan Province), the presented method achieved robust performance with a stable learning efficiency (mean test R2: 0.98 with a small standard deviation of 0.01; mean test RMSE: 0.42 × 1015 molecules/cm2) for imputation of OMI-NO2. In the model, the coordinates and elevation were used to capture the spatial variability of the OMI-NO2 columns, and fused meteorological grid data and planetary boundary layer height and ozone data from GEOS-FP were used to capture spatiotemporal variability of OMI-NO2. The evaluation with ground in situ NO2 measurements showed considerable contribution of the complete (raw observed and imputed) OMI-NO2 columns, meteorology and traffic variables to inference of ground-level NO2 (test R2: 0.82; test RMSE: 8.80 μg/m3). The complete grids of OMI-NO2 columns showed natural and smooth spatial transitions between the raw observed and imputed values. The surfaces of predicted NO2 concentration not only showed consistent distributions with OMI-NO2 at a regional and temporal scale, but also presented local spatial gradients of ground-level NO2. OMI-NO2 can be downscaled and imputed to be used as an important predictor to improve the estimation of high-resolution ground-level NO2. The reliable estimates of ground-level NO2 concentration with uncertainty can reduce the bias in estimates of NO2 exposure and subsequently evaluations of its health effects. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Bagging; Full residual deep network; Ground-level NO2 estimation; Imputation of missing values; OMI-NO2 columns; Traffic and land-use variables; Uncertainty","Air pollution; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Deep learning; Learning systems; Ozone; Remote sensing; Statistical tests; Ultraviolet spectrometers; Uncertainty analysis; Aerosol optical depths; Cloud contamination; Coefficient of variation; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Ozone monitoring instruments; Planetary boundary layers; Spatial variability; Spatiotemporal variability; Nitrogen oxides; aerosol; boundary layer; concentration (composition); nitrogen dioxide; optical depth; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Hainan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098104003

The oxidation state and the process of evolution of OAs in the four seasons were further investigated, and an enhanced carbon oxidation state (-0:45-0.10) and O=C (0.54-0.75) and OM=OC (1.86-2.13) ratios-compared with urban studies-were observed, with the highest oxidation state appearing in summer, likely because of the relatively stronger photochemical processing that dominated the formation processes of both less oxidized OA (LOOOA) and more oxidized OA (MO-OOA). Aqueous-phase processing also contributed to the SOA formation and prevailed in winter, with the share to MO-OOA being more important than that to LO-OOA. In addition, regional transport also played an important role in the variations in SOA. Especially in summer, continuous increases in SOA concentration as a function of odd oxygen (Ox DO3 CNO2) were found to be associated with the increases in wind speed. Furthermore, backward trajectory analysis showed that higher concentrations of submicron particles were associated with air masses transported short distances from the southern regions in all four seasons, while long-range transport from Inner Mongolia (western and northern regions) also contributed to summertime particulate pollution in the background areas of the NCP. Our results illustrate that the background particles in the NCP are influenced significantly by aging processes and regional transport, and the increased contribution of aerosol nitrate highlights how regional reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions are critical for remedying occurrence of nitratedominated haze events over the NCP. © 2021 Author(s).",,"aerosol composition; chemical composition; chemical process; concentration (composition); mountain environment; particulate matter; seasonal variation; China; Gansu; North China Plain; Xinglong Mountain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103336762

Accurate prediction of PM2.5 concentration is very important for people to prevent injury effectively. In order to predict PM2.5 concentration more accurately in this environment, a hybrid modelling method of support vector regression and adaptive unscented Kalman filter (SVR-AUKF) is proposed to predict atmospheric PM2.5 concentration in the case of incorrect or unknown noise. Firstly, the PM2.5 concentration prediction model was established by support vector regression. Secondly, the state space framework of the model is combined with the adaptive unscented Kalman filter method to estimate the uncertain PM2.5 concentration state and noise through continuous updating when the model noise is incorrect or unknown. Finally, the proposed method is compared with SVR-UKF method, the simulation results show that the proposed method is more accurate and robust. The proposed method is compared with SVR-UKF, AR-Kalman, AR and BP methods.

Among low-carbon measures, retrofitting existing coal power plants with biomass co-firing is regarded as a promising cost-efficient option to mitigate greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions. However, the life-cycle economic cost or environmental benefit of this coal-to-biomass retrofit is not identical for various types of power plants in different regions. To facilitate a more efficient biomass utilization strategy in an energy system, it is necessary to carry out a large-scale and high-resolution cost-benefit assessment for the co-firing of biomass and coal in retrofitted plants. Taking China as an example, this study utilized a bottom-up approach and geographic information system, combined with the latest available datasets, to develop a unit-level cost-benefit analysis framework for the coal-to-biomass transition. The results indicate that the coal-to-biomass retrofit costs US$18.3–73.0 for each ton of carbon reduction, and US$21.6–806.5 for each kg of SO2 reduction, at a 25% blending ratio. Installed capacity, operating year, and transportation distance are important influencing factors of cost-benefit heterogeneity. The priority of power unit retrofitting in terms of carbon reductions mainly depends on the cost preference, while that for SO2 reduction is mainly determined by benefit preference. The analytical framework proposed in this study can be used in other countries to formulate an efficient biomass development strategy. © 2021","Biomass energy; China; Cost-benefit analysis; Power plants; Unit-level","Air pollution; Biomass; Blending; Carbon; Climate change; Coal; Coal industry; Cost reduction; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Retrofitting; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollutant emission; Biomass utilization; Development strategies; Environmental benefits; Global climate changes; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Low-carbon transitions; Transportation distance; Cost benefit analysis; biomass power; bottom-up approach; coal-fired power plant; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; energy planning; environmental economics; global climate; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099686070

However, there is a lack of clarity for existing studies that investigate total carbon balance for China's terrestrial carbon balance (carbon storage and Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP)). In this study, based on large data and the improved NEP model, we examined land use and climate change during 2000–2015 in China, calculated terrestrial ecosystem carbon storage change caused by land use change, and carbon sink/source variation under climate change; we found that during 2000–2015, 3.05 % of China’s land area had land use type changes and caused 32.97 Tg of carbon storage loss, consisting of 10.4 Tg from vegetation carbon storage and 22.57 Tg from soil organic carbon (SOC) loss. Built-up land occupying ecological land was the most obvious land transfer type, especially for grassland degeneration. Both temperature and precipitation showed decreasing trends throughout China. Mean annual NEP showed a carbon sink value of 41.73 g C.m−2.yr−1, and the NEPs of carbon sinks were mostly distributed in South and Midland China and partly in Northeast China. There were obvious regional differences and the carbon balance showed that North China and Northwest China were regions of net carbon sources. The other four regions were net carbon sinks. Land use changes caused carbon storage loss in all regions, NEPs in North China and Northwest China were carbon sources, while in the other regions were carbon sinks. All NEPs exhibited an increasing trend during 2000–2015, except for Mid-South China. Finally, according to regional carbon balance characters, different policy implications were drawn which can serve for the formulation of territorial spatial planning. Land exploitation should be limited and environmental conservation is needed in North and Northwest China. The temperature in Southwest China has been increasing continuously and merits attention. The control of built-up land expansion in other regions should be strengthened. © 2020","Carbon balance; Carbon storage; Climate change; Land use change; Net Ecosystem Productivity; Terrestrial ecosystem","carbon balance; carbon storage; climate change; land use change; net ecosystem production; terrestrial ecosystem; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098846793

However, the mismatch between data centres’ heat supply and district heating systems’ heat demands limits its utilization. Further, high peak loads increase the operation cost of district heating systems. This study aimed to solve these problems by introducing thermal energy storages. A water tank and a borehole thermal energy storage system were selected as the short-term and long-term thermal energy storage, respectively. Energy, economic, and environmental indicators were introduced to evaluate different solutions. The case study was a campus district heating system in Norway. Results showed that the water tank could shave the peak load by 31% and save the annual energy cost by 5%. The payback period was lower than 15 years when the storage efficiency remained higher than 80%. However, it had no obvious benefits in terms of mismatch relieving and CO2 emissions reduction. In contrast, the borehole thermal energy storage increased the waste heat utilization rate to 96% and reduced the annual CO2 emissions by 8%. However, the payback period was more than 17 years.

However, the relation between tree water use and biomass production has never been assessed throughout the entire rotation for poplar trees. Meanwhile, it remains poorly understood how the transpiration driving factors of poplars will change with stand age. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between transpiration (E) and aboveground biomass (ABM), as well as the main drivers of E for 2- to 5-year-old (2016–2019) Populus tomentosa trees under three water treatments. The annual increase in ABM depended on annually accumulated E and their relationship could be fitted with a logistic curve in each growing season (R2 &gt; 0.89). Throughout the whole rotation period, compared with the non-irrigated trees, full irrigation trees produced 59% more biomass with only 12% more E, while deficit irrigation trees attained 46% more biomass with 32% more E. The daily E had a strong exponential relationship with vapor pressure deficit (D) during years 3–5 of the rotation, and the asymptote of this relationship increased with tree age (1.6 kPa (2017), 2 kPa (2018), 2.5 kPa (2019)). The E was also strongly linearly correlated to solar radiation (Rs) for each year although with slightly weaker relationships than for D. Similar to other poplar species, P. tomentosa showed effective stomatal control on E. However, soil water content had almost no effect on E for all treatments, no matter which soil layer was considered. D and Rs were the major drivers of P. tomentosa transpiration during the growing season, even during drought periods, in the study region.

Conversion of grassland plays an important role in estimating the regional nutrients budget and assessing ecological effects. However, few studies have estimated the impacts of grassland conversion on soil nutrients under different soil pedogenic horizons. This study selected three sites, which were covered by grassland, shelterbelt, and cropland. The study evaluated the effects of grassland conversion and soil pedogenic horizon (to a depth of 100 cm) on the soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (STN), and soil total phosphorus (STP) concentrations and stocks in the Chinese Chernozem region. The results revealed that significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences were seen after grassland conversion for concentrations and stocks of SOC, STN, and STP. The transformation from grassland to shelterbelt and cropland plantations caused soil carbon and soil nitrogen losses but caused soil phosphorus accumulations. Moreover, conversion of grassland made SOC, STN, and STP all drop below the Bk-horizon. Changes in the SOC and STP on an area basis were the greatest after conversion of grassland to cropland, for concentrations of −16% and 26% and for stocks of −15% and 32%, respectively. Land use change and soil pedogenic horizon primarily influenced the distribution patterns of nutrients concentrations and stocks. However, grassland conversion effects on nutrients were mainly at surface horizons. Soil properties, such as calcium carbonate (CaCO3 ) and soil texture, affected the nutrients from the Bk-horizon to the C-horizon. This study indicates that land use management policies should protect natural grasslands to minimize losses of SOC, STN, and STP. © 2021 by the authors.

Photocatalysts can in fact be used in hydrogen (H2) production (e.g., via water splitting or photoreforming of organic substrates), CO2 reduction, pollution mitigation and water or air remediation via oxidation (photodegradation) of pollutants. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a “benchmark” photocatalyst, thanks to many favorable characteristics. We here review the basic knowledge on the charge carrier processes that define the optical and photophysical properties of intrinsic TiO2. We describe the main characteristics and advantages of TiO2 as photocatalyst, followed by a summary of historical facts about its application. Next, the dynamics of photogenerated electrons and holes is reviewed, including energy levels and trapping states, charge separation and charge recombination. A section on optical absorption and optical properties follows, including a discussion on TiO2 photoluminescence and on the effect of molecular oxygen (O2) on radiative recombination. We next summarize the elementary photocatalytic processes in aqueous solution, including the photogeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the hydrogen evolution reaction. We pinpoint the TiO2 limitations and possible ways to overcome them by discussing some of the “hottest” research trends toward solar hydrogen production, which are classified in two categories: (1) approaches based on the use of engineered TiO2 without any cocatalysts. Discussed topics are highly-reduced “black TiO2"", grey and colored TiO2, surface-engineered anatase nanocrystals; (2) strategies based on heterojunction photocatalysts, where TiO2 is electronically coupled with a different material acting as cocatalyst or as sensitizer. Examples discussed include TiO2 composites or heterostructures with metals (e.g., Pt-TiO2, Au-TiO2), with other metal oxides (e.g., Cu2O, NiO, etc.), direct Z-scheme heterojunctions with g-C3N4 (graphitic carbon nitride) and dye-sensitized TiO2. © 2021 by the authors.","Absorption; Charge lifetimes; Charge transfer; Composite photocatalyst; Ecological transition; Heterostructures; Hydrogen production; O2 sensing; Photocatalysis; Photoluminescence","Carbon nitride; Charge carriers; Copper oxides; Heterojunctions; Hydrogen production; Light absorption; Molecular oxygen; Nickel oxide; Optical properties; Oxide minerals; Platinum compounds; Substrates; Water pollution; Charge carrier process; Charge recombinations; Photocatalytic process; Photogenerated electrons; Photophysical properties; Radiative recombination; Solar Hydrogen Production; Titanium dioxides (TiO2); Titanium dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103430908

While the film is misleading and inaccurate, “Planet” provides fodder for reimagining renewable energy initiatives in ways that advance this moment's antiracist activism and reinvigorate communities of color reeling from Covid-19’s disruptions. Specifically, I explore how solar energy campaigns in these communities unwittingly contribute to some of the environmental problems sensationalized by “Planet,” (e.g. mining, toxic waste, occupational hazards). In the process, these antiracist campaigns paradoxically reinforce the white supremacist hierarchies that shape commodity production. This paradox emerges when campaigns focus on what I call “the means of reduction” as opposed to the means of production. “The means of reduction” refers to the practices that render commodities as capable of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and electricity bills. In response, I offer a pragmatic praxis for aligning community solar campaigns with antiracist principles—linkages that can help communities of color address intersecting precarities. This praxis shifts the focus from reduction to production so as to ensure that community solar efforts are working toward antiracist values. The praxis’ “theoretical” component repurposes the concept of “co-pollutants” to illuminate environmental injustices throughout solar supply chains. Its “practice” component operationalizes this theoretical component, addressing solar's co-pollutants by shifting the focus of community solar campaigns from consumer power to people power. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Black Lives Matter; Covid-19; Energy democracy; Just transition; Solar energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100515088

As a result, newly manufactured cars consume less fuel and emit lower amounts of CO2. In terms of exhaust emissions and fuel consumption, old cars are significantly inferior to the more recent models. In Poland, for instance, the average age of passenger cars is approximately 13 years. Therefore, apart from developing new solutions in the cars produced today, it is important to focus on measures that enable the reduction in CO2 emissions in older vehicles. These methods include the adaptation of used cars to run on gaseous fuels. Natural gas is a hydrocarbon fuel that is particularly preferred in terms of CO2 emissions. The article presents the results of research of carbon oxides emission (CO, CO2) in the exhaust gas of a passenger car fueled by petrol and natural gas. The emissions were measured under the conditions of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test and in real road tests. The test results confirm that compared to petrol, a CNG vehicle allows for a significant reduction in CO2 and CO emissions in a car that is several years old, especially in urban traffic conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper extends the multi-directional efficiency analysis (MEA) to zero-sum game MEA (ZSG-MEA) with considering the CO2 emission as a fixed-sum undesirable output to measure the energy and environmental performance (EEP) of the transportation sector. The ZSG-MEA window analysis is applied to dynamically evaluate the EEP of China’s transportation sector in 30 provincial-level regions during 2008–2017. Some interesting findings are obtained: (i) the EEP of the transportation sector in most regions has not been performed well but the average EEP of the transportation sector in most regions has been gradually improved since 2011. A general trend is that the transportation sector in the east area wins the best average EEP, and the average EEP of the central area is better than that of the west area, but their gap is narrowing from 2012. (ii) The EEP fluctuation verifies the greatest imbalance of EEP among the east area’s regions. Both the east area and the central area are narrowing the imbalance in recent years, but the west area has an inverse trend. (iii) The performance of CO2 emissions is better than that of energy consumption in all three areas, which implies that China’s transportation sector seems to have paid more attention on emission reduction than energy conservation. Besides, the east area has the best performance of energy consumption and CO2 emissions from an overall perspective. And the energy consumption and CO2 emissions in the central area perform better than the west area before 2013, but then shows an entangled state from 2013. (iv) From the average variable specific ZSG-MEA efficiency, the industrial added value of transportation sector performs better than other variables in the east area and central area, but the situation in the west area is inverse.

This article discusses the opportunities and benefits of applying the concepts of regreening and rewilding of cities. The article engages with key sources and summarizes the background and development of regreening and nature‐based solutions and important policies, concerns and perspectives of international and national organizations. It introduces the integration of nature‐based solutions (NBS) as a strategy in urban planning with the aim to strengthen urban resilience and to slow down the biodiversity de-cline. Rewilding areas in cities has become a powerful strategy to bring back butterflies, insects, birds, and wildlife. In contrast to highly managed parks and gardens, these rewilding initiatives are leaving allotted spaces mostly uncultivated and self‐regulated. Contact to nature is essential for human existence, urban wellbeing, and good quality of life. Green spaces in cities—big or small—all contribute to the health and wellbeing of residents. However, many cities do not offer residents easy access to green space within the city. Improving the better distribution of and access to green spaces and extending gardens and parks is likely to deliver a large number of benefits, such as: ecosystem services, better water management for enhanced urban flood control, slowing down the biodiversity loss, contributing to food security, and restoring damaged ecosystems. Furthermore, additional green space and NBS help to keep cities cool during heatwaves and improve the urban microcli-mate. Rewilding has emerged as an important part of new public parks and gardens. The next step is to up‐scale citywide climate intervention strategies deployed to keep cities cool. However, as the discussion of this article shows, it is essential that the design of these NBS strategies is fully integrated with other complementary planning interventions and seeks synergies across all sectors. © 2021 by the author.

The stoving process has many steps, but the most energy-intensive step is heating and drying the candies, which can consume up to 84% of the energy at a factory. Drying is achieved by heating and ventilating the candy stove with large volumes of outside air, so the impact of the local climate on confectionery facilities can be significant. However, there is a lack of literature investigating local climate impact on the stoving process. This work demonstrates how Multiobjective Optimization (MOO) can be used to find a balanced solution between first cost and energy usage. Furthermore, the work investigates local climate impact to study whether strategic facility siting in a specific climate zone can significantly reduce energy needs and installation costs. The paper proposes a generic energy model that uses actual meteorological data and a product-driven recipe for calculating the energy requirement of a confectionery stove. Four distinct climate zones were analyzed, and it was found that operating a stove in a dry, hot climate, such as Las Vegas, requires 15% less energy than a hot-humid climate, such as Houston. The energy model incorporates a Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) procedure to minimize energy usage and initial cost. The algorithm varies the airflow rate and percentage of outdoor air used in the stove. A Pareto Front search procedure is defined, which compares all solutions against a “base case” solution. The base case can be the minimum of any objective, but for this work, it is the lowest energy consuming solution. The search procedure found a preferred solution where a small increase in energy consumption, 0.2%, reduces first cost by 12%–45%. The methods outlined in this paper apply to any energy-consuming manufacturing process that is influenced by climate or any such process that has a broad set of functional operating parameters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate; Energy modeling; Food processing; Multiobjective optimization; Thermo-economics; Weather data","Cost reduction; Drying; Energy utilization; Evolutionary algorithms; Meteorology; Stoves; Energy requirements; Hot humid climate; Installation costs; Manufacturing process; Meteorological data; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Operating parameters; Preferred solutions; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090745673

At the beginning of the experiment, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) removal efficiency was 30.2% in tall fescue-cultivated soil, which was significantly higher than that of unplanted soil (19.4%). However, when compost was added as a soil amendment, TPHs removal efficiency increased to 39.2% in tall fescue-cultivated soil. Interestingly, potential CH4 emissions were more affected by the initial diesel concentration than by compost addition or tall fescue planting. Specifically, the potential CH4 emission was approximately 3.8 times higher in the treatment with the highest initial diesel concentration (T-WC38) than that of the treatment with the lowest initial diesel concentration (T-WC5). Functional gene analysis revealed that TPHs removal had a linear correlation with the alkB/16S gene ratio, whereas potential CH4 emission had a linear correlation with pmoA gene copy numbers.

If that CO2 could be converted into ethanol by carbon capture and utilization technologies it would be possible to increase ethanol production more than 37% without additional corn grain inputs. Gas fermentation processes use microbes to convert carbon-containing gases into ethanol and so have the potential to be used with the CO2 from biorefineries for this purpose. However, as CO2 utilization technologies for converting thermodynamically stable CO2 are typically energy intensive, it is necessary to evaluate the related life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon intensities or CIs) to see whether there are actual emission reduction benefits. In this study, we evaluate the CIs of ethanol produced from high-purity CO2 in corn ethanol plants by gas fermentation plus electrochemical reduction. Our analysis shows that the sources of electricity and hydrogen are key drivers of CO2-based ethanol's GHG emissions. With wind electricity, the design cases show the potential of near-zero CI ethanol (1.1 g CO2e/MJ), but that can increase to up to 331–531 g CO2e/MJ when today's U.S. Midwest electricity mix is used. To avoid the renewable electricity intermittency issue, we considered a power purchase agreement option using wind electricity 40% of the time and using the regional mix for the rest, which provides a 42% GHG emission reduction from the CI of gasoline. © 2020 The Authors and UChicago Argonne, LLC, Operator of Argonne National Laboratory.

We also show that the optimal policy choice depends on R&D efficiency and spillovers. In particular, when green R&D is inefficient and the spillover rate is low (high), the government should choose an emissions tax and (not) privatize the state-owned firm.

This study, however, intends to present a new perspective in order to maximize the utilization of active sites by forming nanovoids in the Si–O–C domain. Structural native nanovoids were formed by introducing PSS-Octakis (dimethylsilyloxy) silsesquioxane (POSS) into the synthesis process of SiOC, and it was then utilized as anode materials of LIBs. Moreover, the effects of POSS on the chemical, structural, and electrochemical properties of SiOC were investigated by varying the content of POSS. It was determined that the addition of POSS could form nanovoids, reduce the free carbon region, decrease the electrical conductivity, and increase the oxygen-rich tetrahedral Si–O–C structure. Despite the reduced electrical conductivity, the porosity formed by the addition of POSS induced high output characteristics by enabling fast ion diffusion to the active SiOC site during the repetitive lithiation/delithiation processes. Furthermore, the nanovoids were found to be capable of improving the structural stability during charge/discharge processes through a buffering effect. Moreover, the increased oxygen-rich tetrahedral Si–O–C structure was able to maximize reversible capacity. Such structural change resulted in a high specific capacity of 980 mAh g−1 at a current density of 180 mA g−1 as well as improved rate capability. A high specific capacity of 412 mAh g−1 was obtained even at a high current density of 3600 mA g−1, and 94% of the initial capacity was maintained after 200 cycles at a current density of 360 mA g−1. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anode materials; Li-ion batteries; Octakis(dimethylsilyoxy)silsesquioxane; Porous ceramics; Silicon oxycarbide","Anodes; Carbon; Current density; Electric conductivity; Ions; Lithium-ion batteries; Oxygen; Silicon batteries; Stability; Anode material for lithium ion batteries; Electrical conductivity; High current densities; High specific capacity; Lithiation/delithiation; Reversible capacity; Silicon oxycarbides; Structural stabilities; Silicon compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096684210

These can be used as a platform for opening discussion and learning about the increased issues of the global crisis in contemporary society. I have drawn upon the representative case studies about climate change to explore how they intervene in urban public space and how they engage viewers to spread awareness, which is one of the fundamental aspects of this paper. It also stimulates viewers’ perceptions and awareness of a more sustainable future through phenomenological and emotional experiences.

Various studies are investigating catalysts for lignocellulosic biomass conversion to valuable chemicals and fuels. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are important catalysts because of their well-ordered porous structures and large surface areas. Although MOFs can be applied directly, four modification strategies can be used to alter their catalytic properties and improve catalytic performance. In the first strategy, coordinatively unsaturated sites are created by changing the bonding state of the metal node. In the second approach, organic linkers with additional functional groups or active elements are used. In the third strategy, MOFs and other active elements are combined. In the final approach, MOFs are carbonized to produce carbon-supported metal catalysts.

Many studies have been conducted on developing and evaluating electrochemical cells that provide high energy efficiency and conversion of CO2 for CO production via ECO2R. However, commercially feasible technologies are yet to be developed and demonstrated due to various technical limitations as well as the lack of a systematic evaluation framework. In this study, CO production performance is examined by catholyte-free electrochemical CO2 reduction (CF-ECO2R), which eliminates a large ohmic drop by removing the catholyte compartment, thus lowering the energy requirement. The CF-ECO2R shows 0.6 V lower cell voltage and 17.4% higher electrical energy conversion efficiency than a typical GDE-catholyte method using 1 M KOH as the catholyte at a current density of 240 mA cm-2. The obtained results are used to demonstrate its technical feasibility and to provide basic data for the evaluation of a scale-up process. A mathematical model is developed based on the obtained experimental data and the model is simulated along with three different options of downstream separation to provide basic mass and energy balance data. Then, techno-economic and CO2 life cycle analyses are conducted to suggest the best configuration of the overall CO production system in terms of the economics and net CO2 reduction. It is estimated that the best configuration provides a reduction in CO2 emission by 48% compared to the conventional CO production via steam methane reforming. This configuration is also assessed to be economically feasible, giving a production cost (584 USD per ton CO) that is competitive with the current market price of CO. It is also demonstrated that the operating voltage of the CF-ECO2R and regional influences such as CO2 emission intensity and cost of the mixed electricity strongly affect the cost and CO2 emission of the system.

Before any implementation of geoengineering, however, the complex natural responses and consequences of such methods should be fully understood to avoid any unexpected and potentially degrading impacts. Here we assess the changes in ecosystem carbon exchange and storage among different terrestrial biomes under three aerosol-based radiation management methods with the baseline of RCP8.5 using an Earth system model (NorESM1-ME). All three methods used in this study (stratospheric aerosol injection, marine sky brightening, cirrus cloud thinning) target the global mean radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere to reach that of the RCP4.5 scenario. The three radiation management (RM) methods investigated in this study show vastly different precipitation patterns, especially in the tropical forest biome. Precipitation differences from the three RM methods result in large variability in global vegetation carbon uptake and storage. Our findings show that there are unforeseen regional consequences under geoengineering, and these consequences should be taken into account in future climate policies as they have a substantial impact on terrestrial ecosystems. Although changes in temperature and precipitation play a large role in vegetation carbon uptake and storage, our results show that CO2fertilization also plays a considerable role. We find that the effects of geoengineering on vegetation carbon storage are much smaller than the effects of mitigation under the RCP4.5 scenario (e.g., afforestation in the tropics). Our results emphasize the importance of considering multiple combined effects and responses of land biomes while achieving the global temperature targets of the Paris Agreement. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

Based on PM2.5 data collected from the ground-based observation stations, two PM2.5 prediction models are constructed through the deep learning approach. Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth from the GOCI and MODIS are used as the main predictors of two models. Both models predict spatial distribution throughout Seoul, Korea (R2 of 0.61 and 0.78). Particularly, the western parts of Seoul tend to have higher PM2.5 concentrations than the other parts, whereas mid-outskirts have noticeably low concentrations. A comparison of spatial distributions of PM2.5 between observations and predictions show that the existing observation network only reflects 15%–60% of entire characteristics of Seoul. Utilizing city-wide PM2.5 estimations, a comparison of estimated PM2.5 between urban and forest regions has been performed. The results show that the estimated PM2.5 concentrations in the forest regions are less than those in urban regions by up to 16.4 μg m−3. In contrast to urban regions, the average of PM2.5 concentrations in the forest regions is likely below the daily mean WHO PM2.5 outdoor standard. Our study suggests that urban forest could be a potential way to improve urban air quality with a specific focus on PM2.5. In addition, the deep learning approach used in this study can be applied to other cities where obtaining observation measurements is difficult. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Mitigation; PM2.5; Satellites; Spatial characteristics; Urban forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100722595

A major concern in the European Union (EU) is air pollution, especially nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which causes many inhabitants health problems and decreases the quality of life. A non-expensive way to reduce pollutants is implementing road restriction policies, as the creation of low emission zones. In this work, we analyze the case of Madrid Central, a low emission zone deployed in Madrid, Spain. We evaluate if it was effective to reduce air pollutants and if there were a side effect, as pollution displacement, during its application. Drawing on open data, we analyze air quality at different points of the city, before and during the application of this measure. Taking into account the EU directives in terms of what healthy air means, we consider three metrics: (a) the trend of NO2 concentration in the air in both periods, (b) the difference between the NO2 concentration during both periods, and (c) the percentage of time in which the population is exposed to air with NO2 concentration under a specific threshold (healthy air as defined by the EU). According to the results, Madrid Central significantly reduces the NO2 concentration in the air and does not produce pollution displacement. Thus, the population breathes healthy air during more time, and there is a positive effect on the whole city. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air pollution; Low emission zone; Pedestrianization; Urban health","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); design; emission; European Union; nitrogen dioxide; pollution control; prioritization; public health; quality of life; Madrid [Spain]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091513796

Legacy effects of past land use, including land conversion and changes in land-use intensity, influence the capacity for future ecosystem carbon sequestration. These effects are hard to quantify, however, and the influence of changes in land-use intensity are still largely overlooked. This study assessed the long term dynamics (1850–2015) of the terrestrial carbon budget in France. We developed a new dynamic model: LUCCA (Land Use Change & Conversion Accounting) that robustly quantifies the dynamics of carbon stocks and fluxes. It allows disentanglement of land conversion from land management effects following a socio-ecological perspective. Carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems in France increased from 3.5 GtC in 1850 to 4.8 GtC in 2015 as a result of contrasting regional land-use trajectories. Based on five counterfactual scenarios, we unravel that changes in land-use intensity explained 46 % of the observed carbon stock changes since 1850, while land conversion was responsible for 30 %, and the rest can be attributed to changes in forest growth rates induced by both environmental and management changes. The effects of land conversion and changes in land-use intensity on carbon stock accumulation, however, would have been hardly possible in the absence of agricultural intensification and release of harvest pressure following wood-fuel substitution by fossil fuel. In fact, carbon emissions induced by fossil fuel consumption in France from 1850 to 2015 were 9 times the carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems. These figures highlight the importance of considering long-term trajectories of ecosystem carbon fluxes and their relationship with emissions from other processes for climate action strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon cycle; Ecosystems; France; Land-use; Long-term trajectories; Socio-ecological metabolism","agricultural intensification; carbon sink; carbon storage; ecosystem dynamics; fossil fuel; fuel consumption; land management; land use change; long-term change; France; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098725794

This technology can potentially boost the diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs) and consequently contribute in reducing the local air pollution and the related externalities. In this context, an environmental and economic analysis has been performed to estimate the social costs saving derived by the decarbonization of the passenger cars mobility. The benefits evaluated in the analysis are compared to the investment and maintenance costs necessary to install and operate a DWPT infrastructure. This under the basic assumption of the present work that considers the widespread adoption of electric vehicles achievable only in presence of the parallel integration of DWPT systems in the motorway infrastructure. At the same time, the work takes into account the possible variations of the energy mix and the effects related to the increase of the electric energy demand related to the increase of the circulating electric vehicles. The analysis is carried out for the six most populous European countries (i.e. Italy, France, Germany, Poland, Spain and UK) and it indicates as the estimated social costs savings are capable to sustain the investment for a wide integration of DWPT in almost all these countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Externalities; Local pollutants; Wireless Power Transfer","Air pollution; Binary alloys; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Economic analysis; Electric automobiles; Energy transfer; Inductive power transmission; Potassium alloys; Sustainable development; Uranium alloys; Wireless charging; Air pollutant emission; Electric energies; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmental sustainability; European Countries; Local air pollutions; Maintenance cost; Parallel integration; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095869835

For this reason, it is fundamental to evaluate the effects on the energetic behaviour and conservation issues caused by retrofit measures in historical structures. The research aims at the performance improvement of Architectural Heritage promoting passive cooling strategies through a comparison between ventilation chimneys and historical courthouses. The architect J. R. Gordon (1863-1937) designed seventeen courthouses in Texas, twelve of which are still existing and functioning at this time. Reinterpreting the period's attention in mechanical systems' innovations for ventilation, cooling and heating, Gordon's courthouse buildings exploits natural ventilation as a strategy for achieving buildings' passive cooling, in the hot and humid climate areas of the Texas state, in a design process that evolved over time to become more technologically sophisticated and climatically efficient. This research investigates the design and construction features and climatic response strategies of Gordon's different types of court houses, specifically examines and assesses their natural ventilation effects.

So far, 190 Parties have submitted their NDCs. But how the NDC can be made comprehensive, unanimous and implementable so that the Paris climate goals can be achieved has been a matter of growing concern among policymakers, academics, and practitioners. Aiming to bridge the knowledge gap about institutional deliberation of NDCs, we assessed the formulation process and implementation outcome of Nepal's first NDC by employing qualitative research methods. We undertook semi-structured interviews (n = 10) with all experts and bureaucrats engaged in the NDC formulation process. Moreover, we conducted group discussions (n = 18) with nine stakeholder groups and key informant surveys (n = 12) with four stakeholder groups representing cross-sectoral ministries, private-sector, (retired) bureaucrats, and media people. We also reviewed contemporary literature and progress report of sectoral governments and other related institutions. The collected data were then analyzed by applying the discursive institutional framework. As NDC is a national political plan of climate action and demands support and commitment from a wide spectrum of society, our results, however, revealed that Nepal's first NDC was formulated without engaging politicians and the other major state and non-state actors. Moreover, the country's NDC was framed and articulated only for fulfilling international obligation (or commitment) and getting international fund, but not as a determined national climate plan of action for expediting climate action at (sub) national level. Our analysis further found that very few institutions including policies, programmes, and budgets were arranged for translating targets of the NDC into action. Because of these shortcomings, Nepal's first NDC could not achieve most of its stipulated targets. Based on the analysis and results of our study, we have discussed and recommended some pathways that are critical for the formulation and implementation of enhanced/updated NDCs in Nepal and the other countries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate action; Climate change; Discourse; Discursive institutionalism; Mitigation","Environmental engineering; Pollution; Formulation process; Group discussions; Institutional framework; International obligations; Non state actors; Qualitative research methods; Semi structured interviews; Stakeholder groups; Budget control; action plan; adaptive management; climate change; institutional framework; international agreement; national planning; political discourse; research method; stakeholder; article; budget; climate change; clinical article; government; human; language; Nepal; outcome assessment; private sector; public figure; qualitative research; semi structured interview; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096185215

Based on a conducted web‐survey and qualitative interviews among local professionals, this paper examines the obstacles, potentials and drivers that could facilitate and accelerate BIPV and PV façade integration, as well as needs that could encourage wider PV use. In order to define a unified strategy, aligning the stakeholders’ views, the following disputable factors are pointed out and discussed: (1) incomplete understanding of BIPV and building‐applied photovoltaics (BAPV) among stakeholders, (2) costs of BIPV systems, (3) low awareness of and confidence in “integrability” of PV modules, (4) incomplete knowledge about and insufficiently investigated PV performance and (5) potential of PV façade and roof integration. Since the costs are the key identified factor for BIPV implementation, life‐cycle cost (LCC) assessments of PV façade and roof integrations have been performed, which supported the search for solutions to identified problems. The performed analysis and findings present the basis for the development of a long‐term holistic strategy for PV implementation in Singapore that could help the highly‐urbanized, tropical resource‐ and land‐constrained island city‐state reduce the dependency on fossil fuels and achieve the climate change targets, thus promoting a more sustainable built environment. © 2021 by the authors.

The Mackenzie Delta region in northern Canada is populated by numerous small shallow lakes. They are classified as no-, low-, and high-closure (NC, LC, and HC, respectively) lakes, reflecting varying degrees of connection to the river main stem, and have different sedimentation characteristics. This study examines sedimentological (mineral surface area, grain size), carbon isotopic (bulk and molecular-level) and inorganic isotopic (neodymium) characteristics of sediment cores from three lakes representing each class. We find that HC lake sediments exhibit strikingly different properties from the other lake sediments. Specifically, they are characterized by higher organic carbon loadings per unit mineral surface area and with relatively minor influence from allochthonous, petrogenic (rock-derived) organic carbon. In contrast, LC and NC lakes have the potential to record basin-scale climatic changes at a high resolution by virtue of enhanced detrital sedimentation. Overall the delta lakes have the capacity to bury about 2 MtC year−1, with little changes in the last 200 years. However, in the (near) future, an increased number of high closure lakes might change the carbon burial efficiency of the Mackenzie Delta as they seem to retain less carbon than NC and LC lakes. © 2021.

We present an integrated observational analysis based on long-term in situ multispecies eddy flux measurements, allowing for quantifying near-real-time changes of urban surface emissions for key air quality and climate tracers. During the first European SARS-CoV-2 wave we find that the emission reduction of classic air pollutants decoupled from CO2 and was significantly larger. These differences can only be rationalized by the different nature of urban combustion sources and point towards a systematic bias of extrapolated urban NOx emissions in state-of-the-art emission models. The analysis suggests that European policies, shifting residential, public, and commercial energy demand towards cleaner combustion, have helped to improve air quality more than expected and that the urban NOx flux remains to be dominated (e.g., &gt; 90 %) by traffic. © Author(s) 2021.

In urban areas, road traffic is an important source of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, primarily due to exhaust gases. The adoption of paraffinic renewable diesel fuels for urban transportation has been suggested as a more sustainable and less air polluting alternative to conventional fossil fuels. The aim of this study is, therefore, to examine whether the transition from the conventional fossil fuel diesel to paraffinic renewable diesel (hydrotreated vegetable oil [HVO] according to the EN 15940 standard) can reduce PM2.5 and NOx emissions in an urban environment. The life cycle assessment-based handprint approach is utilized to calculate and demonstrate the emissions reduction. The reduction potential is quantified for Euro 4, 5 and 6 passenger diesel cars using actual car fleet, mileage, local temperature, and laboratory emissions measurements for 2018 in Helsinki, Finland. Our study shows that the use of HVO can reduce PM2.5 and NOx emissions in urban areas. According to our results, PM2.5 emissions could be reduced by 49% for the defined location and car fleet by replacing conventional fossil-fuel diesel with HVO. In the case of NOx emissions, the local reduction potential is 7%. Overall life cycle emissions reduction potentials of NOx and PM2.5 emissions are 11% and 44%, respectively, if conventional diesel is replaced by HVO. Thus, the manufacturer of HVO can communicate the air quality handprint, and in particular, the NOx and PM2.5 handprints, that their product can achieve. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Air quality handprint; Fine particulate matter; HVO; Hydrotreated vegetable oil; Nitrogen oxide","Air quality; Automobile manufacture; Biodiesel; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Emission control; Exhaust gases; Life cycle; Nitrogen oxides; Urban transportation; Ambient air pollution; Densely populated regions; Emissions measurements; Environmental challenges; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle emissions; Reduction potential; Fossil fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099166037

A two-week sampling campaign was conducted at the toll station on the first highway in the Taipei metropolitan area. Indoor tollbooth monitoring samples were collected for the ETC and MTC lanes to assess the hourly p-PAH, PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations. The hourly average particle concentration was calculated for different types of toll collection based on 100 vehicles per hour. The average traffic density in the truck and bus lanes or car and van lanes with ETC was significantly higher than that with MTC. The mean p-PAH, PM1.0, and PM2.5 concentrations in the car and van lanes with MTC were higher than those for ETC. The increases in PM1.0 and PM2.5 concentrations per 100 vehicles in the bus and truck lanes with MTC were approximately 2 times greater than those for ETC.

These resources are envisioned as a “transitional bridge” to a low-carbon economy dominated by renewable generation. This paper tackles the idea that such a “fuel bridge” could lead to a more sustainable transition. It studies the network of actors and interests involved in exploring a coalbed methane ‘volume’, its modelling and how it becomes public. Through this lens, it shows how a ‘volume’ endures in a ‘stratum’, as well as the political issues related to this reconfiguring of the underground in Lorraine. The article contributes to three debates in relation with political geology. First, it proposes a renewed definition of ‘volume’ based on the work of Michel Serres. The ‘volume’ is not a property of the underground nor a geometric ideality but defined as a transitory ordering of the ‘multitude’ that encompasses material, knowledge and political issues. It enables the development of a more continuous analytical strategy to follow geological and political crossed influences, and contributes to this project by going beyond existing divides (e.g. vitalist/constructivist). Second, the paper provides the reader with a complementary perspective (from the field instead of a compilation of data at an international level) about what it means to assess an unconventional resource. The proposed definition of ‘volume’ does not reduce uncertainty to a matter of knowing but makes it constitutive of the making of a gas potential. This enables one to follow the chain of mediations through which uncertainty is framed and strategically managed to meet industrial, scientific and political interests, while taming local oppositions. Third, the paper analyses why this coalbed methane ‘stratum’ may be democratically contested and transitory instead of preparing the ground for a low-carbon transition. This case study looks at a unique situation in France, namely a private company receiving public support in the context of political tensions about unconventional gas, and shows the country's internal contradictions and delays in updating its institutions and strategy concerning the use of underground resources for a low-carbon transition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coalbed methane; France; Fuel bridge; Michel serres; Stratum; Subsoil; Volume","coalbed methane; critical analysis; local participation; natural gas; political relations; public sector; subsoil; sustainability; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098196499

To drive further advancement, it is timely to conduct a review of the state-of-the-art and lessons learnt from the relevant literature. In this paper, 102 urban climate real case modelling studies published in 2000–2019 are reviewed. Patterns and preferences in their study locations, periods, model choices, land cover databases, topics discussed, and scenarios investigated are holistically examined. There is an evident improvement in model complexity and urban surface data precision during the period reviewed. Most studies focus on the urban thermal climate and effects of urbanization. Based on the research gaps identified, more work is needed on the currently underrepresented but vulnerable cities in developing countries with tropical, arid, and cold climates. Collaborative field campaigns, initiatives to characterize cities in a consistent manner, and multi-scale modelling approaches have proven to benefit the progress in urban climate studies and should therefore be encouraged. More importantly, efforts should be invested in translating the science into information relevant to human well-being, urban planning, and policymaking. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Mesoscale atmospheric model; Urban climate; Urban climate application; Urban climate modelling; Urban parameterization",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100311021

The results of this study show that achieving decarbonisation of the power sector provides a net increase in domestic employment and supplies stable jobs in rural areas, thereby contributing to the revitalisation of the local economy. Furthermore, it improves inequalities in the working age population. Support from either national or local government is required to ensure a workforce is in place to enable a rapid increase in renewable energy.

We evaluated the SOC pool and selected physico-chemical soil variables after conversion of native forest to monoculture tree plantations (teak, eucalypts and rubber) in the Southern Western Ghats region of Kollam district, Kerala, India. Soil samples were collected up to a depth of 50 cm in five depth increments from six locations each from the four selected land-use systems. Soil analyses were carried out as per standard methods. Average SOC concentration ranged from 41.89 to 54.09 g kg−1 (0–10 cm), and found decreased with depth up to 30.11 to 32.98 g kg −1 (40–50 cm). The highest SOC pool (0–50 cm) was observed under natural forest (225.34 t ha−1), followed by rubber (203.48 t ha−1), eucalypts (196.21 t ha−1) and teak plantation (194.61 t ha−1). Similarly, the SOC mitigation potential (carbon equivalent to CO2) decreased in the order natural forest &gt; rubber &gt; eucalypts &gt; teak plantation. The SOC concentration showed significant variation between natural forest and tree plantations. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the major factors and trends to illustrate the variability in the data. PCA results suggest that higher SOC contents and its fractions were closely linked to the surface layers (0–20 cm) of soils under all treatments. Overall conclusion from this investigation is that SOC levels are strongly influenced by the prevailing land-use systems and found to decrease after conversion from natural vegetation to monoculture tree plantations.

The membrane structural parameters (thickness and area per lipid) were obtained at different concentrations of cations in the gel and fluid phases of membrane. Both Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions at the concentrations of 0–1 mM increase the membrane thickness by 1.9 Å and 2.9 Å in the fluid and gel phase, respectively. In the concentration range of 1–30 mM, either a weak tendency to a thickness decrease of ~ 1 Å is observed, or the thickness does not change at all. In the case of Co2+ ions, all changes are extremely weak. We advocate a model of electrostatic interactions for these systems that encompasses the formation of ion bridges between lipid headgroups. Using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm we estimate the fraction of Ca2+ ions bound to the DMPC membrane. The developed model is of an interest to the future studies of membrane interactions with various charged peptides, such as those from the amyloid-β family. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","area per lipid; lipid membranes; membrane thickness; metal ions; small-angle neutron scattering; thermodynamic state","Neutron scattering; Positive ions; Proteins; Concentration ranges; Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine; Divalent metal cations; Langmuir adsorption isotherms; Membrane interactions; Membrane thickness; Structural parameter; Unilamellar vesicle; Membranes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099158238

At the pzfc, Cu(111) shows structural dynamics at both pH 13 and pH 11, which can be understood as the onset of surface restructuring. At higher potentials, full reconstruction and electric field dependent OH adsorption occurs, which causes a remarkable decrease in the atomic density of the first Cu layer. The expansion of the Cu-Cu distance to 0.3 nm generates a hexagonal Moire pattern, on which the adsorbed OH forms a commensurate (1 × 2) adlayer structure with a steady state coverage of 0.5 monolayers at pH 13. Our experimental findings shed light on the true charge distribution and its interrelation with the atomic structure of the electrochemical interface of Cu. © 2021 The Authors.",,"Alkalinity; Binary alloys; Electric fields; Electrocatalysts; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytes; Scanning tunneling microscopy; Structural dynamics; Ultrafast lasers; Electrochemical interface; Electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy; Faradaic efficiencies; Interfacial structures; Nanosecond laser pulse; Potential of zero charge; Solid/liquid interfaces; Surface restructuring; Copper metallography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103424892

As an energy-intensive industry, cement production is one of the largest sources of greenhouse emissions in the world today. The demand for cement is synonymous with the growth in infrastructure demand and per-capita gross domestic product in the world, calling the need for mitigation measures within the industry in order to contribute to the global climate change efforts. System dynamics (SD) is a simulation approach that is used for studying the nonlinear behaviours in complex systems over time, often used in industrial domains for emission forecasts as well as policy experimentation. With the adoption rates of mitigation strategies in the cement industry being inadequate, there is a need for improvisation in policymaking through better decision-support tools. In this paper, a comparative overview of the studies that specifically utilise the SD approach for evaluation of carbon mitigation strategies in the cement industry is presented on the basis of their scope, model description, scenarios tested, and featured mitigation methods. Additionally, the potential for improvements in future studies is discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

One potential solution, gasoline compression ignition (GCI), utilizes gasoline’s lower reactivity to promote partially premixed combustion and extract efficiency while reducing the PM-NOx trade-off curve. Gasoline’s volatility allows for the use of higher levels of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), a key enabler of GCI combustion. In order to deliver higher levels of EGR while maintaining sufficient boost pressure, a tailored and efficient air-handling system is critical. This work presents the analysis-led development of a low-NOx GCI air-handling system including both turbocharger matching and EGR configuration for a prototype heavy-duty GCI engine based on a model year 2013 Cummins ISX diesel engine using low octane gasoline (RON80). In the analysis-driven development process, a 1D engine system-level analysis was closely coupled with closed-cycle 3D CFD GCI combustion development. Three different boost systems were investigated using a validated 1D engine model: 1) the production turbocharger; 2) an off-the-shelf single-stage waste-gate turbocharger; 3) a prototype single-stage variable geometry turbocharger. For each boost system, three EGR configurations were evaluated: 1) a high-pressure EGR route; 2) a low-pressure EGR route; 3) a dual-loop EGR route. The air-handling system performance was first investigated over five steady-state engine operating conditions extracted from the ramped modal cycle supplemental emissions test. Then, through cosimulation using a Simulink-based engine controls model, the best performing candidates under transient operation through the Heavy-Duty Federal Test Procedure certification cycle were identified. The production turbocharger, designed for 4–6 g/kWh engine-out NOx, suffered from low combined turbocharger efficiency under the low-NOx GCI thermal boundary conditions. The prototype 1-Stage variable geometry turbocharger, when used with a high-pressure EGR configuration, demonstrated higher combined efficiencies, while the waste-gate turbocharger showed the best results when used with a dual-loop EGR system. All low-pressure only EGR configurations were found to incur additional pumping penalties due to the need for a back pressure valve to drive sufficient EGR levels. In the transient test cycle analysis, the single-stage high-pressure EGR system was capable of delivering the target boost and EGR, while the off-the-shelf waste-gate turbocharger, with its higher mass inertia, showed slower turbine response and a resulting lag in boost response. Unsurprisingly, the dual-loop EGR system also suffered from delays in EGR delivery during engine acceleration. In summary, the prototype single-stage variable geometry turbocharger with a high-pressure EGR system produced the best performance over both the steady-state and transient engine cycles and was identified as the best candidate for the prototype low-NOx heavy-duty GCI engine. © Copyright © 2021 Kumar, Zhang, Traver and Watson.","1D analysis; 3D analysis; GCI; heavy-duty; transient; turbocharger",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106427109

However, our knowledge of C sequestration in particular, agroforestry system around the world is poor. Therefore, we conducted a study to understand biomass accumulation and carbon allocation in different components of the agroforestry system. The highest stem biomass was recorded in Eucalyptus tereticornis (69.43 ± 0.90 Mg ha−1), branch biomass in Populus deltoids (5.04 ± 0.35 Mg ha−1), leaf biomass also in P. deltoids (2.21 ± 0.12 Mg ha−1), and root biomass in Albizia procera (14.01 ± 0.44 Mg ha−1). The highest (81.01%) C allocation was recorded in the stem of Toona ciliate, branch of P. deltoids (5.73%), leaves of E. tereticornis (2.93%) and root of Anthocephalus cadamba (16.83%). The highest CO2 mitigation (160.5 ± 2.55 Mg CO2 ha−1) and C sequestration (45.33 ± 0.60 Mg ha−1) were recorded in E. tereticornis. The highest wheat crop biomass (11.85 ± 0.23 Mg ha−1) and C stock (3.59 ± 0.05 Mg ha−1) were recorded in P. deltiodes. However, soil carbon stock was recorded in E. tereticornis (37.5 ± 3.52 Mg ha−1). Thus, trees on farmlands with crops are suitable for biomass production and C allocation in different components under changing climatic scenarios. © 2021.

The Agenda 2030 of the United Nations envisages a holistic approach to achieve these goals by focusing on humankind and the planet. In this review, we analyzed the scientific literature and technical reports of international bodies such as the United Nations and Food and Agriculture Organization relating to traditional ethnobotanical knowledge (TEK). The literature on TEK was mapped with the targets of the SDGs to determine the role of traditional knowledge in the realization of selected goals and targets. Our extensive and systematic reviewing of available literatures suggests that, of the 17 goals, at least seven goals are associated with TEK. To achieve these seven goals, a thorough understanding is required to disentangle the intricacies involving TEK, indigenous people holding TEK, and their future role in achieving the SDGs. Our review points towards the role of TEK in achieving goals linked to poverty, health and wellbeing, responsible consumption and production, climate action, life on land, and partnerships. In summary, we argue that achieving the intended outcomes of the SDGs and the targets requires concerted efforts of all relevant stakeholders, including indigenous communities, common citizens, scientists, policy makers, and world leaders. © 2021 by the authors.

To reduce the modeling effort and analyze as many countries as possible, this paper proposes a novel approach of energy system archetypes which can be directly evaluated. These archetypes classify similar countries worldwide independently from their geographic location. Advantages of this idea are the setup of a transferable global database allowing for data reconstruction between countries, market size estimations, and the ability to compare peer countries facing similar challenges. To enable such modeling, a framework is developed in which the archetypes are defined, standardized modeling rules are developed, and the results are evaluated for validation. In a benchmark against simple geographic classifications, the presented clustering approach, which results in 15 archetypes, improves the variance between all countries and their corresponding archetypes by 44% compared to the variance between the countries and their geographic sub-regions. The model results of these archetypes state the need of balancing technologies for the daily cycle of photovoltaic generation and the general importance of flexibility in future decarbonized energy systems. Overall, the results confirm that archetypes are an adequate approach to derive the set of solutions for the decarbonization of worldwide countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Archetype; Clustering; Country energy systems; Decarbonization; Energy system modeling","Energy resources; Clustering approach; Data reconstruction; Energy system model; Geographic location; Global database; Optimal technology; Photovoltaic generation; Standardized models; Decarbonization; benchmarking; database; estimation method; market system; model validation; optimization; reconstruction; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099465718

Ecosystem-based approaches to adaptation (EbAs) are considered highly efficient in enhancing sustainable resilience of cities; however, incorporation of EbA measures into the decision-making process has not been fully achieved at the individual city level. The study illustrates how to initiate strategical adaptation planning “from the scratch” and facilitate the implementation of an adaptation planning process based on examples of three pilot cities in the Czech Republic (Prague, Pilsen, and Brno), using the outputs and experiences gained from participatory workshops and gathered stakeholder and institutional evidence. We focus particularly on stakeholder's perception of climate change-related risks as well as prioritization of specific EbA measures and the institutional context of the decision-making processes concerning implementation of those measures in order to enhance adaptation planning. The results show that the prioritization and suitability of individual EbA measures substantially varies among the analysed cities, depending on the local setting and associated climate-related risks. While low awareness of the problem and the non-existence of the institutional framework can be severe barriers to EbA measures implementation, strong cooperation between the city, NGOs and academics creates a supportive environment for such innovative solutions. We aim to provide Central and Eastern European context of urban EbA adaptation planning using participatory approaches, stakeholder perception and institutional analysis, which is currently not much covered from the regional perspective. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Climate change adaptation; Czech Republic; Ecosystem-based adaptation; Institutions; Participation; Stakeholders; Urban","climate change; decision making; ecosystem approach; ecosystem resilience; institutional framework; participatory approach; risk assessment; stakeholder; Czech Republic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100707494

Compositional variations in the bark samples can be explained by mixing between at least two sources with different Os isotopic signatures: a radiogenic source consistent with crust-derived materials and a relatively less radiogenic source consistent with mantle-derived chromite. The exact origin of the radiogenic Os component cannot be constrained, as background signatures and crustal materials used in the steel industry (e.g., coal and iron ore) likely have overlapping radiogenic signatures.

The effect of the precursors, gas release during the solid-state reaction, and of the intensity of high-energy ball milling on the porous structure and electrochemistry of LFMP/C is studied using DSC/TG/MS, XRD, SEM, TEM, standard contact porosimetry (MSCP), EIS, CV, and GVC. It is shown that the particle size and porosity of LFMP/C strongly depend on the chosen precursors and intensity of mechanical impact. The higher the intensity, the more effective incorporation of carbon black in the pores formed in LFMP, which leads to improved electronic conductivity and better access of the electrolyte to the surface of the electrode, while smaller particles provide improved Li diffusion in the bulk of LFMP.

In the first step of their metabolic pathway, aerobic methanotrophs use methane monooxygenases (MMOs) to activate methane, oxidizing it to methanol. There are two types of MMOs: a particulate, membrane-bound enzyme (pMMO) and a soluble, cytoplasmic enzyme (sMMO). The two MMOs are completely unrelated, with different architectures, metal cofactors, and mechanisms. The more prevalent of the two, pMMO, is copper-dependent, but the identity of its copper active site remains unclear. By contrast, sMMO uses a diiron active site, the catalytic cycle of which is well understood. Here we review the current state of knowledge for both MMOs, with an emphasis on recent developments and emerging hypotheses. In addition, we discuss obstacles to developing expression systems, which are needed to address outstanding questions and to facilitate future protein engineering efforts. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cell proliferation; Copper; Enzymes; Cytoplasmic enzymes; Expression system; Membrane-bound enzymes; Metabolic pathways; Methane emissions; Methane oxidation; Methanotrophic bacteria; Protein engineering; Methane; bacterial protein; metal; methane; methane monooxygenase; oxygenase; bacterium; chemistry; enzyme active site; genetics; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; protein engineering; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Catalytic Domain; Metals; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygenases; Protein Engineering",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102871866

Emphasis on model output is made for the September–October–November 2017–2019 seasonal period. Part of the Central African region, five sub-regions, was identified. The simulated temperatures are compared to the daily climatology of near-surface temperature of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis fifth-generation and the National Center for Environmental Prediction datasets, while the simulated precipitations are compared to the precipitation of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project and Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations datasets. In most analyses, the Grell scheme with Arakawa–Schubert closure assumption tends to have the best index of agreement but its spatial distribution shows underestimation of rainfall. Generally, the Emanuel convection scheme is more suitable to represent rainfall and temperature over Central Africa. Compared to our previous study (Komkoua Mbienda et al., International Journal of Climatology, 2017, 37, 328–342), the present study shows that we have to pay attention to the choice of convective scheme when using any version of RegCM4 released for climate study over Central Africa. This choice is strictly related to the RegCM version released, the study years and the season. It is important to note, however, that the results presented are a preliminary study of the response to the selected convection schemes. The analysis uses a limited sample of climate model simulation (three model years for each convection scheme). Follow-up work, featuring longer duration climate simulations and a full assessment of statistical significance, is therefore required to confirm the robustness of the analysis presented. © 2021 The Authors.

Dynamic processes of gaseous pollutants propagation in the surface air layer above liquid organic waste accumulators are simulated. The developed model will allow calculating the distribution of pollutants over the storage of liquid organic waste in a given period of time and calculate the concentrations of gaseous pollutants in steady-state and non-stationary modes during reagent treatment. The time of reducing the concentrations of pollutants to the required values is determined based on the results of a computational experiment in the VITECON software package.

A Thomson parabola spectrometer was used to discriminate between different ion species while dispersing the ions according to their kinetic energy. Ion parabolic traces were recorded using an image plate detector overlaid with a slotted CR-39 solid-state detector. The obtained response function for the protons was reasonably extrapolated from previously reported higher-ion-energy response functions. Conversely, the obtained response function for carbon ions was one order of magnitude higher than the value extrapolated from previously reported higher-ion-energy response functions. In a previous study, it was determined that if the stopping range of carbon ions is comparable to or smaller than the grain size of the phosphor, then some ions will provide all their energy to the binder resin rather than the phosphor. As a result, it is believed that the imaging plate response will be reduced. Our results show good agreement with the empirical formula of Lelasseux et al., which does not consider photo-stimulated luminescence (PSL) reduction due to the urethane resin. It was shown that the PSL reduction due to the deactivation of the urethane resin is smaller than that previously predicted. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Carbon; Esters; Extrapolation; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Light emission; Phosphors; Resins; Semiconductor detectors; Absolute response; Empirical formulas; High-intensity laser systems; Image plate detectors; Low-energy protons; Photo stimulated luminescence; Response functions; Solid state detectors; Ions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102519866

Increasing plant diversity increased plant biomass, GPP and Re, but NEE remained unchanged. Removing foliar fungi increased GPP and NEE, with the greatest effects at low plant diversity. After accounting for plant biomass, we found that removing foliar fungi increased mass-specific flux rates in the low-diversity plant communities by altering plant species composition and community-wide foliar nitrogen content. However, this effect disappeared when soil fungi and arthropods were also removed, demonstrating that both plant diversity and interactions among consumer groups determine the ecosystem-scale effects of plant–fungal interactions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","biodiversity loss; biodiversity-ecosystem function; consumer effects; ecosystem CO2 fluxes; plant-herbivore interaction; plant-pathogen interaction","arthropod; biomass; carbon flux; fungus; interspecific interaction; net ecosystem exchange; plant community; prairie; respiration; species diversity; Arthropoda; carbon; animal; biodiversity; biomass; carbon cycle; ecosystem; fungus; grassland; soil; Animals; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Ecosystem; Fungi; Grassland; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097390491

Effects of climate change on rangeland vegetation likely depend on grazing by herbivores but the potential responses of vegetation to such changes in climate and grazing regimes remain unclear. We examined vegetation responses to experimentally simulated climate change (warming, drought and increased rainfall) and grazing (clipping vegetation) between 2015 and 2018 at two mountain rangeland sites: Spiti valley, in the Indian Trans-Himalaya and Tost, in the Gobi-Altai Mountains in Mongolia. Clipping and climate change manipulations interactively reduced vegetation cover and biomass but did not affect species richness. Treatment effects and their interactions varied between sites. In ungrazed plots, vegetation cover and biomass declined sharply in response to warming (18%–35%) and drought (20%–50%) at the two sites, and, surprisingly also declined slightly in response to increased rainfall (20%) at Tost. While the effects of climate treatments were largely similar in the grazed and ungrazed plots in Tost, they were larger in the ungrazed plots in Spiti. The decline in vegetation cover was driven by a decline in the cover of both forbs and grasses. In combination, grazing and warming (Tost) or drought (Spiti) had sub-additive effects, that is, the decrease in vegetation cover in response to grazing and warming/drought was less than the sum of their independent effects but greater than the effect of either manipulation alone. Of the two, warming had a greater effect than drought at the more arid site (Tost), whereas drought had a larger effect at the more mesic site (Spiti). Synthesis and applications. Our findings show that future changes in climate, including just over 1°C of warming, could undermine the sustainability of pastoral economies and the persistence of wildlife across Asian montane rangelands. Furthermore, grazing by herbivores will play an important role in mediating rangeland responses to climate change; thus, pasture management in concert with local pastoralists will be crucial in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change on rangelands, pastoral livelihoods and wildlife populations. © 2020 British Ecological Society","climate change; dry steppe; global warming; Gobi-Altai mountains; montane grassland; pastoral livelihood; rangeland vegetation; trans-Himalayas","biomass; climate change; detection method; drought; grazing; herb; mountain region; rainfall; rangeland; sustainability; vegetation cover; vegetation type; wild population; Altai Mountains; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096646605

The review identifies appropriate forest attributes to quantify the opportunity for recreation, biodiversity promotion and carbon storage, and describes new criteria that future forest inventories may include. As a source of information, we analyse recent papers on forest inventory and ES to show if and how they address these criteria. We further discuss how mapping ES could benefit from such new criteria and conclude with three case studies illustrating the importance of selected criteria delivered by forest inventory. Recent Findings: Recent studies on forest inventory focus mainly on carbon storage and biodiversity promotion, while very few studies address the opportunity of recreation. Field sampling still dominates the data collection, despite the fact that airborne laser scanning (ALS) has much improved the precision of large-scale estimates of the level of forest ES provision. However, recent inventory studies have hardly addressed criteria such as visible distance in stands, presence of open water bodies and soil damages (important for the opportunity of recreation) and naturalness (here understood as the similarity of the forest to its natural state) and habitat trees and natural clearings (important for biodiversity promotion). The problem of quantifying carbon stock changes with appropriate precision has not been addressed. In addition, the reviewed studies have hardly explored the potential of inventory information to support mapping of the demand for ES. Summary: We identify challenges with estimating a number of criteria associated with rare events, relevant for both the opportunity of recreation and biodiversity promotion. These include deadwood, rare species and habitat trees. Such rare events require innovative inventory technology, such as point-transect sampling or ALS. The ALS technology needs relatively open canopies, to achieve reliable estimates for deadwood or understorey vegetation. For the opportunity of recreation, the diversity among forest stands (possibly quantified by geoinformatics) and information on the presence of open water bodies (provided by RADAR, ALS data or use of existing maps) may be important. Naturalness is a crucial criterion for native biodiversity promotion but hard to quantify and assess until now. Tree species identification would be crucial for this criterion, which is still a challenge for remote sensing techniques. Estimating carbon storage may build on biomass estimates from terrestrial samples or on remotely sensed data, but major problems exist with the precision of estimates for carbon stock changes. Recent approaches for mapping the supply side of forest ES are promising, while providing so far uncommon structural information by revised inventory concepts could be helpful also for mapping the demand for ES. We conclude that future studies must find holistic inventory management systems to couple various inventory technologies in support of the integration of non-provisioning ES and biodiversity into forest planning. © 2021, The Author(s).","Biodiversity; Carbon storage; Ecosystem service criteria; Forest’s contributions to societal needs; Inventory techniques; Mapping of ecosystem services; Recreation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101440441

However, heat pumps’ initial costs can be prohibitively high and their lifetime costs are only situationally competitive with incumbent technologies. Here we show that a business model based on heat purchase agreements could lower these barriers to heat pump adoption. In this business model, a user hosts a heat pump owned by an aggregator. The aggregator installs the heat pump at low or no initial cost to the user. The user buys the heat pump's heat or cooling output from the aggregator. The aggregator buys the heat pump's input electricity in the wholesale energy market and sells the flexibility of their aggregate electrical load in ancillary service markets. This paper presents the first economic analysis of heat purchase agreements as a third-party ownership model for electric heat pumps. We derive conditions under which a heat purchase agreement is mutually beneficial to the user and the aggregator. We also provide a method to fairly price heat and cooling. A case study of a typical United States home shows that a heat purchase agreement could more than double the value of a heat pump investment relative to the incumbent business model. The potential impact of this work is to reduce emissions both directly, by accelerating replacement of fossil-fueled or inefficient heating or cooling equipment, and indirectly, by helping power system operators reliably integrate wind and solar generation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aggregation; Ancillary services; Business models; Flexibility; Grid-integration of renewables; Heat pumps","Commerce; Cooling; Economic analysis; Electric heating; Electric loads; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heat pump systems; Investments; Sales; Solar power generation; Ancillary service markets; Business modeling; Cooling equipment; Heating and cooling; Incumbent technology; Power system operators; Purchase agreements; Wholesale energy market; Pumps; building; cooling; detection method; electrical power; electricity generation; energy market; heating; instrumentation; pump; solar power; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100008189

Despite the vehicle market being changing due to several new powertrain configurations options, such as hybrid and electric, internal combustion engines will still play an important role in future global vehicle market, due to its applicability in powertrain systems. Among other engine parameters, the geometric compression ratio has an important impact on the engine thermal efficiency and vehicle performance, however such parameter requires deep investigations in order to avoid operation with pre ignition and combustion knocking events. Vehicle simulation is widely used to select powertrain adequately, with respect to fuel consumption and performance. The present work explores the effects of increasing engine geometric compression ratio from 12.5 to 13.9:1, in a naturally aspirated engine with 1.6 l of displacement fueled with E22 (Gasoline with 22% of Ethanol). The investigation was focused on fuel consumption and vehicle performance. The results in steady state presented a potential of reducing fuel consumption in an average of -2.6% over the representative operation points for FTP-75 emissions cycle using geometric compression ratio of 13.9:1. The engine specific fuel consumption maps for E22 were generated based on steady state measurements on engine test bench, and used as input for vehicle simulation. The vehicle model was built and validated considering FTP-75 and HWFET emissions cycles, and as well performance tests that supported the comparison between the vehicle engine with geometric compression ratio of 12.5 and 13.9:1 on chassis dynamometer. © 2021 SAE International.

The cathode is cycled at 100% depth of discharge (DOD), unlike the currently deployed layered cathode whose DOD is limited to 60-80% to compensate for capacity fading and guarantee the required battery life. Additionally, the capacity and cycling stability of the cathode easily surpass those of the existing state-of-the-art batteries, while achieving the energy density goal of 800 W h kg-1cathode for electric vehicles (EV) with ultra-long cycle life.

F doping induced the formation of a 2ahex × 2ahex × chex superlattice from ordered Li occupation in TM slabs and vice versa, which has been proven to be essential for suppressing microcrack formation in deeply charged states, while maintaining the structural stability of the cathode during extended cycling.

The insulation performance of external walls is being continuously enhanced in the architectural domain. However, Korea’s policy and construction market focuses only on the heat resistance of buildings’ external walls to enhance the insulation performance, leading to an increased thickness of the insulation materials. In this study, the relationship between the surface reflectivity and insulation thickness of external walls was examined to formulate an effective insulation strategy for buildings in Korea. Office buildings of 12 regions in the Korean Peninsula were considered. The dynamic energy simulation program EnergyPlus was used to perform the heating and cooling load analyses. The present worth method was adopted to perform the economic analysis. The analysis of the cooling and heating loads indicated that a change occurred not only in terms of the latitude but also between the Eastern and Western regions. The energy consumption could be reduced by increasing the reflectivity in the Southern region and lowering the reflectivity in the Northern region, based on the total load. In addition, a higher latitude corresponded to a higher energy saving effect owing to the increased insulation thickness. In the case of Jeju Island and Busan, regions with a relatively large cooling load and small heating load, the total load is little affected by insulation thickness at high reflectivity. If the external skin was considered to have the optimal reflectivity, the regions for optimal insulation thickness could be divided into three categories: north, central and south. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we estimated the impact of upwind transboundary and local downwind NH3 emissions on PM2.5 and its inorganic components via photochemical grid model simulations. Nine sensitivity scenarios with ±50% perturbations of upwind (China) and/or downwind (South Korea) NH3 emissions were simulated for the year 2016 over Northeast Asia. The annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in the downwind area were predicted to change from −3.3 (−18%) to 2.4 μg/m3(13%) when the NH3 emissions in the upwind and downwind areas were perturbed by -50% to +50%. The change in PM2.5 concentrations in the downwind area depending on the change in NH3 emissions in the upwind area was the highest in spring, followed by winter. This was mainly attributed to the change in nitrate (NO3-), a secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) that is a predominant constituent of PM2.5. Since NH3 is mainly emitted near the surface and vertical mixing is limited during the night, it was modeled that the aloft nitric acid (HNO3)-to-NO3- conversion in the morning hours was increased when the NH3 accumulated near the surface during nighttime begins to mix up within the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) as it develops after sunrise. This implies that the control of upwind and/or downwind NH3 emissions is effective at reducing PM2.5 concentrations in the downwind area even under NH3 rich conditions in Northeast Asia. © 2021 The Author(s)","Ammonia; Long-range transport; Particulate matter; Sensitivity; Vertical mixing","Boundary layers; Nitric acid; Particles (particulate matter); Ammonia emissions; Fine particulate matter; Inorganic components; Planetary boundary layers; PM2.5 concentration; Rich conditions; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Vertical mixing; Ammonia; ammonia; inorganic compound; nitrate; nitric acid; air quality; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission; inorganic matter; long range transport; particulate matter; vertical mixing; air pollution; air quality; Article; Asia; China; Community Multi scale Air Quality; computer model; computer simulation; concentration (parameter); controlled study; downwind; environmental impact; geographic distribution; night; Northeast Asia; particulate matter 2.5; pollution transport; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; South Korea; spring; upwind; wind; winter; China; Northeast Asia; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099710793

We retrieved the cities and greater cities from the Urban Audit 2018 dataset and did the analysis at a 250 m grid cell level for 2015 data based on the global human settlement layer residential population. We estimated the annual premature mortality burden preventable if the WHO recommended values (ie, 10 μg/m3 for PM2·5 and 40 μg/m3 for NO2) were achieved and if air pollution concentrations were reduced to the lowest values measured in 2015 in European cities (ie, 3·7 μg/m3 for PM2·5 and 3·5 μg/m3 for NO2). We clustered and ranked the cities on the basis of population and age-standardised mortality burden associated with air pollution exposure. In addition, we did several uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our estimates. Findings: Compliance with WHO air pollution guidelines could prevent 51 213 (95% CI 34 036–68 682) deaths per year for PM2·5 exposure and 900 (0–2476) deaths per year for NO2 exposure. The reduction of air pollution to the lowest measured concentrations could prevent 124 729 (83 332–166 535) deaths per year for PM2·5 exposure and 79 435 (0–215 165) deaths per year for NO2 exposure. A great variability in the preventable mortality burden was observed by city, ranging from 0 to 202 deaths per 100 000 population for PM2·5 and from 0 to 73 deaths for NO2 per 100 000 population when the lowest measured concentrations were considered. The highest PM2·5 mortality burden was estimated for cities in the Po Valley (northern Italy), Poland, and Czech Republic. The highest NO2 mortality burden was estimated for large cities and capital cities in western and southern Europe. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were particularly sensitive to the choice of the exposure response function, but less so to the choice of baseline mortality values and exposure assessment method. Interpretation: A considerable proportion of premature deaths in European cities could be avoided annually by lowering air pollution concentrations, particularly below WHO guidelines. The mortality burden varied considerably between European cities, indicating where policy actions are more urgently needed to reduce air pollution and achieve sustainable, liveable, and healthy communities. Current guidelines should be revised and air pollution concentrations should be reduced further to achieve greater protection of health in cities.

A 30-year (1986–2015) numerical integration simulation of climate over NI&WI was conducted using the regional climate model RegCM4.5 nested in one-way ERA-Interim reanalysis data. The Grell, Kuo and MIT-Emanuel cumulus convection with Holtslag and University of Washington (UW) planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes were applied in the running of RegCM4.5 to test their capability in simulating precipitation and temperature in winter-spring (January–April) over NI and WI. The results demonstrated that the RegCM4.5 model has a good potential for simulating the variables and trend of surface temperature over the NI and WI region. Magnitude of the model bias for land surface temperature over different regions of Iran varies by convection parameterization schemes. In most cases, the root mean square error between post-processed simulated seasonal average temperature and observation value was less than 1 °C, but there is a systematic “cold bias”. In general, with respect to land surface temperature simulations, a better performance is obtained when using post-processing model's data with Holtslag PBL-Grell and Holtslag PBL-Kuo configuration schemes, compared to the other simulations, over the NI&WI region. Also, the UW PBL convection schemes show a relatively excellent spatial correlations and normalized standard deviations closer to 1 for thirty-year seasonal land surface temperature anomalies over the entire NI&WI region. However, the simulation accuracy of model for precipitation is not as optimal as for temperature. The dominant feature in model simulations is a dry bias with the largest average value (∼1.04 mm/day) over NI region, while the lowest mean bias precipitation (∼−0.47 mm/day), mainly located in WI region. In the comparison of six configuration convection schemes, the Emanuel scheme has been proven to be the most accurate for simulating winter-spring seasonal mean precipitation over NI&WI region. The accuracy of the scheme also showed great difference in simulated station interpolation of precipitation, which urges the improvement for the simulation capability of spatial distribution of precipitation. In general, for seasonal variation of precipitation, the Emanuel convection with two (Holtslag, UW) PBL configuration schemes outperforms with a good correlation score between 0.7−0.8 and normalized standard deviations closer to 1. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","North and West of Iran; Parameterization schemes; Precipitation; RegCM4.5; Regional climate model; Temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Boundary layers; Data handling; Land surface temperature; Mean square error; Parameterization; Springs (components); Statistics; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Convection parameterization; Normalized standard deviations; Parameterization schemes; Planetary boundary layers; Regional climate modeling; Root mean square errors; Seasonal mean precipitation; University of Washington; Climate models; air temperature; climate modeling; land surface; parameterization; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; sensitivity analysis; surface temperature; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099173684

Economic development can no longer be achieved at the cost of the environment. Sustainable development takes and maintains appropriate environmental standards. This study sketches a thorough analysis of the current situations and likely impacts on the environment from the various infrastructural development projects under the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (hereinafter CPEC). Most of the potential outcomes of this project are already known. However, there is a limited academic discussion available concerning its environmental hazards coupled with the relevant laws and policies. The study adopts qualitative means of research to carefully investigate into the environmental challenges and current practices following by pertinent observations and recommendations to improve, implement and formulate bilateral or multilateral, environmental standards in the region. This study aims to explore why it is inevitable to revise the CPEC-related projects, such as shifting from coal-based energy projects to renewables and building climate-resilient infrastructure in order to avoid various environmental harms. The study concludes by suggesting that along with economic integration, it is also essential to promote legal cooperation between China and Pakistan concerning environmental laws as an integral part of the national geopolitical policies to make CPEC a long-lasting as well as a more safe, secure and sustainable project.

A multi-objective genetic-based evolutionary optimization has been used to estimate the most optimal exergy efficiency status, exergy cost reduction, carbon emission reduction, and NOx emission reduction. For the validation of the data, the simulation results are compared with the plant's data. This study investigates the effect of every decisive parameter on the objective performance parameters of the CCPP. The primary estimated results are the emission rates, efficiencies, and the exergoeconomic cost of the system. At the optimum operational state, the exergy efficiency may increase by 10%, while the total emissions may decrease by 14.6%. The conventional technical measures' effectiveness to improve the combined cycle power plant's energy performance is applied to the simulated case study. Results have shown that the main source of the exergy destruction in this system is the HRSG and the combustion chamber, and also the overall performance of the plant shows great sensitivity to the ambient air temperature. This fact has shown that climate change and global warming are effective in thermal power plants' performance. Therefore, the effect of the climate change on the ambient air temperature impact on the power plant and the 4E performance of the simulated combined cycle power plant is also studied. The results show that, due to the global warming effect, the exergy efficiency of the CCPP unit is decreased by over 0.2% in the last two decades, which can be generalized to all thermal electricity generation units throughout the world based on the mean global temperature rise in the last decades. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","energy analysis; exergoeconomics; exergy analysis; genetic algorithm; P-index analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101731114

For sports organizations, adaptive measures may include designing and constructing new stadiums. In this study, the authors explore climate change as a vehicle for urban transformation, particularly as it relates to the replacement of existing stadiums with new, more sustainable and resilient venues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employed a collective case study approach focusing on three recent cases of stadium replacement: Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas; Oakland Ballpark in Oakland, California; and Marlins Park in Miami, Florida. These cases were selected because an official representative of each team made explicit references to some form of climate adaptation, though each ballpark faces a distinctive climate-related threat. Findings: Each of the cases illustrates the various ways in which climate vulnerability may be deployed by teams and policymakers to replace professional sports stadiums. Although all three examples involved the replacement of an existing ballpark, only in the Texas case was climate adaptation openly cited as the primary reason for stadium replacement. Still, ballpark replacement plans in Oakland and Miami included significant and costly design features to protect the stadiums from extreme weather events. Originality/value: This study applies the concept of climate vulnerability to illustrate a potential strategy to justify stadium replacement. As cities and metropolitan regions continue to grapple with the grand challenge of climate change, the associated vulnerability of large public assembly facilities such as major sports stadiums – particularly those prominently situated in urban centers – can no longer be ignored. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Climate impacts on organizations; Organizational climate capacity; Politics; Public finance; Sport ecology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090064050

Quantifying these changes requires a business-as-usual counterfactual that accounts for the synoptic and seasonal variability of air pollutants. We use a machine learning algorithm driven by information from the NASA GEOS-CF model to assess changes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) at 5756 observation sites in 46 countries from January through June 2020. Reductions in NO2 coincide with the timing and intensity of COVID-19 restrictions, ranging from 60 % in severely affected cities (e.g., Wuhan, Milan) to little change (e.g., Rio de Janeiro, Taipei). On average, NO2 concentrations were 18 (13-23) % lower than business as usual from February 2020 onward. China experienced the earliest and steepest decline, but concentrations since April have mostly recovered and remained within 5 % of the business-as-usual estimate. NO2 reductions in Europe and the US have been more gradual, with a halting recovery starting in late March. We estimate that the global NOx (NO + NO2) emission reduction during the first 6 months of 2020 amounted to 3.1 (2.6-3.6) TgN, equivalent to 5.5 (4.7-6.4) % of the annual anthropogenic total. The response of surface O3 is complicated by competing influences of nonlinear atmospheric chemistry. While surface O3 increased by up to 50 % in some locations, we find the overall net impact on daily average O3 between February-June 2020 to be small. However, our analysis indicates a flattening of the O3 diurnal cycle with an increase in nighttime ozone due to reduced titration and a decrease in daytime ozone, reflecting a reduction in photochemical production. The O3 response is dependent on season, timescale, and environment, with declines in surface O3 forecasted if NOx emission reductions continue. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

It is generally expected to improve vehicle utilization rate, and therefore alleviate traffic congestion and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. A few recent theoretical studies are conducted, mainly focusing on the equilibrium analysis of the ride-sourcing markets with ride-pooling services and the impacts of ride-pooling services on transit ridership and traffic congestion. In these studies, there are three key measures that distinguish ride-pooling service analysis from the non-pooling ride-sourcing market analysis. The first is the proportion of passengers who are pool-matched(referred to as pool-matching probability), the second is passengers’ average detour distance, and the third is average vehicle routing distance to pick up and drop off all passengers with different origins and destinations in one specific ride. These three measures are determined by passenger demand for ride-pooling and matching strategies. However, due to the complex nature of ride-resourcing market, it is difficult to analytically determine the relationships between these measures and passenger demand. To fill this research gap, this paper attempts to empirically ascertain these relationships through extensive experiments based on the actual on-demand mobility data obtained from Chengdu, Haikou, and Manhattan. We are surprised to find that the relationships between the three measures (pool-matching probability, passengers’ average detour distance, average vehicle routing distance) and number of passengers in the matching pool (which reflects passenger demand) can be fitted by some simple curves (with fairly high goodness-of-fit) or there exist elegant empirical laws on these relationships. Our findings are insightful and useful to theoretical modeling and applications in ride-resourcing markets, such as evaluation of the impacts of ride-pooling on transit usage and traffic congestion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Detour distance; Matching probability; Ride-pooling; Ride-sourcing; Routing distance","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Global warming; Lakes; Probability; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Carbon dioxide emissions; Data-driven analysis; Equilibrium analysis; Passenger demands; Theoretical modeling; Theoretical study; Transit riderships; Vehicle utilization; Traffic congestion; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; probability; traffic congestion; Chengdu; China; Haikou; Hainan; Kansas; Manhattan; Sichuan; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098977323

Peat mining adversely affects methanotrophs, but activity and community composition/abundances may recover after restoration. Considering that the methanotrophic activity and growth are significantly stimulated in the presence of other microorganisms, the methane-driven interaction network, which encompasses methanotrophs and nonmethanotrophs (i.e., the methanotrophic interactome), may also be relevant in conferring community resilience. Yet, little is known of the methanotrophic interactome's response to and recovery from disturbances. Here, we determined the recovery of the methanotrophic interactome as inferred by a co-occurrence network analysis comparing pristine and restored peatlands. We coupled a DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) approach using [13C]CH4 to a co-occurrence network analysis derived from the 13C-enriched 16S rRNA gene sequences to relate the response in methanotrophic activity to the structuring of the interaction network. Methanotrophic activity and abundances recovered after peat restoration since 2000. “Methylomonaceae” taxa were the predominantly active methanotrophs in both peatlands, but the peatlands differed in the relative abundances of Methylacidiphilaceae and Methylocystis. However, bacterial community compositions were distinct in both peatlands. Likewise, the methanotrophic interactome was profoundly altered in the restored peatland. Structuring of the interaction network after peat mining resulted in the loss of complexity and modularity, indicating a less connected and efficient network, which may have consequences in the event of recurring/future disturbances. Therefore, determining the response of the methane-driven interaction network, in addition to relating methanotrophic activity to community composition/abundances, provided a more comprehensive understanding of the resilience of the methanotrophs. © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

In marine ecosystems, large bivalves play a critical role in benthic–pelagic coupling including nutrient cycling; however, their influence on the uptake of detrital organic matter by benthic communities is less understood. In a replicated factorial field experiment, we examined how the presence or absence (overharvesting scenario) of a large suspension-feeding clam on an intertidal sandflat and the addition of isotopically enriched macroalgal (Ulva sp.) detritus (eutrophication scenario) influenced infaunal biodiversity, and how changes in trophic interactions influenced key ecosystem functions (nutrient cycling and benthic metabolism and primary production). Both clams and Ulva increased community metabolism, but only clams had an effect on nutrient regeneration. We used the 13C- and 15N-enriched Ulva to quantify the effect of clams on detritus uptake in fauna and recovery in sediment. Due to their large biomass, nitrogen incorporation by clams constituted one-third of the infaunal community uptake after 14 days. Clam uptake likely resulted from ingestion of resuspended microphytobentos which had utilized 15N leaking out from decomposing Ulva. In plots without Ulva addition, the effect of clams on the overall resource utilization by the benthic community using natural abundance isotope niche metrics were tested. In plots without clams, the isotope niche of the community was reduced, and less carbon of pelagic origin was channelled into the infaunal food web. Our results imply that the loss of clams changes trophic pathways and reduces community uptake of macroalgal detritus, potentially exacerbating eutrophication.

Moisture enhancement strategies were varied with respect to dose volume (40, 80, 160, and 320 L/Mg-MSW) and dose frequency (dosing every ½, 1, 2, and 4 weeks). Biodegradation was evaluated based on methane generation to assess (i) the lag-time between the start of liquid dosing and onset of methane generation and (ii) the first-order decay rate for methane generation. In general, the decay rate increased with an increase in dose volume for a given dose frequency. In addition, trends of increasing decay rate and decreasing lag-time were observed for an increase in dose frequency for reactors operated with dose volumes of 40, 80, and 160 L/Mg-MSW. A key conclusion from this study was that reactors with more aggressive moisture enhancement attained more rapid methane generation that initiated at shorter elapsed times following the onset of dosing. An assessment of liquid dosing per month indicated that there were more pronounced impacts of increasing decay rate and decreasing lag-time as moisture enhancement increased from 40 L/Mg-MSW/month to 320 L/Mg-MSW/month as compared to the impact on both variables for an increase in liquid dosing above 320 L/Mg-MSW/month. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biodegradation; Bioreactor; Landfill; Leachate recirculation; Methane","Biodegradation; Decay (organic); Liquid methane; Liquids; Methanation; Methane; Moisture; Decay rate; Dose-volume; First-order decays; Laboratory-scale reactor; Lag-time; Moisture enhancements; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Waste biodegradation; Municipal solid waste; biogas; carbon dioxide; methane; biodegradation; bioreactor; landfill; leachate; methane; moisture content; solid waste; Article; biodegradation; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; electric conductivity; first order decay rate; lag time; leaching; methanogenesis; moisture; moisture enhancement; municipal solid waste; oxidation reduction potential; parameters; pH; reactor design; solid waste management; bioreactor; bioremediation; solid waste; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; Biodegradation, Environmental; Bioreactors; Methane; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100667592

This was done through an econometric analysis of the emissions of municipalities that are members of the Finnish Hinku (Towards Carbon Neutral Municipalities) network, and through comprehensive qualitative interviews conducted in 40 of those municipalities. Our quantitative results show that Hinku network membership has successfully led to the lowering of greenhouse gas emission levels in participating municipalities. The qualitative interviews suggest that this is due to systematic local level climate work, enhanced by network membership. The network functions as an intermediary in two ways: by providing expertise and enabling peer-support. In addition, it has also succeeded in legitimising local level climate action. Ambitious local level climate action can also affect the ambition of national climate policy, which in turn may reflect on the amount resources allocated to local climate action. © 2021 The Authors","Climate; Emissions; Intermediaries; Mitigation; Network","carbon emission; climate change; greenhouse gas; local government; questionnaire survey; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100255249

The empirical results suggest that (i) the EU member states do not converge to a unique steady state level and there are multiple equilibria for both indicators. However, the number of clubs for per capita DMC is greater than per capita MF; (ii) the increase in material use due to the income effect is the largest, followed by the population effect. While the structural effect has an inhibiting effect for both DMC and MF, the material intensity effect differs depending on the indicator used; (iii) the magnitude of effects significantly varies between clubs.

The implementation of the principle of low-carbon development is in line with the gradual transformation of the world energy—the transition from fossil fuels as the main source of primary energy resources to other sources of energy. The relevance of the study is determined by the fact that the most important element of development is the possibility of consumption of energy resources and, accordingly, the possibility of their production in the context of economic changes. The methods of statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, the method of criteria estimates were used in the article.

Such research may generate scientific information that would help reduce population exposure to air pollutants. This paper examines the case study of Accra in Ghana, a city dealing with serious waste management problems. The paper proposes a methodology to estimate the impact of waste management on urban air pollution and health. The analysis is described in the following four steps: (1) collecting data on the waste sector; (2) modeling the emissions arising from waste management; (3) transforming emissions to concentration values and (4) estimating the burdens on health. The assessment has been conducted using the CCAC SWEET tool and WHO AirQ+. The method presented can be used in different locations, depending on data availability, when analyzing the impact of and potential changes to waste sector policies. The results of this health impact assessment indicate that, based on the emissions of PM2.5 from the waste sector in Accra, a change from the business-as-usual to more sustainable options would reduce air pollutants emissions and avert 120 premature deaths in 2030. Levels of air pollution in Accra are significant and interventions to reduce PM2.5 exposure should be promoted. The detailed analysis of the current situation provides suggestions for waste management policies in terms of impacts on health and ideas to reconsider the waste policies in Accra. © 2021","Accra; Air pollution; AirQ+; Health; Landfills; Short-lived climate pollutants; Solid waste management; SWEET tool; Waste burning","Air pollution; Health; Metadata; Municipal solid waste; Concentration values; Data availability; Health impact assessment; Management problems; Population exposure; Scientific information; Urban air pollution; Waste management policy; Waste management; carbon dioxide; atmospheric pollution; health impact; incineration; landfill; modeling; municipal solid waste; pollution effect; pollution exposure; social impact assessment; urban pollution; waste management; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; composting; concentration (parameter); Ghana; health; health impact assessment; landfill; municipal solid waste; particulate matter 2.5; population exposure; priority journal; recycling; solid waste management; urban area; air pollutant; city; solid waste; waste management; Accra; Ghana; Greater Accra; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Ghana; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100597066

Limestone (CaCO3) is a Ca-based sorbent which is injected into circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers, where it combines with SO2 to produce calcium sulfate (CaSO4). As a result, SO2 emissions from a power plant are reduced. In this study, CaCO3 addition was proposed and the desulfurization efficiency improved. The direct desulfurization reaction is dominant in a commercial CFB boiler due to the high CO2 partial pressure, but CaO is formed at a fast reaction rate by calcination in the high temperature or in the low CO2 partial pressure region. When CaO remains in the loop seal, it is exposed to a high CO2 partial pressure condition moving through the recirculation section for an extended period and re-injected into the furnace as recarbonated CaCO3. To analyze the direct desulfurization reaction kinetics, a shrink core model in which the reaction proceeds inside the particle was adopted. Surface observations through FE-SEM of CaSO4 produced by the 180 minute long desulfurization experiment using TGA suggest that the CaSO4 crystal growth rate increased after the pre-treatment (recarbonation) of limestone. Recarbonation lowered the limestone crystallinity, causing a faster reaction. The CaCO3 recarbonation increased the Ca utilization by more than 20% when the direct desulfurization reaction occurred. The TGA experiments show that recarbonation contributes to CaSO4 conversion. Increasing the desulfurization efficiency using recarbonation can reduce the fixed investment and operating costs of oxy-fuel CFB plants because only desulfurization in the furnace is able to meet SO2 emission regulations or lower the flue gas desulfurization (FGD) dependence. Accordingly, the desulfurization conversions of recarbonated CaCO3 and limestone were compared in this study. Morphological changes in the limestone were also evaluated using XRD, FE-SEM, and other analysis methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Desulfurization; Limestone; Oxy-fuel circulating fluidized bed; Recarbonation","Acid rain; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Calcium oxide; Carbon dioxide; Carbonate minerals; Coal fired boilers; Crystallinity; Desulfurization; Efficiency; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Investments; Lime; Limestone; Operating costs; Partial pressure; Pollution; Reaction kinetics; Sulfate minerals; Sulfur dioxide; Circulating fluidized bed; Circulating fluidized bed boiler; Comparative evaluations; Desulfurization efficiency; Direct desulfurizations; Environmental pollutions; Flue gas desulfurization(FGD); Morphological changes; Growth rate; calcium; calcium carbonate; calcium oxide; calcium sulfate; carbon dioxide; limestone; sulfur dioxide; comparative study; high temperature; limestone; partial pressure; reaction kinetics; scanning electron microscopy; sulfur dioxide; X-ray diffraction; analytic method; Article; calcination; carbon dioxide tension; chemical modification; chemical reaction; chemical reaction kinetics; comparative study; cost control; crystal structure; desulfurization; experimental study; furnace; high temperature; morphology; oxy fuel circulating fluidized bed; partial pressure; priority journal; recarbonation; scanning electron microscopy; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097087167

At high excited-state densities and low temperatures, free exciton (FE) emission is so suppressed by exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) that other—normally much weaker—emissions dominate the PL spectrum, such as emission from bound excitons (BEs) or PbI2 inclusions. In the Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite with phenethylammonium (PEA) ligands (PEA2PbI4, PEPI), FE emission dominates at all temperatures at the excited-state densities reached with continuous wave excitation. At higher excited state densities reached with femtosecond pulsed excitation, the PL at temperatures under 100 K is dominated by BE emission redshifted from that of FE by 40.3 meV. Weak emission from PbI2 inclusions 170 meV higher in energy than FE PL is also observable under these conditions. Equilibrium between BE and FE states explains why FE emission first increases with decreasing temperature from 290 until 140 K and then decreases with decreasing temperature as the BEs become stable. A Dion-Jacobson (DJ) material based on 1,4-phenyl-enedimethanammonium (PDMA) supports the reduction of FE emission by EEA at cryogenic temperatures. However, in the PDMA-based DJ material, BE emission is never as pronounced. At low temperatures and high-excited state densities caused by pulsed excitation, a broad emission redshifted by 390 meV from the FE dominates. Based on comparison with temperature-dependent measurements of PbI2 films, this emission is suggested to arise from PbI2 inclusions in the material. Possible avenues for improving PL at room temperature are discussed concerning these findings. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Bound exciton; Cryogenic temperatures; Excited state densities; Exciton-exciton annihilation; Low temperatures; Perovskite films; Photoluminescence spectrum; Pulsed excitation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102979566

In Thailand, the number of cases increased exponentially from the middle of March 2020. In response, Thailand’s government has imposed various pandemic prevention measures, such as a rigorous stay-at-home measure to reduce viral transmission between humans. Many human activities ceased, such as transportation, businesses, and services. This has been associated with reductions in air pollutant emissions. This study thus aimed to measure air quality in metropolitan, industrial, and suburban cities of in Thailand. Data on the hourly concentrations of six criteria pollutants were obtained from Thailand’s Pollution Control Department from five stations during three measurement periods: pre-COVID, early COVID, and working-from-home (WFH) periods. The results indicated that vehicle-emitted pollutants had significantly decreased during WFH periods. Moreover, the air quality of all city types ostensibly improved (50%–70%) because of reduced transportation in Thailand’s central and eastern provinces. However, results for Northern provinces were unclear because PM2.5 concentrations were still high during WFH period due to effects from open burning activity as well as meteorological condition. © The Author(s).","Air quality index; Coronavirus; Criteria pollutants; Potential source contribution function","Pollution control; Air pollutant emission; Coronaviruses; Human activities; Meteorological condition; Open burning; PM2.5 concentration; Prevention measures; TO effect; Air quality; air quality; biomass burning; concentration (composition); COVID-19; disease control; government; human activity; parasite transmission; viral disease; Thailand; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101930311

Methods: The analysis was conducted for a total of 194 people who attempted to quit smoking by applying for a smoking cessation support service at the Regional Tobacco Control Center. The data used in the study were extracted from the Smoking Cessation Service Integrated Information System. Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to identify variables associated with smoking relapse within six months’ time period. Results: Smoking relapse rate within six months was 66.0%, and variables associated with relapse included the cases such as carbon monoxide (CO) at the time of registration (HR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.10~4.22 for CO ≥20 ppm or more vs.CO ＜10 ppm), the average number of cigarettes smoked per day (HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00~1.07), and the number of counseling(HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.54~0.67). Conclusion: Smoking characteristics and counseling showed one of the strongest correlations with relapse within six months. This implies that it is necessary to understand the smoking characteristics and patterns of workers and to provide continuous smoking cessation counseling tailored to individual characteristics for effective smoking relapse prevention. © 2021 Korean Academy of Community Health Nursing","Employees; Recurrence; Smoking; Smoking cessation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104698931

In order to understand the Holocene variations in the OMZ of this region, a sediment core (BP3-GCR3) from a water depth of 500 m was retrieved, which is presently swept by nearly anoxic waters of the core of the OMZ. The sedimentary oxide-bound Mn, a reliable redox proxy, exhibits a gradual decrease from ∼14 ppm during the early-Holocene to ∼8 ppm during the late-Holocene, suggesting a relatively less intense OMZ during the former period. The concentration of a suite of other redox-sensitive elements (Fe, Co and Ce) associated with the dispersed sedimentary oxide particulates also show a gradual and coherent decrease through the Holocene suggesting reduction of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the core of the OMZ towards the modern times. This intensification of OMZ seems to be a result of increased export production coupled with decreasing ventilation of thermocline waters through the Holocene. A one-time positive shift is observed at ∼5.5 ka BP in the organic carbon content (OC) from ∼2 % to ∼10 % in core-top. This shift in OC content is also marked by rapid decrease of CaCO3 by ∼20 %, suggesting enhanced carbonate dissolution due to increased anoxia in the OMZ core caused by increased export production in the late Holocene. © 2021, Geol.

Since 2016 in the power plant area new, more stringent limits for power plant units with a thermal output of more than 300 MW operated with black coal are valid. Usually, in order to reach the new limits e.g., for NOX emissions, downstream reduction processes (Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction, SNCR or Selective Catalytic Reduction) are applied, which use of operating resources (essentially ammonia water) thereby increase. By the means of an experimentally validated process, by which pulverized fuel is 4.0/). fed by oscillation through a swirl burner into a pilot combustion chamber with a thermal output of 2.5 MW, nitrogen oxides can be reduced without further activities, for instance from 450 mg/mN3 in non-oscillation operation mode (0 Hz) to 280 mg/mN3 in oscillation operation mode (3.5 Hz), normalized to an O2-content of 6% each. These findings were patented in EP3084300. Particularly promising are the experiments which utilize oscillation of a large portion of the burn out air instead of the fuel in order to minimize the fatigue of the pulverized fuel oscillator, amongst others. Thereby, the nitrogen conversion rate, which describes the ratio of NOX to fuel nitrogen, including thermal NOX can be reduced from 26% for non-oscillation operation mode down to 16%. The present findings show that fuel oscillation alone is not sufficient to achieve nitrogen oxides concentrations below the legislative values. Therefore, a combination of different primary (and secondary) measures is required. This paper presents the experimental results for oscillating coal-dust firing. Furthermore, an expert model based on a multivariate regression is developed to evaluate the experimental results. © 2021 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Boiler; NOx-reduction; Oscillating combustion; Pulverized fuel",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100698771

Understanding climate risks to freshwater ecosystems requires combining hydrological and ecological knowledge. While there have been significant advances in ecohydrological approaches when applied within the large array of methods available for undertaking impact assessments, the ecological and hydrological elements are often not well-integrated. This results in a mismatch in their ability to accommodate the inherent uncertainty in both impacts and responses. We examine published literature that assesses climate change impacts on freshwater ecosystems using both hydrological and ecological models to better understand method choices. We identify four fundamentally distinct modeling approaches used to assess climate change risk. We discuss which approaches are less useful for predicting ecological impacts under climate change, and highlight approaches of comparable complexity that can maximize the utility of dynamic, process-based modeling while capturing the effects of climate uncertainty and variability. Using an illustrative case study of riparian vegetation health under climate change, we show how the four alternate modeling approaches feature different degrees of information in their outcomes and inferences about future risk. Most current studies that examine climate change risks to freshwater ecosystems use simplified methods or inadequately combine key elements. However, unless the interactions between changing hydrologic variability and ecological responses are explicitly captured in scale-sensitive modeling methods, the risks of climate change to freshwater ecosystems will likely be substantially misrepresented, with negative consequences for effective management responses.

This has important impacts on future water management and energy system planning decisions. In this study, we quantify the physical water use of power production and virtual water transfer via power transmission between Chinese provinces using the information on 5408 electricity-generating units and interprovincial power transmission. We show that China's power production withdrew 62.7 billion m3 of freshwater in 2017, of which 13 billion m3 was consumed (i.e. not returned to the original water basin but lost via evaporation, etc.). A large volume of freshwater was virtually traded through the transmission system. Overall, 6.2 billion m3 of freshwater withdrawal and 2.1 billion m3 of water consumption was traded. Nationally, power transmission reduced freshwater withdrawal but increased consumption in China because, compared to the east, the west generally has a larger water consumption factor but a lower withdrawal factor. Water stress was more equally distributed across provinces through power transmission. We find large seasonal variations in inter-regional virtual water consumption transfer, with an August peak. While the Yangtze River basin and downstream of the Yellow River basin have abundant water relative to other basins, the many power plants located along the two rivers aggravate local water stress. These dynamics will become increasingly important for policymakers and energy planners as China undergoes climatic changes and a rapid energy transition. © 2021 The Authors","Electricity system; Power plants; Power transmission; Virtual water trade; Water stress; Water use","Commerce; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission; Electric utilities; Transmissions; Water management; Water supply; Watersheds; Electric power production; Energy transitions; Power production; Seasonal variation; Transmission systems; Water consumption; Yangtze River basin; Yellow River basin; Rivers; demand-side management; energy planning; energy use; hydroelectric power; hydroelectric power plant; power generation; water management; water use; China; Yangtze Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099685245

It is therefore crucial to explore the factors behind the corporate proactivity of carbon emissions abatement (CPCEA). However, existing research mainly focused on the factors that promote national, provincial, city-level, and industrial carbon emissions reduction, without looking at the micro-company level. In response to the research gap, this study therefore explored the drivers of CPCEA using panel data from 736 listed companies in China. This study used the logit regression to examine the effects of pre-identified factors on the CPCEA. The results indicated that political ties, corporate scale, industry category, and regional disparity have significant impacts on the CPCEA. Contrary to expectations, environmental regulation was not found to affect CPCEA. Based on the findings of this study, five policy implications to improve CPCEA in China were proposed. This paper presented empirical evidence to promote CPCEA. Additionally, the results have important practical implications and priority guide for carbon emissions reduction in China and around the world. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China's listed company; Corporate proactivity of carbon emissions abatement (CPCEA); Driving factors; Logit regression","Emission control; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Industrial research; Logistic regression; Public policy; Carbon emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Driving factors; Panel data; Policy implications; Pro activities; Regional disparities; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098229210

In this study, a facile strategy is developed to obtain Bi catalysts with a hexagonal sheet structure on copper foil via the constant potential electrodeposition method. The electrocatalyst shows high activity for formate production from CO2 reduction, with the formate faradaic efficiency (FE) reaching nearly 100% at an overpotential of 0.65 V; a high production rate of 96.37 μmol· h−1·cm−2 is obtained, and the corresponding power consumption is as low as 3.64 kW·h·kg−1. The excellent catalytic ability is derived from the sharp edges and corner sites of the catalyst, as they provide numerous surface-active sites and increase the electrical conductivity and local electric field intensities of the surface electrode; thus, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and the electron-donating ability of the Bi electrode are enhanced, while the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is significantly inhibited. Moreover, the Bi sheets show excellent stability in 24 h electrolysis, with a formate FE of ≥95.8% in aqueous 0.1 M KHCO3 solution.

However, the scaling slopes of leaf N and P resorption efficiency (NRE-PRE), that regulate ecosystem function and biogeochemical cycles, remains unclear. By synthesizing 513 paired observations of leaf NRE and PRE from plantations among 116 studies, we tested hypotheses that NRE-PRE scaling slopes vary among climate zones, along mean annual precipitation (MAP) gradients and stand ages, and among functional groups. We show that the NRE-PRE scaling slopes decreased from tropical regions to subtropical and temperate regions (decreasing MAP) due to high growth rates (more P demand) at high latitudes. The trees in the 20–40 year age range exhibited higher scaling slopes than those in other age ranges. The scaling slopes of coniferous, evergreen, and non-N2-fixing trees were lower than those of corresponding broadleaved, deciduous, and N2-fixing trees, given that the former plant groups tend to be in harsh environmental conditions (cold or P-limited). For each functional group, the latitudinal and temporal NRE-PRE scaling patterns were consistent with the pooled data set. Structural equation models showed that NRE-PRE scaling slopes decreased with latitude, stand age, and the scaling slope of green leaf N-P contents. Consistent with scaling relationships between green leaf N and P, our results suggest that NRE generally decouple from PRE in plantations worldwide. Our findings help improve predictions of plants’ nutrient balance and environmental adaptation strategies with climate change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Leaf; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Plantation; Resorption; Scaling slope; Stoichiometry","Biogeochemistry; Ecology; Forestry; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Tropics; Allocation strategy; Biogeochemical cycle; Ecosystem functions; Environmental adaptation; Environmental conditions; Mean annual precipitation; Scaling relationships; Structural equation models; Climate change; biogeochemistry; ecosystem function; environmental conditions; nitrogen fixation; nutrient cycling; phosphorus; plantation forestry; resorption; signaling; stoichiometry; Age; Ecology; Fixing; Forestry; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Trees; Tropics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095611431

To explore a detailed and high-resolution emission inventory of the iron and steel industry in the BTH region, a classification technology method with CAMx modelling system was developed and applied for classifying all the iron and steel enterprises in the BTH region. Besides, simulation scenarios were designed particularly for quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of the environmental protection measures. Results show that the pollutant emission of the iron and steel industry significantly contributes to the PM2.5, SO42-, NO3-, and SOA concentrations in the atmospheric environment in sub-areas. Therefore, the enterprises in western and central sub-areas show high classification coefficients. Restricting pollutant emissions using the developed classification technology method is more effective in reducing the PM2.5 concentration of the BTH region compared with the proportional reduction method. Thus, the classification method should be primarily implemented for reducing the air pollutant emissions of the iron and steel industry in the BTH region. © 2021 Technoscience Publications.

The particular research study was undertaken in a frequented junction in the city of Celje, located in the eastern part of Slovenia. The results obtained summarize data on consumed fuel and produced CO2amounts depending on the type of vehicle, traffic flow mixture, traffic light signal plan, and actual vehicle velocity. These values were calculated separately for three different conditions of traffic flow management. Amounts of fuel consumed were experimentally investigated in real traffic situations, whereas CO2production was calculated by applying the actual European standard entitled EN 16258:2012 associated with a guideline for measuring emission values, as well as by examining specific traffic flow parameters. The key objective of the manuscript is to present multiple scenarios towards striving to minimize environmental impacts and improve transport operation's economic consequences when implementing proper traffic flow management. As for crucial findings, we quantified fuel consumption and CO2emissions based on real data on the number and type of vehicles crossing the examined intersection and traffic light switching intervals. The results show that most of the CO2was produced while waiting and in the accelerating phase in front of traffic lights, whereby in the running phase through the intersection, significantly less fuel was used. This study represents a mosaic fragment of research addressing endeavors to reduce CO2production in urban transport. Following the experiments conducted, we can see a notable contribution towards reducing CO2production with known and tested interventions in the existing transport infrastructure. A procedure embracing individual research steps may be deemed as an approach methodology dealing with traffic flow management with an aim to decrease the environmental and economic impacts of traffic and transport operation; this is where the novelty of the research lies. © 2021 MDPI AG.

Measures restricted movements to one outing per day for exercise and shopping, otherwise most people were restricted to their dwelling except for key workers (e.g. medical, supermarkets, and transport). In this study, we quantified changes to air quality across the United Kingdom from 30/03/2020 to 03/05/2020 (weeks 14–18), the period of most stringent travel restrictions. Daily pollutant measurements of NO2, O3 and PM2.5 from the national network of monitoring sites during this period were compared with measurements over the same period during 2017–19. Comparisons were also made with predicted concentrations for the 2020 period from business-as-usual (BAU) modelling, where the contributions of normal anthropogenic activities were estimated under the observed meteorological conditions. During the lockdown study period there was a 69% reduction in traffic overall (74% reduction in light and 35% in heavy vehicles). Measurements from 129 monitoring stations, identified mean reductions in NO2 of 38.3% (−8.8 μg/m3) and PM2.5 of 16.5% (−2.2 μg/m3). Improvements in NO2 and PM2.5 were largest at urban traffic sites and more modest at background locations where a large proportion of the population live. In contrast, O3 concentrations on average increased by 7.6% (+4.8 μg/m3) with the largest increases at roadside sites due to reductions in local emissions of NO. A lack of VOC monitoring limited our capacity to interpret changes in O3 at urban background locations.

To conduct a reasonable operational rating, it is necessary to develop a rational and reliable CO2 emission (CE) benchmark for buildings. The conventional CE benchmarks, however, have limitations accounting for regional differences of multi-family housing complexes (MFHCs). Thus, a separate CE benchmark is required for each region for improving the rationale and reliability of the conventional CE benchmarks. To solve this problem, a data-driven approach for establishing a CE benchmark using data mining techniques was applied in this study. Data on a total of 1,212 MFHCs were established, and a total of 11 CE benchmarks (central region: 7; southern region: 4) for MFHCs were established based on the decision tree. The developed CE benchmarks were then validated using statistical methods (Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test, etc.). Compared to the average operational rating based on conventional CE benchmarks, the average operational rating based on the newly developed CE benchmarks decreased by 1.85% in the central region, and increased by 5.19% in the southern region, respectively. This means that the unreliability and irrationality of the conventional operational rating system (ORS) can be solved by the established ORS. The established ORS, based on the newly developed CE benchmarks, can help policymakers select and manage MFHCs with poor CE performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions benchmark; Data mining techniques; Decision tree; Multi-family housing complex; Operational rating system","Benchmarking; Carbon dioxide; Decision trees; Housing; Trees (mathematics); Building sectors; CO2 emissions; Data-driven approach; Kruskal-Wallis tests; Multi-family housings; Policy makers; Rating system; Regional differences; Data mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094112203

The water-soluble form of MMO (sMMO) has three essential components for the hydroxylation of methane: hydroxylase (MMOH), reductase (MMOR), and a regulatory (MMOB) component. MMOR consists of a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain and a ferredoxin domain containing the [2Fe-2S] cluster for electron transfer from NADH to the di-iron sites in MMOH, which exerts its catalytic activity through O2 activation. Herein, the electronic structures of two cofactors, the FAD radical and [2Fe-2S]+, of reduced MMOR from Methylosinus sporium strain 5 were investigated. The results of multi-frequency and multi-technique electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of chemically reduced MMOR indicated the presence of a neutral flavin radical, and its detailed electronic structure was supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The electronic and oxidation environments of [2Fe-2S]+ were further investigated using advanced EPR spectroscopy. Spectroscopic results confirmed that the oxidized state of FeIII is positioned near Cys50, which consists of a ferredoxin domain with a 2.7 Å distance between iron atoms. Our EPR spectroscopic results may provide a paradigm to elucidate the distribution of electronic densities of multiple cofactors in the enzyme, thus understanding its functional role. © the Partner Organisations.",,"Binding sites; Catalyst activity; Density functional theory; Electron transport properties; Electronic structure; Free radical reactions; Iodine compounds; Iron; Iron compounds; Iron metallography; Methane; Paramagnetic resonance; Sulfur; Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy; Electronic density; Flavin adenine dinucleotide; Global carbon cycle; Iron-sulfur clusters; Methane monooxygenase; Oxidation environment; Water-soluble form; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102427027

This study focusses to explore the livelihood as well as the vulnerability status of the marine fishing spatial units in Sindhudurg Coastal and Marine Ecosystem (SCME) area, west coast of India. The focus was to develop a composite index, namely, Sustainable Fisheries Livelihood Index (SFLI) comprising five capitals, which acts as a tool to evaluate the livelihood status of the fishing communities and also a coastal vulnerability (Cumulative Vulnerability Index-CVI) framework from an earlier assessment was used. The livelihood and vulnerability indices were integrated to arrive at a decision-making matrix to identify and propose suitable interventions for appropriate climate adaptation strategies and achieving sustainable fisheries livelihood. In the present study, SCME was found to have a low SFLI value (0.36). Among the three taluks in SCME, Malvan taluk had comparatively higher SFLI (0.46) than Vengurla (0.34) and Devgad (0.29) taluks. Based on cumulative vulnerability indices, the majority of marine fishing spatial units (i.e. 58.3% after combining high and very high CVI ranges) in SCME were found to face severe vulnerability. These spatial units, plotted using CVI versus SFLI in the four quadrants of decision matrix, were analyzed for management interventions with strategies aimed at reducing the vulnerability and improve the adaptive capacity of fishing communities to achieve sustainable livelihoods. Spatial units in Quadrant IV were preferred to have focused climate change adaptation strategies to minimize vulnerability as well as to improve the fisheries livelihood sustainability by enhancing the access to livelihood capital assets. Spatial units in Quadrant I might serve as model units to demonstrate the vulnerability mitigation interventions to achieve stability and sustainability of livelihoods. Appropriate interventions for climate change adaptation such as diversification of fishing, selection of appropriate fishing gears, regulation of fishing effort, diversification of livelihoods and adoption of ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM) have been discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Livelihood; Sustainability; Vulnerability","adaptive management; assessment method; capital; climate change; climate effect; coastal zone management; fishery management; fishing; fishing community; fishing gear; global warming; index method; integrated approach; livelihood; marine ecosystem; strategic approach; sustainability; vulnerability; India; Maharashtra; Sindhudurg",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085053566

This paper proposes a methodology for collecting data about railway stations, at the maximal extent of the French railway network, a century ago.The expected outcome is a geocoded dataset of French railway stations (gares), which: (a) links gares to each other, (b) links gares with French communes, the basic administrative level for statistical information. Present stations are well documented in public data, but thousands of past stations are sparsely recorded, not geocoded, and often ignored, except in volunteer geographic information (VGI), either collaboratively throughWikipedia or individually. VGI is very valuable in keeping track of that heritage, and remote sensing, including aerial photography is often the last chance to obtain precise locations. The approach is a series of steps: (1) meta-analysis of the public datasets, (2) threesteps fusion: measure-decision-combination, between public datasets, (3) computer-assisted geocoding for ‘gares’ where fusion fails, (4) integration of additional gares gathered from VGI, (5) automated quality control, indicating where quality is questionable. These five families of methods, form a comprehensive computer-assisted reconstruction process (CARP), which constitutes the core of this paper. The outcome is a reliable dataset-in geojson format under open license-encompassing (by January 2021) more than 10,700 items linked to about 7500 of the 35,500 communes of France: that is 60% more than recorded before. This work demonstrates: (a) it is possible to reconstruct transport data from the past, at a national scale; (b) the value of remote sensing and of VGI is considerable in completing public sources from an historical perspective; (c) data quality can be monitored all along the process and (d) the geocoded outcome is ready for a large variety of further studies with statistical data (demography, density, space coverage, CO2 simulation, environmental policies, etc.). © 2021 by the authors.

Previous studies have suggested that fungal spores constitute a substantial portion of the atmospheric bioaerosol budget. However, our understanding of what controls the emission and burden of fungal spores on the global scale is limited. Here, we use a previously unexplored source of fungal spore count data from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI) to gain insight into the drivers of their emissions. First, we derive emissions from observed concentrations at 66 stations by applying the boundary layer equilibrium assumption. We estimate an annual mean emission of 62-31m-2 s-1 across the USA. Based on these pseudo-observed emissions, we derive two models for fungal spore emissions at seasonal scales: a statistical model, which links fungal spore emissions to meteorological variables that show similar seasonal cycles (2m specific humidity, leaf area index and friction velocity), and a population model, which describes the growth of fungi and the emission of their spores as a biological process that is driven by temperature and biomass density. Both models show better skill at reproducing the seasonal cycle in fungal spore emissions at the AAAAI stations than the model previously developed by Heald and Spracklen (2009) (referred to as HS09).We implement all three emissions models in the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem to evaluate global emissions and burden of fungal spore bioaerosol. We estimate annual global emissions of 3.7 and 3.4 Tg yr-1 for the statistical model and the population model, respectively, which is about an order of magnitude lower than the HS09 model. The global burden of the statistical and the population model is similarly an order of magnitude lower than that of the HS09 model. A comparison with independent datasets shows that the new models reproduce the seasonal cycle of fluorescent biological aerosol particle (FBAP) concentrations at two locations in Europe somewhat better than the HS09 model, although a quantitative comparison is hindered by the ambiguity in interpreting measurements of fluorescent particles. Observed vertical profiles of FBAP show that the convective transport of spores over source regions is captured well by GEOS-Chem, irrespective of which emission scheme is used. However, over the North Atlantic, far from significant spore sources, the model does not reproduce the vertical profiles. This points to the need for further exploration of the transport, cloud processing and wet removal of spores. In addition, more long-term observational datasets are needed to assess whether drivers of seasonal fungal spore emissions are similar across continents and biomes. © 2021 EDP Sciences.

Unlike most of the other reported studies on COVID-19 lockdown, this study provides variations over a unique tropical rural environment located at a scientifically strategic location in the Southern Indian peninsula. Striking differences in the time series and diurnal variability have been observed in different phases of the lockdown. The levels of most species that are primarily emitted from anthropogenic activities reduced significantly during the lockdown which also impacted the levels and diurnal variability of secondary species like O3. When compared with the same periods in 2019, short-lived trace gas species such as NO, NO2, SO2 which have direct anthropogenic emission influence have shown the reduction over 50%, whereas species like CO and O3 which have direct as well as indirect impacts of anthropogenic emissions have shown reductions up to 10%. Long-lived species (CO2 and CH4) have shown negligible difference (&lt;1%). BC and AOD have shown reductions over 20%. Particulate Matter (1, 2.5 and 10) reductions have been in the range of 40 to 50% when compared to the pre-lockdown period. The changes in shortwave downward radiation at the surface, diffuse component due to the scattering and diffuse fraction have been +2.2%, −4.1% and −2.4%, respectively, in comparison with 2019.

Considering the fact that heating is mostly based on fossil fuels, it is then evident that its decarbonization is one of the crucial tasks for achieving climate change prevention goals. At the same time, electricity sectors across the globe are undergoing a rapid transformation in order to accommodate the growing capacities of non-dispatchable solar and wind generators. One of the proposed solutions to achieve heating sector decarbonization and non-dispatchable generators power system integration is sector coupling, where heat pumps are perceived as a perfect fit. Air source heat pumps enable a rapid improvement in local air quality by replacing conventional heating sources, but at the same time, they put additional stress on the power system. The emissions associated with heat pump operation are a combination of power system energy mix, weather conditions and heat pump technology. Taking the above into consideration, this paper presents an approach to estimate which of the mentioned factors has the highest impact on heat pump emissions. Due to low air quality during the heating season, undergoing a power system transformation (with a relatively low share of renewables) in a case study located in Poland is considered. The results of the conducted analysis revealed that for a scenario where an air-to-water (A/W) heat pump is supposed to cover space and domestic hot water load, its CO2 emissions are shaped by country-specific energy mix (55.2%), heat pump technology (coefficient of performance) (33.9%) and, to a lesser extent, by changing climate (10.9%). The outcome of this paper can be used by policy makers in designing decarbonization strategies and funding distribution. © 2021 by the authors.

In aquatic environments, species might not be able to redistribute poleward or into deeper water when temperatures rise because of barriers, reduced light availability, altered water chemistry or any combination of these. How species respond to climate change may depend on physiological adaptability, but also on the population dynamics of the species. Density dependence is a ubiquitous force that governs population dynamics and regulates population growth, yet its connections to the impacts of climate change remain little known, especially in marine studies. Reductions in density below an environmental carrying capacity may cause compensatory increases in demographic parameters and population growth rate, hence masking the impacts of climate change on populations. On the other hand, climate-driven deterioration of conditions may reduce environmental carrying capacities, making compensation less likely and populations more susceptible to the effects of stochastic processes. Here we investigate the effects of climate change on Baltic blue mussels using a 17-year dataset on population density. Using a Bayesian modelling framework, we investigate the impacts of climate change, assess the magnitude and effects of density dependence, and project the likelihood of population decline by the year 2030. Our findings show negative impacts of warmer and less saline waters, both outcomes of climate change. We also show that density dependence increases the likelihood of population decline by subjecting the population to the detrimental effects of stochastic processes (i.e. low densities where random bad years can cause local extinction, negating the possibility for random good years to offset bad years). We highlight the importance of understanding, and accounting for both density dependence and climate variation when predicting the impact of climate change on keystone species, such as the Baltic blue mussel. © 2020 British Ecological Society","Bivalvia; climate change; demographic mechanism; density dependence; population projection; salinity; stochastic process; temperature","adaptation; aquatic environment; bivalve; carrying capacity; climate change; demography; density dependence; environmental factor; high temperature; keystone species; local extinction; population decline; population growth; population regulation; stochasticity; water chemistry; Bivalvia; Mytilus edulis; animal; Bayes theorem; climate change; environmental protection; Mytilus edulis; population dynamics; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Mytilus edulis; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096647084

Due to restricted emissions, it was hypothesized that the air quality has been improved during lockdown throughout the country. The study is intended to assess the impact of nationwide lockdown measures on air quality in Bangladesh. We analyzed satellite data for four different air pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, and O3) to assess the changes in the atmospheric concentrations of pollutants in major cities as well as across the country. In this study, the concentrations of NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 from 1 February to 30 May of the year 2019 and 2020 were analyzed. The average SO2 and NO2 concentrations were decreased by 43 and 40%, respectively, while tropospheric O3 were found to be increased with a maximum of &gt; 7%. Among the major cities, Dhaka, Gazipur, Chattogram, and Narayanganj were found to be more influenced by the restricted emissions. In Dhaka, NO2 and SO2 concentrations were decreased approximately by 69 and 67%, respectively. Our analysis reveals that NO2 concentrations are highly correlated with the regional COVID-19 cases (r = 0.74).

Whilst the effect of processing parameters on hydrochar properties is well known, post-treatments to valorize hydrochars are infrequently investigated. Moreover, more severely carbonized hydrochars have a reactive species present on their surface that may limit hydrochars’ use as a solid fuel or soil amendment/environmental adsorbent. To address these potential limitations, a low-temperature (180 °C) thermal treatment and a chemical extraction (1:4 methanol: dichloromethane) were performed on OFMSW hydrochars. The thermal extraction removed up to 12% of this reactive volatile matter, comprised of alkanes, furans, ketones, and fatty acids. Chemical extraction removed up to 61% of the hydrochar, and the extract comprised mostly fatty acids, suggesting a potential pathway for recovery of fatty acids and condensation of fuel molecules in the solid hydrochar. The higher heating values of the extracts were much greater than the non-extractable solid hydrochar. The non-extractable primary char showed similar oxidative and pyrolytic behavior to a standard bituminous coal. The results indicate that HTC could valorize OFMSW by converting this wet waste into a dry solid fuel, soil amendment or environmental adsorbent while simultaneously extracting valuable biodiesel and biofuel precursors. Given increasing legislative pressure to divert OFMSW from landfills, this new pathway offers an alternative to traditional anaerobic digestion management strategies that produce only methane as a green energy product. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuel; Extraction; Hydrothermal carbonization; Municipal solid waste; Pyrolysis","Anaerobic digestion; Biodiesel; Bituminous coal; Carbonization; Dichloromethane; Extraction; Ketones; Soils; Temperature; Thermochemistry; Volatile fatty acids; Environmental burdens; Higher heating value; Hydrothermal carbonization; Legislative pressures; Management strategies; Organic fraction of municipal solid wastes; Processing parameters; Thermo chemical process; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099191454

Methods: The experiment was conducted as a 4 × 3 factorial arrangement following a completely randomised design with two factors. The treatments were according to the proportion of Leucaena and Napier grass (in g/kg DM, Treatment (T)1 = 0: 750 (control), T2 = 250: 500, T3 = 500: 250, T4 = 750: 0). Three levels of CO (in mg rumen fluid, CO1 = 0, CO2 = 10, CO3 = 20 respectively) were added to each of the diet, giving a total 12 dietary treatments. Key results: Replacing Napier grass with Leucaena at 500 g/kg (T3) and 750 g/kg (T4) levels increased the molar volatile fatty acid concentration, microbial protein synthesis (P < 0.001) and ammonia nitrogen concentration (P = 0.003), whereas ruminal protozoa concomitantly decreased (P < 0.05). The addition of CO at 10 mg also reduced the number of ruminal protozoa compared with the control (P < 0.001). A significant Leucaena × CO interaction was observed on the increase of ammonia nitrogen and microbial protein synthesis, and CH4 production was simultaneously suppressed (P < 0.001). There was also a significant Leucaena × CO interaction on increasing concentration of C18:1 cis-9, C18:2 cis-10 cis-12 and α-linolenic acid, which thus contributed to the increase of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids accumulation in the culture (P < 0.001). However, the concentration of C18:0 was not influenced by the treatments (P > 0.05). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the inclusion of Leucaena into a Napier grass-based diet at 500 g/kg and 750 g/kg DM positively affected rumen fermentation, reduced CH4 formation and increased beneficial fatty acids in the rumen. Although CO had similar positive effects on CH4 production and targeted beneficial fatty acids, it reduced the microbial protein synthesis at inclusion of 20 mg/mL DM. Overall, there were synergistic interactions between Leucaena and CO in reducing CH4 production and improving the fatty acid profile in the rumen. Implications: It is possible to improve animal productivity while reducing the environmental impact of livestock production through inclusion of tannin-containing Leucaena and CO in ruminant diets in tropical regions where C4 grasses typically have low nutritive value. © 2021 CSIRO.","biohydrogenation; methanogenesis; ruminant; tanniferous legume","ammonia; fatty acid; fermentation; grass; legume; methane; protein; vegetable oil; Fabaceae; Leucaena; Leucaena leucocephala; Pennisetum purpureum; Poaceae; Protozoa; Ruminantia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096933873

On land, a predictive skill of up to 2 years is primarily maintained in the tropics and extra-tropics enabled by the initialization of the physical climate. We further show that anomalies of atmospheric CO2 growth rate inferred from natural variations of the land and ocean carbon sinks are predictable at lead time of 2 years and the skill is limited by the land carbon sink predictability horizon. © 2020.

For the fluorescence in solution and solid states, contrasting results between the two series were demonstrated. For Be series a net aggregation induced emission effect was observed with high fluorescence quantum yield for the solid state. A [2+2] cycloaddition under irradiation at 350 nm was also revealed for one derivative of Be series. In contrast, for Fu series the fluorescence in solution is higher than in the solid state. The X-ray crystallography studies for the compounds reveal the formation of strong π-π stacking for the derivatives without emissive property in the solid state and the presence of essentially lateral contacts for emissive compounds.

Multistage statistical sampling was implemented in the surveys for Hanoi Metropolitan Region (HMR) and deep rural area of Ninh Binh province (Con Thoi, Ninh Binh (CTNB)). Emission factors were scrutinized to select relevant ranges and central values for typical cookstoves in RRD. Large differences in the activity data (cooking activities, fuel-stove types, and fuel consumption) were found between three HMR strata (urban, suburban, and rural populations) and CTNB, respectively, which resulted in distinctly different annual emissions per capita. Annual 2010 emissions from residential combustion in RRD were estimated for toxic pollutants, in Gg/year, of 217 for CO, 1.5 NOx, 7.4 SO2, 33 NMVOC, 3.7 NH3, 16.9 PM2.5, 1.4 BC, and 7.1 OC, along with 171 t/year of total PAHs with 0.7 t/year of BaP, and greenhouse gases of 5395 CO2, 17.2 CH4, and 0.7 N2O Gg/year. Emissions increased by 1.5–7.8%, varying with species, over the 6-year period. Prevalent use of crop residue in CTNB induced its dominant shares in the residential combustion emissions not only in this deep rural area but also in the entire RRD domain. Spatial emission distribution exhibited high intensities over districts having high rural population density. Global warming potential results indicated the dominant role of black carbon, especially over the 20-year horizon.

Although there are no internationally recognised fuel efficiency tests for HD diesel engines, there have been some regional and OEM developments pushing in the direction of improved fuel efficiency. In Japan the relatively new JASO DH-2F standard adds a fuel efficiency requirement, measuring fuel efficiency using the Hino N04C engine which is also used within the standard for other performance testing. In North America API have introduced the FA-4 performance standard to allow users to specify an xW-30 oil of lower HTHS150 to help achieve fuel efficiency, but with no accompanying test to quantify. In Europe ACEA are planning a HD fuel economy ""F""classification which may be something like API FA-4. Volvo and Daimler have developed their own fired engine tests to determine the fuel efficiency effect of the oil. Against this background, we selected the Daimler OM501 fuel economy test as a relevant and important option and used it for the work reported here. A range of multigrade engine oils were formulated for evaluation in the OM501 fuel economy test. In addition to targeting the usual HTHS150°C value of ≥3.5 mPas. normally associated with xW-40 oils used in HD diesel engines, HTHS150°C of ≥2.9 mPas. as mentioned for xW-30 in API FA-4, and also lighter oils of HTHS150°C ≥2.6 mPas were included. In addition, we used a range of different VII (Viscosity Index Improver) types to get a variation in lower temperature viscosity values even when the HTHS150°C values were set as mentioned above. We used group III type base-oil and a suitable DI package throughout and the VIIs used included those recommended for such oils, plus fuel efficient PAMA comb type VIIs. Results broadly show a strong dependence of fuel economy to viscosity in this test. This also applies to the lighter HTHS150°C ≥2.6 mPas. oils which also looked to be providing predominantly hydrodynamic lubrication and so were not improved in fuel economy by the application of organic friction modifier. Furthermore, the viscosity when measured by HTHS80°C and HTHS100°C provided an excellent correlation to fuel economy (R2 ~ 0.98) when viewed as a simple linear plot. All other viscosity values such as HTHS150°C (R2 ~ 0.68) and KV100C (R2 ~ 0.72) did not correlate as well. VI has no correlation to fuel economy. It was demonstrated that oils with the same viscosity protection in terms of HTHS150°C could have a significantly different fuel economy performance due to the differences in HTHS80°C and HTHS100°C brought about by the use of different VII types or different formulation strategies. Clearly, reducing the HTHS80°C and HTHS100°C gives an improvement in fuel economy for this engine. The relationships established in this paper will be of use within the industry in predicting the likely OM501 fuel economy performance in advance of, or instead of actual OM501 testing. The HTHS80°C or HTHS100°C value of the formulation can instead be used to predict the likely OM501 fuel economy result. ails. ©",,"Diesel engines; Efficiency; Fuels; Lubricating oils; Testing; Viscosity index; European Commission; Fuel efficiency test; Heavy duty vehicles; Heavy-duty diesel engine; Hydrodynamic lubrication; Performance standards; Performance testing; Viscosity index improvers; Fuel economy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103445329

Adopting a Poulantzian view of the state as a social relation, this paper explores the degree to which such a community exists in opposition to aggressive climate policy in the Canadian context. This research focuses on the extent to which fossil and financial capitalists form a cohesive network, capable of sharing perspectives and preferences on climate change and the future of oil and gas extraction, and mobilizing collectively to pursue them. The paper draws on a network analysis of connections (shared ownership, lending, and director interlocks) between and within major fossil-fuel based corporations and major financial corporations in Canada, in order to see whether or not relational ties across the sectors are sparse or dense, and whether they are broadly diffused across companies or concentrated among a few key players. The resulting analysis shows that fossil capital is structurally tied to finance, and the sectors are joined through lending, holdings and directorships, with some financial institutions playing more important structural positions within the network than others. As activists are already targeting financial institutions as part of their ongoing resistance efforts against fossil extraction and financial corporations, the findings from this study suggest continued social movement pressure and we provide some finer grained suggestions for which actors to target. The current conjuncture indicates that policy pathways to zero emissions will in part depend on breaking the load bearing joints in the fossil-finance capital network. © 2020","Canada; Energy; Finance; Fossil fuels; Social networks; States",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098079000

A near-infrared (NIR) nanophosphor embedded with mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN), ZnGa2O4:Cr3+,Sn4+ (ZGOCS), was developed and its optical properties were harnessed to enhance the photosynthetic ability of Brassica rapa spp. chinensis. The broad excitation of ZGOCS from the ultraviolet to the visible region allowed the conversion of extra light into near-infrared light (650–800 nm) and thus promoted the dual photosystem via the Emerson effect. ZGOCS@MSN was spherical with a size of 65±10 nm and good dispersion. A light conversion ability of up to 75 % under different wavelengths was achieved. Moreover, the electron transfer rate of photosynthesis increased by 100 % with a suitable ZGOCS@MSN concentration. Plant and animal models were used to explore the effects of the nanophosphor.

To address these problems, two 9-year experiments involving typical maize production systems in Northcentral China (summer maize) and Northeast China (spring maize) were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of Nutrient Expert (NE) management, a Nutrient Decision Support System which combines 4 R nutrient management with improved varieties and optimized plant density, on reducing carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) footprints. The mean grain yields under NE were 7.4 and 11.5 tons ha−1, which were 3.9% and 6.9% higher than those of local farmers’ practices (FP) in the summer and spring maize systems, respectively; the N-derived (affected by N fertilization) yield accounted for 21.7% and 73.5% of the total yield under NE, respectively. Compared with FP, NE achieved 21.8% and 16.0% lower reactive nitrogen (Nr) losses, 18.4% and 20.9% lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 24.8% and 21.4% smaller N footprints (9.1 and 2.3 kg N ton−1 grain), and 21.5% and 26.0% smaller C footprints (436 and 206 kg CO2 eq ton−1 grain) in summer and spring maize, respectively. NE reduced the N-derived N and C footprints by 30.3% and 27.2% in summer maize and 22.9% and 28.0% in spring maize, respectively, as a result of greater yields and optimal N management. Moreover, compared with summer maize, spring maize showed significantly smaller N-derived N (12.6-fold) and C (7.2-fold) footprints. The results demonstrated the ability of long-term NE management to sustain maize yields, reduce Nr losses and GHG emissions, and cut C and N footprints, indicating its potential suitability as an alternative management for sustainable agriculture. Moreover, the summer maize system still had considerable potential for environmental footprints reduction even when current NE management practices were adopted. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental footprints; Greenhouse gas emissions; Maize; Nutrient expert; Reactive nitrogen loss","carbon; nitrogen; fertilizer; nitrogen; agricultural management; agricultural practice; alternative agriculture; crop yield; cutting (process); fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; maize; management practice; agricultural worker; air temperature; Article; carbon footprint; China; climate change; comparative study; controlled study; cropping system; decision support system; environmental impact; fertilization; fertilizer application; grain filling; grain yield; greenhouse gas; harvest; maize; monoculture; monsoon climate; nonhuman; nutrient management; plant density; soil property; spring; summer; sustainable agriculture; sustainable development; varietas; volatilization; winter wheat; agriculture; soil; China; Agriculture; China; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Soil; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099182889

Multilayer material stacks are needed to pattern complex high-resolution structures. For carbon films, one key point is the tradeoff between planarization and high-temperature stability requirements used in patterning and post-patterning process integration. On one side, the need for thermally stable carbon materials is steadily increasing, for better pattern transfer fidelity (less line wiggling), chemical vapor deposition (CVD) compatibility where a plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) inorganic hardmask is deposited on top, and for the use as mandrels for pattern multiplication. On the other hand, due to the increased complexity of chip designs, gap filling and planarization of the underlying topography is also strongly desired. In addition, wet chemical resistance and the capability to be polished by chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) processes are often necessary. Design of a spin-on carbon (SOC) film to meet all the desired, but sometimes conflicting, properties using organic polymers with good solubility in fab-approved solvent systems requires innovative chemical design and rigorous experiment and tuning processes. Brewer Science's advanced material development is bringing forth low-shrinkage, high-temperature-stable SOCs with spin-bowl/drain compatibility for advanced node manufacturing and integration. The materials presented in this paper are stable up to 500-550°C with no weight loss, soluble in solvents commonly used in semiconductor industry, can fill <10 nm narrow gaps, and have excellent planarization properties over a long distance. The coated film has very low thickness shrinkage during the bake conditions on the track and is stable through the subsequent high temperature PECVD process. The resulting dense carbon film provides extremely good planarization both locally and globally across the wafer. It demonstrated great chemical resistance to SC 1 conditions and can be CMP polished using commercially available slurries, if needed. During etch transfer, it showed very little after-develop inspection (ADI) and after-etch inspection (AEI) bias and maintained excellent line-width resolution through various critical dimensions. Moreover, this material's good solubility allows it to be formulated with high solid content for >2 μm thickness, which has showed early promising results in filling some very-high-aspect-ratio gaps in certain memory applications. © 2021 IEEE.","CMP; CVD; EUV; gap fill; high temperature; Planarize; SC1; SOC; spin on carbon material","Aspect ratio; Carbon films; Chemical reactions; Chemical resistance; Integrated circuit design; Organic polymers; Plasma CVD; Programmable logic controllers; Semiconductor device manufacture; Shrinkage; Solubility; Spin fluctuations; System-on-chip; Thermodynamic stability; Topography; After develop inspections; After-etch inspections; Chemical vapor depositions (CVD); Chemical-mechanical planarization process; High temperature process; High temperature stability; High-resolution structures; Plasmaenhanced CVD (PECVD); Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113600921

However, stationary LCZ maps are insufficient for forecasts in the rapidly urbanizing regions, where there are frequent transitions among multiple urban lands and thus changing surface properties. To facilitate climate forecasts with these changing properties, we propose a new methodological framework to predict future LCZ maps using the Cellular Automata (CA) land-cover/land-use change (LCLUC) model. Different from most existing LCLUC studies that treat the urban area as homogeneous, our work is the first attempt to simulate the complex conversions among low-, mid- and high-rise urban lands defined in LCZ. To validate our method, we apply it in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) metropolitan area, China, a rapidly urbanizing region with more than 50 million residents. First, we use the World Urban Database and Portal Tool (WUDAPT) method to generate LCZ maps of the PRD region in 2009 and 2014, with satellite images. Then, we apply the CA model on the 2009 LCZ map to forecast 2014 one based on the LCLUC rules discovered by the data mining technique. The comparison between the forecasted and observed 2014 LCZ maps yields a kappa coefficient of 0.77 and an overall accuracy of 82%. Our method achieves satisfactory accuracies on the high- (84%) and low-rise (82%) urban lands while performing relatively poorly on the mid-rise (40%) lands. Our results demonstrate that the combination of the LCZ scheme and LCLUC modeling has the potential of capturing the structural changes within cities and providing the necessary input datasets for urban climate forecasts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Land-cover/land-use change; Local climate zone",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101781973

This study explores an ideal setting, the low-carbon city pilot program conducted by the Chinese government as a quasi-natural experiment to address this question. We conduct a difference-in-differences approach to analyze the impact of environment regulation on R&D investment. We find that the program's adoption has led to an increase in R&D investment of 0.145% as a percentage of total assets and 0.273% as a percentage of sales, indicating a positive effect of environmental regulation on R&D expenditures. The increase in R&D expenditures is greater for firms experiencing a larger increase in government subsidies, a greater decline in corporate tax or a greater improvement in financial condition following the low-carbon pilot program. A series of robustness tests support a causal interpretation of our findings and indicate that the observed effect of the low-carbon pilot program on corporate R&D investment is unlikely driven by chance.

Nevertheless, the relative importance of different environmental factors in driving plant distributions across spatial scales and among plant groups is not clear. This study aims to disentangle how plant–environment relationships vary with latitude and among plant taxa. Location: Global. Time period: Present day. Main taxa: Plant taxa including angiosperms, gymnosperms, pteridophytes and bryophytes. Methods: We obtained global distribution occurrence data of mass plant groups (625 families, 6,221 genera, and 54,101 species) from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database. We used random forest method to quantify the relative effects of 15 environmental factors (including climate, soil and topography) on plant distributions at global and regional scales (divided into different latitude zones). We also used phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) models to investigate the relationships between environmental variables and geographical range size, latitudinal range and limits of plants at the global scale. Results: Our analyses revealed the primacy of the effects of climatic variability (temperature seasonality and isothermality) on plant distribution at the global scale. The relative contributions of temperature seasonality and isothermality peaked in tropical areas, whereas solar radiation and annual mean temperature had stronger influence in high-latitude areas. Wide-range plant groups tended to occur in areas with higher temperature variability (isothermality and temperature seasonality) and flatter terrain (low slope). Both climate variability and extreme influenced geographical range size, latitudinal range and limits of plants. Main conclusions: Our study highlights the significance of climate variability for global plant distributions. Environmental effects upon plant distributions vary across latitudes. The findings imply that environmental factors affecting plant distributions change with geographical scales, suggesting that different geographical and ecological processes should be integrated to explain multi-scale distribution patterns. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Climate extremes; climate variability; environmental drivers; geographical range size; global scales; latitudinal limits; latitudinal ranges; plant distributions; regional scales","angiosperm; bryophyte; climate change; climate effect; geographical distribution; gymnosperm; high temperature; phylogenetics; pteridophyte; taxonomy; terrain; bryophytes; Gymnospermae; Magnoliophyta; Pteridophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099367544

The results reveal that for China VI standard GDI vehicle, compared with CLTC, which is the newest test cycle according to realistic road conditions in China, the aforesaid evaluation indexes of FTP-75 and WLTC are basically higher due to their higher acceleration and deceleration ratio. Compared with hot start, a cold start followed by warming-up process has a significant impact on PN emissions over all test cycles and different test cycles show diverse sensitivity to the change of start-up conditions. The particles with a diameter of 5.6–23 nm (sub-23 nm) account for 43.1–57.7% of the total PN emission quantity for China V standard GDI vehicle, which is about 5–15% higher than that of theoretical assumptions. Different piecewise speed segments exhibited different impacts on PN characteristics when acceleration and deceleration reveal greater influence. Gasoline particulate filter (GPF) could effectively capture full-size particulates including fine particles as sub-23 nm particles, which is verified over FTP-75 and CLTC, while sub-23 nm PN emission is still at a high level over WLTC for its ultrahigh speed segment. There could have been an underestimation of the real particle number emitted from GDI vehicle while the emission of solid sub-23 nm particles was excluded under current emission regulations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Gasoline direct injection vehicles; Particle number; Particle size distribution; Particulate matter; Test cycles","Direct injection; Gasoline; Light weight vehicles; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Size distribution; Acceleration and deceleration; Federal test procedures; Gasoline direct injection; Light duty vehicles; New european driving cycles; Particulate filters; Particulate Matter; Start-up conditions; Automobile testing; gasoline; particle size; particulate matter; size distribution; traffic emission; acceleration; Article; China; comparative study; controlled study; deceleration; emission test cycle; Europe; exhaust gas; gasoline direct injection vehicle; mass; measurement; motor vehicle; particle mass; particle number; particle size; particle size distribution; particulate matter; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; United States; velocity; warming; China; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094812236

To understand the role of the electrolyte components, four salts (LiBF4, LiBOB, LiPF6 and LiTFSI) and three solvents (ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate) were investigated. Various types of in situ cells were assembled and X-ray diffraction patterns were collected in operando upon cycling. Co-intercalated phase formation was found to be triggered by the presence of propylene carbonate and to be electrochemically driven. This co-intercalated phase is formed in the early stages of reduction, with cell parameters a = 3.514 Å, c = 17.931 Å, corresponding approximately to a tripling of the pristine TiS2 cell along the c-axis. This phase does not seem to evolve upon further oxidation and hence induces an overall loss of capacity. Whereas the nature of the anion does not appear to influence the co-intercalated phase formation, the content of propylene carbonate in the electrolyte is clearly correlated to both its amount and the extent of capacity loss. © 2021 The Author(s).

In this study, we conducted a pot experiment in which Glycine max L. (soybean) was cultivated in two cadmium (Cd)-contaminated soils (low, 3.14 mg kg−1; high, 10.80 mg kg−1) to investigate the effects of biochar on the bioremediation of Cd, N2O emissions and the rhizosphere microbial community structure. The bioaccumulation of Cd in the plant shoots and roots increased with all biochar addition rates (0%, 1%, 5% and 10%); unexpectedly, the translocation capacity of Cd to the edible parts of the plant significantly decreased to 0.58 mg kg−1, which was close to the edible threshold (0.4 mg kg−1). The abundance and activities of functional marker genes of microbial nitrification (amoA) and denitrification (nirK, nirS and nosZ) were quantified with quantitative PCR, and we found that biochar addition reduced the precursor production of rhizoshpere N2O by inhibiting the transcription of the nirK gene.

In order to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of this critical metal there is considerable interest in Europe in understanding the availability of cobalt from indigenous resources. This study reviews information on cobalt resources in Europe and evaluates the potential for additional discoveries. Based on published information and a survey of national mineral resource agencies, 509 cobalt-bearing deposits and occurrences have been identified in 25 countries in Europe. Harmonised cobalt resources, classified using the United Nations Framework Classification (UNFC), have been estimated for 151 deposits in 12 countries where data are available. The calculated total resource comprises 1 342 649 tonnes of contained cobalt metal. This includes: 114 638 tonnes in commercial projects with current cobalt extraction; 370 409 tonnes in potentially commercial projects; 111 107 tonnes in historic estimates compliant with modern reporting; and 746 495 tonnes in non-compliant historic estimates. Analysis of these data reveals that cobalt resources are widely distributed across Europe in deposits of several different types. Global mine production of cobalt is dominated by stratiform sediment-hosted copper deposits, magmatic nickel-copper deposits and nickel laterite deposits, but other deposit types may also be significantly enriched in cobalt. In Europe, current cobalt production is derived from three mines in Finland: the magmatic sulfide deposit at Kevitsa; the Kylylahti deposit of volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) affinity; and the black shale-hosted deposit at Sotkamo (Talvivaara). This study has identified 104 deposits in Europe that are currently being explored for cobalt, of which 79 are located in Finland, Norway and Sweden. The Fennoscandian Shield and the Caledonian Belt in these countries are high priority exploration terrains for a variety of cobalt-bearing deposits, notably magmatic Ni-Cu-Co deposits. The Svecofennian, Sveconorwegian and the Caledonian orogenies in Fennoscandia also resulted in the formation of several other cobalt-enriched deposit types. These include chiefly metasediment- and metavolcanic-hosted Co-Cu-Au, VMS, skarn and polymetallic vein deposits. The Kupferschiefer deposits in Poland and Germany are stratiform sediment-hosted Cu deposits with some similarities to the Central African Copperbelt, which is the predominant global producer. However, the cobalt grade in the Kupferschiefer deposits is relatively low (0.005–0.008% Co) and not currently economic to exploit without significant improvement in extraction technology. In the Balkans and Turkey cobalt grades and tonnages are known in 27 nickel laterite deposits, with several containing more than 10 000 tonnes of cobalt metal. Only nickel is currently recovered from these deposits, but new processing technologies such as high-pressure acid leaching could enable cobalt recovery in the future. Small polymetallic cobalt-bearing vein deposits in several European countries have been historic producers of cobalt. Today most are uneconomic, but new technologies and the drive towards locally-sourced raw materials could make them viable future sources of cobalt. Our analysis suggests that geological availability in Europe is not a problem. However, many economic, technological, environmental and social challenges will have to be overcome for exploration projects to become commercial. © 2020 British Geological Survey (C) UKRI 2020.

The CBBD measure can combine the passengers of both systems on the same route, which helps increase passenger demand for the BRT, and reduce fuel consumption and emissions from utilizing the exclusive lanes for the combined route. However, the CBBD could affect some bus and BRT passengers in terms of either losing or gaining travel time-saving benefits depending on their travel pattern. This research proposed a methodology to determine the travel distance initiating disadvantage for BRT passengers (DDB) to justify the potential success of the CBBD operations. The number of passengers gaining a benefit from the CBBD was sensitive to the distance between the CBBD stops and the operational period of the CBBD. The CBBD reform would be beneficial to transit agencies to improve the travel time of passengers and be able to promote environmental sustainability for the public transportation system in urban cities. © 2021 by the authors.

In an effort to integrate the reductive glycine pathway (rGP) as a highly promising pathway for the assimilation of CO2 and formate, genes coding for glycine synthase system from Gottschalkia acidurici were successfully introduced into Clostridium pasteurianum, a non-model host microorganism with industrial interests. The mutant harboring glycine synthase exhibited assimilation of exogenous formate and reduced CO2 formation. Further metabolic data clearly showed large impacts of expression of glycine synthase on the product metabolism of C. pasteurianum. In particular, 2-oxobutyrate (2-OB) was observed for the first time as a metabolic intermediate of C. pasteurianum and its secretion was solely triggered by the expression of glycine synthase. The perturbation of C1 metabolism is discussed regarding its interactions with pathways of the central metabolism, acidogenesis, solventogenesis, and amino acid metabolism. The secretion of 2-OB is considered as a consequence of metabolic and redox instabilities due to the activity of glycine synthase and may represent a common metabolic response of Clostridia in enhanced use of C1 compounds. © 2020 The Authors.

It is very important to promote the process of urban sustainable development. On the basis of literature review, the government and energy saving enterprises are identified as the symbiotic subjects of urban energy saving innovation ecosystem. Based on logistic equation, this paper constructs a dual agent symbiosis model of urban energy saving innovation ecosystem. The simulation results show that the positive and negative of the symbiosis coefficient is an important parameter affecting the results of symbiosis equilibrium on urban energy saving innovation ecosystem. When the symbiosis coefficient is negative, the coordination and promotion between symbiotic subjects is greater than competition and competition, which makes the existing resources meet the needs of more symbiotic subjects to participate in urban energy saving. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ecosystems; Environmental technology; Planning; Pollution control; Sustainable development; Human settlements; Literature reviews; Logistic equations; Urban energy; Urban sustainable development; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102727211

To reduce computational cost, an approach for dynamical downscaling of climate projections was developed that uses atmospheric climatologies with augmented winds to simulate historical (1986–2005) and future (2046–2065) periods separately. The two simulations differ in initial and lateral open boundary conditions. For each simulation, the daily climatology of surface winds in the driving model was augmented with high-frequency variability from an atmospheric reanalysis product. The “time-slice” approach was able to reproduce the observed climate state for the historical period. Sensitivity tests confirmed that the high frequency wind variability plays an essential role in freshwater distribution in this region. Projections suggest that sea surface temperature will increase by 1.8–2.4°C and surface salinity will decrease between −0.08 and −0.23 depending on whether a moderate or high emissions scenario is used. Stratification increases throughout the region and there is some evidence of nutrient limitation near the surface. Primary production and phytoplankton productivity (chlorophyll) also increase. Density surfaces are relocated deeper in the water column and this change is mainly driven by surface heating and freshening. Changes in saturation state are mainly due to anthropogenic CO2 with minor contributions from solubility, remineralization and advection. There is little difference between RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 with regard to projections of deoxygenation and acidification. The depths of the aragonite saturation state and the oxygen minimum zone are projected to become shallower by ≃ 100 and ≃ 75 m respectively. Extreme states of temperature, oxygen and acidification are projected to become more frequent and more extreme, with the frequency of occurrence of (Formula presented.) expected to approximately double under either scenario. © Copyright © 2021 Holdsworth, Zhai, Lu and Christian.","acidification; biogeochemistry; climate-change; deoxygenation; modeling; Pacific ocean; projection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103413999

In this study, the tropical epiphyte Phalaenopsis cv. “Sacramento” was subjected to different lighting regimes. Photosynthesis and biochemical measuring techniques were used to address four specific questions: (1) the response of malate decarboxylation to light intensity, (2) the malate carboxylation pathway in phase IV, (3) the response of diel carbon gain to the light integral and (4) the response of diel carbon gain to CO2. The four CAM-phases were clearly discernable. The length of phase III and the malate decarboxylation rate responded directly to light intensity. In phase IV, CO2 was initially mainly carboxylated via Rubisco. However, at daylength of 16 h, specifically beyond ±12 h, it was mainly phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEP-C) carboxylating CO2. Diel carbon gain appeared to be controlled by the light integral during phase III rather than the total daily light integral. Elevated CO2 further enhanced carbon gain both in phase IV and phase I. This establishes that neither malate storage capacity, nor availability of PEP as substrate for nocturnal CO2 carboxylation were limiting factors for carbon gain enhancement. These results advance our understanding of CAM-plants and are also of practical importance for growers. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","citrate; crassulacean acid metabolism; malate; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC); Rubisco","C3 plant; carbon; crassulacean acid metabolism; epiphyte; light intensity; photosynthesis; physiological response; California; Sacramento; United States; Orchidaceae; Phalaenopsis; carbon; carbon dioxide; citric acid; malic acid; malic acid derivative; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; light; metabolism; Orchidaceae; photosynthesis; physiology; radiation response; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Citric Acid; Crassulacean Acid Metabolism; Light; Malates; Orchidaceae; Photosynthesis; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097594059

This paper explores how natural processes could give rise to this puzzling combination of characteristics. Our model is based on available data regarding the emergence of historic influenzas, early COVID-19 cases and spreading, the microbiome of permafrost, long-distance airborne transport of viruses reaching stratospheric levels, ultraviolet immunosuppression, sunlight variations, weather patterns, Arctic thawing, and global warming. Atmospheric conveyance is supported by hemispheric distribution disparities, ties of COVID-19 cases to air pollution particulate concentrations, and contemporaneous animal infections. The following sequence is proposed: (1) virus emergence after hot Arctic summers, predominantly near solar irradiance maxima or involving wildfires, indicates release of large amounts of ancient viruses during extensive permafrost melting, which are then incorporated in autumn polar air circulation, where cold storage and little sunlight permit survival. (2) Pandemics onset in winter to spring at rather few locations: from climate data on Wuhan, emergence occurs where the North Polar Jet stream hovers while intersecting warmer, moist air, producing rain which deposits particulates with the viral harvest on a vulnerable human population. (3) Spring and summer increases in COVID-19 cases link to high solar irradiance, implicating ultraviolet immune suppression as one means of amplification. (4) Viruses multiplied by infected humans at close range being incorporated in atmospheric circulation explains rapid global spread, periodic case surges (waves), and multi-year durations. Pollution and wind geography affect uptake and re-distribution.

In many cases, interventions will likely be needed to safeguard populations and species and to maintain functioning ecosystems. Strategies aimed at initiating, reinstating, or enhancing patterns of gene flow via the deliberate movement of genotypes around the environment are generating growing interest with broad applications in conservation and environmental management. These diverse strategies go by various names ranging from genetic or evolutionary rescue to provenancing and genetic resurrection. Our aim here is to provide some clarification around terminology and to how these strategies are connected and linked to underlying genetic processes. We draw on case studies from the literature and outline mechanisms that underlie how the various strategies aim to increase species fitness and impact the wider community. We argue that understanding mechanisms leading to species decline and community impact is a key to successful implementation of these strategies. We emphasize the need to consider the nature of source and recipient populations, as well as associated risks and trade-offs for the various strategies. This overview highlights where strategies are likely to have potential at population, species, and ecosystem scales, but also where they should probably not be attempted depending on the overall aims of the intervention. We advocate an approach where short- and long-term strategies are integrated into a decision framework that also considers nongenetic aspects of management. © 2020 The Authors.

A key point to address this pillar is the proper management of waste generation. Within the broad spectrum of waste types, food loss and waste is produced worldwide in large quantities. In this framework, the development of composite in-dexes is recommended to measure the level of compliance of any context with Sustainable Development Goals. This work presents a novel composite index for food loss and waste generation and management systems, the so‐called sustainable development goals‐food (SDG‐Food) index, aiming to determine the level of compliance of any concrete national, regional, or local context regarding five different sustainable development goals with a water‐climate‐food nexus thinking. The pilot case study of Spain is presented by analyzing the environmental performance between 2015 and 2040 in a context of (i) compliance and (ii) non‐compliance with the Paris Agreement targets. Addi-tionally, four different diets are assessed. Results suggested a numerical index score of 13.79, high-lighting the categories of eggs, cereals, meat, and vegetables, and the stages of agricultural production and consumption, as the furthers ones for compliance with the five SDG assessed. Moreover, the scenario of compliance with the Paris agreement targets presented better values for all stages, and a vegan diet was highlighted as the one with the best index score. © 2021 by the authors.

However, socio-environmental experiences can alter subjective understandings of the environment, thereby modifying their environmental awareness. Method: A two-stage analysis was applied to evaluate the impacts of socio-environmental perceptions on the preparedness and knowledge of air pollution risk among 551 adolescent males. In the first stage, we evaluated the impacts on the overall preparedness and knowledge with Gaussian regressions, and in the second stage, we evaluated specific preparedness and knowledge with binomial regressions. Results: First-stage analyses showed that socio-environmental perceptions impacted overall preparedness but not overall knowledge. Particularly, perceivably low environmental knowledge of oneself negatively influenced overall preparedness, and a perceivably large household positively influenced overall preparedness. The second-stage analyses further implied a complex mechanism between perception, preparedness, and knowledge. Specifically, poor outdoor air quality surrounding the home and perceivably low environmental knowledge of oneself negatively influenced specific preparedness for caring for family members. Perceivably low environmental knowledge of oneself also negatively influenced preparedness for outdoor air pollution and knowledge of visibility, wearing masks, cardiovascular diseases, and mortality risk. Poor indoor environment negatively influenced preparedness of wearing a mask. However, participating in few sports activities negatively influenced preparedness for wearing mask, and knowledge of wearing masks, greenhouse gases, and tropospheric ozone, but positively influenced preparedness for outdoor activities during hazy days. Perceivably low school grade positively influenced knowledge of tropospheric ozone. Perceivably low environmental knowledge of the parents and a large household also positively influenced specific preparedness. Poor indoor air quality at home positively influenced knowledge of mortality risk. Conclusions: Due to the complexity of adolescent males’ preparedness and knowledge, further environmental and health actions (e.g., community services, environmental education, and health workshops) with appropriate preventive strategies should be targeted and specified. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adolescent males; Air pollution risk perception; Environmental perception; Knowledge; Preparedness; Social perception","Air quality; Greenhouse gases; Indoor air pollution; Ozone; Risk assessment; Troposphere; Wear of materials; Cardio-vascular disease; Environmental awareness; Environmental education; Environmental knowledge; Environmental perceptions; Outdoor air qualities; Preventive strategies; Social and environmental; Risk perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098672800

Ly Thuong Kiet Street, District 10, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam","Vietnam's urban areas have faced with serious environmental pollution issues, including: water pollution, municipal waste and air pollution. Air in Ho Chi Minh city is polluted by PM2.5 (particle matter with the diameter is less than 2.5 µm, so-called PM2.5), O3, CO, NO2 and TSP which greatly affects public health. In 2017, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) had 8,640,000 inhabitants with a total of 7,339,552 motorcycles and 637,323 automobiles. There are about 2,500 factories, 2,061,957 household and 5,096 restaurants in the city. The aim of this study is to (i) conduct a detailed air pollution emission inventory for PM2.5; (ii) stimulate PM2.5's dispersion in HCMC and (iii) propose mitigation measures for PM2.5 in the city. Simulations of air pollution were conducted in HCMC by using TAPM-CTM system model. The model performance was evaluated using observed meteorological data at Tan Son Hoa station and air quality data at the Ho Chi Minh City University of Science. The result states that the sum of air pollutants from main sources of disposal in HCMC is 3,978.32 ton of PM2.5 in 2017. Average maximum 1 hours, 24 hours and annual of PM2.5 concentration in 2017 does not exceed QCVN 05:2013/BTNMT, but it is 1.3 to 2.3 times higher than the WHO's guideline. Therefore, the PM2.5 in HCMC impacts on public health of HCMC. To control and manage the air's quality and minimize the generation of PM2.5 in HCMC there are possible solutions such as the control of air pollutants from the main source, the creation of encouraging policy, the regulation of air pollutants in HCMC and the raising people's awareness of environmental protection. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air pollution control; Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Environmental regulations; Holmium; Meteorology; Public health; Quality control; Air quality data; Environmental pollutions; Meteorological data; Mitigation measures; Model performance; Photochemical modeling; PM2.5 concentration; Pollution emissions; Water pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102976699

According to the UNFCCC, peat extraction and use induce the emission of 25.3 million tons CO2-eq each year. For this reason, peat production and use trigger political debates in the context of growing climate concerns. Because of the trade of peat, climate policies can induce carbon leakage. Data on peat production, consumption and emissions are needed by politics and all actors concerned to address this challenge. This study describes the situation of peat production, markets and trade in Europe in average between 2012 and 2016 and compares it with the period 1995-1999. Based on national and international statistics, a balanced material flow model was built for every country with production, imports, exports and consumption. Results show that peat production amounts to 21.3 million tons per year in average between 2012 and 2016, concentrated in Northern Europe, with a majority for energy over other uses. Peat for fuel is produced in a few countries in which it is consumed. On the contrary, most of non-energy peat is traded, mostly within Europe. For the past 25 years, fuel consumption has declined, partially compensated by an increase in horticultural use. A growing part of the peat for horticultural use is traded, exported mostly from the Baltic States and Germany. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science.

The OHPS includes a diesel generator, battery energy storage system (BESS), and a solar power system (SPS). This impact will focus on the electricity production levels of each of the OHPS components according to the increase of the fuel price and the SPS size. The Bellavista community in Ecuador was selected as the case study for this work. In this South American country, the government has begun a gradual increase in the diesel fuel price until it reaches international prices. Fifteen scenarios of OHPSs were simulated, in Homer Pro software, considering three SPS sizes and varying the diesel fuel price in five values. The annual load profile for the simulations was built based on the information of a previous study in this community. The results showed that for lower fuel prices (USD$0.26/L and USD$0.35/L), the OHPSs worked mostly with their diesel generators with reduced use of their BESSs. However, there was a higher penetration of the power delivered from the SPSs and BESSs, with higher fuel prices (USD$0.44/L, USD$0.53/L, and USD$0.62/L). These OHPSs considerably reduced their CO2emissions compared with the standalone diesel generator scenario. © 2021 MDPI AG.

Some of them contend that international public officials have gained significant political influence in various policy fields. Compared to other international bureaucracies, the political leeway of the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has been considered rather limited. Due to the specific problem structure of the policy domain of climate change, national governments endowed this intergovernmental treaty secretariat with a relatively narrow mandate. However, this article argues that in the past few years, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat has gradually loosened its straitjacket and expanded its original spectrum of activity by engaging different sub-national and non-state actors into a policy dialogue using facilitative orchestration as a mode of governance. The present article explores the recent evolution of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat and investigates the way in which it initiates, guides, broadens and strengthens sub-national and non-state climate actions to achieve progress in the international climate negotiations. Points for practitioners: The Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has lately adopted new roles and functions in global climate policymaking. While previously seen as a rather technocratic body that, first and foremost, serves national governments, the Climate Secretariat increasingly interacts with sub-national governments, civil society organizations and private companies to push the global response to climate change forward. We contend that the Climate Secretariat can contribute to global climate policymaking by coordinating and steering the initiatives of non-nation-state actors towards coherence and good practice. © The Author(s) 2020.","climate change; environmental policymaking; intergovernmental relations; international bureaucracies; sub-national and non-state actors","bureaucracy; environmental policy; intergovernmental relations; organizational framework; policy analysis; policy making; state role; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068045177

In order to reduce the emission of contaminants due to fossil fuels, the state of Baja California has recently launched several research projects for the optimization of facilities for the exploitation of renewable sources, and in particular wave energy. In this work a first-level feasibility study of energy extraction from wave motion is presented for the Ensenada coast, along a complex distance of more than 200 km. The methodology proposed provides good spatial and temporal resolution for wave heights and periods calculation and consequently for the wave power. The methodology is based on the application of the coupled Simulated Waves Nearshore and Advanced Circulation (SWAN + ADCIRC) model for generation, propagation and dissipation of waves. To take into account the meteorological variability within a 21-year dataset, the Typical Meteorological Year method was applied. Results show that overall, the most persistent energy potential during the year is >2 kW/m, with peaks of 5 and 10 kW/m during few months. Given the theoretical energy potential calculated, the Ensenada coast could produce hundreds of GWh per year. The proposed methodology can be applied for the exploration of other coasts with energy potential. © 2021 by the authors.

This study presents changes in CO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 based on their anomalies during the COVID-19 partial (Phase 2) and total (Phase 3) lockdowns in Mexico City (MCMA). To minimise the impact of the air pollutant long-term trends, pollutant anomalies were calculated using as baseline truncated Fourier series, fitted with data from 2016 to 2019, and then compared with those from the lockdown. Additionally, days with stagnant conditions and heavy rain were excluded to reduce the impact of extreme weather changes. Satellite observations for NO2 and CO were used to contrast the ground-based derived results. During the lockdown Phase 2, only NO2 exhibited significant decreases (p &lt; 0.05) of between 10 and 23% due to reductions in motor vehicle emissions. By contrast, O3 increased (p &lt; 0.05) between 16 and 40% at the same sites where NO2 decreased. During Phase 3, significant decreases (p &lt; 0.05) were observed for NO2 (43%), PM10 (20%), and PM2.5 (32%) in response to the total lockdown. Although O3 concentrations were lower in Phase 3 than during Phase 2, those did not decrease (p &lt; 0.05) from the baseline at any site despite the total lockdown. SO2 decreased only during Phase 3 in a near-road environment. Satellite observations confirmed that NO2 decreased and CO stabilised during the total lockdown. Air pollutant changes during the lockdown could be overestimated between 2 and 10-fold without accounting for the influences of meteorology and long-term trends in pollutant concentrations. Air quality improved significantly during the lockdown driven by reduced NO2 and PM2.5 emissions despite increases in O3, resulting in health benefits for the MCMA population. A health assessment conducted suggested that around 588 deaths related to air pollution exposure were averted during the lockdown. Our results show that to reduce O3 within the MCMA, policies must focus on reducing VOCs emissions from non-mobile sources. The measures implemented during the COVID-19 lockdowns provide valuable information to reduce air pollution through a range of abatement strategies for emissions other than from motor vehicles. © Copyright © 2021 Hernández-Paniagua, Valdez, Almanza, Rivera-Cárdenas, Grutter, Stremme, García-Reynoso and Ruiz-Suárez.","air pollutant emissions; COVID-19; Fourier series; meteorology; remote sensing","air pollution; city; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; human; Mexico; particulate matter; prevention and control; public health; Air Pollution; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Mexico; Particulate Matter; Public Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103835806

Model simulations have shown that submesoscale features play a pivotal role on plankton distribution, metabolism and carbon fluxes. However, there is a lack of observational studies that provide evidence for the complexity of short-term phytoplankton distribution and variability inferred from theoretical and modeling approaches. In the present study, the development and decay of a submesoscale front south of Gran Canaria Island is tracked at scales not considered in regular oceanographic samplings in order to analyze the picoplankton response to short-term variability. Likewise, the contribution of each scale of variability to the total variance of the picophytoplankton community has been quantified. We observe statistically different picophytoplankton assemblages across stations closer than 5 km, and between time periods shorter than 24 h, which were related to high physical spatiotemporal variability. Our results suggest that both temporal and spatial variability may equally contribute to the total variance of picoplankton community in the mixed layer, while time is the principal contributor to total variance in the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM). © Copyright © 2021 Hernández-Hernández, Santana-Falcón, Estrada-Allis and Arístegui.","Canary Islands; frontogenesis; frontolisis; picoplankton; spatiotemporal variability; submesoscale front; subtropical North Atlantic",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103508382

It is the largest unaltered freshwater body on the 337,000 km2 Colorado Plateau. Prehistorical (before AD 1878) highstands were ca. 9 and 24 m relative to depocenter datum. These levels likely occurred during four multidecadal episodes of cool, wet conditions between ca. 3.55 and 0.20 ka BP. Maximum historical levels (early 1900s) were up to 7.9 m, whereas modern (post-1941) levels were frequently zero or relatively low. Historical climate records indicate reconstructed lake levels correlate directly with annual precipitation and inversely with temperature. Early highstands were associated with above average precipitation and the lowest temperatures of the 116 yr record. The lake receded after 1941; thereafter, frequent drying and low-water levels resulted from recurrent drought and steadily increasing temperatures. Consequently, a wet episode from the 1970s to the 1990s had precipitation like the early 1900s, but highstands were only ca. 3.8 m. The historical lake-level chronology is consistent with changes of hydrologic balance predicted by climate models, that is, reduced effective precipitation (precipitation minus evaporation). These changes, particularly aridification, apparently began in the 1970s or earlier. Global oceanic and atmospheric climate modulate lake levels and regional hydroclimate.

Warming can not only increase C uptake by stimulating productivity at high elevations but also enhance C release by increasing respiration and the frequency, intensity and size of wildfires. To understand the consequences of climate change for temperate mountain forests, we simulated interactions among climate, wildfire, tree species and their combined effects on regional C stocks in forests of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, USA (GYE) with the LANDIS-II landscape change model. Simulations used historical climate and future potential climate represented by downscaled projections from five general circulation models (GCMs) that bracket the range of variability under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 emissions scenario. Total ecosystem C increased by 67% through 2100 in simulations with historical climate, and by 38%–69% with GCM climate. Differences in C uptake among GCMs resulted primarily from variation in area burned, not productivity. Warming increased productivity by extending the growing season, especially near upper tree line, but did not offset biomass losses to fire. By 2100, simulated area burned increased by 27%–215% under GCM climate, with the largest increases after 2050. With warming >3°C in mean annual temperature, the increased frequency of large fires reduced live C stocks by 4%–36% relative to the control, historical climate scenario. However, relative losses in total C were delayed under GCMs with large increases in summer precipitation and buffered by C retained in soils and the wood of fire-killed trees. Increasing fire size limited seed dispersal, and reductions in soil moisture limited seedling establishment; both effects will likely constrain long-term forest regeneration and C uptake. Synthesis. Forests in the GYE can maintain a C sink through the mid-century in a warming climate but continued warming may cause the loss of forest area, live above-ground biomass and, ultimately, ecosystem C. Future changes in C stocks in similar forests throughout western North America will depend on regional thresholds for extensive wildfire and forest regeneration and therefore, changes may occur earlier in drier regions. © 2020 British Ecological Society.

Natural climate solutions (NCS) harness the photosynthetic power of ecosystems to avoid emissions and remove atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), sequestering it in biological carbon pools. In this perspective, we aim to determine which kinds of NCS strategies are most suitable for ecosystem-scale flux measurements and how these measurements should be deployed for diverse NCS scales and goals. We find that ecosystem-scale flux measurements bring unique value when assessing NCS strategies characterized by inaccessible and hard-to-observe carbon pool changes, important non-CO2 greenhouse gas fluxes, the potential for biophysical impacts, or dynamic successional changes. We propose three deployment types for ecosystem-scale flux measurements at various NCS scales to constrain wide uncertainties and chart a workable path forward: “pilot”, “upscale”, and “monitor”. Together, the integration of ecosystem-scale flux measurements by the NCS community and the prioritization of NCS measurements by the flux community, have the potential to improve accounting in ways that capture the net impacts, unintended feedbacks, and on-the-ground specifics of a wide range of emerging NCS strategies. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; Uncertainty analysis; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Carbon dynamics; Climate mitigations; Direct observations; Eddy covariance measurements; Flux measurements; Greenhouse gas fluxes; Prioritization; Ecosystems; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; assessment method; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; flux measurement; greenhouse gas; observational method; seasonal variation; strategic approach; biophysics; carbon footprint; climate; climate resilience; ecosystem; ecosystem monitoring; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; human; measurement; natural science; nonhuman; Review; climate; climate change; greenhouse gas; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Gases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102965345

In particular, a decrease in electricity generation by coal could contribute to reducing CO2 emissions. We study potential economic consequences of a coal phase-out in Germany, using a multi-region dynamic general equilibrium model. Four regional phase-out scenarios before the end of 2040 are simulated. We find that the worst case phase-out scenario would lead to an increase in the aggregate unemployment rate by about 0.13 [0.09 minimum; 0.18 maximum] percentage points from 2020 to 2040. The effect on regional unemployment rates varies between 0.18 [0.13; 0.22] and 1.07 [1.00; 1.13] percentage points in the lignite regions. A faster coal phase-out can lead to a faster recovery. The coal phase-out leads to migration from German lignite regions to German non-lignite regions and reduces the labour force in the lignite regions by 10,100 [6,300; 12,300] people by 2040.

Indeed, its history as a coal and energy region has formed the consciousness and self-awareness of local residents. Now mining activities are coming to an end: in order to meet its climate protection goals, the German government has decided to eliminate coal-based energy production by 2038. The politically initiated and normatively justified phase-out, which will result in the loss of thousands of well-paid jobs, is a challenge for policy at all levels, particularly against the background of increasing influence of right-wing populism. Consequently, state authorities intent on initiating a promising process of transformation in Lusatia. To structure this process, guiding principles for the entire region are to be created and its inhabitants actively involved in their design. Here we aim to characterize the socio-cultural, respectively socio-political conditions and challenges at this early stage in the process. Using a qualitative research approach that includes participatory observation, interviews and a stakeholder workshop, we investigate the functions of guiding principles in the political process. Furthermore, we suggest a process design that takes account of the complex, heterogeneous and uncertain nature of regional transformation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate Protection; Germany; Leitbild; Regional structural change; Urban transformation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088796360

Air quality is a pressing issue in many AP countries and together with increased vehicle sales has led to intense scrutiny of vehicle emissions. The heterogeneity of socio-economic features and transportation patterns in AP countries has resulted in different emission levels and control policies. We present an assessment of the historical and future emissions of on-road transportation and strategies to tackle emission challenges. First, we collected historical country-level population, economic development, vehicle ownership, and transportation policy data from 1900 to 2020, and forecast future development of on-road transportation activity (both passenger and freight) based on its historical relationship with socio-economic development through 2050. We considered major countries (China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia) individually and other AP countries as a group. Second, we generated a series of emission control scenarios with various stringency levels after a comprehensive review of vehicle control measures implemented in AP countries. The control packages included transportation mode shifts, pollutant emission standards, fuel consumption standards, fuel and powertrain diversification, improvement in fuel quality, and economic and transportation policies. Localized emission factors for greenhouse gases (GHGs) and criteria air pollutants (carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM)) were collected and estimated in line with the emission control measures. Third, we estimated historical and future emissions of AP on-road transportation from 1900 to 2050. The results showed that major air pollutants (NOx, CO, and PM2.5) from on-road vehicles peaked in 2000-2010 and are now declining despite increasing vehicle population. Control of GHGs is more challenging than for criteria air pollutants. In our reference scenario where existing policies and emission standards are implemented and new technologies are adopted according to national plans, road transportation GHG emissions in AP peak in approximately 2040.

Based on the data of Chinese ports from 2009 to 2018, this paper presents a data envelopment analysis model with subdividing input-output indicator weights and develops it further in two stages with the weight preference and the slacks-based measure, respectively. After assessing the sustainable development capability (SDC) of Chinese ports and their spatial correlation, it revealed that Chinese ports are clustered in several regions and their SDC has spilled over into their neighbors. Further study revealed the SDC is affected by environmental regulations in different ways: as a key measure among regulations to improve the SDC, voluntary regulation has a spatial spillover effect, but neither the mandatory regulation nor public media regulation can significantly improve the SDC. This suggests that the port authority should enact environmental regulations based on the port spatial difference and the port should expand its operation scale and market size and recruit more top talent, which is good for improving its productivity and reducing its carbon emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

PBB reduced N2O and NH3 emissions by 1.25%–8.72% and 10.4%–11.8%, respectively. The quantitative PCR results indicated that the reduced N2O emission by PBB were mainly related to denitrifying genes (nirS, nirK, nosZ, and narG). The metagenome results demonstrated that Nitrosococcus was the main genus that could oxidize ammonia to nitrite decreased by PBB. The PBB significantly affected the nitrogen metabolism pathway, reduced the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase to inhibit the formation of NH4+ to reduce NH3 emission. The higher N2O emission in the control group was also related to the higher relative contents of hydroxylamine reductase and nitrite reductase. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aerobic composting; Bamboo biochar; Metagenome; Nitrogen metabolism; Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR)","Amines; Bamboo; Genes; Metabolism; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Polymerase chain reaction; Aerobic composting; Ammonia emissions; Emission mechanism; Glutamate dehydrogenase; Microbial communities; Microbial structures; Nitrite reductase; Nitrogen metabolism; Ammonia; activated carbon; ammonia; bacterial protein; biochar; glutamate dehydrogenase; hydroxylamine reductase; narG protein; nirK protein; nirS protein; nitrite; nitrite reductase; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide reductase; nosZ protein; oxidoreductase; unclassified drug; ammonia; biochar; charcoal; nitrous oxide; ammonia; bacterium; bamboo; biochar; composting; emission; genomics; metabolism; microbial community; nitrous oxide; polymerase chain reaction; aerobic capacity; Article; bacterial gene; bamboo; carbon footprint; composting; controlled study; decomposition; denitrification; denitrifying bacterium; enzyme activity; functional genomics; metabolism; metagenome; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial diversity; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; oxidation; powder; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; swine manure; polymerase chain reaction; powder; Sasa; soil; Nitrosococcus; Ammonia; Charcoal; Composting; Denitrification; Metagenome; Nitrous Oxide; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Powders; Sasa; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098938772

More specifically, an analysis of the complete transition to EVs by 2050 and whether renewable energy would be enough to supply their electricity demand. Some difficulties are facing such a transition and its background. To support the analysis, an estimation of the supply and demand of electricity in the United States is made using assumptions and data provided by (mostly) government agencies. The estimation uses existing data to predict the amount of renewable power available for EVs in 2050 and the amount of power that EVs will require. These predictions have pointed out that power generated by renewable means (by 2050) available for EVs and the EVs' power needs are both around 1 trillion kWh. Further discussions about energy storage and transportation conclude that the power generated by renewable energy may not be able to cover all the energy needs of EVs but a significant amount. The complete transition to EV in the future will largely be supported by clean and renewable energy, so the transition is warranted as it will greatly reduce carbon emissions, pollution, and even global warming. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Carbon; Digital storage; Economics; Electric energy storage; Global warming; Carbon emissions; Electricity demands; Energy needs; Government agencies; Renewable energies; Renewable Power; Storage and transportations; Supply and demand; Electric automobiles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103149984

Stricter clean air policies have been enacted in recent years to tackle China's serious problem with PM2.5 pollution, including the implementation of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan between 2013 and 2017. However, assessment of the change in national PM2.5 exposure during this period is difficult due to the limitation of high-resolution PM2.5 data. To address this issue, a satellite-based spatiotemporal model was developed to predict daily high-resolution surface PM2.5 concentrations in China during the designated period, and quantitative analysis was then performed regarding the spatiotemporal characteristics of this critical pollutant. The corresponding changes in the population exposure to PM2.5 were also explored at a fine scale. The overall concentrations of PM2.5 declined from 2013 to 2017, with substantial decreases in eastern China but negligible decreases in western China. The national PM2.5 concentration declined remarkably from 2013 to 2014 to 2015–2017. The Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei and Pearl River Delta regions and most cities reached the goals set by the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan. However, despite the overall reduction in the PM2.5 concentration, by 2017 the vast majority of the Chinese population still lived in areas with sustained levels of high risk from fine particle pollution. The findings from this study have crucial environmental policy implications for the mitigation of PM2.5 pollution and could benefit PM2.5–related health studies in China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; City scale; Health risk exposure; PM2.5 concentration; Spatiotemporal patterns","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Environmental protection; Public policy; Satellites; Air pollution prevention; Environmental policy; Fine particulate matter; Pearl River Delta region; Population exposure; Spatio-temporal models; Spatio-temporal resolution; Spatiotemporal characteristics; River pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096944520

In this study, variation in the concentration of health-threatening air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, and O3) pre- and post-lockdown was investigated at global, continental, and national scales. We analyzed ground-based data from &gt;10,000 monitoring stations in 380 cities across the globe. Global-scale results during lockdown (March to May 2020) showed that concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 decreased by 16.1% and 45.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline period (2015–2019). However, O3 concentration increased by 5.4%. At the continental scale, concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 substantially dropped in 2020 across all continents during lockdown compared to the baseline, with a maximum reduction of 20.4% for PM2.5 in East Asia and 42.5% for NO2 in Europe. The maximum reduction in O3 was observed in North America (7.8%), followed by Asia (0.7%), while small increases were found in other continents. At the national scale, PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations decreased significantly during lockdown, but O3 concentration showed varying patterns among countries. We found maximum reductions of 50.8% for PM2.5 in India and 103.5% for NO2 in Spain. The maximum reduction in O3 (22.5%) was found in India. Improvements in air quality were temporary as pollution levels increased in cities since lockdowns were lifted. We posit that these unprecedented changes in air pollutants were mainly attributable to reductions in traffic and industrial activities. Column reductions could also be explained by meteorological variability and a decline in emissions caused by environmental policy regulations. Our results have implications for the continued implementation of strict air quality policies and emission control strategies to improve environmental and human health. © 2021 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air pollution; Confinement; COVID-19; Ground-level data; Lockdown",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100741678

Seasonal snowpacks for the period spanning water years 1982-2017 were calculated using two established methods: (1) the classic Sturm approach that requires 60 days of snow cover with a peak depth >50 cm and (2) the snow seasonality metric (SSM) that only requires 60 days of continuous snow cover to define seasonal snow. The latter approach yields continuous values from -1 to +1, where -1 (+1) indicates an ephemeral (seasonal) snowpack. The SSM approach is novel in its ability to identify both seasonal and ephemeral snowpacks. Both approaches identify seasonal snowpacks in western U.S. mountains and the northern central and eastern U.S. The SSM approach identifies greater areas of seasonal snowpacks compared to the Sturm method, particularly in the Upper Midwest, New England, and the Intermountain West. This is a result of the relaxed depth constraint compared to the Sturm approach. Ephemeral snowpacks exist throughout lower elevation regions of the western U.S. and across a broad longitudinal swath centered near 35° N spanning the lee of the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic coast. Because it lacks a depth constraint, the SSM approach may inform the location of shallow but long-duration snowpacks at risk of transitioning to ephemeral snowpacks with climatic change. A case study in Oregon during an extreme snow drought year (2014/2015) highlights seasonal to ephemeral snowpack transitions. Aggregating seasonal and ephemeral snowpacks to the HUC-8 watershed level in the western U.S. demonstrates the majority of watersheds are at risk of losing seasonal snow. © 2021 by the authors.","Ephemeral snow; Seasonal snow; Snow; Snowpack; United states",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103043169

In addition, when graphite particles are aligned, they can cause fracture by their linkage. The safety management standards for carbon steels in high-temperature applications state that graphitization should be considered at 698 K and above. The number of reported cases on graphitization in steels below 698 K is limited, and the mechanism has not yet been well investigated. This paper reports the finding of unprecedented graphitization at 673 K in creep-ruptured carbon steel and an elongated form of graphite that appears after a much shorter time at 673–773 K than other previously reported times. Furthermore, the formation mechanism of this elongated graphite is discussed.

Using a continuous 4 year dataset of CO2 and CH4 fluxes obtained from three eddy covariance (EC) towers, we investigate the integrated dynamics of landscape type, vegetation community, moisture regime, and season on net CO2 and CH4 fluxes. EC towers were situated across a moisture gradient including a moist upland tundra, a heterogeneous polygon tundra, and an inundated drained lake basin. We show that seasonal shifts in carbon emissions buffer annual carbon budget differences caused by site variability. Of note, high growing season gross primary productivity leads to higher fall zero-curtain CO2 emissions, reducing both variability in annual budgets and carbon sink strength of more productive sites. Alternatively, fall zero-curtain CH4 emissions are equal across landscape types, indicating site variation has little effect on CH4 emissions during the fall despite large differences during the growing season. We find that the polygon site has the largest mean warming potential (107 ± 8.63 g C-CO2-eq m−2 yr−1) followed by the drained lake basin site (82.12 ± 9.85 g C-CO2-eq m−2 yr−1) and the upland site (77.19 ± 21.8 g C-CO2-eq m−2 yr−1), albeit differences were not significant. The highest temperature sensitivities are also at the polygon site with mixed results between CO2 and CH4 at the other sites. Results show a similar mean annual net warming effect across dominant landscape types but that these landscape types vary significantly in the amounts and timing of CO2 and CH4 fluxes. © 2021 The Author(s).

Recycling also helps to reduce land, water, and air pollution as well as waste landfilling issues. The present work has been done to explore the prospect of partial replacement of natural soil for brick manufacturing with municipal waste, which is soda-lime glass. In this study, the effect of waste glass additives on the physical and mechanical properties of brick has been investigated. Bricks were manufactured using 2%, 4%, 10%, 16%, 30%, and 40% of waste glass replacing natural clay. Compressive strength, water absorption, and other tests were carried out to determine the mechanical performance and durability of the prepared brick specimens. An increase in compressive strength and decrease in water absorption of the samples were observed with the addition of waste glass. It was found that the developed bricks have been satisfying the parameters of the Grade-A and Grade-S brick in accordance with the Bangladeshi standard for conventional building clay brick (BDS 208). Results obtained from this study indicated that partial replacement of natural clay in brick with waste soda-lime glass makes the brick production sustainable and eco-friendly. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Brick; Efflorescence; Ultimate strength; Waste glass; Water absorption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096548977

We estimate that global forests were a net carbon sink of −7.6 ± 49 GtCO2e yr−1, reflecting a balance between gross carbon removals (−15.6 ± 49 GtCO2e yr−1) and gross emissions from deforestation and other disturbances (8.1 ± 2.5 GtCO2e yr−1).

Rice production in the subtropical environment in Bangladesh is mostly dependent on synthetic inorganic fertilizer to maintain productivity; however, the inorganic fertilizer has negative effects on global warming. Climate-smart and resilient agricultural production systems are major concerns nowadays to meet sustainable development goals. The study was conducted to evaluate the optimum rate and source of organic amendments on rice productivity and soil fertility along with CH4 emission. A total of nine nutrient combinations were used in the study. The CH4 emission, soil redox potential (Eh), soil pH, soil nitrogen and organic carbon, available phosphorus, rice grain and straw were greatly affected by the application of different rates and sources of the nutrient. However, the soil exchangeable K content, plant height, and harvest index were not affected. Among the treatments, the application of 75% recommended fertilizer (RF) + biosolid 2 tha−1 (T3) was the most effective and showed the superior performance in terms of available P (12.90 ppm), the number of grains panicle−1 (121), and 1000-grain weight (24.6 g), rice grain, and straw yield along with the moderate CH4 emission (18.25 mg m−2 h−1 ). On the other hand, the lowest soil Eh (−158 mV) and soil pH (6.65) were measured from the treatment T3. The finding of this study revealed that the application of 75% of RF + biosolid 2 t ha−1 can be recommended as the preferable soil amendment for boosting rice yield, reduce CH4 emissions, and sustainably maintain soil fertility. Furthermore, this finding may help to introduce preferable soil amendment doses, which will contribute to boosting rice productivity and economic turnouts of the farmers. © 2021 by the authors.

Consequently, building design strategies for island buildings usually refer to those developed for inland cities. This approach has to some extent hindered the energy–saving design and green development of island buildings in China.This research takes a first step on this issue by defining the building climate zones of 36 marine islands over China marine area using two-stage zoning methodology adopted by current building climate zoning standard (GB50178-1993). The meteorological data used for analysis was obtained from the National Climate Center of China over the 30-year period from 1985 to 2014. As comparison, 40 coastal stations which are adjacent to the investigated marine islands were also included in this study. Subsequently a more objective technique—cluster analysis was operated as an effective supplement to discover the climate characteristics among different observations. The results of both methodologies consistently show that among the 36 islands investigated, the majority of islands located in northern and eastern marine area belong to the same climate zones as their adjacent coastal cities. However, island cities in southern marine area cannot be assigned to any current climate zone, which was demonstrated by its distinctive climate features different from any other sites investigated through cluster analysis as well as different energy use patterns. Thus a new zone was defined to supplement the current building climate zoning scheme to cover marine area of China. © 2020 The Authors","Building climate zoning; Building energy consumption; Climate characteristics; Clustering analysis; Marine islands; Two-stage zoning method",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089701872

The chemical fibre industry seriously harms the environment due to its small production scale, single product variety, low resource utilization efficiency, and weak technology strength. Investigating wastewater generated by chemical fibre production and improving the measurement uncertainty of monitoring factors are significant to chemical fibre wastewater treatment and environmental protection. A review of related literature on wastewater pollution in the chemical industry is conducted to summarize the types of wastewater hazards in the chemical fibre production process. An environmental monitoring uncertainty model is used to measure the wastewater monitoring uncertainty of a chemical fibre enterprise in Jilin City, Jilin Province in China. Findings show that the hazardous types of chemical fibre wastewater include polluting the surrounding environment, endangering human health, and destroying existing biodiversity. The monitoring quality reliability of the extended uncertainty model for the pH value, chemical oxygen demand, ammonia-nitrogen, and total phosphorous used in this case is superior to the direct chemical numerical detection quality. The monitoring uncertainty of chemical fibre wastewater can be further improved by perfecting the chemical fibre production process and the wastewater treatment process. Its environmental hazards can also be relieved by improving the environmental monitoring industry of wastewater and strengthening the R&D of related virtual instruments. This study can serve as a reference for enhancing the environmental monitoring quality of chemical fibre wastewater, compensating for the environmental monitoring errors, realizing the energy conservation and emission reduction of the chemical fibre industry. © 2021 Technoscience Publications.

However, the long-term extensive development of agriculture has led to a series of water problems such as groundwater overexploitation, water shortages, and water pollution in some areas of China, resulting in great pressure on the ecological environment and social economy. In this paper, we constructed a dynamic optimization simulation model based on the input–output (I–O) approach within the horizon of 2012–2025 to explore the synthetic optimal policies for achieving both socioeconomic development, and water resources and water environment protection in a node city on the middle route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project, Handan. Six scenarios based on various synthetic policies were adopted. The simulation results show that during the simulation period, the maximum development of the social economy can be achieved under the premise of achieving the specific objectives of water resources and water environment protection in a comprehensive scenario. In addition, the water environment improved: the annual chemical oxygen demand (COD) emissions reduced by 7.5%, 10.3%, 5.0%, and 5.9% in pig farming, cattle farming, chicken farming, and households, respectively. Furthermore, the water supply–demand structure was optimized. The water demand of wheat planting and groundwater extraction decreased at an annual rate of 9.1% and 7.7%, respectively.

In order to further explore the adsorption properties of different gases (CH4/CO2/N2) on the coal surface, the thermodynamic parameters of adsorption were revealed using a molecular simulation method. The results show that the Langmuir-Freundlich model is more accurate to represent gas adsorption on anthracite coal than the Langmuir model and Freundlich model, which reveal that the gas adsorption on the coal surface is heterogeneous. Also, thermodynamic parameters indicate that gas adsorption on anthracite coal is a thermodynamically spontaneous (ΔG < 0) and exothermic physisorption (0 < ΔH < 10 kcal/mol) process, and the gas molecules tend to be in an ordered state (ΔS > 0). According to adsorption affinity and thermodynamic parameters, the adsorption capacity of these three gases on a coal surface follows the sequence of CO2 > CH4 > N2.

In recent years, numerous studies have focused on improving the efficiency and sustainability of CCL, and the results have important implications for promoting innovation, applying technologies, improving facilities and equipment, and optimizing management in the CCL industry. Scope and approach: This review discusses active research areas, gaps in the existing state of research, and future research challenges for CCL. Furthermore, we summarize the current status of China's CCL industry and technology and compare the state of CCL development in China with that in more developed countries in terms of infrastructure, data handling, and national policies. Key findings and conclusions: The future trends of CCL involve low carbon strategies and intelligent innovation, which are the key to meeting environmental concerns and the evolving needs of the market. Advances in next-generation information technology (including IoT, blockchain, AI, etc.) have significantly accelerated the modernization of CCL. Meanwhile, attaining these dual objectives of a low-carbon footprint and intelligent innovation requires cooperation between national regulators, industry, consumers, and interdisciplinary experts. A key finding of this review is that national policy and financial intervention in China are expected to be the main forces behind renovating infrastructure and upgrading standardization, which is required to narrow the CCL development gap between China and other more developed nations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Cold chain; Digital development; Energy conservation; Food safety; Fresh agricultural products","Agricultural products; Carbon footprint; Data handling; Modernization; Sustainable development; Cold chain logistics; Developed countries; Environmental concerns; Fresh agricultural products; Low-carbon strategies; Quality and safeties; Research challenges; State of research; Accident prevention",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100387432

Since 1980/1981, this phenomenon inspired a technological shift in rice production to Directly-seeded flooded rice on rainfed land. Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara province achieved self-sufficiency of rice in 1984, a year before national self-sufficiency in 1985. This research aims to analyze the impact of directly-seeded flooded rice as a climate change adaptation strategy on output supply and input demand. Time series data from 2000 to 2015 was analyzed by employing Translog Profit Function and Seemingly Unrelated Regression. The results showed that Directly-seeded flooded rice as a climate change adaptation strategy has a positive impact on output supply and input demand. It indicated (1) elastic output supply subject to self-price change of rice and labor, yet inelastic to the price of seed, Urea fertilizer, TSP, and NPK fertilizer. (2) All demand inputs were inelastic subject to self-price except casual labor and herbicide, and elastic subject to output price. Herbicide and fertilizers are complementary inputs to the directly-seeded flooded rice, while herbicide and casual labor are substitution inputs. The output and inputs price changes faced by farmers have both positive as well as negative impacts on output supply and input demand. It means that inputs such as seed, fertilizers, pesticides, and energy such as petrol for hand tractors are the main physical inputs to Directly-seeded flooded rice. Those inputs were very strategic economic goods, meanings that when the price changes occurred, it disturbed supply directly and performance of rice farming, either the production side, profits, or price risk. It also has food security impacts in Lombok. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Ecology; Floods; Food supply; Herbicides; Profitability; Urea; Urea fertilizers; Weed control; Climate change adaptation; Food security; NPK fertilizers; Output and inputs; Profit function; Rice production; Seemingly unrelated regression; Time-series data; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103660422

The concept of the “New Normal” and the experience of the global pandemic provide points of transition in thinking about our relationship to our planet and to each other. These include the fragility of contemporary economics, dependency on industrialized urban infrastructures, and reliance on top-down governance, vulnerability to climate disasters, dislocation from the natural world, societal inequalities, and the loss of cultural memory. The paper considers the potential role of systems thinking in attempting to manage societies’ responses to the pandemic. To provide the methodological context in which some systems thinking can be applied to alleviate the pandemic, we conduct a focused literature review of systemic frameworks, and using examples from Brazil and England, the paper questions the validity of existing disaster management systems and proposes an integrated critical systems approach. Reflecting on these experiences, questions of systems criticality are further developed and considered in relation to critical recovery from disasters and as integral critical systems (ICS) to interrogate the intention of systems. Finally, the paper reflects upon the value of systems and the values embedded in systems that may or may not promote equitable well-being in recovery from disasters such as COVID-19. © 2021 by the authors.

An approach often suggested to improve both the environmental and economic performance of the energy system is demand-side management. However, there has been little research into how households perceive load shifting in space heating. This paper evaluates the thermal perception among tenants in 33 multi-residential buildings connected to district heating in Sweden. Centrally controlled load shifts were applied in eight of these buildings during a two-week trial in early winter. The participants recorded their thermal sensation and thermal satisfaction in a diary, supplemented by opening and closing surveys. The results indicated that indoor temperatures at home were generally experienced as being low, especially in the morning. Control over heating was regarded as insufficient. No statistically significant difference in thermal sensation and satisfaction between days with and without load shifts was identified. However, after the trial, significantly fewer participants than before were willing to accept greater temperature variations to save energy. The study further highlights four factors that may influence the perception and acceptance of demand-side management in residential space heating: (1) set indoor climate conditions, (2) timing and magnitude of load shifts, (3) individual control and (4) communication. © 2021 The Author(s)","Demand-side management; Domestic heating; Peak shaving; Residential energy consumption; Thermal comfort",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100688007

However, despite some positive evidence that insurance positively affects farmers' production strategies, consumption smoothing, asset protection, and asset recovery, the specific effect of insurance on farm households' dietary diversity is largely unexplored. Often, positive effects on dietary diversity are presumed through income gains that might arise from investment returns of profitable production activities and cash gains from payouts. We argue that there exist multiple other causal mechanisms through which insurance may even negatively influence farm households’ dietary diversity. The current article elaborates these mechanisms and provides recommendations on ways to avoid unintended negative effects on dietary diversity which should be taken into account by governments and donors if they continue to further promote insurance. © 2020","Agricultural insurance; Dietary diversity; Local market; Production diversity; Smallholder",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100172902

Four configurations are investigated: simple SOFC, and SOFC with the anode and/or cathode gas recycling. The effect of enriching the gasification medium with oxygen is also investigated. Thermodynamics, economic and environmental aspects of the systems are then comprehensively compared. Finally, multi-criteria particle swarm optimization is employed considering various anode and cathode recycling ratios, and feedstock compositions. The results indicate that optimum values of local power output, and levelized cost and emissions are observed at higher current densities and fuel utilization factors. The SOFC with anode and cathode recycling performs better in almost all conditions. The results further indicate that enriching the gasification medium with oxygen can greatly improve system performance while increasing the levelized cost of products. The optimization results show that exergy efficiency, levelized cost of products, and levelized emissions respectively are 43.7%, 47.2 $/MWh, and 0.530 t/MWh, for a syngas fueled SOFC using air, and 44.2%, 67.9 $/MWh, and 0.481 t/MWh, for a syngas fueled SOFC using O2-enriched air. An appropriate feedstock for a syngas fueled SOFC with anode and cathode gas recycling is CH2.315O0.027 with 77.2 wt% carbon, 15.0 wt% hydrogen, and 2.8 wt% oxygen to achieve a well-balanced condition between exergetic, economic, and environmental indicators.

However, there is a necessity to assess the scope of local climate change, as the livelihood and food systems of subsistence-based communities are already getting impacted. To provide more clarity about local climate trends in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan, this study integrates measured climate data with community observations in the villages of Savnob and Roshorv. Taking a transdisciplinary approach, both knowledge systems were considered as equally pertinent and mutually informed the research process. Statistical trends of temperature and snow cover were retrieved using downscaled ERA5 temperature data and the snow cover product MOD10A1. Local knowledge was gathered through community workshops and structured interviews and analysed using a consensus index. Results showed, that local communities perceived increasing temperatures in autumn and winter and decreasing amounts of snow and rain. Instrumental data records indicated an increase in summer temperatures and a shortening of the snow season in Savnob. As both knowledge systems entail their own strengths and limitations, an integrative assessment can broaden the understanding of local climate trends by (i) reducing existing uncertainties, (ii) providing new information, and (iii) introducing unforeseen perspectives.

Species respond to local conditions, but also to larger scale gradients, such as climate. Trait ecology links these responses of species to community composition and species distributions. Yet, we often do not know which environmental gradients are most important in determining community trait composition at either local or biogeographical scales, or their interaction. Here we quantify the relative contribution of local and climatic conditions to the structure and composition of functional traits found within bromeliad invertebrate communities. We conclude that climate explains more variation in invertebrate trait composition within bromeliads than does local conditions. Importantly, climate mediated the response of traits to local conditions; for example, invertebrates with benthic life-history traits increased with bromeliad water volume only under certain precipitation regimes. Our ability to detect this and other patterns hinged on the compilation of multiple fine-grained datasets, allowing us to contrast the effect of climate versus local conditions. We suggest that, in addition to sampling communities at local scales, we need to aggregate studies that span large ranges in climate variation in order to fully understand trait filtering at local, regional and global scales. © 2020 The Authors.

When presenting their national climate policies, countries often showcase their target trajectories against fictitious socalled baselines. These counterfactual scenarios are meant to present future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the absence of climate policy. These so-called baselines presented by countries are often of limited use, as they can be exaggerated and as the methodology used to derive them is usually not transparent. Scenarios created by independent modeling groups using integrated assessment models (IAMs) can provide different interpretations of several socio-economic storylines and can provide a more realistic backdrop against which the projected target emission trajectory can be assessed. However, the IAMs are limited in regional resolution. This resolution is further reduced in intercomparison studies, as data for a common set of regions are produced by aggregating the underlying smaller regions. Thus, the data are not readily available for country-specific policy analysis. This gap is closed by downscaling regional IAM scenarios to the country level. The last of such efforts has been performed for the SRES (""Special Report on Emissions Scenarios"") scenarios, which are over a decade old by now. CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6) scenarios have been downscaled to a grid; however they cover only a few combinations of forcing levels and SSP storylines with only a single model per combination. Here, we provide up-To-date country scenarios, downscaled from the full RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) and SSP (Shared Socio-Economic Pathway) scenario databases, using results from the SSP GDP (gross domestic product) country model results as drivers for the downscaling process.

Hazard analysis benefits enormously from the number of available landslide runout models that can recreate events and provide key insights into the nature of landsliding phenomena. Regional models that are easily employed, however, remain a rarity. For debris flows and debris avalanches, where the impacts may occur some distance from the source, there remains a need for a practical, predictive model that can be applied at the regional scale. We present, herein, an agent-based simulation for debris flows and debris avalanches called DebrisFlow Predictor. A fully predictive model, DebrisFlow Predictor employs autonomous subroutines, or agents, that act on an underlying digital elevation model (DEM) using a set of probabilistic rules for scour, deposition, path selection, and spreading behavior. Relying on observations of aggregate debris flow behavior, DebrisFlow Predictor predicts landslide runout, area, volume, and depth along the landslide path. The results can be analyzed within the program or exported in a variety of useful formats for further analysis. A key feature of DebrisFlow Predictor is that it requires minimal input data, relying primarily on a 5 m DEM and user-defined initiation zones, and yet appears to produce realistic results. We demonstrate the applicability of DebrisFlow Predictor using two very different case studies from distinct geologic, geomorphic, and climatic settings. The first case study considers sediment production from the steep slopes of Papua, the island province of Indonesia; the second considers landslide runout as it affects a community on Vancouver Island off the west coast of Canada. We show how DebrisFlow Predictor works, how it performs compared to real world examples, what kinds of problems it can solve, and how the outputs compare to historical studies. Finally, we discuss its limitations and its intended use as a predictive regional landslide runout tool. DebrisFlow Predictor is freely available for non-commercial use. © Author(s) 2021.

Scholars working in urban political ecology (UPE) and in children’s geographies have a significant opportunity to research these toxic metabolic flows and responses to them, though scholarship at the intersection of UPE and children’s geographies is scarce and falls behind the growing social movements involved in activism regarding air pollution in children’s urban spaces. Additionally, the intersection of children’s geographies and UPE presents a chance for significant pedagogical reflection in UPE, which, to date, has been nearly absent. To address these issues, this paper details a multi-method and participatory action research project with undergraduates to locate and intervene in uneven and unequal urban metabolism of air pollution near a primary school in east London. It argues for the increasing relevance of air pollution for UPE scholarship, for further interdisciplinary work at the intersection of UPE and children’s geographies, and for the greater participation of undergraduates in urban environmental politics beyond the classroom.

The study was carried out using monitoring data of the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring of the country for 21 rivers by comparing two periods: 1963–1980 and 2008–2017. According to the study’s results, trends of an increase in the mean annual water discharge (by 2–97%) and the essential reduction in its intra-annual variability have been found in most of the studied rivers. On the contrary, the trends of reduction in annual suspended sediment load and the intensity of erosion in the river basins were identified in most of the study region. Their most essential and statistically significant decreases (by 47–94%) were recorded within the Stavropol Upland, which several decades ago was considered one of the most erosion-dangerous territories of the entire country, as well as in some river basins of the central part of the Greater Caucasus’s northern slope (by 17–94%). The changes in climate (reducing the depth of soil freezing and meltwater runoff on the soil) and land use/cover (reduction of acreage and load (pressure) of agricultural machinery on the soil, reducing livestock on pastures, and the transfer of water from the neighboring, more full-flowing rivers) are considered the leading causes of the aforementioned trends. The findings will contribute to solving some economic and environmental problems of both the region and adjacent territories and water areas. © 2021 by the authors.

Sustainable agriculture is the way to increase agricultural productivity and economic prosperity by protecting all natural resources. It maintains a balance of soil fertility with crop productivity and nutritional quality. The mixed cropping systems followed earlier in different regions according to their tradition, climatic zone, soil and water conditions were climate-smart approaches to sustainable food production based on practical experiences over the years of old generations. The life style changes, imbalance in farming system in last 70 years and demand for more food as well as declining land resources resulted in intensive agriculture. Besides, least returns and less demand of ethnic crops gave more preference to major staple food crops. Barahnaja is a traditional orphan crops based mixed cropping system practiced in Himalayan region due to its sustainability and assured crop harvest during erratic weather conditions. This traditional farming method is an exemplary scientific approach to derive innovations with respect to productivity, quality, plant soil interactions and organic agriculture. The main focus of the review is to substantiate the characteristics of the traditional mixed cropping system by describing the advantages of the system and opportunities for scientific innovation towards new knowledge and sustainability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Barahnaja; Food security; Mixed cropping; Organic agriculture; Rhizosphere biology; Sustainable agriculture","alternative agriculture; cropping practice; cultivation; farming system; food production; nutritional status; soil fertility; sustainability; Himalayas",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099874322

A large share of these emissions is caused by electricity production. Scientists have been debating the viability of using natural gas as a transition fuel while renewable energies mature technologically and economically. Although natural gas might help the energy transition by reducing emissions compared to coal, there are other long-term implications of investing in natural gas which can work against reaching climate goals. One concern is that investments in natural gas might crowd out investments in renewable alternatives. This research reviews the literature on the role of natural gas in reducing carbon emissions to mitigate climate change and to bridge between coal and renewable technologies. We advance the debate by laying out how various positive and negative effects of natural gas interrelate. Our research warns that natural gas’ negative delayed and global effects can easily outweigh the positive immediate and local effects unless precautions are taken. Existing studies agree that natural gas helps avoid greenhouse gas emissions in the short term, while unintended long term effects might also hinder the transition into renewables. Our review helps to inform the policy-making process by reviewing the systemic effects of using natural gas as a transition fuel and suggests policy actions to avoid the negative long term consequences. © 2020 The Authors","Carbon lock-in; Energy rebound; Energy transition; Fossil spillover; Natural gas; System dynamics","Carbon; Climate change; Coal industry; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Natural gas; Carbon emissions; Electricity production; Energy transitions; Long-term effects; Positive and negative effect; Reducing emissions; Renewable energies; Renewable technology; Gas emissions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096394947

However, the effect of no tillage and plastic mulching combined with optimum management of water and nitrogen on soil carbon emission has not been tested. A field experiment was carried out in 2016–2018, to evaluate how no tillage, reduced the levels of irrigation and nitrogen affect crop yield, water use, and soil carbon emission of following spring wheat after plastic-mulched maize. A sustainability evaluation index was analyzed via integrating key parameters related to yield performance, water use, and soil carbon emission characteristics. Our results show that no tillage with previous residual plastic mulching, reduced irrigation, and reduced nitrogen application increased yield and water use efficiency of following wheat, but decreased soil carbon emission. From the 3-year average, no tillage and previous residual plastic mulching combined with the reduction of 20 % in both irrigation and nitrogen levels (i.e., the integrated system), increased grain and energy yields of following wheat by 13.7 and 7.8 %, respectively, compared to conventional tillage with conventional high levels of irrigation and nitrogen (i.e., the control). Also, the integrated system improved grain and energy yields for water use efficiency by 7.2 and 4.0 %, respectively. The soil carbon emission with the integrated system was 31.7 % lower than that with the control treatment, and the integrated system reduced soil carbon emission for water use efficiency by 33.8 % compared to the control treatment. However, the integrated system had 65.1 % greater carbon emission efficiency than the control treatment. The integrated system had the highest sustainability index among all treatments. Therefore, no tillage with previous residual plastic mulching from the previous maize combined with a 20 % reduction in both irrigation and nitrogen levels is an optimal strategy for sustainable and effective production of wheat in arid Oasis irrigation regions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emission; Irrigation; Nitrogen; No tillage with plastic mulching; Sustainability","carbon emission; crop rotation; maize; mulching; nitrogen; oasis agriculture; plastic; water use efficiency; wheat; zero tillage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097793820

However, the influences of microplastics on soil carbon cycling which driven by microbial communities remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of polyester microfiber (PMF) and natural organic matter（OM）on soil microbial communities, carbon-degraded enzymes, and carbon accumulation through an incubation experiment. Our results showed that the addition of PMF increased the activities of soil cellulase and laccase but did not impact soil bacterial and fungal communities too much. However, the addition of OM largely altered soil microbial communities and the activities of carbon-degraded enzymes, then mitigated the PMF effects on the activities of soil cellulase and laccase. On the other hand, greater alpha diversity of bacterial community attached on PMF was observed than those in the surrounding soils. The interaction of PMF and OM increased the richness of bacterial community in soils and on PMF. More importantly, we observed that the accumulation of natural organic carbon in soils reduced with increasing PMF. Thus, our results provide valuable insights into the effects of microplastics on soil organic carbon dynamics and microbial communities, and further work is required to clarify the biochemical processes at the surface of microplastics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Enzymatic activity; Microbial communities; Polyester microfiber; Soil organic carbon","Bacteria; Biogeochemistry; Cellulose derivatives; Enzymes; Microfibers; Microplastic; Polyesters; Soils; Bacterial community; Biochemical process; Carbon accumulation; Enzymatic activities; Microbial communities; Natural organic matters; Soil microbial community; Soil organic carbon; Organic carbon; amylase; beta glucosidase; carbon; cellulase; laccase; microplastic; natural organic matter; organic carbon; polyester; sucrase; xylan 1,4 beta xylosidase; carbon; plastic; polyester; biochemical composition; clay soil; enzyme activity; microbial community; organic matter; polymer; soil carbon; soil microorganism; Article; bioaccumulation; biochemical analysis; carbon cycling; controlled study; dynamics; enzymatic degradation; enzyme activity; fungal community; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; soil; soil microflora; species richness; surface property; clay; microbiology; microflora; Bacteria (microorganisms); Carbon; Clay; Microbiota; Plastics; Polyesters; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097188962

It is crucial to design high-efficiency photocatalysts with strong light-absorbing capability, strong redox potentials, high charge separation and excellent durability. Bismuth-based materials have unique crystal structures, electronic configurations and environmental friendliness. However, insufficient light absorption and charge separation greatly limit their application. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, the construction of artificial Z-scheme photocatalysts provides a feasible strategy to overcome these bottlenecks. This review mainly concentrates on the construction mechanism and structure genre of bismuth-based Z-scheme photocatalytic systems, including the liquid-phase Z-scheme photocatalytic system, all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic system with a mediator, and direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system, and their applications in water splitting, CO2 reduction and pollutant degradation are summarized. The different reaction mechanisms in various applications are discussed in detail. Finally, challenges and opportunities are proposed to develop more efficient bismuth-based Z-scheme photocatalysts.

BC + BV resulted in the highest degradation of OM. BV was most effective treatment in controlling CH4 emissions and it significantly reduced the abundance of the mcrA gene. Methanobrevibacter, Methanosarcina, and Methanocorpusculum were closely related to CH4 emissions during the thermophilic composting period. PICRUSt analysis showed that BC and/or BV enhanced the metabolism associated with OM degradation and reduced CH4 metabolism. Structural equation modeling indicated that BC + BV strongly promoted the metabolic activity of microorganisms, which had a positive effect on CH4 emissions.

Generalized linear models (GLM), a typical choice for ecological modeling, have well-established limitations. These limitations include apriori assumptions, inability to handle multicollinearity, and considering differential effects as the fixed effect. We propose an Ensemble-based Dynamic Emission Model (EDEM) to address these limitations. EDEM is developed at the intersection of network science and ensemble learning, i.e., a specialized approach of machine learning. Generalized Additive Model (GAM), i.e., a variant of GLM, and EDEM are tested in Los Angeles and Ventura counties of California, which is one of the biggest SARS-CoV-2 clusters in the US. GAM depicts that a 1 μg/m3, 1 μg/m3, and 1 ppm increase (lag 0–7) in PM 2.5, PM 10, and O3 is associated with 4.51% (CI: 7.01 to −2.00) decrease, 1.62% (CI: 2.23 to −1.022) decrease, and 4.66% (CI: 0.85 to 8.47) increase in daily SARS-CoV-2 cases, respectively. Subsequent increment in lag resulted in the negative association between pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 cases. EDEM results in an R2 score of 90.96% and 79.16% on training and testing datasets, respectively. EDEM confirmed the negative association between particulates and SARS-CoV-2 cases; whereas, the O3 depicts a positive association; however, the positive association observed through GAM is not statistically significant. In addition, the county-level analysis of pollutant concentration interactions suggests that increased emissions from other counties positively affect SARS-CoV-2 cases in adjoining counties as well.

In contrast, the wavevectors of scattered electromagnetic fields outside the lattice are constrained by the 3D light cone, the free-photon dispersion in the surrounding medium. Here, we report that light-cone surface lattice resonances (SLRs) from plasmonic nanoparticle lattices can be used to observe the radiated electromagnetic fields from extended BZ edges. Our coupled dipole radiation theory reveals how lattice geometry and induced surface plasmon dipole orientation affect angular distributions of the radiated fields. Using dye molecules as local dipole emitters to excite the light-cone SLR modes, we experimentally identified high-order BZ edges by directional, in-plane lasing emission. These results provide insight into nanolaser architectures that can emit at multiple wavelengths and in-plane directions simply by rotating the nanocavity lattice. ©","coupled dipole radiation theory; light-cone surface lattice resonance; metal nanoparticle lattice; photonic Brillouin zone; plasmon nanolaser; radiative loss","Cones; Electromagnetic fields; Plasmonic nanoparticles; Surface plasmon resonance; Surface plasmons; Dipole orientation; First Brillouin zone; In-plane direction; Multiple wavelengths; Optical structures; Radiated electromagnetic fields; Scattered electromagnetic fields; Translational symmetry; Lattice theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103460111

Signal transduction via PII proteins is modulated by effector molecules and post-Translational modifications in the PII T-loop. Whereas the binding of ADP, ATP and the concomitant binding of ATP and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) engender two distinct conformations of the T-loop that either favor or disfavor the interaction with partner proteins, the structural consequences of post-Translational modifications such as phosphorylation, uridylylation and adenylylation are far less well understood. In the present study, crystal structures of the PII protein GlnK from Corynebacterium glutamicum have been determined, namely of adenylylated GlnK (adGlnK) and unmodified unadenylylated GlnK (unGlnK). AdGlnK has been proposed to act as an inducer of the transcription repressor AmtR, and the adenylylation of Tyr51 in GlnK has been proposed to be a prerequisite for this function. The structures of unGlnK and adGlnK allow the first atomic insights into the structural implications of the covalent attachment of an AMP moiety to the T-loop. The overall GlnK fold remains unaltered upon adenylylation, and T-loop adenylylation does not appear to interfere with the formation of the two major functionally important T-loop conformations, namely the extended T-loop in the canonical ADP-bound state and the compacted T-loop that is adopted upon the simultaneous binding of Mg-ATP and 2OG. Thus, the PII-Typical conformational switching mechanism appears to be preserved in GlnK from C. glutamicum, while at the same time the functional repertoire becomes expanded through the accommodation of a peculiar post-Translational modification. © 2021.","Adenylylation; Ampylation; Bacterial signal transduction; Crystal structures; Nitrogen starvation; Post-Translational modifications; T-loop conformations","bacterial protein; nitrogen regulatory protein; chemistry; Corynebacterium glutamicum; metabolism; molecular model; protein conformation; protein processing; protein quaternary structure; X ray crystallography; Bacterial Proteins; Corynebacterium glutamicum; Crystallography, X-Ray; Models, Molecular; PII Nitrogen Regulatory Proteins; Protein Conformation; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Protein Structure, Quaternary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102040369

Humans rely on these coral reef ecosystems to provide significant ecological and economic resources; however, coral reefs are threatened by numerous local and global anthropogenic factors that cause significant environmental change. The interactions of these local and global human impacts may increase the rate of coral reef degradation. For example, there are many local influences (i.e., sedimentation and submarine groundwater discharge) that may exacerbate coral bleaching and mortality. Therefore, researchers and resource managers cannot limit their narratives and actions to mitigating a sole stressor. With the continued increase in greenhouse gas emissions, management strategies and restoration techniques need to account for the scale at which environmental change occurs. This review aims to outline the various local and global anthropogenic stressors threatening reef resiliency and address the recent disagreements surrounding present-day conservation practices. Unfortunately, there is no one solution to preserve and restore all coral reefs. Each coral reef region is challenged by numerous interactive stressors that affect its ecosystem response, recovery, and services in various ways.

This study evaluated the dynamics of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen under rain-fed olive groves over a long-term period (2004–2019). The management practices associated with achieving the 4‰ initiative objectives and the depth of analysis to measure the effectiveness of the initiative have generated uncertainties and wide debate in the scientific community. To contribute to this debate from a farm level, the objective of this study was to analyse the effects of conventional tillage and no-tillage with bare soil by using herbicides (after land management change from conventional tillage) on carbon and nitrogen stocks in complete soil profiles (depth &gt; 100 cm) over 15 years in a Mediterranean olive grove. Soil samples were collected from each farm and analysed for carbon content and physical-chemical characteristics. This study indicates that management practices evaluated resulted in soil organic carbon and total nitrogen contents decreasing in soil, with a reduction &gt;30% in all horizons. Results highlight a significant depletion of soil organic carbon stock with a significant decarbonisation process (−1.8 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) and total nitrogen stock (−0.57 and − 0.41 Mg N ha−1 yr−1) on average under both managements (no-tillage no tillage with herbicide and conventional tillage respectively) as compared to the initial situation. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that deep horizons are significant reservoirs of carbon (&gt;50% in all cases) and in woody crops, its analysis within the dynamics of soil organic carbon stocks proposed by the 4‰ initiative was relevant. With these results, no-tillage with bare soil by using herbicides was demonstrated as an unsustainable agricultural practice and it is proposed to change the current soil management to sustainable management that increases the C inputs to achieve the 4‰ targets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bare soil; Conventional tillage; No tillage; SOC stock; Soil depth","Agricultural robots; Agronomy; Herbicides; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Weed control; Agricultural practices; Chemical characteristic; Long-term evaluation; Management practices; Scientific community; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Sustainable management; Total nitrogen content; Soil surveys; carbon; herbicide; nitrogen; organic carbon; soil organic carbon; soil organic matter; unclassified drug; agricultural soil; bare soil; carbon; crop plant; management practice; nitrogen; physicochemical property; soil depth; soil management; soil organic matter; zero tillage; Article; carbonization; controlled study; conventional tillage; crop; decarbonization; depletion; no tillage; nonhuman; olive; olive grove; physical chemistry; priority journal; soil analysis; soil depth; soil management; Southern Europe; wood; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096839275

Oil and gas operators appear optimistic about the technical feasibility of CCS; whereas civil society and NGOs are increasingly vocal in their scepticism towards the necessity of CCS in a net-zero society. Given that operators’ expertise may be required to support offshore CO2 storage given their subsea experience, and that civil society is important in shaping government and public opinion, this divergence may be a challenge to offshore CCS deployment in the UK and elsewhere. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the grounds on which oil and gas operators’ views on CCS differ from a wider range of stakeholders, through a survey and in-depth interviews. Our results show that people with more knowledge of CCS are more likely to support its deployment, and that strong belief in anthropogenic climate change is lower – albeit rising – among oil and gas respondents. Our results also show concern that the net-zero transition may have negative effects for carbon-intensive regions, and that storage expertise is the UK's strongest skill set for CCS deployment. We suggest that across a range of stakeholders, the value of CCS is thus most likely to lie in specific applications (e.g. hydrogen) and/or very specific localities (e.g. places with existing subsurface knowledge and skills), rather than widespread deployment as a mitigation technology. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage; Just transition; North Sea; Offshore CCS; Oil and gas","Climate change; Gas industry; Offshore oil well production; Petroleum industry; Social aspects; Anthropogenic climate changes; Civil society; Environmental stakeholders; In-depth interviews; Oil and Gas Industry; Oil and gas operators; Public opinions; Research and development; Carbon capture; carbon sequestration; feasibility study; gas production; offshore structure; oil production; stakeholder; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; Scotland; United Kingdom; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101715239

However, forests can uptake and sequester POPs from the atmosphere, acting as a filter as they are transported to the poles as part of the so-called grasshopper effect. In this Review, we summarize POP (and polyaromatic hydrocarbon) cycling and distribution in forests, and discuss the environmental factors that impact POP fates. Pollutants are taken up by foliage and transported to the forest floor, where they can be stored in the litter layer or leach further into the soil. Typically, soil organic carbon content, temperature and latitude are the most important factors influencing POP distribution and storage, with boreal and tropical forests accumulating the greatest POP concentrations. Forest fires and deforestation, however, threaten the ability of forests to sequester POPs, with the former also anticipated to increase production of POPs and polyaromatic hydrocarbons through combustion. In order to better estimate the burden of POPs in the environment, greater large-scale and long-term observations are required in all forests, particularly in tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105816898

This work evaluates the water-climate-agriculture nexus in the Gharanghu basin, Iran, seeking to achieve sustainable management of its water system. An optimization model solves for water-release adaptive strategies corresponding to five nexus scenarios to cope with reduced water resources under climate change. The scenarios are as follows (Afshar et al., 2006): change in cropping pattern (Asadieh and Afshar, 2019), reduction of areas under cultivation (Asgari et al., 2015), reuse of agricultural wastewater in irrigated land (Ashofteh et al., 2017), combination of scenarios (Afshar et al., 2006) and (Asgari et al., 2015), namely change in cropping pattern and reuse of agricultural wastewater simultaneously, and (Bates et al., 2008) integration of scenarios (Asadieh and Afshar, 2019) and (Asgari et al., 2015) namely, reduction of areas under cultivation and reuse of agricultural wastewater simultaneously. The nexus scenarios are evaluated with the time reliability index (the ratio of the number of months in which water is supplied to the total months of reservoir operation) based on changes in water supply and agricultural water demand. Results show the time reliability index in the climate change interval (monthly time series for the period 2040–2069) without implementing any nexus scenario equals 28%, and it increases with the implementation of the water-climate-agriculture nexus scenarios. The time reliability of the system equals 85% implementing scenario (Bates et al., 2008) (reducing the area under cultivation and reusing agricultural wastewater in irrigated land). The authors' previous research projects that climate change impacts in the study region would be severe. This paper's findings provide water managers and planners with useful strategies for optimal reservoir operation that rely on decreasing water demand and increasing water supply.

It also presents a new reading on the thermodynamic conditions and characteristics of CO2 and CO2-EOR together with oil industry advancement in the world and Brazil. The interface with chemical EOR processes involving nanoparticles (NPs), their application inside the reservoirs for EOR and understanding of fines migration reducing, among other physical phenomena is also studied. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a worldwide strategy for mitigating climate change. CO2 geosequestration is also analyzed on the leakage of CO2 and brine from aquifers and their implication to the security of the storage and environment. Recent studies show that, globally, CO2-EOR can extract up to 375 billion of additional oil barrels and geological storage up to 360 Gt of CO2 in the next 50 years. Pre-salt is a complex of microbial carbonate reservoirs with stromatolite framework in ultra-deep waters (1500–3000) m depth, underneath by thick salt layer (2000–2500) m. Its reservoirs are in the depth up to (5500–6500) m TVDSS and approximately (200–300) km offshore. It presents light oils and high (GOR) ranging (200–400) Sm3/Sm3 and huge CO2 contamination (8–15)%. Due to the large CO2 content of oil, this work investigated CO2-EOR and CO2 geosequestration within the reservoirs. Pilot test demonstrated that miscible CO2-EOR with WAG is feasible and beneficial to this hydrocarbon Province. This study also calculated and validated the potential of CO2-EOR to the CCS. It concludes that Pre-salt can contribute to recovery factor (RF) increasing about 5.7 billion of additional oil barrels, and to CCS with about 266 Mt CO2 to be geological stored, for the next 20 years. In this context, this work also analyses the recent changes on the Brazilian oil and gas regulation to encourage new international Companies to enter in Brazil and Pre-salt for petroleum exploring. In Pre-salt, CO2-EOR also connects the petroleum energy system to CCS, transforming the oil reservoir in a carbon sink. These results represent a substantial role of Pre-salt to the energy efficiency of energy resources recovering from the biosphere and a high contribution to the climate change mitigation. © 2021, The Author(s).","Additional oil; Climate change; CO2 geosequestration; Pre-salt","Aquifers; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Gasoline; Hydrogeology; Offshore oil well production; Petroleum industry; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Samarium compounds; Subsalt strata; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Climate change mitigation; Enhanced oil recovery; International company; Microbial carbonates; Nanoparticle (NPs); Physical phenomena; Thermodynamic conditions; Enhanced recovery",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101461779

In an experiment with U.S. participants, we found that conservatives and moderates are more supportive of climate change mitigation when exposed to information about mitigation actions taken by the private sector. These results suggest that the private sector initiatives may be a way to bolster support for climate action across the U.S. political spectrum. We also tested for downstream spillover effects and found mixed results: Compared to reading about government regulations to mitigate climate change, reading about private sector climate actions led to both increased and decreased support for government-led further mitigation through two different pathways. We found an indirect positive spillover effect in which conservatives and moderates perceived private approaches to be feasible and effective, leading to more mitigation support. However, we also found an indirect negative spillover effect in which reading about private section mitigation actions reduced concern about climate change among conservatives and moderates, thus decreasing their support for government policies to mitigate climate change. These indirect positive and negative spillover effects appear to cancel each other out. Additionally, when comparing the effect of reading about private sector action to reading specifically about a carbon tax (rather than other government regulations) there were no spillover effects. We explore the policy and behavioral implications of these findings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change policy; Climate communications; Ideology; Mitigation support; Private sector climate approaches; Solution aversion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099838762

Among the different sectors, the transport sector is responsible for more than 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, mostly emitted in cities. Therefore, initiatives and analysis focused on electric vehicles integration powered by renewables is currently a desirable solution to mitigate climate change and promote energy transition. Under this framework, this paper proposes a multi-indicator analysis for the estimation of CO2 emissions combining renewable integration targets, reduction emission targets and realistic renewable resource potentials. Four scenarios are identified and analyzed: (i) current situation with conventional vehicles, (ii) replacement of such conventional by electric vehicles without renewable integration, (iii) and (iv) integration of renewables to fulfill emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2050 respectively. The analysis is evaluated in the state of Maine (United States). From the results, a minimum renewable penetration of 39% and 82%, respectively, is needed to fulfill the emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2050 by considering 100% conventional vehicle replacement.

With growing international pressure to curb global emissions through the 2015 Paris Agreement and mounting climate change-related losses in agriculture, countries are in need of an increasingly robust agricultural policy framework. This paper takes an in-depth look at the agricultural sector in Viet Nam, contributing to a better understanding of the main bottlenecks in implementing the Paris Agreement, evaluating the relevance and impact of selected barriers for the implementation of current climate policies and their implications for nationally determined contribution (NDC) design. To address these questions, an exploratory mixed method approach was employed: (i) identifying and mapping key policies, (ii) reviewing global literature sources on barriers, (iii) conducting stakeholder interviews (n = 25), and (iv) follow-up quantitative surveys (n = 16). The interviews revealed numerous barriers within Viet Nam's institutional setting that acted to impede the creation and implementation of climate policy. As seen in other countries, insufficient inter-ministry collaboration and information sharing restricted the overall success of climate policy, with poor representation of non-lead ministries in drafting and inadequate channels for bottom-up engagement also considered major constraints. These coupled with gaps in financing make for fragmented policies that often lack clear implementation guidelines, particularly at a local level. The NDC process presents an opportunity for Viet Nam to coordinate their cross-sector climate response around a single international agreement, facilitating greater inter-ministry information and data sharing, while utilizing the technical and financial support provided through international partners to build capacity in this vital area. © Copyright © 2021 Giles, Grosjean, Le Coq, Huber, Bui and Läderach.","bottlenecks; challenges; climate change; nationally determined contributions (NDC); Paris Agreement (COP 21); policy analysis; vietnam",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104105482

Suhiya oxbow-lake in the middle alluvial plain of the River Ganga, was selected as the natural laboratory. A top-down multidisciplinary approach was chosen employing satellite imagery to analyse the annual oxbow-lake surface vegetation dynamics (Eichhornia and Hydrilla). Side-scan sonar profiles across two oxbow lakes along with River Ganga core data and vintage topographical maps, estimated the lake-sedimentation rate of 9.6 cm/yr. Organic carbon [amino acids, aromatics, lingo-phenols and lipids hydrocarbons] infiltration-based on hydrophobicity and molecular-mass was detected at different depths along the water and sedimentary column. Elemental analysis showed lake surface to groundwater the As conc. varied from (0.37 to 185 μg/l). A microbial diversity based study showed that large sized photoautotrophs Nostoc, Anabaena are replaced by Fe-oxido-reducing As-metabolizing bacteria e.g. Acidovorax, Dechloromonas and enteric organisms e.g. Enterobacter, Salmonella at bottom of water column.

The study focuses on an isolated carbonate platform of middle Miocene age, offshore Sarawak in Malaysia that has been partly dolomitized- A process that increased the porosity and permeability of the prolific gas reservoir. The nine lithofacies are defined from one reference core and include a range of lithologies and pore types, covering limestone and dolomitized limestone, each with vuggy varieties, as well as sucrosic and crystalline dolomites with intercrystalline porosity, and argillaceous limestones and shales. To predict the lithofacies and porosity from geophysical data, we adopt a probabilistic algorithm that uses Bayesian theory with an analytical solution for conditional means and covariances of posterior probabilities, assuming a Gaussian mixture model. The inversion is a two-step process, first solving for P- A nd S-wave velocities and density from two partial seismic stacks. Subsequently, the lithofacies and porosity are predicted from the elastic parameters in the borehole and across a 2D inline. The final result is a model that consists of the pointwise posterior distributions of the facies and porosity at each location where seismic data are available. The facies posterior distribution represents the facies proportions estimated from seismic data, whereas the porosity distribution represents the probability density function at each location. These distributions provide the most likely model and its associated uncertainty for geologic interpretations of lithofacies associated with distinct stages of carbonate platform growth. © 2021 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","AVO/AVA; carbonate; facies; geology; inversion","Carbonation; Gas permeability; Gaussian distribution; Geophysical prospecting; Lime; Limestone; Offshore gas fields; Offshore oil well production; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Probability density function; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Shear waves; Argillaceous limestone; Gaussian Mixture Model; Geologic interpretation; Porosity distributions; Posterior distributions; Probabilistic algorithm; Probabilistic prediction; Reservoir characterization; Porosity; AVO method; Bayesian analysis; carbonate platform; data inversion; dolomitization; facies analysis; gas field; hydrocarbon reservoir; limestone; lithofacies; lithology; porosity; probability density function; reservoir characterization; S-wave; seismic data; seismic velocity; structural geology; East Malaysia; Malaysia; Sarawak",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105162592

Field capacity, saturated water conductivity, and waste direct evaporation tests were implemented to characterize the basic hydrologic properties of municipal waste and the effect of climate conditions on leachate production. A test cell in Aradkouh landfill with the area of 32 × 50 m2 was constructed to calibrate and compare the measured values with the results of the model. Since the cell is located in a semiarid climate, evaporation had a crucial role in decreasing the primary leachate quantity. The field capacity of the waste is obtained approximately 32.5% (V/V), which is more than the results of laboratory tests. Besides, the waste permeability of the cell was calculated (1.02 × 10−6 m/s) that is less than the results of experiments. In order to determine the effect of waste settlement in leachate production, an initial rate of settlement and ultimate settlement by using hyperbolic function has been obtained 0.104 and 146.5, respectively.

In this study, the short-term and long-term performance of closed-loop horizontal GHP systems in cold regions and the effectiveness of seasonal balancing were investigated. A period of 50 years was simulated to cover the life of a conventional system. A repeating block of heat exchangers at three depths was modeled in a series of 3D multi-physics finite element simulations. Two operation modes were defined, representing the non-balanced mode and the seasonal balancing through the injection of lake water in summer. The climate conditions at the ground surface were explicitly modeled by defining a temperature boundary condition. A novel AI framework was developed to generate the projections of ground surface temperatures from air temperature and other atmospheric variables. An artificial neural network was trained using the air and ground temperature measurements at the nearby weather station. Several training approaches were compared to minimize prediction errors. The model was then used to convert the air temperatures from downscaled outputs of the CanESM2 climate model into surface temperatures. Finite element models, representing the two operation modes under three climate change scenarios and various heat exchanger spacing, were simulated and verified by comparing the resulting ground temperatures with the local measurements. The outputs were processed into extraction power, thermal output, and carbon emissions. Results suggest that in order to attain a stable heat extraction throughout a year, heat exchangers should be placed at depths that are not affected by seasonal variations of surface conditions. Simulations revealed thermal depletion and its inverse correlation with heat exchanger spacing. The seasonal balancing operation approach showed enhancement in total thermal output by 55%. The system was found to be resilient when subjected to the major climate pathways. In a rough estimate based on the average carbon footprint of electricity production in Canada, a system with 100 heat exchangers was found to save up to 800 tons and 1300 tons of equivalent CO2 emissions over its life, under the non-balanced and balanced operation modes, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Geothermal energy; Mitigation; Sustainability","Atmospheric temperature; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Climate models; Environmental impact; Extraction; Finite element method; Geothermal energy; Geothermal heating; Neural networks; Surface properties; Temperature measurement; Atmospheric variables; Climate change scenarios; Conventional systems; Electricity production; Finite element simulations; Geothermal heat pumps (GHP); Ground surface temperature; Long term performance; Geothermal heat pumps; carbon footprint; climate change; climate conditions; climate modeling; cold region; electricity generation; finite element method; geothermal energy; geothermal system; performance assessment; sustainability; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097909880

A comprehensive data collection was conducted within the main routes of the city and then the ISFahan Bus Driving Cycle (ISFBDC) was developed using a micro-trips random selection approach. On-board experiments were carried out on 20 urban buses to analyze the emission performance of the fleet in real-world conditions. The effects of bus speeds, after-treatment systems, and passenger load on emission performance and fuel consumption (FC) were also discussed. Meanwhile, the contribution of different driving modes to the CO, HC, NOx, and CO2 mileage(M)/fuel(F)-based(B) EFs and FC rates were investigated. Our results show that ISFBDC is unique in the world. FBEFs are strongly correlated with the speed, so much so that HC FBEFs were reduced by over 70% with increasing 30 km/h in the bus speed. Idling status contributes over 70%, 50%, 30%, and 30% to the NOx, CO2, and HC emission, and FC of the studied fleet, respectively. Although DPF filters in Euro IV buses could significantly reduce the NOx emission, they have no considerable impact on the emission of the other studied pollutants. Per-passenger EFs and FCF are more than halved by 1.5 T increase in passenger loads.

Anthropogenic aerosols (and their precursors) that cause solar dimming are in fact often co-emitted with GHGs. While the reduction of GHG emissions is expected to slow down the ongoing increase in the greenhouse effect, an increased surface irradiance due to reduced atmospheric aerosol load might occur in the most populated areas of the earth. Increased irradiance may lead to air warming, favour the occurrence of heatwaves and increase the evaporative demand of the atmosphere. This is why effective and sustainable solar radiation management strategies to reflect more light back to space should be designed, tested and implemented together with GHG emission mitigation. Here we propose that new plants (crops, orchards and forests) with low-chlorophyll (Chl) content may provide a realistic, sustainable and relatively simple solution to increase surface reflectance of large geographical areas via changes in surface albedo. This may finally offset all or part of the expected local solar brightening. While high-Chl content provides substantial competitive advantages to plants growing in their natural environment, new plants with low-Chl content may be successfully used in agriculture and silviculture and be as productive as the green wildtypes (or even more). The most appropriate strategies to obtain highly productive and highly reflective plants are discussed in this paper and their mitigation potential is examined together with the challenges associated with their introduction in agriculture. © 2020 The Authors.

Intense economic and human activities in megacities result in air pollution emissions, inducing high levels of air pollutants in the atmosphere that harm human health, cause regional haze and acid deposition, damage crops, influence regional air quality, and contribute to climate change. Since the Great London Smog and the first recognized episode of Los Angeles photochemical smog seventy years ago, substantial progress has been achieved in improving the scientific understanding of air pollution and in developing emissions reduction technologies and control measures. However, much remains to be understood about the complex processes of atmospheric transport and reaction mechanisms; the formation and evolution of secondary particles, especially those containing organic species; and the influence of emerging emissions sources and changing climate on air quality and health. Molina (DOI: 10.1039/D0FD00123F) has provided an excellent overview of the sources of emissions in megacities, atmospheric physicochemical processes, air quality trends and management, and the impacts on health and climate for the introductory lecture of this Faraday Discussion.

Thus, it will be a win-win situation to preform air-quality conscious flare minimization (FM) for chemical plants, so that both environmental and industrial sustainability could be promoted. In this study, a systematic multi-scale methodology has been established to identify and demonstrate the win-win strategy for simultaneous air-quality benign and profitable emission reduction during chemical plant shutdown (CPS) operations. The major contribution of this study is that process-level dynamic simulations via Aspen Plus Dynamics have been seamlessly integrated with the regional-level air-quality modeling via CAMx to simultaneously accomplish both flare source savings and ozone impact minimization during the CPS operation. Case studies have indicated that the base case of CPS without FM could have a serious effect on the air-quality (1.6 ppb 8-h ozone observed). However, the improved case of CPS based on FM would significantly reduce such an ozone impact (only 0.1 ppb 8-h ozone observed); meanwhile the flare source and CO2 emission reductions, as well as the plant economic savings are respectively 165.2 tons, 479.1 tons, and US$133,945.6. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Chemical plant shutdown; Dynamic simulation; Emission reduction; Multi-scale modeling; Ozone pollution control","Air quality; Chemical operations; Chemicals; Computer software; Emission control; Frequency modulation; Ozone; Plant shutdowns; Profitability; Sustainable development; Air quality modeling; CO2 emission reduction; Emission reduction; Flare minimization; Impact minimization; Industrial sustainability; Safety operations; Win-win strategies; Chemical plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100433439

This has extended to the grape and wine industry, an important industry in South Africa in terms of labor employment and foreign exchange. This paper aims to review the current state of knowledge with regards to the three pillars of sustainability and with regards to climate change. In order to understand sustainability in South Africa, a historical context is needed, because the welfare of farm workers still retains vestiges of past Apartheid. Ecological responsibility and higher profits are the main reasons for sustainable practices. Additionally, water use, chemical use, and soil erosion are important environmental sustainability concerns. With regards to climate change, in terms of economic sustainability, there will be winners and losers and social sustainability issues will intensify as changes occur in farms. Table grape producers are relatively more profitable than wine grape producers. Furthermore, pest, disease, irrigation pressure will worsen as the climate warms. However, there are long-and short-term adaptation strategies such as changes in viticulture practices and grape cultivars, respectively, to stem the effects of climate change, but this may be stymied by cost and farmers’ perceptions of climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

This accelerated release of CO2 acts as a major source for climatic change due to the greenhouse gas effect resulting in global warming and melting of polar ice caps, alteration in biogeochemical cycles, altered rainfall, ocean acidification, eutrophication of lakes, imbalance in the ecological communities and extinction of some species, effects on soil fertility, changes in the metabolism and at the molecular level. Reduce, reuse and recycle strategy can be applied to control elevated CO2 levels by preventing deforestation, using renewable energy as an alternative for fossil fuels and reusing the atmospheric CO2. Carbon capture and storage (CCS), Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) are the two technologies adapted to capture the atmospheric CO2, utilize it, and focus on permanent storage in the geological sites. Captured CO2 is used to produce many value added products such as polymers, biofuels, reactants etc. Plants and microorganisms act as a natural CO2 filter. Several biomolecules such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids are produced due to the biological carbon fixation process using photosynthesis. Six different photosynthetic pathways and some non-photosynthetic pathways to fix atmospheric CO2 have been reported in diverse species of plants and microbes such as bacteria, fungi, yeast, algae etc. Algae are the most potent microbe in CO2 utilization and biological carbon fixation compared to other microbes and used widely on a large industrial scale for biofuel production. Algal biofuel production using captured CO2 is the best productive method to recycle and reduce atmospheric CO2. © 2020 The Author(s)","Carbon dioxide; Health effects; Sequestration; Storage; Utilization",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098684347

The initial view of inhaled anesthetics as indispensable for general anesthesia has evolved during the years and, currently, its general use has even been questioned. Beyond the traditional risks inherent to any drug in use, inhaled anesthetics are exceptionally strong greenhouse gases (GHG) and may pose considerable occupational risks. This emphasizes the importance of evaluating and considering its use in clinical practices. Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence of worsening climate changes, control measures are very slowly implemented. Therefore, it is the responsibility of all society sectors, including the health sector to maximally decrease GHG emissions where possible. Within the field of anesthesia, the potential to reduce GHG emissions can be briefly summarized as follows: Stop or avoid the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) and desflurane, consider the use of total intravenous or local-regional anesthesia, invest in the development of new technologies to minimize volatile anesthetics consumption, scavenging systems, and destruction of waste gas. The improved and sustained awareness of the medical community regarding the climate impact of inhaled anesthetics is mandatory to bring change in the current practice. © 2021 by the authors.

It also represents the most marginal member of genus Zelkova that was widespread in the broadleaved forests thriving in warm–temperate climates throughout Eurasia until the Last Glacial Age. Occurring at the westernmost range of the genus under typical Mediterranean climate, the micro-topographic settings have always appeared crucial for the survival of this relict. However, the factors and processes actually involved in its persistence in the current refugia, as well as the response of similar relict trees in arid environments, are poorly understood worldwide. In the aim to elucidate these aspects, in the two sites hosting Z. sicula analyses of topographical attributes were combined with investigations on soil moisture dynamics. Additionally, plants’ growth and spatial distribution patterns were analyzed to detect fine-scale differences between populations and assess the possible ecological amplitude of the species. Results revealed that convergent topographies are basic determinants of microrefugia in arid environments. Within the investigated sites, underground moisture never decreases below 25%, buffering seasonal rainfall fluctuations. Therefore, hydrological microrefugia play a key role in decoupling from regional climate, supporting the target species in coping with an unsuitable climatic envelope. Additionally, the inter-population variability of biometric attributes showed that individual growth is site-dependent and the species retains a relative ecological plasticity, whereas the strongly clumped spatial patterns confirmed the common clonal growth. On one hand, deeply incised landforms have acted as effective hydrologic microrefugia, on the other clonality coupled with triploidy supposedly improved the resistance of Z. sicula to harsh environments, though entailing inability to reproduce sexually. Most likely, sterility and environmental/physical barriers that have existed for millennia have prevented this relict from leaving the last suitable microrefugia, resulting in the two current rear edge populations. © 2021 The Authors.

These fluctuations from colder to warmer or wetter to drier affected both biodiversity and human societies in the last 12,000 years, although the impact in Southern America is still poorly known. We are here investigating the biodiversity of small mammal faunas, more sensitive to climatic changes than large mammals, combining taphonomic and palaeoecological data in the Argentine Pampas to better understand the global nature and effect of these Holocene climatic fluctuations. This paper is pioneering applying in this region palaeoecological methodologies practised in European sites, such as the chorotype classification and biomes overlap analyses. The Pampean Region is an ecotone with a confluence of three climatic regions where any change in climatic conditions should be easily detected. Our results, based on the palaeoecological requirements of small mammals, do not indicate severe changes, and most of the sites show climatic stability except for one of them, in which a possible trend towards present conditions (temperate/humid) can be inferred. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aridity; Central-east Argentina; Chorotypes; Climatic change; Temperature","Biodiversity; Mammals; Climatic changes; Climatic conditions; Climatic fluctuations; Climatic regions; Climatic stability; Interglacial periods; Northern Hemispheres; Overlap Analysis; Climatology; biodiversity; biotype; climate change; climate conditions; climate variation; ecotype; environmental factor; Holocene; Northern Hemisphere; paleoecology; small mammal; Argentina; Pampas; Argentinidae; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100373140

One kind is fabricated by using a co-catalyst bilayer approach and other by a catalyst-free route by using a porous alumina membrane as a template. The carbon nanotubes fabricated by both approaches exhibit low crystallinity. To compute the thermal properties of the nanomaterials, a photothermal experiment was measured at 1064 nm wavelength, and numerical simulations were conducted to analyze the photo-thermionic emission dynamics. The high absorbance of the carbon nanotubes leads to reach temperatures above 1500 K, with time response in the millisecond order and emission currents in the nanoampere range. On the other hand, the photodetector behavior was confirmed by a single pulse experiment that induces fast photocurrent recognition associated to a photodiode. Our results highlighted the coexistence of stable states related to high-power and high-speed electronic conversion energy dependent on the growth mechanism of carbon nanotubes. © 2020 The Chinese Ceramic Society","Carbon nanotubes; Photo-thermionic effect; Photodetector; Photothermal conversion; Porous alumina membrane",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098636138

In this work, two Euro 6d-Temp diesel passenger cars, classified in different segments, a C-segment and a Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV), were tested along a route selected considering the Real Driving Emissions (RDE) test procedure. The tests were carried out in Madrid (Spain), a city with almost 3.3 million of inhabitants and a metropolitan area population of approximately 6.5 million with almost 5 million of vehicles. This work aims to study the contribution of the new generation diesel light-duty vehicles on the urban air quality. Results show great effectiveness of pollution control technologies, since the results of NOx emissions registered were 60% and 76% lower, with the SUV and C-segment vehicle, respectively, than limits established in Euro 6d-Temp regulation. In the case of PN emissions this reduction is even higher, 99% and 88% with SUV and C-segment vehicle, respectively. The opposite trends between NOx and PN for both vehicles revealed the different effectiveness of the pollution control strategies. This work also presents the distribution of emissions along the circuit, identifying the zones more affected regarding the pollution produced by both vehicles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Diesel; Euro 6d-Temp regulation; Light-duty vehicles; RDE procedure; SUV","Air quality; Diesel engines; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Light weight vehicles; Nitrogen oxides; Testing; Control strategies; Diesel passenger cars; Distribution of emissions; Light duty vehicles; Pollutant emission; Pollution control technology; Regulated pollutants; Sport utility vehicles; Pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097043180

The incorporation of this technology, which offers low-cost solutions, allows for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions linked to energy consumption. In this work, the MHP energy recovery potential in Spain from all available wastewater discharges, both municipal and private industrial, was assessed, based on discharge licenses. From a total of 16,778 licenses, less than 1% of the sites presented an MHP potential higher than 2 kW, with a total power potential between 3.31 and 3.54 MW. This total was distributed between industry, fish farms and municipal wastewater treatment plants following the proportion 51-54%, 14-13% and 35-33%, respectively. The total energy production estimated reached 29 GWh · year-1, from which 80% corresponded to sites with power potential over 15 kW. Energy-related industries, not included in previous investigations, amounted to 45% of the total energy potential for Spain, a finding which could greatly influence MHP potential estimates across the world. The estimated energy production represented a potential CO2 emission savings of around 11 thousand tonnes, with a corresponding reduction between M€ 2.11 and M€ 4.24 in the total energy consumption in the country. © 2021 by the authors.","Fish farms; Hydropower potential; Industries; Renewable energy; Wastewater treatment plants","Computer system recovery; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Metropolitan area networks; Recovery; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Water distribution systems; Energy productions; Low-cost solution; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; Municipal wastewaters; Power potential; Total energy consumption; Wastewater discharge; Water distribution networks; Energy utilization; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; greenhouse gas; hydroelectric power; municipal solid waste; power plant; wastewater treatment; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102661155

The downswing of the carsharing industry may not only experience negative economic consequences but also ecological ones. Carsharing has the potential to reduce emissions, occupied space, and congestion and hence can actively contribute to mitigating climate change. As Bill Gates strikingly states: “Covid-19 is awful. Climate change could be worse.” For this reason, it is important to understand which underlying mechanisms drive carsharing usage during the Covid-19 pandemic. The current research has the overall objective to provide deeper insights into the mediating mechanisms that explain carsharing usage intention during the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, we draw on signaling theory to explore how different claims (environmental claims, safety claims) that prompt two different opposing underlying processes (perceived ecological benefits, perceived physical risk) influence carsharing usage intention. An online experiment employing a 3 (environmental claim vs. safety claim vs. no claim) × 2 (high information diagnosticity vs. low information diagnosticity) between-subjects design with participants acquired by the online panel platform Clickworker was conducted in April 2020. Fictitious labels and fictitious advertisements served as stimulus material and constituted the five experimental conditions. The data were analyzed by a multicategorial moderated mediation analysis and a multivariate analysis of covariance. Results reveal that environmental claims can stimulate perceived ecological benefits, which, in turn, positively affect carsharing usage intention. Interestingly, our research demonstrates that safety claims cannot decrease perceived physical risk in the context of Covid-19 and carsharing. Nevertheless, perceived physical risk has a (marginal) negative influence on carsharing usage intention and hence should not be discarded altogether. The findings of this article offer new insights into the mental processes that guide consumer decision-making during the coronavirus crisis and also offer important policy implications by highlighting the relevance of environmental claims during the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the negative influence of perceived physical risk on carsharing usage intention points to the need for alternative measures to reduce users' risk perceptions. © Copyright © 2021 Garaus and Garaus.","Covid-19; environmental claim; experiment; label; mediation analysis; perceived ecological benefits; perceived physical risk; safety claim",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102563243

Although a variety of methods to assess the suitability are available, a com-prehensive, objective, and large-scale screening of environmental variables that influence the re-sults—and therefore their accuracy—of these methods has rarely been explored. An approach to the selection of such variables is proposed and the criteria established for large-scale assessment of land, based on big data, for its suitability to maize (Zea mays L.) cultivation as a case study. The predicted suitability matched the past distribution of maize with an overall accuracy of 79% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.72. The land suitability for maize is likely to decrease markedly at low latitudes and even at mid latitudes. The total area suitable for maize globally and in most major maize-producing countries will decrease, the decrease being particularly steep in those regions optimally suited for maize at present. Compared with earlier research, the method proposed in the present paper is simple yet objective, comprehensive, and reliable for large-scale assessment. The findings of the study highlight the necessity of adopting relevant strategies to cope with the adverse impacts of climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

The results showed the following. (1) The air quality in Hohhot continuously improved, and compared with those in 2013, the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations decreased by 24.6% and 48.2%, respectively, in 2017. However, the air pollutant concentrations remained high, with the average PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations exceeding the national secondary standards by 22.9% and 35.7%, respectively. (2) The reductions in the spring PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were 5.6% and 8.9%, respectively, and the annual decreases in the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were 3.6 and 15.1 µg m−3 yr−1, respectively, from 2013 to 2017. (3) The absolute contribution ranges of dust weather to the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and TSP during 2013–17 were 0.6–5.2 µg m−3, 9.0–16.9 µg m−3, and 14.7–30.0 µg m−3, respectively, in Hohhot during the spring. 摘要 2013年9月国务院颁布了《大气污染防治行动计划》.研究其实施前后呼和浩特市大气污染物浓度变化及及原因;同时, 分析了春季沙尘天气对于呼和浩特市大气环境颗粒物浓度的定量影响.结果表明:呼和浩特市大气环境质量持续改善, 但大气污染物浓度仍然较高.PM2.5和PM10年均浓度分别超过国家二级标准22.9%和35.7%;2013–2017年春季PM2.5和PM10浓度降幅较大, 沙尘天气对呼和浩特市PM2.5, PM10, 和TSP浓度的绝对贡献范围分别在0.6–5.2 µg m−3, 9.0–16.9 µg m−3 和 14.7–30.0 µg m−3. © 2021","Air pollution; Air pollution prevention and control action plan; Hohhot; Sand-dust; Spring; 《大气污染防治行动计划》; 关键词:; 呼和浩特; 大气污染; 春季; 沙尘天气","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); dust; particulate matter; pollution control; seasonal variation; trend analysis; China; Hohhot; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101026760

The game was developed and validated under the auspices of the EU‐funded project EnerGAware‐Energy Game for Awareness of energy efficiency in social housing communities in an affordable housing pilot located in Plymouth (United Kingdom). The results showed that the future exploitation of the game holds important energy‐ and emissions‐saving potential. Assuming that the game is distributed freely by European energy pro-viders to their domestic end‐users, the game was found to be able to save more than 48.9 secondary terawatt‐hours per year (TWhs) and 18.8 million tons of CO2e annually, contributing up to around 8% to the target set for the European buildings sector to keep global warming under 2 °C. The results also showed that the game is highly feasible from the energy point of view, even when we consider the energy consumed upstream, due to its low cumulative energy demand and its potential for household energy reduction. The results of this research provide helpful information for private and public stakeholders, as they contribute to determining the sustainability of promoting energy saving through gaming. © 2021 by the authors.

The main competitors of the Baltic countries in Baltic Sea region are the ports of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. The ports of all three Baltic States are important transit corridors, connecting not only East and West, but also South and North. Periodical investments, modernization, and the construction of new terminals allow the Port of Klaipeda to successfully compete with neighbouring ports and strive for leadership positions. Thus, the aim of our study is to investigate the competitive environment of the Baltic Sea region. We use systematization, grouping, summarization of the scientific literature, data collection, comparison, financial analysis, and capacity calculation. The main results show that the Port of Klaipeda, a seaport on the eastern Baltic coast, is an important hub of the East-West (IXB) transport corridor, connecting roads and sea routes in this direction. With the accession of new members, including Lithuania, to the EU in 2004, the Baltic Sea became the internal Sea of the Union. Many Baltic seaports belong to the same system and organizations (ESPO, BPO). EU ports policy provides them with equal requirements for security, transport regulation, environmental protection, anti-air pollution, and sustainable development.

Although these two forces act separately, their respective contributions are rarely examined. Moreover, while the response of a given community may be a function of latitude and altitude, most studies have focused on these gradients separately. Riparian ecosystems are an opportunity to investigate community change along latitudinal and elevational gradients. Location: France, three major rivers (the Doubs, the Allier and the Loire). Taxon: Birds. Methods: Drawing upon bird community monitoring data over a period of 31 years (1982–2013, n = 1,286 point counts), we assessed community adjustment to temperature increase with the Community Temperature Index (CTI), and the homogenization pattern following habitat conversion with the Community Specialization Index (CSI). We evaluated the spatial climatic debt accumulated by communities, and the interaction between CTI and CSI trends. Furthermore, we tested differences in trends for lowland and highland elevations. Results: Over the study period, the temperature increased by 1.17°C, and the CTI by 0.12°C, which corresponds to a spatial climatic debt of 4.9 km/year. Lowland communities adjusted to warming but not highland communities, which have experienced a decline in species abundance. CSI trends revealed biotic homogenization in both lowland and highland communities. This finding was uncorrelated with the CTI increase, and is thought to be due to the pressure from land use change on community composition. Main conclusions: Riparian breeding bird communities have been affected by a temperature increase and, potentially, habitat change. Highland communities are most vulnerable to climate warming. Both climate warming and habitat change appear to have rapidly affected the composition of local communities, with expectable concerns on their diversity and specificity in the long term. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","bird distribution; climate warming; climatic debt; community changes; lag; wetland","bird; climate change; community composition; digital elevation model; habitat structure; land use change; riparian vegetation; vulnerability; warming; Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes; Bourgogne-Franche-Comte; Doubs; France; Loire",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096639758

Although the resulting emission reductions will continue to evolve, this will presumably be temporary. Here, we provide estimates of the potential effect of such short-term emission reductions on global and regional temperature and precipitation by analyzing the response of an Earth System Model to a range of idealized near-term emission pathways not considered in available model intercomparison projects. These estimates reveal the modest impact that temporary emission reductions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will have on global and regional climate. Our simulations suggest that the impact of carbon dioxide and aerosol emission reductions is actually a temporary enhancement in warming rate. However, our results demonstrate that even large emission reductions applied for a short duration have only a small and likely undetectable impact.

Many biomass power plants have been built and operated because the combustion of biomass is considered to be renewable and carbon neutral. In this review, the following topics are summarized: (1) economic values of bioproducts, (2) many restrictions of biomass power generation systems such as (i) very low energy efficiency from solar power to electricity, (ii) limiting amount of resource, and (iii) requirement of fuel cost for operation, and (3) characteristics of combustion technologies including drawbacks and the following strong points: (i) high power, (ii) high-temperature heat generation, and (iii) utilization for hygiene or sanitation purposes. The reduction of simple combustion and the noble use of combustion technology by effectively utilizing these strongpoints are required to greatly reduce CO2 emission even if renewable biomass is used.

Typical applications employ substantial simplifications including homogeneous soil units and soil-hydraulic properties assigned based only on average textural classifications; the potential impact of these assumptions is usually disregarded. We present a multi-scale approach for parameterizing the distributed Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-Based Regional Slope-Stability (TRIGRS) model that accounts for site-specific spatial variations in both soil thickness and complex layering properties by defining homogeneous soil properties that vary spatially for each model grid cell. These effective properties allow TRIGRS to accurately simulate the timing and distribution of slope failures without any modification of the model structure. We implemented this approach for the carbonate ridge of Sarno Mountains (southern Italy) whose slopes are mantled by complex layered soils of pyroclastic origin. The urbanized foot slopes enveloping these mountains are among the most landslide-prone areas of Italy and have been subjected to repeated occurrences of damaging and deadly rainfall-induced flow-type shallow landslides. At this scope, a primary local-scale application of TRIGRS was calibrated on physics-based rainfall thresholds, previously determined by a coupled VS2D (version 1.3) hydrological modeling and slope stability analysis. Subsequently, by taking into account the spatial distribution of soil thickness and vertical heterogeneity of soil hydrological and mechanical properties, a distributed assessment of landslide hazard was carried out by means of TRIGRS. The combination of these approaches led to the spatial assessment of landslide hazard under different hypothetical rainfall intensities and antecedent hydrological conditions. This approach to parameterizing TRIGRS can be adapted to other spatially variable soil layering and thickness to improve hazard assessments. © 2021 by the authors.

Herein, based on local characteristics, such as the heat load and distribution, we compared the woody biomass used for heat, electricity, and combined heat and power (CHP) with or without a district heating system (DHS). In this study, target demands were selected from the actual residential and commercial sectors of Koriyama City in Fukushima Prefecture using two maps of heat density. A heat pipe network between each buildings was designed using Dijkstra's algorithm, and the amount of woody biomass used in each case was fixed such that it satisfied the heat demands of heat-only boilers. Therefore, there were no meshes with unit heat densities &gt;4.2 TJ/ha. However, we found areas with the required heat densities and selected 90 buildings for the DHS. The case that both CHP and DHS were installed and the CHP operational model followed the heat demand (i.e., the “CHP follow” case) was the most effective to reduce CO2. When individual heat-only boilers were installed in buildings, the CO2 reduction was substantial; however, the capital costs associated with heat-only boilers were much higher than the those of the other scenarios. When a heat-only boiler and DHS were installed (i.e., the “Heat DHS” case), the CO2 reduction was competitive with the “CHP follow” scenario, however, total cost was more expensive. Furthermore, the cost of reducing CO2 would be larger than that of “CHP follow” case even if the CO2 emissions factor of grid electricity was less than half of its current value. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass utilization in Japan; Combined heat and power; District heating system; Heat-only boiler; Woody biomass","Biomass; Boilers; Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Heat pipes; Combined heat and power; Commercial sector; Dijkstra's algorithms; District heating system; Heat pipe networks; Heat-only-boilers; Local characteristics; Operational model; District heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099190205

This paper is focused only on one factor, the chips generated while forming gear teeth by power skiving, which could result in local changes in the carburized case parameters as a negatively affecting point of mechanical performance of the carburized case. The chips, due to the specifics of the power skiving process and the kinematics of tooth forming, could be subject to the phenomena of pressure welding or binding of chips to the tooth. During the carburizing stage of the downstream manufacturing processes, the chips form a diffusion barrier, which ultimately could result in localized changes in the carburized case.

Performed simulations of chips by a generating cupper “spots”, mentioned in the study, represent a new approach in connection with minimization of errors, which could appear during carbon case depth and case hardness analysis for typical chips, generated during the machining process—assurance that a complete chip was bound to the surface. Hardness correlation for zones, where the chip appears with areas free of chips, gives simple techniques for assessment. Performed tests increased the knowledge about the critical size of the chip—1.5 mm, which could affect the case hardening. Obtained experimental test results showed that the appearance of chip phenomena on the gear tooth might have a negative impact on a carburized case depth and hardened layer. © 2021 by the authors.

Under waterlogging, plant roots are exposed to hypoxic conditions, which strongly affect root growth and function. However, its impact is dependent on various factors, such as waterlogging depth. Therefore, our objective is to elucidate effects of different waterlogging depths on Pinus thunbergii Parl., which is widely used for afforestation, especially at coastal forests. We conducted an experiment to examine growth and morphology of fine roots and transpiration using 2-year-old seedlings under three treatments, (1) control (no waterlogging), (2) partial waterlogging (partial-WL, waterlogging depth = 15 cm from the bottom), and (3) full waterlogging (full-WL, waterlogging depth = from the bottom to the soil surface, 26 cm). As a result, fine root growth and transpiration were both significantly decreased at full-WL. However, for partial-WL, fine root growth was significantly increased compared to control and full-WL at the top soil, where it was not waterlogged. Additionally, transpiration which had decreased after 4 weeks of waterlogging showed no significant difference compared to control after 8 weeks of waterlogging. This recovery is to be attributed to the increase in fine root growth at non-waterlogged top soil, which compensated for the damaged roots at the waterlogged bottom soil. In conclusion, this study suggests that P. thunbergii is sensitive to waterlogging; however, it can adapt to waterlogging by plastically changing the distribution of fine root growth. © Copyright © 2021 Fujita, Noguchi and Tange.","coastal forest restoration; fine root color; fine root growth distribution; fine root morphology; in-growth core",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103023278

There have been studies arguing that the policy has significantly reduced carbon emission in the pilot cities. However, with greater policy leverage and resource input, it is not difficult for the pilot cities to reduce their overall carbon emissions. The more important question is: Do the low-carbon cities reduce carbon emission efficiently considering various input and output indicators? Does the policy really make a difference by reducing carbon emission at the city level from a cost-effectiveness perspective? This research addresses the gap by introducing the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index in DEA and the quasi-experimental method of Difference in Difference with Propensity Score Matching (PSM-DID) to evaluate the impacts of the low-carbon city pilot scheme in China. Beyond the results that the policy did improve the overall carbon emission efficiency of pilot cities, the article generates several intriguing findings: (1) Although existing researches argue that the policy helps reduce the carbon emission of pilot cities immediately, our findings suggest that it takes longer time to improve the carbon emission efficiency; (2) The proportion of secondary industry and energy intensity of the cities are negatively related to the carbon emission efficiency while capital-labor ratio and the investment in research work the other way around; (3) The policy might further deepen the urban divide between the eastern and western regions since it is more effective on eastern pilot cities; and (4) The mechanisms through which the policy takes effects have also been discussed. © 2020 The Authors","Carbon emission efficiency; DEA; Difference-in-difference; Low-carbon cities; Policy effectiveness","Cost effectiveness; Environmental management; Investments; Carbon emission efficiencies; Carbon emissions; Difference-in-differences; Experimental methods; Input and outputs; Low-carbon cities; Malmquist-luenberger productivity indices; Propensity score matching; Carbon; carbon emission; empirical analysis; energy intensity; input-output analysis; policy making; pollution policy; urban policy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099202686

However, the O3 levels throughout the Guangxi region of South China showed a clear downward trend during the lockdown. To better understand this unusual phenomenon, we investigated the characteristics of conventional pollutants, the influence of meteorological and anthropogenic factors quantified by a multiple linear regression (MLR) model, and the impact of local sources and long-range transport based on a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) and the HYSPLIT model. Results show that in Guangxi, the conventional pollutants generally declined during the COVID-19 lockdown period (January 24 to February 9, 2020) compared with their concentrations during 2016–2019, while O3 gradually increased during the resumption (10 February to April 2020) and full operation periods (May and June 2020). Focusing on Beihai, a typical Guangxi region city, the correlations between the daily O3 concentrations and six meteorological parameters (wind speed, visibility, temperature, humidity, precipitation, and atmospheric pressure) and their corresponding regression coefficients indicate that meteorological conditions were generally conducive to O3 pollution mitigation during the lockdown. A 7.84 μg/m3 drop in O3 concentration was driven by meteorology, with other decreases (4.11 μg/m3) explained by reduced anthropogenic emissions of O3 precursors. Taken together, the lower NO2/SO2 ratios (1.25–2.33) and consistencies between real-time monitored primary emissions and ambient concentrations suggest that, with the closure of small-scale industries, residual industrial emissions have become dominant contributors to local primary pollutants. Backward trajectory cluster analyses show that the slump of O3 concentrations in Southern Guangxi could be partly attributed to clean air mass transfer (24–58%) from the South China Sea. Overall, the synergistic effects of the COVID-19 lockdown and meteorological factors intensified O3 reduction in the Guangxi region of South China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CEMS; COVID-19; Lockdown; MLR model; Ozone; South China","Air quality; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric pressure; Cluster analysis; Industrial emissions; Linear regression; Mass transfer; Meteorology; Ozone; Wind; Ambient concentrations; Anthropogenic emissions; Continuous emission monitoring system; Meteorological condition; Meteorological factors; Meteorological parameters; Multiple linear regression models; Small scale industries; Pollution detection; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; ozone; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; emission; emission control; meteorology; multiple regression; ozone; pollutant; pollution monitoring; air pollutant; air quality; atmospheric pressure; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental temperature; epidemic; Guangxi; human; human impact (environment); humidity; meteorological phenomena; meteorology; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; precipitation; South China Sea; visibility; wind speed; air pollution; China; city; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; meteorology; Beihai; China; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Meteorology; Ozone; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095791919

Drawing on data from the German Mobility Panel (MOP), this paper analyzes the factors that affect the frequency of cold starts, approximated here by the number of car tours that a household takes over the course of a week. Based on fixed-effects panel estimations, we find a negative and statistically significant effect of fuel prices on the number of tours and, hence, cold starts. Using our estimates to explore the spatial implications arising from fuel price increases stipulated under Germany's Climate Programme 2030, we find substantial impacts on the number of avoided tours even for modest fuel price increases of 20 cents per liter, particularly in urban areas. This outcome lends support to using carbon pricing as a means to improve both global climate and local air quality, pointing to a co-benefit of climate policy. © 2021 The Author(s).

The difference in the reboiler specific heat duty at stripper pressures of 1.7 and 2.1 bar was minimal as similar amounts of water vapor were observed in the CO2 product stream at stripper outlet. Recycling of product CO2 increased the inlet CO2 concentration to the absorber from 14 to 16 vol% which enhanced mass transfer from the gas to the solvent resulting in about 5 % reduction in the energy of regeneration at the lower stripper pressure. The solvent circulation rate was reduced by about 30 % relative to previous 30 wt% MEA campaign for the CO2 target capture of 90 %.

Their unique properties already allow us to create many useful products in electronics, biomedicine, and other high-tech industries. However, the study of graphene and its derivatives is continuing. The mechanism of the formation of the graphene lattice and the state parameters of its individual atoms are still not fully understood. The reason for this is the fact that graphene itself cannot be obtained without laying carbon atoms on a surface with certain properties. However, in this case, the properties of graphene are substantially obscured by the properties of the surface itself. This study is devoted to the creation of a graphene model in the form of a lattice of hydrogen-like carbon atoms. In this case, we use a modification of the Brandt–Kitagawa approach with shielded ions that we proposed earlier. In the cold lattice approximation, this model assumes that the three valence atoms oriented along the bond lines belong to the ion shield. And only one valence electron determines the ground state of the lattice atom and the inhomogeneous angular distribution of its field. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","graphene lattice; ground state; hydrogen-like atom; inhomogeneous central field; self-consistent solution of the Schrodinger equation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104768825

In plants, oxalate oxidase is the most well-studied enzyme capable of degrading oxalate, but not all plants possess this activity. Recently, acyl-activating enzyme 3 (AAE3), encoding an oxalyl-CoA synthetase, was identified in Arabidopsis. This enzyme has been proposed to catalyze the first step in an alternative pathway of oxalate degradation. Since this initial discovery, this enzyme and proposed pathway have been found to be important to other plants and yeast as well. In this study, we identify, in Arabidopsis, an oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase (AtOXC) that is capable of catalyzing the second step in this proposed pathway of oxalate catabolism. This enzyme breaks down oxalyl-CoA, the product of AtAAE3, into formyl-CoA and CO2 . AtOXC:GFP localization suggested that this enzyme functions within the cytosol of the cell. An Atoxc knock-down mutant showed a reduction in the ability to degrade oxalate into CO2 . This reduction in AtOXC activity resulted in an increase in the accumulation of oxalate and the enzyme substrate, oxalyl-CoA. Size exclusion studies suggest that the enzyme functions as a dimer. Computer modeling of the AtOXC enzyme structure identified amino acids of predicted importance in co-factor binding and catalysis.

Using DNA metabarcoding datasets from a three-year-sampling (73 samples), we constructed the protistan plankton co-occurrence network of Lake Zurich, a model lake ecosystem subjected to climate change. Despite several documentations of dramatic lake warming in Lake Zurich, our study provides an unprecedented perspective by linking changes in biotic association patterns to climate stress. Water temperature belonged to the strongest environmental parameters splitting the data into two distinct seasonal networks (October–April; May–September). The expected ecological niche of phytoplankton, weakened through nutrient depletion because of permanent thermal stratification and through parasitic fungi, was occupied by the cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens and mixotrophic nanoflagellates. Instead of phytoplankton, bacteria and nanoflagellates were the main prey organisms associated with key predators (ciliates), which contrasts traditional views of biological associations in lake plankton. In a species extinction scenario, the warm season network emerged as more vulnerable than the cold season network, indicating a time-lagged effect of warmer winter temperatures on the communities. We conclude that climate stressors compromise lake ecosystem robustness and resilience through species replacement, richness differences, and succession as indicated by key network properties. © 2021 by the authors.

Such events are characterised as thresholds beyond which cereal yields significantly change. We apply a threshold model to district-level data collected in India over 1966–2011 and objectively identify thresholds, measured by the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, before estimating their yield effects, for rice, wheat, maize, millet, sorghum and barley. Heterogeneous, crop-specific thresholds are identified for all crops except wheat. Thresholds are identified at normal climatic conditions but have smaller negative marginal effects than those of thresholds identified at dry conditions. The extent to which agro-ecological conditions and irrigation influence the location of thresholds and the size of their marginal effects varies by crop. Thresholds identified at dry climatic conditions severely reduce yield yet are rarely crossed; those at normal conditions moderately affect yield but are frequently crossed. A threshold’s total impact on production is found to be inverse to the severity of its marginal effect. Severe-effect thresholds have been crossed with increasing frequency over time, contributing to growth in the size of total impacts.

Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russian Federation","Background: The extreme southwest of Australia is a biodiversity hotspot region that has a Mediterranean-type climate and numerous endemic plant and animal species, many of which remain to be properly delimited. We refine species limits in Anarthria, a Western Australian endemic genus characterised by the occurrence of the greatest number of plesiomorphic character states in the restiid clade of Poales. In contrast to many other groups of wind-pollinated Australian Poales, Anarthria was traditionally viewed as having well-established species limits. All six currently recognised species, which are conspicuous members of some Western Australian plant communities, were described in the first half of the 19th century. They are traditionally distinguished from each other mainly using quantitative characters. Methods: We examined extensive existing herbarium specimens and made new collections of Anarthria in nature. Scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy were used to study leaf micromorphology. Molecular diversity of Anarthria was examined using a plastid (trnL-F) and a low-copy nuclear marker (at103). This is the first study of species-level molecular diversity in the restiid clade using a nuclear marker. Results: Material historically classified as Anarthria gracilis R.Br. actually belongs to three distinct species, A. gracilis s.str., A. grandiflora Nees and A. dioica (Steud.) C.I. Fomichev, each of which forms a well-supported clade in phylogenetic analyses. Both segregate species were described in the first half of the 19th century but not recognised as such in subsequent taxonomic accounts. Anarthria dioica was first collected in 1826, then wrongly interpreted as a species of Juncus (Juncaceae) and described as Juncus dioicus. We provide a formal transfer of the name to Anarthria and for the first time report its clear and qualitative diagnostic characters: An extremely short leaf ligule and distinctive pattern of leaf epidermal micromorphology. A long ligule is present in A. gracilis s.str. and A. grandiflora. These species differ from each other in leaf lamina morphology and anatomy and have mostly non-overlapping distribution ranges. The narrower definition of species provides a basis for future phylogeographic analyses in Anarthria. Our study highlights a need for more extensive use of nuclear DNA markers in Restionaceae. The use of the low copy nuclear marker at103 allowed a clade comprising all three ligulate species of Anarthria to be recognised. The ligule character is used here for the first time in the taxonomy of Anarthria and merits special attention in studies of other restiids. In general, our study uncovered a superficially hidden but, in reality, conspicuous diversity in a common group of wind-pollinated plants in the southwest of Western Australia. © 2021 Fomichev et al.","Anarthria; Diagnostic characters; Leaf ligule; Leaf morphology; Micromorphology; Phylogeny; Poales; Restionaceae; South-western Australian biodiversity hotspot; Western Australia","Anarthria dioica; Anarthria gracilis; Anarthria grandiflora Nees; Anarthria humilis; Anarthria laevis; Anarthria polyphylla; Anarthria prolifera; Anarthria scabra; Article; biodiversity; cladistics; DNA extraction; DNA marker; gene amplification; gene sequence; geographic distribution; hotspot; Juncaceae; Juncus dioicus; leaf lamina; leaf ligule; leaf morphology; micromorphology; nonhuman; nuclear at 103 region; parsimony analysis; phylogeny; plant community; plastid; plastid trn L F; Poales; Restionaceae; scanning electron microscopy; wind pollination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102462198

We use constrained density functional theory (DFT) to emulate the creation of a localized hole on the halogen and follow the subsequent dynamics via time-dependent DFT. We find low-frequency CM modes (∼1 eV) that propagate across the molecule and study their dependence on length, bond order, and halogenation. We observe that the CM speed (∼4 Å/fs) is largely independent of molecule length, but is lower for triple-bonded versus double-bonded molecules. Additionally, as the halogen mass increases, the hole travels in a more particlelike manner as it moves across the molecule. These heuristics will be useful in identifying molecules and optimal CM detection methods for future experiments, especially for halogenated hydrocarbons which are promising targets for ionization-triggered CM. © 2021 American Physical Society.",,"Bond length; Calculations; Density functional theory; Halogenation; Heuristic methods; Hydrocarbons; Bonded molecule; Charge migration; Detection methods; First-principles calculation; Halogenated hydrocarbons; Localized holes; Molecular mode; Time-dependent DFT; Molecules",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104431680

Romania, in line with the Union’s objectives, resorted to the application of a system of environmental taxes and provided in the budgetary policy government expenditures for environmental protection. The aim of the research is to highlight the effects of these measures on the environment by analysing the short-run and long-run causal relationships between greenhouse gas emissions, green taxes and government expenditures on environmental protection. Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method and Granger causality tests were used to demonstrate the existence of these relationships and the intensity with which they manifest. Following the analysis, we identified a significant long-run influence of government spending on environmental protection on greenhouse gas emissions but also numerous short-run and long-run causal relationships between greenhouse gas emissions and green taxes, applied in Romania. The results of the research consider the impact of public expenses for environment protection, a variable not yet applied for Romania, on greenhouse gas emissions’ decrease, in correlation with environmental taxes per source of origin. © 2021 by the authors.

Nitrogen cycling and N2O production, reduction, and emissions could be amplified in carbonate karst aquifers because of their extensive global range, susceptibility to nitrogen contamination, and groundwater-surface water mixing that varies redox conditions of the aquifer. The magnitude of N2O cycling in karst aquifers is poorly known, however, and thus we sampled thirteen springs discharging from the karstic Upper Floridan Aquifer (UFA) to evaluate N2O cycling. The springs can be separated into three groups based on variations in subsurface residence times, differences in surface–groundwater interactions, and variable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. These springs are oxic to sub-oxic and have NO3− concentrations that range from &lt; 0.1 to 4.2 mg N-NO3−/L and DOC concentrations that range from &lt; 0.1 to 50 mg C/L. Maximum spring water N2O concentrations are 3.85 µg N-N2O/L or ~ 12 times greater than water equilibrated with atmospheric N2O. The highest N2O concentrations correspond with the lowest NO3− concentrations. Where recharge water has residence times of a few days, partial denitrification to N2O occurs, while complete denitrification to N2 is more prominent in springs with longer subsurface residence times. Springs with short residence times have groundwater emission factors greater than the global average of 0.0060, reflecting N2O production, whereas springs with residence times of months to years have groundwater emission factors less than the global average. These findings imply that N2O cycling in karst aquifers depends on DOC and DO concentrations in recharged surface water and subsequent time available for N processing in the subsurface. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Karst; Nitrogen; Nitrous oxide; Springs","Aquifers; Atmospheric chemistry; Biochemical oxygen demand; Denitrification; Dissolved oxygen; Global warming; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Landforms; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Ozone layer; Surface waters; Atmospheric nitrous oxide; Dissolved organic carbon; Dissolved oxygen concentrations; Groundwater interaction; Groundwater-surface waters; Reactive nitrogen species; Stratospheric ozone depletion; Upper floridan aquifers; Groundwater pollution; aquifer characterization; carbonate; denitrification; dissolved organic carbon; dissolved oxygen; karst hydrology; mixing; nitrate; nitrous oxide; redox conditions; spring water; Floridan Aquifer; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098970364

It is shown that such technologies have presently arrived at a crossroad in their development. Their future will be determined by the development prospects of coal energy as a whole. Coal still continues to play the most important role in the world energy. In recent years, external factors have become extremely negative for the development of coal energy. Among other fuels, coal produces the largest specific emissions of CO2 during its combustion, in view of which it may become the first victim of the unfolding energy decarbonization policy. Under such conditions, there is a need to diversify the coal utilization fields, primarily through manufacturing a wide range of chemical products with a high added value. This generates the need to develop the appropriate technologies, and, first of all, gasification technologies, the use of which opens the possibility of making almost the entire range of products from coal that are obtained from petroleum and natural gas. It has been determined that gasification technologies have already reached a high level of technical maturity, and a large number of gasifier designs have been proposed. It has been determined that the majority of operating coal gasification plants are presently used for manufacturing various chemical products, first of all, natural gas substitute (which is then forwarded to gas networks) and also methanol and ammonia. It is pointed out that only a few integrated gasification combined cycle plants have been implemented and planned for construction, which means that the private sector shows little interest in this technology. At the same time, such plants have quite a high potential for being used in low-carbon energy, of course, provided that the problem of disposing the captured CO2 is solved. It is shown that a large number of gasifier equipment manufacturers are available around the world.

However, the mechanistic understanding of their influence on soil N-processes is still poor. This paper aims to shed new light on how natural and NH4+-enriched chabazite zeolites alter short-term N-ammonification and nitrification rates with and without the use of nitrification inhibitor (DMPP). We employed the15 N pool dilution technique to determine short-term gross rates of ammonification and nitrification in a silty-clay soil amended with two typologies of chabazite-rich tuff: (1) at natural state and (2) enriched with NH4+-N from an animal slurry. Archaeal and bacterial amoA, nirS and nosZ genes, N2 O-N and CO2-C emissions were also evaluated. The results showed modest short-term effects of chabazite at natural state only on nitrate production rates, which was slightly delayed compared to the unamended soil. On the other hand, the addition of NH4+-enriched chabazite stimulated NH4+-N production, N2 O-N emissions, but reduced NO3−-N production and abundance of nirS-nosZ genes. DMPP efficiency in reducing nitrification rates was dependent on N addition but not affected by the two typologies of zeolites tested. The outcomes of this study indicated the good compatibility of both natural and NH4+-enriched chabazite zeolite with DMPP. In particular, the application of NH4+-enriched zeolites with DMPP is recommended to mitigate short-term N losses. © 2021 by the authors.

However, climate change may affect renewable power outputs by enhancing the weather variability and making extreme conditions more frequent. High temperature or clouds, for example, can lead to poorer photovoltaic (PV) power outputs. Here, we assess global changes in the frequency of warm and cloudy conditions that lead to very low PV power outputs. Using simulations from global climate models (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), we show that summer days with very low PV power outputs are expected to double in the Arabian Peninsula by mid-century but could be reduced by half in southern Europe over the same period, even under a moderate-emission scenario. Changes for winter, either enhancing or mitigating the PV power intermittency, are projected to be less striking, at least in low- and mid-latitude regions.

In addition, the spatial spillover effect of AANR on reducing air pollution is not only basically supported among the treated cities, but also partially established in the untreated cities neighboring the treated cities. Furthermore, there is a clear evidence that AANR has effectively broken the excessive dependence on the traditional “political tournament mechanism”, while the establishment of a new political promotion mechanism still has a long way to go.

Soil microbes play important roles in ecosystems and have been used as indicators of soil quality and health. However, microbial interactions in desert ecosystems remain poorly understood. In this study, we collected soil samples from 12 deserts in northern China, spanning four climate types representing distinct aridity gradients, to evaluate bacterial and eukaryotic co-occurrence networks, and analyze environmental factors determining microbial interactions and their relationships with these factors. At the regional scale, bacterial and eukaryotic interactions strengthened with increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP). They were also influenced by soil total phosphorus and the normalized difference vegetation index. At the local scale, although soil-, climate-, and plant-related factors significantly constrained bacterial and eukaryotic networks, their relative effects varied. Overall, eukaryotic communities formed smaller and less complex networks than bacterial communities. Both bacterial and eukaryotic networks were more complex in deserts with higher MAP, suggesting that they are more stable and play more important roles in biogeochemical cycling in these areas than in lower MAP deserts. Our results provide further evidence that altered precipitation gradient probably leads to unstable and vulnerable microbial communities. This study enhances our understanding of microbial community organization in desert ecosystems, while providing novel insights into soil health. These findings should prove valuable in the evaluation of land development and degradation processes. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","bacterial and eukaryotic interactions; community stability; desert soils; precipitation gradient; soil functions","Arid regions; Bacteria; Ecosystems; Landforms; Soils; Temperature measurement; Vegetation; Biogeochemical cycling; Co-occurrence networks; Environmental factors; Mean annual precipitation; Microbial communities; Microbial interactions; Normalized difference vegetation index; Precipitation gradients; Complex networks; biogeochemical cycle; desert soil; environmental degradation; microbial activity; microbial community; precipitation (chemistry); soil microorganism; soil quality; Bacteria (microorganisms); Eukaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097802968

Due to climate change and human activities, the inflow of Miyun Reservoir watershed (MRW) has been continuously reduced in the past 30 years, which has seriously affected the safety of Beijing’s water supply. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the mitigation measures based on the quantification of the integrated impacts of climate and land use change in MRW. The non-point source (NPS) model (soil and water assessment tool, SWAT) was used for the development of future climate scenarios which were derived from two regional climate models (RCMs) under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Three land use scenarios were generated by the land use model (conversion of land-use and its effects (CLUE-S)): (1) historical trend scenario, (2) ecological protection without consideration of spatial configuration scenario and (3) ecological protection scenario. Moreover, the reduction of sediment and nutrients under three future land use patterns in future climate scenarios was evaluated. The results showed that an appropriate land use change project led to the desired reduction effect on sediment and nutrients output under future climate scenarios. The average reduction rates of sediment, total nitrogen and total phosphorus were 11.4%, 6.3% and 7.4%, respectively. The ecological protection scenario considering spatial configuration showed the best reduction effect on sediment, total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Therefore, the addition of region-specific preference variables as part of land use change provides better pollutant control effects. Overall, this research provides technical support to protect the safety of Beijing’s drinking water and future management of non-point source pollution in MRW. © 2021 by the authors.

China has experienced a large-scale vegetation cover change in recent years. We summarized the literature of vegetation cover change and revealed how large-scale anthropogenic activities influence vegetation cover change in China. Afforestation and intensification of cropland played a key role in large-scale greening. Urbanization showed a “U” shape to influence vegetation cover change. Mining and reclamation, land abandonment and land consolidation, and regional natural protection all had a unique influence on the change of vegetation cover. Indeed, the large-scale vegetation cover change was caused by interaction of anthropogenic factors and part human-driven climate change. Anthropogenic factors influenced climate change to indirectly alter the condition of plant growth. Interaction between climate change and human activities influence on vegetation cover still needs to be further investigated in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the anaerobic digestion of VFAs may not be stable during long-term operation under a short hydraulic retention time. In this study, conductive carbon cloth was supplemented to investigate the impacts on the anaerobic digestion of VFAs in wastewater sourced from dark fermentation. The results demonstrated that the failure of anaerobic digestion could be avoided when carbon cloth was supplemented. In the stable stage, the methane production rate with carbon cloth supplementation was improved by 200–260%, and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was significantly enhanced compared with that in the control without carbon cloth. The relative abundance of potential exoelectrogens on the carbon cloth was increased by up to 8-fold compared with that in the suspension.

It analyses their historical performance in terms of energy system and greenhouse gas emissions indicators. In cases where policies aim to reduce future emissions, their target performance levels are assessed. The review centres on the sectors of electricity generation, passenger vehicles, freight transport, forestry, industry, buildings, agriculture, and oil and gas production. Most focus countries have implemented successful policies for renewable energy, fuel efficiency, electrification of passenger vehicles, and forestry. For other sectors, information is limited or very heterogeneous (e.g. buildings, appliances, agriculture) or there are few comprehensive policies in place (e.g. industry). The article further presents an explorative emissions scenario developed under the assumption that all countries will replicate both the observed trends in sector-level indicators and the trends that policies for future emissions reductions aspire to achieve. It shows that the global replication of sector progress would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 by about 20% compared to a current policies scenario. All countries analysed would overachieve the emissions reduction targets in their post-2020 climate targets. However, the resulting reduction in global emissions by 2030 would still not be sufficient to keep the world on track for a global cost-effective pathway that keeps temperature increase below 2°C. The findings of this study emphasise the need for transformative policies to keep the Paris Agreement temperature limit within reach. © 2020 The Authors","Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Nationally determined contributions; Policy review; Replication of progress; Sector climate policy; Sector progress","Agricultural robots; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Forestry; Freight transportation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum industry; Petroleum transportation; Temperature; Timber; Climate change mitigation; Electricity generation; Emissions reduction; Emissions scenarios; Greenhouse gas emissions indicators; Historical performance; Oil and gas production; Temperature increase; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098674881

Six river sections (headwaters, middle reach, and four large river sections with increasing salinity) and 18 sites were selected in the Mondego river (Central Portugal). Hypotheses of the expected variations were drawn, based on theory (e.g. River Continuum Concept—RCC) and previous studies. Abiotic conditions were strongly associated with macroinvertebrate communities’ taxonomic composition, but the relationship with functional parameters was different than the predicted one. Decomposition rates were similar from headwaters to the first large river sections (not expected) but increased in the estuarine sections. The high rates of decomposition were associated with the low salinity and especially with the high densities of the shredder Gammarus sp. Biofilm growth rate peaked in intermediate sections and was lower in the headwaters and in the estuary (not expected). The lower algae productivity in the estuary was not compensated by the heterotrophic component of the biofilm. The use of multiple biological traits indicated an unexpected higher functional similarity among the upper river sections, and differences within large river sections (not evident with taxonomic composition). These results show contradictions to widely accepted river concepts, such as the RCC, and highlight the importance of management practices adjusted to each river section to keep the ecosystem functioning. They also increased the knowledge on the transition zone between fresh and estuarine water which is important in the context of mitigation of climate change effects, considering the expected intrusion of saline water upstream. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Biofilm growth; Litter decomposition; Primary production; Traits","abiotic factor; climate change; community response; estuarine environment; estuarine front; growth rate; headwater; invertebrate; macroinvertebrate; transition zone; Portugal; Gammarus sp.; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099369041

Although the Amazon forest’s role in climate regulation often takes center stage in arguments for containing deforestation, it is biodiversity that has justified the region’s existing protected areas. The will to take effective measures to contain forest loss derives largely from the intrinsic or existence value of this diversity, rather than from its utilitarian value. This applies both at the national level in Amazonian countries such as Brazil and to international actors such as governments, companies, non-governmental organizations and individuals. The rapidly deteriorating environmental situation in Amazonia shows the inadequacy of the arguments that have been used to justify actions to reverse this deterioration.

To estimate GHGs from the land-use systems, we measured fluxes (positive/negative emissions per unit of time) of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) from the cropping and adjacent non-cropping systems in Wakiso District, Uganda. The study comprised of 9 treatments with 2 inter-cropping systems (banana-coffee and maize-beans), 4 sole-cropped systems (banana, maize, beans, and sweet potato), and 3 non-cropping systems (fallow lands, pasture lands, and grasslands). Four management practices: mulching with no-tillage (mulched-NT); non-mulching with reduced-tillage (non-mulched-RT); non-mulching with deep-tillage (non-mulched-DT); compositing with reduced-tillage (compost-RT) were embedded in the cropping systems. The study also assessed the effect of the cropping systems and their management practices on crop yields. The GHG fluxes were monitored using the static chamber technique and analysed using a gas chromatography (G.C.). The results showed that all the land-use systems were sources of CO2 flux with sole-cropped sweet potato under non-mulched-DT (148.12 ± 3.4 μg C m−2 h−1) as the most substantial source, and the grasslands (33.03 ± 1.7 μg C m−2 h−1) as the weakest source. Similarly, all the land-use systems were sources of N2O flux with sole-cropped beans under non-mulched-RT (14.21 ± 0.4 μg N m−2 h−1) as the strongest source, and grasslands (3.43 ± 0.4 μg N m−2 h−1) as the weakest source. The management practices were sinks (any system that absorbs more GHGs than it releases) of CH4 except mulched-NT in the maize-beans intercrop, sole-cropped beans, and sole-cropped maize. The sole-cropped sweet potato under mulched-RT (0.3 ± 0.01 μg C m−2 h−1) was the strongest source of CH4, while the grasslands (−0.67 ± 0.01 μg C m−2 h−1) were the strongest sink. The intercropped systems significantly reduced GHG fluxes and had a yield advantage relative to the sole-cropped systems. Our results suggested that intercropping in central Uganda could be a more sustainable and eco-friendly approach concerning GHG fluxes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Crop yields; Cropping systems; Methane; Mitigation measures; Nitrous oxide; Non-cropping systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098146240

Long-term observed chickpea-mungbean system (CMS) phenological changes were used for the determination of the relationship between crop practices, climate warming and phenology for the making strategies for CMS to minimize negative climate change impacts. Observed thermal trend from sowing to maturity was ranging from 0.82 to 1.15 °C decade−1 for chickpea and 0.64 to 0.97 °C decade−1 for mungbean during 1980–2018. Observed chickpea phenology stages was earlier for mean value of 7.04 (sowing; S), 6.76 (emergence; E), 4.31 (anthesis; A), 2.15 (maturity; M) days decade−1, whereas chickpea phases were decreased averagely 2.73 (S–A), 2.16 (A–M), 4.89 (S–M) days decade−1. Mungbean, ‘S’ 6.24, ‘E’ 5.97, ‘A’ 3.76, and ‘M’ 2.01 days decade−1 were occurred earlier. Period of mungbean phenology phases were lessened with averaged 2.45 (S–A), 1.76 (S–M) and 4.23 (A–M) days decade−1, respectively. Phenological stages and phases of both crops chickpea and mungbean correlated negatively with rising temperatures at all sites studied. By using CROPGRO-Chickpea and CROPGRO-Legume models for usual chickpea and mungbean cultivars at the sites for 38 years duration indicated that model predicted phenology stages were accelerated with thermal trend more as compared with observed stages. This showed that, during last decades, growing newly evolved cultivars of pulses having more thermal time requirement have significantly offset the increased temperature induced changes in chickpea (33%) and mungbean (20%) phenology. Therefore, for the mitigation of climate warming influences, newly evolved cultivars for CMS must be familiarized that need greater demand for degree days and having higher tolerance to temperature. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Climate warming trends; CROPGRO-Chickpea and CROPGRO-Legume models; Phenological phases and stages",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089750961

Previously, there have been no comparative reviews assessing the risk of OI due to extreme heat within a wide range of global climate zones. The present review therefore aims to summarise the existing epidemiological evidence on the impact of extreme heat (hot temperatures and heatwaves (HW)) on OI in different climate zones and to assess the individual risk factors associated with workers and workplace that contribute to heat-associated OI risks. Methods: A systematic review of published peer-reviewed articles that assessed the effects of extreme heat on OI among non-military workers was undertaken using three databases (PubMed, Embase and Scopus) without temporal or geographical limits from database inception until July 2020. Extreme heat exposure was assessed in terms of hot temperatures and HW periods. For hot temperatures, the effect estimates were converted to relative risks (RR) associated with 1 °C increase in temperature above reference values, while for HW, effect estimates were RR comparing heatwave with non-heatwave periods. The patterns of heat associated OI risk were investigated in different climate zones (according to Köppen Geiger classification) based on the study locations and were estimated using random-effects meta-analysis models. Subgroup analyses according to workers’ characteristics (e.g. gender, age group, experience), nature of work (e.g. physical demands, location of work i.e. indoor/outdoor) and workplace characteristics (e.g. industries, business size) were also conducted. Results: A total of 24 studies published between 2005 and 2020 were included in the review. Among these, 22 studies met the eligibility criteria, representing almost 22 million OI across six countries (Australia, Canada, China, Italy, Spain, and USA) and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results suggested that the overall risk of OI increased by 1% (RR 1.010, 95% CI: 1.009–1.011) for 1 °C increase in temperature above reference values and 17.4% (RR 1.174, 95% CI: 1.057–1.291) during HW. Among different climate zones, the highest risk of OI during hot temperatures was identified in Humid Subtropical Climates (RR 1.017, 95% CI: 1.014–1.020) followed by Oceanic (RR 1.010, 95% CI: 1.008–1.012) and Hot Mediterranean Climates (RR 1.009, 95% CI: 1.008–1.011). Similarly, Oceanic (RR 1.218, 95% CI: 1.093–1.343) and Humid Subtropical Climates (RR 1.213, 95% CI: 0.995–1.431) had the highest risk of OI during HW periods. No studies assessing the risk of OI in Tropical regions were found. The effects of hot temperatures on the risk of OI were acute with a lag effect of 1–2 days in all climate zones. Young workers (age < 35 years), male workers and workers in agriculture, forestry or fishing, construction and manufacturing industries were at high risk of OI during hot temperatures. Further young workers (age < 35 years), male workers and those working in electricity, gas and water and manufacturing industries were found to be at high risk of OI during HW. Conclusions: This review strengthens the evidence on the risk of heat-associated OI in different climate zones. The risk of OI associated with extreme heat is not evenly distributed and is dependent on underlying climatic conditions, workers’ attributes, the nature of work and workplace characteristics. The differences in the risk of OI across different climate zones and worker subgroups warrant further investigation along with the development of climate and work-specific intervention strategies. © 2021","Climate zones; Heatwaves; Hot temperatures; Occupation injuries","Agricultural robots; Climate models; Forestry; Health risks; Manufacture; Random processes; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Tropics; Climatic conditions; Eligibility criterion; Intervention strategy; Manufacturing industries; Mediterranean climates; Occupational injury; Subtropical climates; Systematic Review; Occupational risks; climate effect; epidemiology; extreme event; health geography; health risk; heat wave; injury; meta-analysis; occupational exposure; risk assessment; risk factor; agriculture; Australia; building industry; Canada; China; classification; climate; data base; environmental temperature; extreme hot weather; fishing; forestry; gender; geography; groups by age; heat wave; high risk population; high temperature; human; Italy; manufacturing industry; occupational accident; personal experience; priority journal; Review; risk factor; Spain; systematic review; United States; workplace; adult; heat; male; meta analysis; occupational exposure; Australia; Canada; China; Italy; Spain; United States; Scopus; Adult; Australia; Canada; China; Extreme Heat; Hot Temperature; Humans; Italy; Male; Occupational Exposure; Occupational Injuries; Spain",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099446870

In order to meet these requirements, aircraft engines should work very close to their operating limits. Therefore, the importance of advanced control strategies to satisfy all engine control modes simultaneously while protecting them from malfunctions and physical damages is being more crucial these days. In the last three decades, fuzzy controllers (FCs) have been proposed as a high potential solution for performance improvement of the next generation of aircraft engines. Based on an analytic review, this paper divides the trend of FCs design into two main lines including pure FCs (PFC) and min–max FCs (MMFC). These two main architectures are then designed, implemented on hardware, and applied in a case study to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each structure. The analysis of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation results shows that the pure FC structure would be a high potential candidate for maneuverability and response time indices improvement (e.g., military applications); while min–max FC architecture has a great potential for future civil aero-engines where the fuel consumption and steady-state responses are more important. The simulation results are also compared with those of industrial min–max controllers to confirm the feasibility and reliability of the fuzzy controllers for real-world application.

In the present review, latest progresses were summarized to gain insights on this issue. LDH-derived catalysts can be prepared via various methods and possess favorable characteristics of reversible topotactic transformation for further development. Compared to conventional catalysts, they show specific advantages in specific surface area, metal element dispersion and active site distribution. Despite of distinguished LDH-derived catalysts applied in CO2 reduction reactions to methane, methanol, hydrocarbons, etc., state-of-art LDH-derived catalysts consisted of catalyst-adsorbent synergistic system are recently constructed to employ the surface CO2 adsorption boundary layer to increase the CO2 partial pressure near active sites for hydrogenation. The overall catalytic performance is thus promoted dramatically. Accordingly, the strategy of adsorption-enhanced hydrogenation is expected to facilitate the industrialization of CO2 hydrogenation and is instructive for catalyst design in future. © 2020 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry","adsorption-enhanced hydrogenation; catalytic conversion; CO2 utilization; LDH-derived catalysts","Adsorption; Boundary layers; Carbon dioxide; Hydrogenation; Catalytic conversion; Catalytic performance; CO2 hydrogenation; Conventional catalyst; Layered double hydroxides; Synergistic systems; Topotactic transformation; Value-added chemicals; Catalyst activity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099632020

Unfortunately, existing catalysts suffer from low faradic efficiency of formate production at high current density. Here, we report a general strategy for preparing the Bi2O2CO3 nanosheet (BOC-NS) with abundant oxygen vacancies through in situ electrically driven conversion of the BiPO4 precursor. The converted BOC-NS displays high faradic efficiency of formate (FEHCOO−) (∼100%) over a wide potential region in an H-type cell and achieves a formate partial current density of −930 mA cm−2 with a FEHCOO− of 93% at −1.55 VRHE in a flow cell. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the BOC-NS surface with abundant oxygen vacancies benefit formate production, which stems from fast reaction kinetics toward the formation of ∗OCHO intermediate on defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets.

This is especially true for China, which relies heavily on coal-fired power plants. In China, CCS could play an important role in removing CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants and establishing low-carbon cities. Clarifying the emissions reduction potential of cities using CO2 geological storage will help to identify site suitable for carrying out CCS projects in a technically and economically feasible way. In this paper, we assessed CO2 storage capacity in three geological structures between 800 to 3000 m underground: (1) the nationwide on-shore CO2 storage capacity of 705 oil fields in terms of both depleted oil reservoirs (DOR) and enhanced oil recovery (EOR); (2) 754 gas fields in terms of both depleted gas reservoirs (DGR) and enhanced gas recovery (EGR); (3) China's deep saline aquifers (DSA), including 17 large basins ; and (4) the CO2 emissions of coal-fired plants of 300 MW and over. After completing all of these assessments, this paper presents an emissions reduction potential estimate. The results show that: 1) the total CO2 storage capacity of DOR, EOR, DGR, EGR and DSA is 21,287 Mt, 5191 Mt, 15,321 Mt, 9018 Mt and 1,004,319 Mt, respectively; 2) 76 cities can sequester their existing CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants in situ within their administrative boundaries for over 10 years, and their contribution is 634.43 Mt per year. 3) Ordos City has priority to carry out CO2 geological storage for coal-fired power plants due to the volume of its annual captured CO2 (52.13 Mt), and it can operate for about 123 years if its CO2 emissions remain unchanged. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage; City emission reduction; CO2 storage capacity; Emissions reduction potential","Aquifers; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal storage; Emission control; Enhanced recovery; Gas emissions; Global warming; Hydrogeology; Metal recovery; Mining; Oil fields; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Underground gas storage; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Co2 geological storages; Coal-fired power plant; Depleted gas reservoir; Depleted oil reservoirs; Enhanced gas recoveries; Enhanced oil recovery; Geological structures; Fossil fuel power plants; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; coal-fired power plant; emission control; enhanced oil recovery; structural geology; underground storage; waste management; China; Ordos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101323388

The n-alkanes concentrations were quite similar at both sites (26-29 ng/m3) and mainly explained by anthropogenic emissions rather than natural ones. The concentrations of total Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) were nearly three times higher at Zouk Mikael (2.56 ng/m3) compared to Fiaa (0.95 ng/m3), especially for indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene linked to the presence of the power plant. A characteristic indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene/(indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene + benzo[g,h,i]perylene) ratio in the range 0.8-1.0 was determined for heavy fuel oil combustion from the power plant. Fatty acids and hopanes were also investigated and were assigned to cooking activities and vehicular emissions respectively. Phthalates were identified for the first time in Lebanon with high concentrations at Zouk and Fiaa (106.88 and 97.68 ng/m3 respectively). Moreover, the biogenic secondary aerosols revealed higher concentrations in summer. The total terpene concentration varied between 131 ng/m3 at Zouk Mikael in winter to 469 ng/m3 at Fiaa in summer. Additionnally, the concentrations of the dicarboxylic acids especially for adipic and phthalic acids were more influenced by anthropogenic sources.The analysis of molecular markers and diagnostic ratios indicated that the sites were strongly affected by anthropogenic sources such as waste open burning, diesel private generators, cooking activities, road transport, power plant, and industrial emissions. Moreover, results showed different pattern during winter and summer seasons.

Although an important species, as its use as a fertilizer sustains human living, ammonia has major consequences for both humans and the environment because of its reactive gas-phase chemistry that makes it easily convertible to particles. Despite its pronounced importance, ammonia emissions are highly uncertain in most emission inventories. However, the great development of satellite remote sensing nowadays provides the opportunity for more targeted research on constraining ammonia emissions. Here, we used satellite measurements to calculate global ammonia emissions over the period 2008 2017. Then, the calculated ammonia emissions were fed to a chemistry transport model, and ammonia concentrations were simulated for the period 2008 2017. The simulated concentrations of ammonia were compared with ground measurements from Europe, North America and Southeastern Asia, as well as with satellite measurements. The satellite-constrained ammonia emissions represent global concentrations more accurately than state-of-theart emissions. Calculated fluxes in the North China Plain were seen to be more increased after 2015, which is not due to emission changes but due to changes in sulfate emissions that resulted in less ammonia neutralization and hence in larger atmospheric loads. Emissions over Europe were also twice as much as those in traditional datasets with dominant sources being industrial and agricultural applications. Four hot-spot regions of high ammonia emissions were seen in North America, which are characterized by high agricultural activity, such as animal breeding, animal farms and agricultural practices. South America is dominated by ammonia emissions from biomass burning, which causes a strong seasonality. In Southeastern Asia, ammonia emissions from fertilizer plants in China, Pakistan, India and Indonesia are the most important, while a strong seasonality was observed with a spring and late summer peak due to rice and wheat cultivation. Measurements of ammonia surface concentrations were better reproduced with satellite-constrained emissions, such as measurements from CrIS (Cross-track Infrared Sounder). © 2021 EDP Sciences.

Due to the negative impact of peat use on the carbon footprint of ecosystems and the landscape, demand for peat substitutes is increasing. The objective of the substrate producers is to use regional, ecologically beneficial substrates that can be achieved through hydrothermal conversion by providing the process of converting biomass into peat-like properties. This method was investigated with materials originating from landscape conservation as starting material with the aim of using the generated peat substitute in culture experiments. The hydrothermal carbonization of the biomass from extensive grassland was first carried out in preliminary experiments on a laboratory scale by varying the temperature and holding time. Hydrothermally carbonized plant residues (hydrochar) were obtained on the basis of three different temperatures (150, 170, 190 C) and their chemical properties were analyzed. In the study, three different mixtures of a commercial growing medium with addition of 10, 20 and 30% v v-1 of hydrochar were examined. The substrate chemical properties of the hydrochar mixtures differed only slightly. The hydrochar mixtures, a pure peat substrate and a peat substrate mixed with wood fibers, were used for substrate hydraulic, chemical and phytotoxic experiments. In addition, extensive cultivation and storage experiments of the described admixtures of the various varieties produced with Chinese cabbage, impatiens and daisies were carried out. Comparable plant growth could be observed for some of the tested qualities, but fungal and odor problems leave room for improvement, especially in terms of post-processing. The relationship between the growth of plants and soil chemical properties have been studied and presented. It was found that the chemical analyzes showed no dominant influence on the growth behavior. Presumably, the hydrothermally carbonized material fixed the added nitrogen. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science.

This study focused on describing air quality during the initial phase of the Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic (since there were fewer anthropogenic activities) in 10 Chinese mega-cities. Using the independent t-test, the means of air quality index (AQI) scores and individual air pollutants concentration during the outbreak were compared with the means before the outbreak. Cohen’s d was estimated to quantify how much difference was observed. Based on the AQI score, the air quality in these 10 cities ranged from excellent (Shenzhen) to light pollution (Xi’an) with 44.8 µg m−3 and 119.7 µg m−3, respectively. In comparison to the 2019 air quality, Guangzhou and Wuhan noted major differences in air quality during the outbreak. Indicators of traffic pollution, particularly NO2, were significantly lower during the outbreak in all cities. Particulate matter pollution varied, with some cities observing lower concentrations and other higher concentrations during the outbreak. There was a significant decrease in air pollution levels during the outbreak. More researchers should observe changes in air quality during peculiar or major events. Implementation of stringent regulation on vehicle use should be considered in mega-cities.

The EU supports the construction of an effective multilateral order, able to guarantee the provision of global common goods such as a clean and healthy environment. In this context, the present chapter explores how the eventual US retirement from the Paris Agreement and intensifying US-China tensions would affect the international climate change regime, American and EU cooperation on climate change with China and the prospects for a two-pronged EU-China leadership of the international climate change regime on the basis of their enhanced climate change cooperation and domestic developments in China under the Xi leadership. The chapter concludes that the EU should welcome any help it may find both in the United States and China to shape an ambitious interpretation of the Paris rulebook that will govern the international climate regime for the foreseeable future. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Mario Esteban and Lara Lázaro Touza.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104723170

This problem can be somehow mitigated by finding applications for these unusable materials in engineering. For instance, Scrap Tire can be executed as lightweight materials for backfill in geotechnical engineering projects. The Scrap Tire reuse in Sand-Tire Mixtures can effectively address growing environmental concerns and, at the same time, provide solutions for geotechnical problems associated with the low shear strength of the soil which fundamentally is determined as the main characteristics of Calcareous (or Carbonate) soils. In order to deeply understand the mechanical behavior of Sand-Tire Mixtures, a series of Consolidated Drained Triaxial Test were conducted in this study employing specimens with two different relative densities (i.e. 30% and 60%) under the specific confining pressures (i.e.100, 350, and 600 kN/m2). The results revealed that by adding 10% Scrap Tire into the Sand-Tire Mixtures, the loose specimen’s shear strength increases from 6 to 14% in comparison to pure sand. Furthermore, the particle breakage factor of the mixtures is considerably less than that of pure specimens. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Calcareous sand; Particle breakage; Relative density; Tire chips; Triaxial test","Geotechnical engineering; Mixtures; Sand; Shear strength; Confining pressures; Consolidated drained; Environmental concerns; Environmental problems; Geotechnical problems; Lightweight materials; Mechanical behavior; Number of vehicles; Tires; backfill; calcareous soil; consolidation; shear strength; soil mechanics; tire; triaxial test",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094194962

To this end, special attention should be paid to this region if the African continent’s GHG mitigation targets are to be achieved. An extended decomposition approach was combined with the Tapio method to explore the decoupling of CO2 emissions from industrial growth in North African countries over the period of 1990–2016. The effects of five factors were assessed in the decoupling and the study took into account all fossil fuels used in the industrial sector of this region. Unlike Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, and Algeria, this study did not consider Libya because of the unavailability of data. Meanwhile, the results showed that: (i) low decoupling was achieved in Tunisia, compared with Morocco and Egypt, where significant decoupling occurred significantly over the study period. (ii) Due to the slowdown in industrial growth, the decoupling analysis did not show satisfactory results in the case of Algeria. (iii) Scale effects contributed to promoting decoupling only in Algeria, while the energy intensity effect played a negative role in decoupling only in Tunisia. (iv) The energy structure effect played an important role in decoupling in Tunisia and Egypt, while the economic structural effect favored decoupling in Tunisia and Morocco alone. An energy policy conducive to the use of more renewable energy is needed to promote decoupling in North African countries. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO2 emission; Decoupling; Economic growth; Energy; Industry; North Africa","carbon emission; emission inventory; energy intensity; environmental economics; fossil fuel; growth rate; industrial development; industrial emission; Algeria; Egypt; Morocco; Tunisia; carbon; carbon dioxide; Algeria; economic development; Egypt; Morocco; Tunisia; Algeria; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Egypt; Morocco; Tunisia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096307003

Utilizing a unique lithography approach based on direct femtosecond laser processing, a fast and easy technique for modification of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) optoelectronic properties through localized two-photon oxidation is developed. It results in a novel approach of quasimetallic to semiconducting nanotube conversion so that metal/semiconductor planar junction is formed via local laser patterning. The fabricated planar junction in the field-effect transistors based on individual SWCNT drastically increases the photoresponse of such devices. The broadband photoresponsivity of the two-photon oxidized structures reaches the value of 2 × 107 A W−1 per single SWCNT at 1 V bias voltage. The SWCNT-based transistors with induced metal/semiconductor planar junction can be applied to detect extremely small light intensities with high spatial resolution in photovoltaics, integrated circuits, and telecommunication applications. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","carbon nanotubes; femtosecond lasers; photodetectors; photovoltaics; two-photon absorption","Femtosecond lasers; Field effect transistors; Nanotubes; Oxidation; Photons; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN); Carbon nano-materials; Femtosecond laser processing; High spatial resolution; Nanometer scale devices; Optoelectronic properties; Semi-conducting nanotubes; Singlewalled carbon nanotube (SWCNT); Telecommunication applications; Semiconductor junctions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099758202

These fluxes inform our understanding of ecosystem function, are an important constraint on parameterization of terrestrial biosphere models, are necessary to understand the response of plants to global environmental change, and are integral to efforts to improve crop production. Collection of these data using gas analyzers can be both technically challenging and time consuming, and individual studies generally focus on a small range of species, restricted time periods, or limited geographic regions. The high value of these data is exemplified by the many publications that reuse and synthesize gas exchange data, however the lack of metadata and data reporting conventions make full and efficient use of these data difficult. Here we propose a reporting format for leaf-level gas exchange data and metadata to provide guidance to data contributors on how to store data in repositories to maximize their discoverability, facilitate their efficient reuse, and add value to individual datasets. For data users, the reporting format will better allow data repositories to optimize data search and extraction, and more readily integrate similar data into harmonized synthesis products. The reporting format specifies data table variable naming and unit conventions, as well as metadata characterizing experimental conditions and protocols. For common data types that were the focus of this initial version of the reporting format, i.e., survey measurements, dark respiration, carbon dioxide and light response curves, and parameters derived from those measurements, we took a further step of defining required additional data and metadata that would maximize the potential reuse of those data types. To aid data contributors and the development of data ingest tools by data repositories we provided a translation table comparing the outputs of common gas exchange instruments. Extensive consultation with data collectors, data users, instrument manufacturers, and data scientists was undertaken in order to ensure that the reporting format met community needs. The reporting format presented here is intended to form a foundation for future development that will incorporate additional data types and variables as gas exchange systems and measurement approaches advance in the future. The reporting format is published in the U.S. Department of Energy's ESS-DIVE data repository, with documentation and future development efforts being maintained in a version control system. © 2021 The Authors","Carbon dioxide; Data reporting format; Data standard; Irradiance; Metadata; Photosynthesis","biosphere; carbon dioxide; control system; data set; detection method; ecosystem function; environmental change; experimental study; gas exchange; geographical region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100076204

The phylogenetic and functional diversity of these consortia are not fully understood, and it is not clear which lineages perform iron reduction and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Here, we investigated microbial communities from both natural Lake Kinneret iron-rich methanic sediments (20 cm depth) and ironamended slurry incubations from this zone using metagenomics, focusing on functions associated with iron reduction and methane cycling. Analyses of the phylogenetic and functional diversity indicate that consortia of archaea (mainly Bathyarchaeia, Methanomicrobia, Thermoplasmata, and Thermococci) and bacteria (mainly Chloroflexi (Chloroflexota), Nitrospirae (Nitrospirota), and Proteobacteria) perform key metabolic reactions such as amino acid uptake and dissimilation, organic matter fermentation, and methanogenesis. The Deltaproteobacteria, especially Desulfuromondales (Desulfuromonadota), have the potential to transfer electrons extracellularly either to iron mineral particles or to microbial syntrophs, including methanogens. This is likely via transmembrane cytochromes, outer-membrane hexaheme c-Type cytochrome (OmcS) in particular, or pilin monomers (PilA), all of which were attributed to this lineage. Bona fide anaerobic oxidizers of methane (ANME) and denitrifying methanotrophs Methylomirabilia (NC10) may mediate AOM in these methanogenic sediments; however we also consider the role of methanogens in active AOM or back flux of methanogenesis. Putative aerobes, such as methaneoxidizing bacteria Methylomonas and their methylotrophic syntrophs Methylotenera, are found among the anaerobic lineages in Lake Kinneret iron-Amended slurries and are also involved in the oxidation of methane or its intermediates, as suggested previously. We propose a reaction model for the metabolic interactions in these sediments, linking the potential players that interact via intricate metabolic tradeoffs and direct electron transfer between species. Our results highlight the metabolic complexity of microbial communities in an energy-limited environment, where aerobe and anaerobe communities may co-exist and facilitate AOM as one strategy for survival. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

These technologies however require several metals that have limited availability, produced as companion metals in a small number of countries and classified as hazardous, and their production is associated with significant energy, water, and CO2 emissions. This paper discusses material-energy-water-carbon nexus impacts on the sustainability of lighting technologies and provides comprehensive assessment of their materials inflows, outflows, and stocks and associated energy, water, and CO2 emissions using a dynamic material flow-stock model and several scenarios for regional buildings' floor area and lighting demands; lighting technologies' market share and luminous efficacy; and energy, water, and emissions intensities. The highest demand for metals compared to current production or reserves is expected for Ga, Ge, Y, and Ag. The highest energy, emissions, and water demands are associated with Al, Cu, and Y. Although increasing LED technology market share increases cumulative energy, emissions, and water (EEW), increasing technologies' luminous efficacy reduces EEW by 31% and increasing lifetime reduces EEW by 37%. Changes in EEW intensities reduced energy by 14%, emissions by 26%, and water by 2%.

In this work, with objectives based on the minimization of two optimization features, namely loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and cost of energy (COE), multi-objective optimization of a grid-connected PV/wind turbine framework was implemented in the Faculty of Engineering in Gharyan, Libya, with the aim of providing adequate electricity, while optimizing the system’s renewable energy fraction (REF) was the third objective. This research also aimed to estimate the resulting amount of power produced by the hybrid system and mathematical models were submitted. The results showed the share of the total energy supplying the electricity demand for each part of the network. This study subsequently explored the interrelationship of the grid and the proposed hybrid system in relation to the capacity of the network to sell or obtain electricity from the hybrid system. In addition, multi-objective bat algorithm (MOBA) findings were divided into three dominant regions: the first region was the economically optimal solution (lowest COE), the second region was the conceptual perspective of utilizing renewable energies (highest REF), and the final region was the optimal solution with optimal environmental effects (lowest GHG emissions). © 2021, The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.","Cost of energy; GHG emission; Grid-connected; Multi-objective; PV; Renewable energy fraction","Cost engineering; Electric power transmission networks; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Optimal systems; Ecological effect; Electricity demands; Grid-connected PV; Loss of power supply probability; Optimal solutions; Optimization features; Renewable energies; Renewable energy fractions; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099106854

In this context, a solution should be produced by integrating the concepts and principles of sustainability and ecology into all components of the city. Within the scope of the study, urban green areas, one of the landscape components that have an active role in ensuring sustainability in urban areas of Tekirdag, have been investigated. Regular visits were made to these areas and examinations were made, the plant inventory was prepared and the suitability for use and adaptation of these plants were evaluated. By this means, the current conditions of open green areas were determined in terms of ensuring sustainability in urban ecosystems, their deficiencies were determined and recommendations were made. Plant density and species diversity are very low in most of the gardens examined for this research. Besides, it was determined that the design principles were not taken into consideration in the use of plant material and that they were planted randomly. It was determined that the compositions that were created for partially aesthetic purposes were not brought together to emphasize the visual values of the plants and there was confusion. Considering the adaptation status to the field, it is seen that plants suitable for Tekirdag climate and ecological conditions are mostly preferred. However, it has been observed that there are problems in the adaptation of the some taxa to the climate of the city, which is exposed to intense winds, as they need to be planted in sheltered places. © 2021 Parlar Scientific Publications.

Low-temperature district heating is a key technology for energy-efficient urban heat supply as it supports an efficient utilization of low-grade waste-heat and renewable heat sources. The low operating temperature for such grids facilitates the integration of seasonal thermal energy storage, enabling a high degree of operational flexibility in the utilization of both uncontrollable and controllable heat sources. Yet, an inherent challenge of optimizing the operation of low-temperature district heating networks and its flexibility is the underlying uncertainty in heat demand. We develop a new stochastic model to minimize the total operational cost of district heating networks with local waste heat utilization, seasonal storage and uncertain demand. We consider in particular how demand side management and seasonal storage can improve the operational flexibility and thereby reduce costs. We analyze different set-ups of a local low-temperature district heating network under development in a new residential area in Trondheim, Norway. We find up to 37% reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, 29% generation reduction in peak hours, and 10% lower operational costs.

Gas flaring becomes a public concern and a priority issue because it's waste of a non-renewable source in addition to environmental problems due to gas emissions that produce greenhouse effects. Also, it represents definite risks to human health. Air emissions calculations were conducted based on the international guidelines and found that CO2 pollutant is the main source of the emissions in the gas plant, the yearly emissions of CO2 are 343.3 Ton /year. The second source of emissions in the gas plant is CH4. The yearly emissions from methane CH4 is 3.3 Ton/year. The other sources of emissions in the gas plant include CO, NOx and VOC. Total GHG emissions from the gas project Facilities during normal operation are estimated to be 55,133 Ton/year CO2 equivalents. CO2 is the main GHG pollutant, which contributes over 91% of the GHG. The calculated GHG intensity of the gas project facilities is 0.05 Tons of CO2 equivalents per ton of the total production.

The approach is based on combination of measurement procedure of the harmful emissions concentrations in the surface atmospheric layer and mathematical modeling of the impact of these emissions on soil and ground-water contamination. The scheme of this harmful emission concentrations measurement using a mobile complex Sniffer4D Hyper‐local Air Quality Analyzer is given. Based on these results, a mathematical model of diffusion of this harmful substance in the upper layers of soil and water resources is proposed. As a result of the computations, the distribution of concentrations of soil and water contamination in the neighborhood of separate observation points has been built. Also, the field of nitrogen dioxide concentrations at various depths for observation points has been modeled. For a waterbody, the concentration of nitric acid, which is formed due to the interaction of nitrogen dioxide with water, is higher in water than in the surface layer of the soil. This concentration can be significantly increased during prolonged downpours when acidic solutions drain from surrounding soil areas into the waterbodies. The obtained research results are fully consistent with the practical and theoretical results on the diffusion of gases into soils and water resources. It means that the proposed approach can be used instead of the existing very expensive approach to analysis of soil and groundwater contamination in the laboratory. © 2021 by the authors.

Rapid and uncontrolled urbanization coupled with population growth, rising vehicle population, and growth of industries has been fuelling this problem. The present study analyzed the trend and pattern of air pollution of three Indian megacities: Delhi, Kolkata, and Chennai in a spatio-temporal frame using a comparative approach. To develop the air pollution scenario, air-quality data have been collected from the Central Pollution Control Board and also the State Pollution Control Board of respective cities. Four major pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and SO2) have been selected to develop the air-quality index (AQI) from the period of 2017 to 2020. The meteorological parameters have been used to correlate with AQI. Moreover, exceedance factor has been calculated to analyze the level of pollution in comparison to the national standards. The results demonstrate that Delhi and Kolkata are most affected by air pollution. The seasonal distribution shows that higher concentrations of pollution were found during the winter season. The results of this analysis will be helpful in the assessment of air pollution and to investigate the way out through proper policies.

Here, we present a high-resolution marine carbon system data set covering the complete cycle of sea-ice growth and melt in an Arctic estuary (Nunavut, Canada).This data set was collected through three consecutive yearlong deployments of sensors for pH and partial pressure of CO2 in seawater (pCO2sw) on a cabled underwater observatory.The sensors were remarkably stable compared to discrete samples: While corrections for offsets were required in some instances, we did not observe significant drift over the deployment periods. Our observations revealed a strong seasonality in this marine carbon system. Prior to sea-ice formation, air–sea gas exchange and respiration were the dominant processes, leading to increasing pCO2sw and reduced aragonite saturation state (OAr). During sea-ice growth, water column respiration and brine rejection (possibly enriched in dissolved inorganic carbon, relative to alkalinity, due to ikaite precipitation in sea ice) drove pCO2sw to supersaturation and lowered OAr to &lt; 1. Shortly after polar sunrise, the ecosystem became net autotrophic, returning pCO2sw to undersaturation. The biological community responsible for this early switch to autotrophy (well before ice algae or phytoplankton blooms) requires further investigation. After sea-ice melt initiated, an under-ice phytoplankton bloom strongly reduced aqueous carbon (chlorophyll-a max of 2.4 mg L–1), returning OAr to &gt; 1 after 4.5 months of undersaturation. Based on simple extrapolations of anthropogenic carbon inventories, we suspect that this seasonal undersaturation would not have occurred naturally. At ice breakup,the sensor platform recorded low pCO2sw (230 matm), suggesting a strong CO2 sink during the open water season.

In the present paper, we aimed at analysing how the implementation of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) as well as climatic, social, and demographic variables affected the initial growth rate of COVID-19. In more detail, we aimed at identifying and assessing all the predictors in a whole picture of the COVID-19 outbreak and the effectiveness of the response of the countries to the pandemic. It can be expected, indeed, that there is a subtle and complex interplay among the various parameters. As such, we estimated the initial growth rate of COVID-19 for countries across the globe, and used a multiple linear regression model to study the association between the initial growth rate and NPI as well as pre-existing country characteristics (climatic, social and demographic variables measured before the current epidemic began). We obtained a mean initial growth rate of 0.120 (SD 0.076), in the range 0.023–0.315. Ten (8 pre-existing country characteristics and 2 NPI) out of 29 factors considered (21 pre-existing country characteristics and 8 NPI) were associated with the initial growth of COVID-19. Population in urban agglomerations of more than 1 million, PM2.5 air pollution mean annual exposure, life expectancy, hospital beds available, urban population, Global Health Security detection index and restrictions on international movement had the most significant effects on the initial growth of COVID-19. Based on available data and the results we obtained, NPI put in place by governments around the world alone may not have had a significant impact on the initial growth of COVID-19. Only restrictions on international movements had a relative significance with respect to the initial growth rate, whereas demographic, climatic, and social variables seemed to play a greater role in the initial growth rate of COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climatic variables; COVID-19; Demographic variables; Epidemic growth rate; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; Social variables","Linear regression; Population statistics; Urban growth; Cross-country studies; Demographic variables; Life expectancies; Multiple linear regression models; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; Urban agglomerations; Urban population; World Health Organization; Growth rate; climate effect; climate variation; COVID-19; demography; epidemic; growth rate; social impact; viral disease; air pollution; Article; climate; climatic variable; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; disease association; environmental temperature; epidemic growth rate; government; growth rate; human; life expectancy; multiple linear regression analysis; multiple regression; nonpharmaceutical intervention; pandemic; particle size; pollution; population; priority journal; social aspect; therapy; urban area; workplace; air pollution; demography; pandemic; Air Pollution; COVID-19; Demography; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097654867

Strategies are required to protect the global environment, enhance employee health and safety, reduce emissions, and use fuels and raw materials responsibly across all sectors of the economy. Blended Portland cements containing supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), usually industrial by-products, are excellent examples of industrial ecology. In particular, they offer a solution for reducing environmental impacts from several industries. In fact, with every ton of cement produced, nearly a ton of CO2 is emitted. The use of SCMs as a cement substitution reduces these CO2 emissions, saves non-renewable material sources, minimizes waste, and enhances the properties of the concrete. High-quality SCMs are becoming increasingly restricted. With the growing demands for cement, new sources of SCMs, often called alternative SCMs (ASCMs), will need to be used. However, this brings another challenge, as ASCMs are often comprised of local materials, with smaller volumes and more variable compositions. Accordingly, efficient and rapid methods are necessary for evaluating their performance and reactivity in concrete materials. Moreover, there is a need to characterize the chemical, physical, and mineralogical properties of the ASCMs. This paper presents the requirements for materials to qualify as SCMs, an example of a rapid screening test for assessing the performance of ASCMs, and an inventory of materials with favorable properties.

Meanwhile, the new-round marketization reform of the electricity industry has been ongoing in China since 2015. Therefore, it is urgent to evaluate the risk of electric power grid investment in China under new socio-economic development situation, which can help the investors manage risk and reduce risk loss. In this paper, a hybrid novel multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method combining the latest group MCDM method, namely, Bayesian best-worst method (BBWM) and improved matter-element extension model (IMEEM) is proposed for risk evaluation of electric power grid investment in China under new socio- economic development situation. The BBWM is used for the weights’ determination of electric power grid investment risk criteria, and the IMEEM is employed to rank risk grade of electric power grid investment. The risk evaluation index system of electric power grid investment is built, including economic, social, environmental, technical and marketable risks. The risk of electric power grid investment under new socio-economic development situation in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China is empirically evaluated by using the proposed MCDM method, and the results indicate that it belongs to “Medium” grade, but closer to “High” grade. The main contributions of this paper include: (1) it proposes a hybrid novel MCDM method combining the BBWM and IMEEM for risk evaluation of electric power grid investment; and (2) it provides a new view for risk evaluation of electric power grid investment including economic, social, environmental, technical and marketable risks.

With the push towards improving sustainability of these systems, a circular or closed-loop approach for managing resources is desir-able. These crop production systems generate biowaste in the form of crop and growing substrate residues, the disposal of which not only impacts the immediate environment, but also represents a loss of valuable resources. Closing the resource loop through composting of crop residues and urban biowaste is presented. Composting allows for the recovery of carbon dioxide and plant nutrients that can be reused as inputs for crop production, while also providing a mechanism for managing and valorizing biowastes. A conceptual framework for integrating carbon dioxide and nutrient recovery through composting in a CEA system is described along with potential environmental benefits over conventional inputs. Challenges involved in the recovery and reuse of each component, as well as possible solutions, are discussed.

Drawing on documentary evidence and a series of semi-structured expert interviews, it finds that London’s city authorities have a strong capacity for autonomy, stakeholder participation, local leadership and coordination on climate action and mobility, of which they make extensive use. The national legal and political framework remains broadly supportive following the UK’s departure from the EU, but multi-level co-ordina-tion is thin, and funding issues have intensified conflict over political jurisdiction since the pandemic began.

Tree mortality rates have been increasing in tropical forests, reducing the global carbon sink. Upcoming hyperspectral satellites could be used to predict regions close to experiencing extensive tree mortality during periods of stress, such as drought. Here we show, for a tropical rainforest in Borneo, how imminent tropical tree mortality impacts leaf physiological traits and reflectance. We measured leaf reflectance (400–2500 nm), light-saturated photosynthesis (Asat), leaf dark respiration (Rdark), leaf mass area (LMA), and % leaf water across five campaigns in a six-month period during which there were two causes of tree mortality: a major natural drought and a co-incident tree stem girdling treatment. We find that prior to mortality, there were significant (p &lt; 0.05) leaf spectral changes in the red (650–700 nm), the NIR (1,000–1,400 nm), and SWIR bands (2,000–2,400 nm) and significant reductions in the potential carbon balance of the leaves (increased Rdark and reduced Asat). We show that the partial least squares regression technique can predict mortality in tropical trees across different species and functional groups with medium precision but low accuracy (r2 of.65 and RMSE/mean of 0.58). However, most tree death in our study was due to girdling, which is not a natural form of death. More research is needed to determine if this spectroscopy technique can be applied to tropical forests in general. © 2020 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","drought; el Niño; girdling; spectroscopy; traits; tree mortality; tropical forests","carbon balance; drought stress; leaf; mortality; photosynthesis; prediction; rainforest; satellite altimetry; spectral reflectance; tropical region; Borneo; Satellites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097911849

Considering potential heterogeneity in the natural gas-CO2 nexus, this study divides the 73 countries into regional comprehensive economic partnership (RCEP) countries and non-RCEP countries for comparative analysis. The main findings indicate that natural gas consumption can significantly promote CO2 emissions for the full sample and non-RCEP countries, and improved technological innovation can help alleviate CO2 emissions from natural gas consumption. In the RCEP countries, technological innovation can improve the carbon emission reduction effect of natural gas. Furthermore, economic growth and global CO2 emissions show an inverted U-shaped relationship, which confirms the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis.

At the same time, it has also renewed interest in strategic resources utilized in battery production, such as lithium. In the areas of extraction, reactions to lithium mining range from hope for paid work and increased in come to resistance and conflict. Based on extensive ethnographic fieldwork stays realized between February 2018 and August 2019, this article associates the opposed reactions to lithium mining in the communities of the drainage basins of Salar de Olaroz-Cauchari and Salinas Grandes-Guayatayoc with divergent territorialities. In doing so, historically different strategies resistance and negotiation of dealing with overlapping territorialities can be identified. Based on a reciprocal relationship, different strategies and divergent territorialities are mutually dependent. In the two case studies, the new territoriality related to the global market implies diverging socio-spatial consequences with different risks. Using the example of lithium mining, it can thus be shown that the sustainability transition continues to be based on social-ecological inequalities and global asymmetries of power. © 2021 Gesellschaft fur Erdkunde zu Berlin.

While there are considerable interests in understanding the health effects of carbon emissions in the context of climate change, little is observed at regional scale and by econometric methods. Applying regression analysis on 2002–2017 Chinese provincial-level panel data, this study explores the intermediary mechanisms and regional differences of carbon emissions on residents' health. The results indicate that: (1) Carbon emissions have a long-term adverse impact on residents' health—a 1% rise in carbon emission adds 0.298% more outpatients and 0.162% more inpatients; (2) The rise in carbon emissions impairs residents' health mainly by raising the temperature; (3) In areas with high levels of industrialization and urbanization, increased carbon emissions bring greater health risks; and (4) In terms of China's unique “leading industrialization and lagging urbanization” situation, only by upgrading industrial structure, improving urbanization quality, and promoting coordinated industrialization and urbanization can the harm of carbon emissions to residents' health be reduced. Therefore, the “one-size-fits-all” policy model is not suitable for China's current situation. To address global “climate change” issues, China must act according to local conditions by applying mitigating (adaptive) measures in economically developed (less developed) regions. Simultaneously, the authorities must focus on the interaction and synergy between industrialization and urbanization. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; China's Emission Trading Scheme; Industrialization; Residents' health; Urbanization","Carbon; Climate change; Economic analysis; Health; Health risks; Industrial emissions; Carbon emissions; Current situation; Economic growths; Health effects; Industrial structures; Local conditions; Regional differences; Regional scale; Industrial economics; carbon; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; econometrics; environmental economics; environmental protection; industrialization; panel data; urbanization; adverse event; Article; carbon emission; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; development; environmental temperature; geography; health; health hazard; hospital patient; human; industrialization; Mediation effect model; outpatient; priority journal; regression analysis; statistical model; urbanization; China; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Industrial Development; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097645578

In this study, we present a modeling framework that integrates a hydrological model with projections of General Circulation Models (GCMs). Temperature and precipitation projections of six GCMs with two downscaling methods are used to force the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in the Hamilton Harbour watershed in Ontario, Canada. A flow-based weighting strategy was developed to integrate the projections of multiple GCMs based on their ability to recreate empirical flow frequency distributions in multiple monitoring sites. Our study renders support to the ability of the weighted model ensemble to draw meaningful hydrological forecasts. Nonetheless, we also note that the ensemble strategy understates the frequency and magnitude of flow extremes, and therefore the domain that is collectively delineated by individual GCMs can still provide complementary planning information. Climate change is projected to trigger a distinct increase in air temperature and precipitation during the late winter-early spring period, which in turn will likely result in an earlier snowmelt and changes in the magnitude and timing of peak flow events. Analysis of the water cycle shows that the sensitivity of the individual hydrological components to climate change may vary along the urban-to-agriculture gradient. The projected declining soil–water content in agricultural catchments highlights the likelihood of more intensified drought conditions in the croplands. Evapotranspiration rates will likely increase across the entire watershed, whereas surface runoff could be reduced but less so in urbanized locations. Overall, our findings suggest that any future planning exercise to ameliorate the prevailing water quality conditions will only be insightful if we consider the interplay between climate change and urbanization processes in the area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural watersheds; Climate change; Extreme hydrological events; GCMs, Ensemble strategy; Urban watersheds","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Catchments; Climate models; Quality control; Risk assessment; Water quality; Watersheds; Agricultural catchments; General circulation model; Hydrological forecast; Hydrological modeling; Hydrological response; Planning information; Soil and water assessment tool; Weighted model ensembles; Climate change; adaptive management; agricultural land; air temperature; climate change; downscaling; drought; evapotranspiration; runoff; soil water; urbanization; water quality; watershed; Hamilton Harbor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099608561

However, the effects of long-term in situ application of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), one of the important NIs, on N2O emissions from agricultural soils are not well documented. In this study, a field trial was conducted to determine N2O emissions in response to DMPP application for six consecutive years (2010–2015) on a rainfed acidic luvisol planted with maize in Northeast China, as well as the effects on the soil microbial communities after six years. Three treatments were used, i.e., no urea (CK), urea (SU), and urea plus DMPP (DMPP). The results showed large intra- and interannual variations in the N2O fluxes for all treatments. The N2O mitigation efficiency of DMPP varied from 18.4 to 50.3% across the six cycles, which was mainly attributed to the amount of precipitation and its annual distribution. The annual N2O emissions and N2O emissions factor during the six years were significantly mitigated by DMPP applications, with mean reductions of 29.9 and 47.9%, respectively. The abundances of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, ammonia oxidizer genes, and denitrifier functional genes in the soils collected 10 days after fertilization in May 2015 and again in September were determined. In May 2015, DMPP application significantly decreased the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) amoA gene copy number by 77.7% and increased the nosZ gene copy number by 116.8%. However, in September 2015, even after the six-year application period assessed in May, there was no significant effect on gene abundance due to DMPP. Overall, the repeated annual application of DMPP in the spring effectively reduced N2O emissions from acidic luvisol soil, yielding no significant long-term shifts in soil bacterial communities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","AOB; DMPP; N2O; Nitrification inhibitor; nosZ",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098470726

The effect of the restriction measures and the reduction of vehicles traffic was predominant in reducing concentration rather than meteorological forcing. During the lockdown in 2020, a decrease of 61% in ultrafine particle positive fluxes can be observed. At the same time, negative fluxes decreased by 59% and our observation site behaved, essentially, as a sink of ultrafine particles. Due to this behavior, we can conclude that the principal particle sources during the lockdown were far away from the measurement site. © MDPI AG.

An interesting prospect with respect to future applications of these materials is the possibility of generating a 'switchable' framework in which the guest adsorption can be modulated by virtue of the redox state of the framework. Herein, we report a closely related metal-organic framework (MOF), [Zn2(DSNDI)], where the redox state of the electroactive ligand DSNDI4- (N,N′-bis(4-carboxy-3-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxydiimide) can be modulated using both in situ and ex situ methods. The material is stable to both chemical and electrochemical reduction of its organic DSNDI units without structural collapse or degradation, and remains porous to N2, H2 and CO2. The chemically reduced frameworks demonstrate notable changes from the parent material, particularly with respect to CO2 binding. The CO2 isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) increases from 27.9 kJ mol-1 in the neutral material to 43.9 kJ mol-1 after reduction due to enhanced host-guest interactions, the latter being comparable to the best performing member of the MOF-74 series, [Mg2(dobdc)]. The origin of the enhanced interaction was probed using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations which corroborated the presence of enhanced framework-CO2 interactions for the chemically-reduced MOF.

In this study, the impact of lockdown on atmospheric particle number concentrations and size distributions is investigated in two different sites of Southern Italy: Lecce and Lamezia Terme, regional stations of the GAW/ACTRIS networks. The effects of restrictions are quantified by comparing submicron particle concentrations, in the size range from 10 nm to 800 nm, measured during the lockdown period and in the same period of previous years, from 2015 to 2019, considering three time intervals: Prelockdown, lockdown and postlockdown. Different percentage reductions in total particle number concentrations are observed, -19% and -23% in Lecce and -7% and -4% in Lamezia Terme during lockdown and postlockdown, respectively, with several variations in each subclass of particles. From the comparison, no significant variations of meteorological factors are observed except a reduction of rainfall in 2020, which might explain the higher levels of particle concentrations measured during prelockdown at both stations. In general, the results demonstrate an improvement of air quality, more conspicuous in Lecce than in Lamezia Terme, during the lockdown, with a differed reduction in the concentration of submicronic particles that depends on the different types of sources, their distance from observational sites and local meteorology. © 2021 by the authors.

However, due to the uneven spatial distribution of ground stations, satellite acquisition cycle, and cloud/rain, high-resolution products cannot be provided on a complete spatio-temporal scale. To provide a full daily PM2.5 product in recent years at 1-km grid of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, here we apply a state-of-the-art machine learning approach, CatBoost, to (1) reconstruct satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data; and to (2) estimate gridded PM2.5 from station measurements combining elevation, meteorological factors, and the reconstructed AOD data. Compared with existing approaches, CatBoost substantially improved the performance of AOD reconstruction by ~16%. We further show that a wavelet decomposition procedure on the station-based PM2.5 and input variables is helpful to improve the estimation accuracy. Overall, the approach has a good performance in estimating PM2.5 with a cross-validation R2 of 0.88 and root-mean-squared error of 17.79 μg/m3. From the new dataset, population-weighted PM2.5 revealed heterogeneous spatial distribution of exposure in different areas, consistently higher in the Southern and Eastern BTH and lower in Beijing and Northern BTH. In recent years, both AOD and PM2.5 in the BTH region had notable interannual decreases, which can be attributed to the emission reduction efforts and interannual natural variabilities. © 2021","AOD; Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei; CatBoost; PM2.5; Remote sensing; Wavelet decomposition","Emission control; Mean square error; Satellites; Spatial distribution; Aerosol optical depths; Air pollution prevention; Fine particulate matter; Machine learning approaches; Meteorological factors; Root mean squared errors; Satellite acquisition; Spatio-temporal scale; Wavelet decomposition; aerosol; annual variation; decomposition analysis; optical depth; particulate matter; satellite data; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; aerosol; article; China; cross validation; decomposition; meteorological phenomena; optical depth; particulate matter 2.5; remote sensing; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101445196

Herein, a novel strategy inspired by biomimetic mineralization is developed to acquire a hierarchical flower-like Mn3O4@N, P-doped carbon (NPC) composite, which consists of multi-intercalated Mn3O4 nanosheets and NPC cores. The Mn3O4 nanosheets offer abundant active regions, and their C-O-Mn bonds with NPC ensure the fast electron transfer kinetics. It is noteworthy that the intercalation pseudocapacitance mechanism of Mn3+/Mn4+ transformation in Mn3O4@NPC not only extends the potential window to 0–1.3 V (vs Ag/AgCl) but also significantly increased pseudocapacitance. Benefits from the advantages of structure and energy storage mechanism, the Mn3O4@NPC electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 370.8 F g−1 and superior rate performance. A 2.6 V flexible aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (FAAS) is fabricated by integrating Mn3O4@NPC cathode with an electrochemically reduced porous carbon anode and a PVA-Na2SO4 hydrogel electrolyte. Notably, the FAAS delivers a high energy density of 76.96 Wh kg−1 as well as excellent rate capability. The device exhibited an excellent stability during 10,000 cycles and additional 240 h floating test.

Here, we demonstrate the photocathode functionality of a Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) featuring cofacial pairs of photo- and electro-active 1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide (NDI) ligands, which was successfully applied to markedly reduce the overpotential required for CO2reduction to CO by a well-known rhenium molecular electrocatalyst. Reduction of [Cd(DPNDI)(TDC)]n(DPNDI =N,N′-di(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide, H2TDC = thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylic acid) to its mixed-valence state induces through-space Intervalence Charge Transfer (IVCT) within cofacial DPNDI units. Irradiation of the mixed-valence MOF in the visible region generates a DPNDI photoexcited radical monoanion state, which is stabilised as a persistent species by the inherent IVCT interactions and has been rationalised using Density Functional Theory (DFT). This photoexcited radical monoanion state was able to undergo charge transfer (CT) reduction of the rhenium molecular electrocatalyst to effect CO generation at a lower overpotential than that required by the discrete electrocatalyst itself.

Therefore, the design optimization procedure developed is centered into leaf spring weight reduction. The design optimization procedure was bounded by industry regulatory standards and base on analytical and numerical experiments.

The IEA-ETSAP methodology was utilized to model and analyse the Basilicata energy system in a business-as-usual scenario, based on the assumptions of the 2010 Regional Energy and Environmental Policy Plan, and in two low-carbon scenarios, decarbonisation and high energy efficiency, which, in line with the long-term European strategy, foresee an 85% carbon dioxide emission reduction and a 20% energy efficiency increase in 2050. The results highlight that electricity production from renewable energy sources (in particular wind energy), strongly supported by the regional policy, goes beyond the Basilicata Regional Energy-Environmental Plan forecast, with a further increase in the decarbonisation scenarios. In addition, solar thermal and highly efficient technologies are adopted in commercial and residential end-use sectors. An additional 9% reduction in energy consumption is achieved in the high energy efficiency scenario by passive houses. The proposed approach shows the usefulness of a modelling framework typically used for national and supranational analyses to support regional authorities in their decision-making process to obtain results in line with the European and national strategies. Application to the Basilicata region shows the usefulness of a consolidated framework for policy assessment at a local scale to assess regional contribution to the achievement of national climate mitigation targets that tend towards climate neutrality. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Basilicata region; Climate change mitigation; Energy efficiency measures; Scenario analysis; TIMES model","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Decarbonization; Decision making; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Global warming; Wind power; Carbon dioxide emissions; Decision making process; Efficient technology; Electricity production; Environmental policy; High energy efficiency; Regional authorities; Renewable energy source; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095881670

Since modern district heating systems are sustainable energy distribution services that exploit renewable sources and avoid energy waste, in-depth knowledge of thermal energy demand, which is mainly affected by weather conditions, is essential to enhance heat production schedules. We hence propose a mixture copula-based approach to investigate the complex relationship between meteorological variables, such as outdoor temperature and solar radiation, and thermal energy demand in the district heating system of the Italian city Bozen-Bolzano. We analyse data collected from 2014 to 2017, and estimate copulas after removing serial dependence in each time series using autoregressive integrated moving average models. Due to complex relationships, a mixture of an unstructured Student-t and a flipped Clayton copula is deemed the best model, as it allows differentiating the magnitude of dependence in each tail and exhibiting both heavy-tailed and asymmetric dependence.

Since, 2007 agroforestry has received attention in global climate discus-sions for its carbon sink potential. Agroforestry plays a defining role in offsetting greenhouse gases, providing sustainable livelihoods, localizing Sustainable Development Goals and achieving biodiversity targets. The review explores evidence of agroforestry systems for human well-being along with its climate adaptation and mitigation potential for South Asia. In particular, we explore key enabling and constraining conditions for mainstreaming agroforestry systems to use them to fulfill global climate mitigation targets. Nationally determined contributions submitted by South Asian countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change acknowledge agrofor-estry systems. In 2016, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation’s Resolution on Agrofor-estry brought consensus on developing national agroforestry policies by all regional countries and became a strong enabling condition to ensure effectiveness of using agroforestry for climate targets. Lack of uniform methodologies for creation of databases to monitor tree and soil carbon stocks was found to be a key limitation for the purpose. Water scarcity, lack of interactive governance, rights of farmers and ownership issues along with insufficient financial support to rural farmers for agro-forestry were other constraining conditions that should be appropriately addressed by the regional countries to develop their preparedness for achieving national climate ambitions. Our review indi-cates the need to shift from planning to the implementation phase following strong examples shared from India and Nepal, including carbon neutrality scenarios, incentives and sustainable local livelihood to enhance preparedness. © 2021 by the authors.

The thermal and oxygen storage dynamics are described using a set of coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) developed and experimentally validated in previous research. Advancements in on-board diagnostic (OBD) design are moving in the direction of using physics-based models that would retain as much physical insights as possible. Retaining the one-dimensional (1D) evolution of the internal storage dynamics along the device length is key for the development of accurate emission control strategies. In this work, we adopt the numerical projection orthogonal approach combined with the analytical features of Galerkin reduction method to define a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the oxygen storage and temperature dynamics throughout the device life. Using experimental data collected over three TWC devices, each of different age, and under the excitation of different real drive cycles, we validate the model and quantify the relation between the number of reduced-order states versus model accuracy for devices both new and at different stages of life. The input dependent characteristics of the developed reduced-model model is also investigated using a power spectral density (PSD) analysis. Finally, we show that an initial tuning of the reduced model parameters for a fresh catalyst guarantees satisfactory modeling performance throughout the device life, regardless of the driving scenario. © 2020 by ASME.",,"Catalysts; Catalytic converters; Dynamics; Emission control; Nonlinear equations; Numerical methods; Ordinary differential equations; Oxygen; Partial differential equations; Spectral density; Dependent characteristics; Nonlinear partial differential equations; On board diagnostics; Physics-based models; Power spectral densities (PSD); Reduced order models; Satisfactory modeling; Three way catalytic converter; Digital storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094875412

This paper examines the electricity and carbon mitigation costs to reliably operate India’s grid in 2030 for a variety of wind and solar targets (200 GW to 600 GW) and the most promising options for reducing these costs. We find that systems where solar photovoltaic comprises only 25 to 50% of the total renewable target have the lowest carbon mitigation costs in most scenarios. This result invites a reexamination of India’s proposed solar-majority targets. We also find that, compared to other regions and contrary to prevailing assumptions, meeting high renewable targets will avoid building very few new fossil fuel (coal and natural gas) power plants because of India’s specific weather patterns and need to meet peak electricity demand. However, building 600 GW of renewable capacity, with the majority being wind plants, reduces how often fossil fuel power plants run, and this amount of capacity can hold India’s 2030 emissions below 2018 levels for less than the social cost of carbon. With likely wind and solar cost declines and increases in coal energy costs, balanced or wind-majority high renewable energy systems (600 GW or ≈ 45% share by energy) could result in electricity costs similar to a fossil fuel-dominated system. As an alternative strategy for meeting peak electricity demand, battery storage can avert the need for new fossil fuel capacity but is cost effective only at low capital costs (≈ USD 150 per kWh). © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Increasing the component of bamboo powder in the carrier reduced the carbon availability and had an adverse effect on nitrate removal efficiency. However, bamboo powder improved the ammonia removal rate which mainly through autotrophic nitrification. Three reactors exhibited distinct microbial compositions in both bacterial and fungal diversity. High inclusion of bamboo power decreased the relative abundance of denitrifiers Denitromonas and increased the relative abundance of nitrifiers, including Nitromonas, Nitrospina and Nitrospira.

Generally, the preparation of semiconductor oxide electron transport layer and perovskite involves high-temperature annealing procedure for abundant light absorption as well as efficient charge transport, which limits its flexible application. Herein, we develop an all room temperature processing high-efficiency planar C-PSCs that utilizes SnO2 as electron transport layer and a cheap polymer i.e. polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the interface passivation layer to reduce the defect state density of perovskite and facilitate valid charge transfer from perovskite to carbon. The resultant planar C-PSC devices achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.5% comparable to the conventional C-PSCs with annealing process, about 50% higher than that based on bare C-PSC devices without PEG. The room-temperature processing C–PSCs exhibits excellent stability, retaining around 90% of the initial PCE after being stored in air for 20 days. Furthermore, this room-temperature process is extended to the flexible C–PSCs, achieving a PCE over 10%.

However, slight information on climate change and environmental issues had been integrated into the curricula. Moreover, minimal research had been carried out to understand university role in spreading awareness, and students level of awareness and daily behaviour towards climate change, especially in developing countries. This paper aims to investigate the aforementioned issues. An experimental study was carried out on 448 undergraduate students enrolled at An-Najah National University Palestine. The study aimed to examine students’ knowledge and daily behaviour towards climate change, and the important role the university and students’ societies play in terms of spreading and enhancing awareness. The results revealed that female and male students had a non satisfactory interest level in environmental topics and activities, and gender equality did not seem to be an issue. Moreover, female students tend to have a significantly lower level of awareness on climate change compared to male students. On the other hand, being an engineering students or a member in students’ societies had a positive impact on students’ level of awareness and especially females. The results revealed that female students who are enrolled in the engineering faculty or members of students’ societies had a significantly higher level of awareness compared to female students who are enrolled in other faculties or not members of students’ societies. In general, students had a low level of awareness regardless of gender or faculty and universities should offer undergraduate students and especially female students’ opportunities to learn more about climate change by integrating climate change topics into higher education. Moreover, universities should support extracurricular activities held by student societies, and some of these activities should be directed towards environmental and climate change issues.

The first objective of the paper is to present the model, including the 2-layer calibration that has been carried out for assuring energy balance using official statistics. The second objective of the paper is to demonstrate the use of the model to develop greenhouse gas mitigation scenarios based on policies including: (i) improved fuel efficiency of vehicles; (ii) improved vehicle inspections; (iii) the scaling up of low-carbon technologies including hybrid and electric vehicles, as well as the use of bioethanol produced in Mauritius; and (iv) the proposed light-rail system in Mauritius. The results show that the ‘business-as-usual’ land transport emissions are expected to reach ~1.68 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2050. The combination of all scenarios could result in ~0.31 MtCO2e reductions by 2050, with over 57% of all reductions are expected to accrue from (iii). Since energy used in transport makes up for more than 56% of the primary energy requirement of Mauritius, the macroeconomic effects of decarbonizing land transport is significant from an energy security standpoint. The modelling approach can be used to inform the formulation of a low-carbon land transport strategy for Mauritius, as well as for increasing the mitigation ambition of its Nationally Determined Contribution. Further, it is argued that the approach would be useful in the context of other small islands developing states that face land availability constraints like Mauritius. © 2021 The Authors","Climate change mitigation; Land transport emissions; Travel demand",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099635982

To this end we use an adapted version of JSBACH-the land surface component of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-ESM)-that accounts for the organic matter stored in the permafrostaffected soils of the high northern latitudes. The model is run under different climate scenarios that assume an increase in GHG concentrations, based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5 and the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, which peaks in the years 2025, 2050, 2075 or 2100, respectively. The peaks are followed by a decrease in atmospheric GHGs that returns the concentrations to the levels at the beginning of the 21st century, reversing the imposed climate change. We show that the soil CO2 emissions exhibit an almost linear dependence on the global mean surface temperatures that are simulated for the different climate scenarios. Here, each degree of warming increases the fluxes by, very roughly, 50 % of their initial value, while each degree of cooling decreases them correspondingly. However, the linear dependence does not mean that the processes governing the soil CO2 emissions are fully reversible on short timescales but rather that two strongly hysteretic factors offset each other-namely the net primary productivity and the availability of formerly frozen soil organic matter. In contrast, the soil methane emissions show a less pronounced increase with rising temperatures, and they are consistently lower after the peak in the GHG concentrations than prior to it. Here, the net fluxes could even become negative, and we find that methane emissions will play only a minor role in the northern highlatitude contribution to global warming, even when considering the high global warming potential of the gas. Finally, we find that at a global mean temperature of roughly 1.75 K (±0:5 K) above pre-industrial levels the high-latitude ecosystem turns from a CO2 sink into a source of atmospheric carbon, with the net fluxes into the atmosphere increasing substantially with rising atmospheric GHG concentrations. This is very different from scenario simulations with the standard version of the MPI-ESM, in which the region continues to take up atmospheric CO2 throughout the entire 21st century, confirming that the omission of permafrost-related processes and the organic matter stored in the frozen soils leads to a fundamental misrepresentation of the carbon dynamics in the Arctic. © 2021 Author(s).",,"carbon emission; climate change; concentration (composition); latitude; methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101976489

These models rarely include limits imposed by injectivity, ultimate amounts, or the geographic distribution of storage resources. However, they could if a sufficiently simple model were available. We develop a methodology for the fast assessment of the dynamic storage resource of a reservoir under different scenarios of well numbers and interwell distance. The approach combines the use of a single-well multiphase analytical solution and the superposition of pressure responses to evaluate the pressure buildup in a multiwell scenario. The injectivity is directly estimated by means of a nonlinear relationship between flow-rate and overpressure and by imposing a limiting overpressure, which is evaluated on the basis of the mechanical parameters for failure. The methodology is implemented within a tool, named CO2BLOCK, which can optimise site design for the numbers of wells and spacing between wells. Given its small computational expense, the methodology can be applied to a large number of sites within a region. We apply this to analyse the storage potential in the offshore of the UK. We estimate that 25–250 GtCO2 can be safely stored over an injection time interval of 30 years. We also demonstrate the use of the tool in evaluating tradeoffs between infrastructure costs and maximising injectivity at two specific sites in the offshore UK. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 storage capacity; Injectivity; Resource optimization; Simplified models","Aquifers; Carbon capture; Economics; Geographical distribution; Hydrogeology; Offshore oil well production; Well spacing; Computational expense; Infrastructure costs; Integrated assessment models; Mechanical parameters; Non-linear relationships; Pressure response; Storage potential; Storage resources; Climate change; aquifer; carbon storage; design; estimation method; fluid injection; model; optimization; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099628402

Based on an in-depth case study analysis, we identify three main dimensions of conflict underlying the political negotiations: the fiscal dimension, the rule-of-law dimension and the policy dimension, especially the climate and digitalization agendas. Various coalitions of actors were able to negotiate on these aspects, keeping a balance between their main priorities, but also making concessions, to enable an agreement. Our analysis reveals that the Franco-German alliance has been revived, enabling the grant instrument in the NGEU to be adopted; a new alliance of small rich northern states named the Frugals' has emerged as a surprisingly strong coalition, insisting on conditionality for accessing the grant; a clear Polish-Hungarian front has appeared to be challenging the EU's commitment to the rule-of-law; and a weakly coordinated Spanish-Italian front was successful in terms of securing grants as an instrument. The article also assesses that despite the agreement on the deal, there will continue to be battles in the NGEU, especially on the fiscal and rule-of-law dimensions. Yet, it could represent a ‘Hamiltonian moment,’ if the NGEU becomes a permanent fiscal instrument, which would advance European integration further. © 2021 The Authors.

One solution is a paradigm shift of the transportation policies from personal vehicles to public transportation system using electric buses. Using electric bus fleets for public transportation is not straightforward in Indian cities for two reasons, viz., weak electricity grid and predominantly coal-based power generation. In this work, a novel transportation system, that uses solar PV generation and large capacity batteries, is analyzed for its impact on air pollution and environmental sustainability. A detailed well to wheel analysis of the system, for various power generation scenarios, is presented and also compared with the existing ones. The analysis done in this work answers the question: “Can the electric bus-based public transportation contribute towards emission reduction in transportation?” The results also elaborate that to reach the target under the Paris Protocol, India has to take drastic majors like phasing out of coal by 2030. To phase out Coal, India has to reduce its contribution by 5% each year from now and use renewable energy sources extensively. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","E-bus; emission; renewable energy; transportation system","Air pollution; Buses; Coal; Coal industry; Coal transportation; Electric automobiles; Emission control; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Vehicle-to-grid; Coal based power generation; Conflicting objectives; Environmental sustainability; Public transportation; Public transportation systems; Renewable energy source; Transportation policies; Well-to-wheel analysis; Bus transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089782635

However, it can be used to generate biogas, electricity, and carbon credits from biodigesters and concentrators. Thus, studying the use of vinasse is justified, and this study asks the following research question: How feasible is it to use internal circulation biodigesters with the vinasse concentrator Citrotec®, and their conjugates in energy and environmental terms? To answer this question, the study employs quantitative methodology. To analyze this in terms of energy, the consumption of diesel in vinasse logistics has been calculated, the balance of energy in its processing and transport, its generation of electricity, and its capacity in terms of storage in urban centers. It has also been in terms of its incremental capacity in the production of cellulosic ethanol, the generation of electricity, and substitution for diesel, gasoline, and ethanol in the states of Brazil. The environmental analysis includes the balance and emission and mitigation of nitrous, sulfur, and carbon oxides in the processing and transport of vinasse, as well the figures for each Brazilian state that produces ethanol and the potential gains in the carbon credit market. The principal innovations of this article are a detailed analysis of the production ranges for autonomous sugar energy plants with a range of production from 500 to 4000 m3/day, the processing and logistics of vinasse for planting, as well as an analysis of each Brazilian state for the 2015/2016 crop. According to our results and review of the literature, the reuse of vinasse is recommended due to its energy and environmental gains, in a way that maintains the fertilizing and irrigation characteristics of the residues, particularly the IC biodigesters and concentrators and their conjugates. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Energy and environmental analysis; Internal circulation biodigester; Vinasse; Vinasse concentrator","biogas; diesel; electricity generation; ethanol; fuel consumption; research work; sugar; sulfur; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083806061

The byproducts of coal combustion, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), have increasingly been associated with adverse birth outcomes. The goal of this study was to leverage the current progressive transition away from coal in the U.S. to assess whether coal PM2.5 is associated with preterm birth (PTB) rates and whether this association differs by maternal Black/White race/ethnicity. Using a novel dispersion modeling approach, we estimated PM2.5 pollution from coal-fired power plants nationwide at the county-level during the study period (2000-2018). We also obtained county-level PTB rates for non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black mothers. We used a generalized additive mixed model to estimate the relationship between coal PM2.5 and PTB rates, overall and stratified by maternal race. We included a natural spline to allow for non-linearity in the concentration-response curve. We observed a positive non-linear relationship between coal PM2.5 and PTB rate, which plateaued at higher levels of pollution. We also observed differential associations by maternal race; the association was stronger for White women, especially at higher levels of coal PM2.5 (&gt;2.0 µg m−3). Our findings suggest that the transition away from coal may reduce PTB rates in the U.S. © 2021 The Author(s).

This period was characterized by increased boreal summer insolation over the Northern Hemisphere, a vegetated Sahara and reduced airborne dust concentrations. A set of sensitivity experiments was conducted in which solar insolation, vegetation and dust concentrations were changed in turn to disentangle their impacts on TC activity in the Atlantic Ocean. Results show that the greening of the Sa hara and reduced dust loadings (MHGS+RD) lead to a larger increase in the number of Atlantic TCs (27 %) relative to the pre-industrial (PI) climate than the orbital forcing alone (MHPMIP; 9 %). The TC seasonality is also highly modified in the MH climate, showing a decrease in TC activity dur ing the beginning of the hurricane season (June to August), with a shift of its maximum towards October and Novem ber in the MHGS+RD experiment relative to PI. MH experi ments simulate stronger hurricanes compared to PI, similar to future projections. Moreover, they suggest longer-lasting cyclones relative to PI. Our results also show that changes in the African easterly waves are not relevant in altering the frequency and intensity of TCs, but they may shift the loca tion of their genesis. This work highlights the importance of considering vegetation and dust changes over the Sahara re gion when investigating TC activity under a different climate state. © 2021.

In pursuit of mitigating the problem, the European Commission has adopted a bundle of policies, such as consumer protection measures, short-term financial interventions, motivations for energy efficiency (e.g., energy retrofits and replacement of old household appliance) and information campaigns, among others. There is no doubt, however, that increasing the income of vulnerable households would be the most preferred and effective option. Focusing on energy efficiency, a measure typically incorporated in the National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) of many Member States as a means to fight energy poverty, this paper aims to shed light on the need to gradually move towards more localized—not to say personalized—actions. In this direction, a labeled choice-based experiment is used, which involves a hypothetical selection between three alternative energy interventions, i.e., house retrofit, upgrading of heating system and upgrading of household electrical appliances. The research aims to integrate the preferences of households from the choice experiment with indicators of energy poverty and establish a connection between energy poverty and energy efficiency investment decisions. The results demonstrate that households’ preferences are affected by qualitative and quantitative aspects of energy vulnerability and sociodemographic characteristics. Furthermore, vulnerable households seem to be more prone to the so-called “discounting gap”, as previous studies also suggest. These findings are worrisome because, without tailor-made support, these households may never escape the vicious circle of energy poverty. To this end, the survey could provide useful information to policy-makers towards developing more robust policies of energy poverty alleviation. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet, potential leakage, migration and dissolution of externally-supplied CO2 from such reservoirs are a cause for concern. The potential impact of CO2 leakage on the biogeochemistry of sediments and overlying waters in the North Sea was studied during a controlled subsurface CO2 release experiment in 2019 at a potential carbon capture and storage site (Goldeneye). This study describes the natural (unperturbed) biogeochemistry of sediments. They are classified as muddy sand to sandy mud with low organic carbon content (∼0.6 %). Distributions of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) in sediment porewaters are reported in addition to in situ benthic fluxes of dissolved nutrients and oxygen between the sediments and the overlying water. Oxygen fluxes into the sediment, measured using benthic chambers and eddy covariance, were 6.18 ± 0.58 and 5.73 ± 2.03 mmol m−2 d-1, respectively. Diagnostic indicators are discussed that could be used to detect CO2 enrichment of sediments due to reservoir leakage at CCS sites. These include the ratio TA and ammonium to sulfate in sediment porewaters, benthic fluxes and chloride-normalized cation distributions. These indicators currently suggest that the organic carbon at Goldeneye has an oxidation state below zero and is mainly degraded via sulfate reduction. Carbonate precipitation is apparently negligible, whereas decreases in Mg2+ and K+ point toward ongoing alteration of lithogenic sediments by reverse weathering processes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Alkalinity; Biogeochemistry; CCS; CO2; Fluxes; North Sea; Reverse weathering; Sediment","Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Chlorine compounds; Dissolved oxygen; Organic carbon; Sediments; Sulfur compounds; Weathering; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbonate precipitation; Cation distributions; Diagnostic indicators; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Dissolved nutrients; Organic carbon contents; Release experiments; Carbon capture; alkalinity; anthropogenic source; baseline conditions; biogeochemistry; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; dissolved inorganic carbon; leakage; lithology; organic carbon; sediment chemistry; weathering; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099976604

The head boundary conditions could cause artifacts of extremely large, but unrealistic recharge rates owing to unlimited supply of water. This study adopted a fully-coupled surface–subsurface hydrologic modeling approach to simulate transient topography-driven groundwater flow and also surface-water flow under homogeneous and isotropic settings. Two 100-year climate datasets and five hydraulic conductivities (K, 0.01–100 m/d) were tested in numerical experiments. In the base case with a wet climate (annual precipitation 1696 mm/y) and K of 1 m/d, groundwater head at two different locations close to both lateral boundaries fluctuates only within 5.1 m and 9.6 m, respectively, during the 100-year period. Despite the local water table fluctuations caused by the variability in the climatic record, large-scale groundwater flow systems can be assumed in dynamic equilibrium provided stationary climate. Long-term average exchange fluxes are spatially constant and limited by precipitation infiltration when surface water is absent, whereas they vary from positive to negative values (i.e., recharge to discharge) spatially when surface water is present. Sensitivity analysis suggests that wetter climate and smaller K lead to more inundation of the land surface, stronger hierarchical nesting of groundwater flow systems and more variable exchange fluxes. Overall, our first fully-coupled modeling of topography-driven groundwater flow implies that attention must be paid to causality between head and flow, and climatic record as boundary conditions may be more appropriate due to its relaxed manner. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate; Fully-coupled surface-water groundwater modeling; Groundwater exchange fluxes; Topography-driven groundwater flow","Boundary conditions; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Hierarchical systems; Sensitivity analysis; Topography; Annual precipitation; Groundwater flow systems; Homogeneous and isotropic; Hydrologic modeling; Numerical experiments; Surface water and groundwaters; Surface water flows; Water table fluctuations; Surface waters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099497760

In this study, we have developed a new emission inversion system based on a fourdimensional local ensemble transform Kalman filter (4DLETKF) and the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to dynamically update the SO2 emission grid by grid over China by assimilating the ground-based hourly SO2 observations. Sensitivity tests for the assimilation system have been conducted firstly to tune four system parameters: ensemble size, horizontal and temporal localization lengths, and perturbation size. Our results reveal that the same random perturbation factors used throughout the whole model grids with assimilating observations within about 180 km can efficiently optimize the SO2 emission, whereas the ensemble size has only little effect. The temporal localization by assimilating only the subsequent hourly observations can reveal the diurnal variation of the SO2 emission, which is better than updating the magnitude of SO2 emission every 12 h by assimilating all the observations within the 12 h window. The inverted SO2 emission over China in November 2016 has declined by an average of 49.4% since 2010, which is well in agreement with the bottom-up estimation of 48.0 %. Larger reductions of SO2 emission are found over the a priori higher source regions such as the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). The simulated SO2 surface mass concentrations using two distinguished chemical reaction mechanisms are both much more comparable to the observations with the newly inverted SO2 emission than those with the a priori emission. These indicate that the newly developed emission inversion system can efficiently update the SO2 emissions based on the routine surface SO2 observations.

These models, particularly positive matrix factorization (PMF), have been extensively used for analyzing particle number concentrations (PNCs) datasets. However, the variation of observed PNCs and particle size distribution are driven by both the source emission rates and atmospheric dispersion as well as chemical and physical transformation processes. This variation in the observation data caused by meteorologically induced dilution reduces the ability to obtain accurate source apportionment results. To reduce the influence of dilution on quantitative source estimates, a methodology for improving the accuracy of source apportionment results by incorporating a measure of dispersion, the ventilation coefficient, into the PMF analysis (called dispersion normalized PMF, DN-PMF) was applied to a PNC dataset measured from a field campaign that includes the Spring Festival event and the start of the COVID-19 lockdown in Tianjin, China. The data also included gaseous pollutants and hourly PM2.5 compositional data. Eight factors were resolved and interpreted as municipal incinerator, traffic nucleation, secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA), traffic emissions, photonucleation, coal combustion, residential heating and festival emissions. The DN-PMF enhanced the diel patterns of photonucleation and the two traffic factors by enlarging the differences between daytime peak values and nighttime concentrations. The municipal incinerator plant, traffic emissions, and coal combustion have cleaner and more clearly defined directionalities after dispersion normalization. Thus, dispersion normalized PMF is capable of enhancing the source emission patterns. After the COVID-19 lockdown began, PNC of traffic nucleation and traffic emissions decreased by 41% and 44%, respectively, while photonucleation produced more particles likely due to the reduction in the condensation sink. The significant changes in source emissions indicate a substantially reduced traffic volume after the implement of lockdown measures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Particle number concentration; Particle size distribution; PMF; Source apportionment","Aerosols; Atmospheric movements; Crystallization; Factorization; Fog; Nucleation; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Atmospheric dispersion; Factor analysis model; Particle number concentration; Positive Matrix Factorization; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Source apportionment; Source contributions; Transformation process; Coal combustion; coal; COVID-19; dispersion; particle size; particulate matter; size distribution; source apportionment; ventilation; viral disease; air and air related phenomena; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; atmosphere; atmospheric dispersion; chemical modification; China; circadian rhythm; combustion; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; data base; dilution; environmental aspects and related phenomena; epidemic; exhaust gas; factor analysis; festival emission; incineration; measurement accuracy; particle number concentration; particle size; particle size distribution; particulate matter 2.5; photonucleation; pollution and pollution related phenomena; positive matrix factorization; priority journal; quantitative analysis; quarantine; residential heating; secondary inorganic aerosol; source apportionment; spring; traffic nucleation; air pollutant; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; human; particulate matter; China; Tianjin; Air Pollutants; China; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096144642

Future scenarios were developed taking into account the Representatives Concentrations Pathway (RCP) adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) in its fifth Assessment Report (AR5). To investigate the possible effects of future climate and land use changes on CO2 emissions, we compared our results with a previous study that simulated the carbon emissions under present climate conditions. The results showed that under moderate climatic changes scenario associated to the recuperation of natural land covers in the watershed (i.e., increase in forestry areas) the CO2 emissions are estimated to be more than 100% higher than the current emissions in a specific season. On the other hand, in a more extreme climatic changes scenario associated to the expansion of agriculture and pasture areas, the estimates of CO2 emissions along the year decrease of 5% compared to current emissions. Our findings indicate that the processes such as eutrophication, mixing and stratification of water column and the water retention time will be key elements controlling the CO2 emission from Amazonian reservoirs in the future. We highlight that the CO2 emissions from future planed Amazonian hydroelectric reservoirs are uncertain and will be highly dependent of regional climate and LULC changes.

Herein, a simple yet robust route is employed to simultaneously craft single-atomic Fe sites and graphitic layer-wrapped Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe3C@GL NPs) encapsulated within 1D N-doped hollow mesoporous carbon tubes (denoted Fe-N-HMCTs). The successional compositional and structural crafting of the hydrothermally self-templated polyimide tubes (PITs), enabled by Fe species incorporation and acid leaching treatment, respectively, yields Fe-N-HMCTs that are subsequently exploited as the ORR electrocatalyst. Remarkably, an alkaline electrolyte capitalizing on Fe-N-HMCTs achieves excellent ORR activity (onset potential, 0.992 V; half-wave potential, 0.872 V), favorable long-term stability, and strong methanol tolerance, outperforming the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. Such impressive ORR performances of the Fe-N-HMCTs originate from the favorable configuration of active sites (i.e., atomically dispersed Fe-Nx sites and homogeneously incorporated Fe3C@GL NPs) in conjunction with the advantageous 1D hollow tubular architecture containing adequate mesoporous surface.

However, green spaces in hot and humid regions risk being underutilized by residents unless thermal environments are designed to be sufficiently comfortable. Understanding what conditions are needed for comfortable outdoor spaces, particularly how people feel in regard to their thermal environment, is vital in designing spaces for public use. Traditional gardens are excellent examples of successful microclimate design from which we can learn, as they are developed over the generations through observation and modification. This study analyzed how Japanese gardens affect people’s thermal stress on extremely hot summer days. Meteorological data was collected in three Japanese gardens, and human thermal comfort was evaluated through physiological equivalent temperature (PET). Statistical analysis examined the relationship between spatial configurations of the gardens and thermal comfort. Our study revealed that Japanese gardens can efficiently ameliorate thermal stress. Spatial analysis showed that garden elements affect thermal comfort variously depending on time of the day and spatial distribution. © 2021 by the authors.

This study draws lessons from the preliminary pilot projects that some provinces and cities have conducted, aiming to provide insights that will inform policy and decision makers in effectively designing future EC initiatives. By reviewing 45 case studies, we find that EC has typical regional characteristics with high provincial heterogeneity regarding the compensation factor, compensation formula, and compensation standard. Although great efforts have been made in the pilots, China's municipal EC programs still have much room for improvement. Currently, nearly 93% of regions have adopted the territorial model to define environmental responsibility for monitoring sites, and 68% have not implemented the urban and county classification assessment. We argue that both actions will weaken the effectiveness of the EC policy because they cannot clearly define regional environmental responsibilities. To ensure fairness, this study suggests the simultaneous adoption of shared responsibility by adjacent administrative regions and the territorial model, when calculating the environmental responsibility of each assessed object. This study not only reveals the progress and challenges of China's EC practices in air quality but also provides important references for the construction of EC mechanisms in other regions. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Case study; China; Ecosystem service payment; Territorial model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100426373

Fortunately, the carbon emission trading scheme, a powerful tool for reducing carbon emissions, has been established in many countries to slow catastrophic climate change thus promoting human well-being. The nexuses between energy and European carbon markets have been extensively studied due to the grim reality of global climate change. However, no literature to date has examined the multi-scale associations between China's energy and regional CET markets. This paper aims to fill this gap by utilizing a proposed wavelet-based multi-scale investigation framework to explore the information spillovers and dynamic dependence over different time horizons. The original energy and carbon return series are decomposed by the MODWT method. The TVP-VAR-based connectedness and the DECO-FIGARCH model are then built at each selected wavelet component. The wavelet coherence method is also applied to depict the time-frequency dependence. The empirical results demonstrate that the information spillovers at multivariate time-scales are heterogeneous. Generally, GDEA and the crude oil markets act as the information spillover net-transmitters at the raw data level and all wavelet scales. The dynamic spillovers present significant time-varying features and a similar evaluation trajectory. Besides, we offer strong evidence of a low dynamic equicorrelation between China's energy and regional CET markets, suggesting the portfolio diversification benefits. Furthermore, the information spillover and dependence are proved to be more significant at longer time horizons. Finally, the energy-carbon portfolios offer diversification opportunities, and the risk reduction effectiveness varies with wavelet scales. Moreover, the optimal-weighted portfolio exhibits the best risk management performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China's energy and carbon markets; Dynamic dependence; Information spillovers; Multi-scale","Carbon; Commerce; Risk management; Sustainable development; Carbon emission trading; Environmental governances; Global climate changes; Information spillovers; Multi scale analysis; Portfolio diversification; Risk management performance; Wavelet components; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099223582

Other analytical techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, proximate and ultimate analyses, calorimetric analysis (HHV/LHV), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), were also applied to characterize them. The TG/DTG curves identified the main thermal degradation stages of the lignocellulosic materials, which correspond to average contents of hemicellulose (49.1%), cellulose (31.7%), lignin (16.2%), moisture (10.0%), ash (6.3%), volatile materials (68.0%), and fixed carbon (16.0%). X-rays showed a crystallinity index for the biomasses between 53.0 and 60.0%, confirming crystalline and amorphous regions. Metal composition determination by ICP-OES identified the main metallic and inorganic materials (K, Ca, Al, and Fe) present in the samples. SEM images revealed some morphological and structural differences, for example pores, roughness, fibers, and lamellae. FTIR was used mainly to evaluate the presence of energy bands or oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen bonds, confirming the data obtained by the ultimate analysis. EDS identified the behavior of the main organic and inorganic elements. All the results presented demonstrate the importance of this research and its application to science. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Bioenergy; Cassava waste; Gaseous emissions; Thermal process","Carbon; Crystallinity; Degradation; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fossil fuels; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen bonds; Inductively coupled plasma; Lignocellulosic biomass; Nanocrystalline materials; Optical emission spectroscopy; Plants (botany); Scanning electron microscopy; Thermoanalysis; Bio-energy; Chemical characterization; Energy dispersive spectroscopies (EDS); Environmental legislations; Fourier transform infrared; Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry; Lignocellulosic material; Thermal process; Waste incineration; Carbon; Crystallinity; Degradation; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Gases; Hydrogen Bonds",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078405125

The purpose of this study was to link spatiotemporal variations in TROPOMI methane (CH4) columns to meteorological flow patterns over the Permian Basin, the largest oil and second-largest natural gas producing region in the United States. Over a two-year period (1 December 2018–1 December 2020), the largest average CH4 enhancements were observed near and to the north and west of the primary emission regions. Four case study periods—two with moderate westerly winds associated with passing weather disturbances (8–15 March 2019 and 1 April–10 May 2019) and two other periods dominated by high pressure and low wind speeds (16–23 March 2019 and 24 September–9 October 2020)—were analyzed to better understand meteorological drivers of the variability in CH4. Meteorological observations and analyses combined with TROPOMI observations suggest that weakened transport out of the Basin during low wind speed periods contributes to CH4 enhancements throughout the Basin, while valley and slope flows may explain the observed western expansion of the Permian Basin CH4 anomaly. © 2021 by the authors.

However, given these topics are not investigated by a single epistemic community, the literature base underpinning the associated research continues to be undefined. Here, we aim to delineate a plausible body of literature capturing a comprehensive spectrum of demand, services and social aspects of climate change mitigation. As method we use a novel double-stacked expert-machine learning research architecture and expert evaluation to develop a typology and map key messages relevant for climate change mitigation within this body of literature. First, relying on the official key words provided to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by governments (across 17 queries), and on specific investigations of domain experts (27 queries), we identify 121 165 non-unique and 99 065 unique academic publications covering issues relevant for demand-side mitigation. Second, we identify a literature typology with four key clusters: policy, housing, mobility, and food/consumption. Third, we systematically extract key content-based insights finding that the housing literature emphasizes social and collective action, whereas the food/consumption literatures highlight behavioral change, but insights also demonstrate the dynamic relationship between behavioral change and social norms. All clusters point to the possibility of improved public health as a result of demand-side solutions. The centrality of the policy cluster suggests that political actions are what bring the different specific approaches together. Fourth, by mapping the underlying epistemic communities we find that researchers are already highly interconnected, glued together by common interests in sustainability and energy demand. We conclude by outlining avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration, synthetic analysis, community building, and by suggesting next steps for evaluating this body of literature. © 2021 The Author(s).

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a risk factor for dementia and structural brain changes. It remains to be determined whether transient insulin deprivation that frequently occurs in insulin-treated individuals with T1D alters brain function. METHODS. We therefore performed functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and neuropsychological testing at baseline and following 5.4 ± 0.6 hours of insulin deprivation in 14 individuals with T1D and compared results with those from 14 age-, sex-, and BMI-matched nondiabetic (ND) participants with no interventions. RESULTS. Insulin deprivation in T1D increased blood glucose, and β-hydroxybutyrate, while reducing bicarbonate levels. Participants with T1D showed lower baseline brain N-acetyl aspartate and myo-inositol levels but higher cortical fractional anisotropy, suggesting unhealthy neurons and brain microstructure. Although cognitive functions did not differ between participants with T1D and ND participants at baseline, significant changes in fine motor speed as well as attention and short-term memory occurred following insulin deprivation in participants with T1D. Insulin deprivation also reduced brain adenosine triphosphate levels and altered the phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate ratio. Baseline differences in functional connectivity in brain regions between participants with T1D and ND participants were noted, and on insulin deprivation further alterations in functional connectivity between regions, especially cortical and hippocampus-caudate regions, were observed. These alterations in functional connectivity correlated to brain metabolites and to changes in cognition. CONCLUSION. Transient insulin deprivation therefore caused alterations in executive aspects of cognitive function concurrent with functional connectivity between memory regions and the sensory cortex. These findings have important clinical implications, as many patients with T1D inadvertently have periods of transient insulin deprivation.

The regions near the Amazon rainforest presented much higher and faster contaminations. This paper attempts to explain this phenomenon through a global analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil. It also investigates the relationship between climate conditions and airborne transmission with the evolution of contagion in the Amazonian states. The method of investigation of the spread of SARS-COV-2 in these different macro-environments was based on the analysis of three extensive daily official databases on the number of deaths, the percentage of adherence of the populations to the restriction policies, and the local climatic conditions. Besides, the social conditions in those States were also taken into account. Then, it was compared the epidemiologic results for States with very different climatic characteristics and that had adopted, almost simultaneously, similar social isolation measures. However, all these analyses were not able to explain the remarkable difference in the evolution of the pandemic among Brazilian regions. So, it was necessary to invoke airborne transmission, facilitated by the very high air humidity, as a decisive factor to explain the faster evolution of contagion in the rainforest region.

A hydrocarbon seep near Scott Inlet, Baffin Bay, was visited for in situ observations and sampling in the summer of 2018. Video evidence of an active hydrocarbon seep was confirmed by methane and hydrocarbon analysis of the overlying water column, which is 260 m at this site. Elevated methane concentrations in bottom water above and down current from the seep decreased to background seawater levels in the mid-water column >150 m above the seafloor. Seafloor microbial mats morphologically resembling sulfide-oxidizing bacteria surrounded areas of bubble ebullition. Calcareous tube worms, brittle stars, shrimp, sponges, sea stars, sea anemones, sea urchins, small fish and soft corals were observed near the seep, with soft corals showing evidence for hydrocarbon incorporation. Sediment microbial communities included putative methane-oxidizing Methyloprofundus, sulfate-reducing Desulfobulbaceae and sulfide-oxidizing Sulfurovum. A metabolic gene diagnostic for aerobic methanotrophs (pmoA) was detected in the sediment and bottom water above the seep epicentre and up to 5 km away. Both 16S rRNA gene and pmoA amplicon sequencing revealed that pelagic microbial communities oriented along the geologic basement rise associated with methane seepage (running SW to NE) differed from communities in off-axis water up to 5 km away. Relative abundances of aerobic methanotrophs and putative hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were elevated in the bottom water down current from the seep. Detection of bacterial clades typically associated with hydrocarbon and methane oxidation highlights the importance of Arctic marine microbial communities in mitigating hydrocarbon emissions from natural geologic sources. © 2020 The Authors","Arctic hydrocarbon seep; Benthic megafauna; Methane; Methanotrophs; Microbial communities","Aerobic bacteria; Biodegradation; Ecosystems; Genes; Mammals; Methane; RNA; Shellfish; Stars; Sulfur compounds; Hydrocarbon analysis; Hydrocarbon degrading bacteria; Hydrocarbon emission; In-situ observations; Methane concentrations; Microbial communities; Natural laboratories; Sulfide-oxidizing bacteria; Hydrocarbons; hydrocarbon; methane; RNA 16S; sea water; hydrocarbon; methane; RNA 16S; benthos; hydrocarbon seep; marine ecosystem; marine sediment; methane; methanotrophy; microbial community; microbial mat; seafloor; amplicon; animal tissue; Arctic; Article; bay; brittle star; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coral; Desulfobulbaceae; fish; gene; gene sequence; hydrocarbon seep; marine environment; methanotrophic bacterium; Methyloprofundus; microbial community; microbial mat; nonhuman; pmoA gene; priority journal; RNA gene; sea; sea anemone; sea urchin; shrimp; starfish; sulfide oxidizing bacterium; Sulfurovum; summer; videorecording; worm; animal; bay; microflora; phylogeny; sediment; Arctic Ocean; Baffin Bay [Arctic Ocean]; Actiniaria; Alcyonacea; Asteroidea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Decapoda (Crustacea); Desulfobulbaceae; Echinoidea; Ophiuroidea; Porifera; Sulfurovum; Tubicolae; Animals; Bays; Geologic Sediments; Hydrocarbons; Methane; Microbiota; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098143959

In regions where the installation of PV technology is advantageous because of high irradiance areas, in many cases, also possess arid or desert climates that inherently exhibit greater surface soiling. Because of the energy production and associated maintenance-cost factors, it is advantageous to evaluate environmental factors (meteorological variables, climate, and geographical features) as early as possible in developing a PV installation. Alternatively, the determination of the soiling rates (SRate), even after system commissioning can aid in the optimization of maintenance and cleaning-cycle requirements. Significant research has been reported addressing these critical factors through determining local soiling losses. This article presents, evaluates, and compares methodologies to accurately determine and compare SRate and losses from soiling monitoring stations and installed PV systems operating in Belo Horizonte, Brazil (latitude-19.92°, longitude-43.99°). Specifically, data collected from soiling stations were used to estimate the soiling ratio (SRatio) and SRate. A related process is applied to the PV system, using the performance ratio. The methodology incorporates several key refinements. These include normalization and adjustment for the meteorological parameters (temperature and irradiance). Additionally, the differences between the measured global horizontal irradiance (GHI), the plane-of-array irradiance (GPOA) obtained through the application of a transposition model, and the plane-of-array measured by reference cell (Gref) are presented and compared. The results demonstrate that the transposition model is an acceptable option for cases in which only GHI measurements are available. © 2011-2012 IEEE.","Climate; photovoltaic (PV) system; soiling monitoring station; soiling rate; soiling ratio","Solar power generation; Energy productions; Environmental factors; Equatorial climate; Geographical features; Meteorological parameters; Meteorological variables; Monitoring stations; Photovoltaic modules; Solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099726510

Data are scarce, catchments are highly human-modified and streamflow exhibits strong nonlinear responses to rainfall. The goal of this study was to evaluate the monthly and seasonal streamflow forecasting in two large catchments in the Jaguaribe River Basin in the Brazilian semi-arid area. We adopted four different lead times: one month ahead for monthly scale and two, three and four months ahead for seasonal scale. The gaps of the historic streamflow series were filled up by using rainfall-runoff modelling. Then, time series model techniques were applied, i.e., the locally constant, the locally averaged, the k-nearest-neighbours algorithm (k-NN) and the autoregressive (AR) model. The criterion of reliability of the validation results is that the forecast is more skillful than streamflow climatology. Our approach outperformed the streamflow climatology for all monthly streamflows. On average, the former was 25% better than the latter. The seasonal streamflow forecasting (SSF) was also reliable (on average, 20% better than the climatology), failing slightly only for the high flow season of one catchment (6% worse than the climatology). Considering an uncertainty envelope (probabilistic forecasting), which was considerably narrower than the data standard deviation, the streamflow forecasting performance increased by about 50% at both scales. The forecast errors were mainly driven by the streamflow intra-seasonality at monthly scale, while they were by the forecast lead time at seasonal scale. The best-fit and worst-fit time series model were the k-NN approach and the AR model, respectively. The rainfall-runoff modelling outputs played an important role in improving streamflow forecasting for one streamgauge that showed 35% of data gaps. The developed data-driven approach is mathematical and computationally very simple, demands few resources to accomplish its operational implementation and is applicable to other dryland watersheds. Our findings may be part of drought forecasting systems and potentially help allocating water months in advance. Moreover, the developed strategy can serve as a baseline for more complex streamflow forecast systems. © 2021, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","dryland hydrology; nonlinear time series analysis; probabilistic streamflow forecasting; rainfall-runoff modelling; reconstructed streamflow data; stochastic dynamical systems","catchment; nonlinearity; probability; rainfall-runoff modeling; reconstruction; river basin; seasonal variation; stochasticity; streamflow; time series analysis; Brazil; Ceara; Jaguaribe Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109016224

It comprises five cave levels over a 154 m altitudinal range, specifically Ulivo (340 m a.s.l.), Colombo (247 m a.s.l.), Upper Santa Lucia (215 m a.s.l.), Lower Santa Lucia (201 m a.s.l.) and Bàsura (186 m a.s.l.) caves. The system is active at lower altitudes, as testified by the thermal spring currently located at 70 m a.s.l. along the Varatella valley. Speleogenesis was attributed to the action of epigenic processes by other authors. However, the extraordinary geodiversity of the underground morphologies and deposits are at odds with this interpretation. Accordingly, this work investigates the genesis of the Toirano karst system, in relation to the landscape evolution of the surrounding area. A detailed morphological and mineralogical investigation of cave geoforms and deposits, together with the presence of the active low thermal sulphide spring on the Varatella valley and only ~100 m below the Bàsura Cave, sustain the hypothesis of a hypogene origin of the caves. This work shows that most of the caves formed close to the former water table (base) level, in turn determined by the mean sea level. Geochronological analyses, including U/Th (n = 13) and cosmogenic burial (n = 1) dating, together with an estimated incision rate of the Varatella valley of around 0.1 mm y−1, have allowed to assess the age of the highest cave (Ulivo) at around 2.7 Ma, Colombo at ~1.8 Ma, Upper Santa Lucia at ~1.5 Ma, Lower Santa Lucia ~1.3 Ma and Bàsura at ~1.2 Ma. Estimated palaeotemperature attained through isotope analyses and fluid inclusions on speleothems suggest that the temperature of rising waters was lower than 50 °C and possibly ranging between ~12 and ~20 °C, indicating that hydrothermal fluids were not the main driver of speleogenesis, at least in the late speleogenic phases. Additionally, sulphuric acid speleogenesis by-products were not identified. Accordingly, hypogenic speleogenesis occurred because of the action of low temperature CO2-rich rising fluids. A late stage of epigenic speleogenesis has been detected because of the clear evidences of condensation-corrosion morphologies, taking place since ~150 ka (possibly earlier) when caves were finally connected to the surface because of valley enlargement. Besides uncovering the genesis of the Toirano karst system, this study demonstrates that the combination of local geology, surface vs underground geomorphological observations, climate change vs landscape evolution evaluation and geochemical data is of key importance for interpreting subsurface land-shaping processes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cave geomorphology; Dating; Hypogene karst; Speleogenesis; Stable isotopes","cave system; condensation; corrosion; dating method; dolostone; geomorphology; landscape evolution; speleology; speleothem; stable isotope; Italy; Liguria; Savona; Toirano",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098467801

In Europe, air quality remains poor in many areas, despite reductions in emissions and ambient concentrations. Air pollution and climate change are the biggest environmental concerns for Europeans, implying concerted and integrated actions to tackle them. The revised 2016 European National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD) enforces Member States to implement strategies, based on emission reduction measures, aimed to comply with targets by 2030 and achieve European Union (EU) and World Health Organization air quality objectives for environment and health protection. Despite those strategies are designed for 2030, the influence of climate change on air quality is not accounted for. In this sense, the purpose of this paper is the evaluation of the climate change impact on future air quality, taking into consideration emission reduction measures. The WRF-CAMx air quality modelling system was applied over Europe for one year selected as representative of a short-term changing climate (around 2030), and compared to a base case year, to estimate to what extent the climate variables by themselves could positively or negatively influence air quality. Results indicate that meteorological conditions may be decisive for the air quality state in the future. Differences between future and present simulations pointed to a global decrease of ozone levels in the future; increases and decreases in particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide concentrations over different seasons and European regions. This work is intended to contribute to a better understanding of the influence of climate variables on air quality improvement strategies as an additional support to European environmental authorities in developing the National Air Pollution Control Programmes in the scope of NECD. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality impacts; Climate modelling; Europe; NECD (National Emission Ceilings Directive)","Air quality; Emission control; Health; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Air quality improvement; Air quality modelling system; Ambient concentrations; Climate change impact; Environmental Authority; Environmental concerns; Meteorological condition; World Health Organization; Climate change; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; concentration (composition); future prospect; policy development; pollution control; pollution policy; strategic approach; air pollution; air quality; Article; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; European; high temperature; limit of quantitation; particulate matter; precipitation; priority journal; seasonal variation; simulation; trend study; urban area; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097649910

Eight factors were identified, two of them directly related to the handling of bulk materials (Limestone + gypsum and Clinker), accounting jointly for 35% of the average PM10 concentration. A Road traffic factor was the second highest contributor to PM10 levels (17%) while the Shipping emissions factor accounted for only 6% of the average PM10 mass.

Results indicate that emission abatement strategies should primarily focus on the reduction of fugitive emissions caused by the handling of bulk materials at the docks. Moreover, scenarios including reductions of more than 50% in bulk handling sources and 10% in other anthropogenic sources would help to reduce anthropogenic exceedances of the daily PM10 limit (50 μg·m−3) and to approach to WHO daily PM10 standard (20 μg m−3). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bulk materials; Harbor; PM10; PMF; Port; Source apportionment","biomass burning; concentration (composition); gypsum; Mediterranean environment; nitrate; particulate matter; port operation; quantitative analysis; sea salt; source apportionment; Alicante [Comunidad Valencia]; Comunidad Valencia; Spain; Subgroup A; air pollutant; city; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; Spain; Air Pollutants; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098211831

During the process of finding out a feasible solution for quick disposal of agricultural waste in a safer way, a novel method has been developed by the authors in which crop residue is converted into a useful product, biochar, which can be applied back to the fields for amendment of soil. It not only reduces the introduction of harmful gases into the environment but also improves the physical and chemical properties of the soil. This method is very simple and can be adopted by an individual farmer without much investment and technical skills. Many studies have been conducted on the factors involved in the production and use of biochar as a soil amendment; but in India, not much work has been carried out yet, as it is relatively a new concept in terms of using biomass for biochar production and application. Although biochar is not a new product, it has drawn the attention of researchers and other stakeholders in the near past because of its usefulness in improving the physical and chemical properties of the soil and at the same time reducing greenhouse gas emission, which is one of the biggest challenges for the modern world to protect the environment. © 2021 Technoscience Publications.

The low yield of PHBV’s production is the main hindrance to its sustainable production, and the manipulation of PHBV production processes could potentially overcome this obstacle. The present research investigated evolutionarily divergent cyanobacteria obtained from local environments of Thailand. Among the strains tested, Cyanosarcina sp. AARL T020, a hot spring cyanobacterium, showed a high rate of PHBV accumulation with a fascinating 3‐hydroxyvalerate mole fraction. A two‐stage cultivation strategy with sole organic carbon supplementation was successful in maximizing cyanobacterial PHBV production. The use of an optimized medium in the first stage of cultivation provided a 4.9‐fold increase in biomass production. Subsequently, the addition of levulinic acid in the second stage of cultivation can induce significant biomass and PHBV production. With this strategy, the final biomass production and PHBV productivity were increased by 6.5 and 73.2 fold, respectively. The GC‐MS, FTIR, and NMR analyses confirmed that the obtained PHBV consisted of two subunits of 3‐hydroxyvaryrate and 3‐hydroxybutyrate. Interestingly, the cyanobacterial PHBV contained a very high 3‐hydroxyvalerate mole fraction (94%) exhibiting a low degree of crystallinity and expanding in processability window, which could be applied to polymers for desirable advanced applications. © 2021 by the authors.

We used a locally adapted and calibrated model describing soil organic carbon dynamics under the impact of climate change and a broad range of scenarios combining increased use of organic amendments, reduced soil tillage, and increased land area for the local market. We found that, in its current state, only 26% of agricultural area could achieve a 4‰ year−1 increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in the coming 30 years, due mainly to perennial cropping systems (sugarcane, banana, orchards) occupying soils with the lowest SOC stocks. Implementing reduced tillage with increased use of locally produced composts would increase the agricultural area reaching the 4 per 1000 target to 31%. However, at territory scale, all scenarios tested showed an annual decrease in SOC stocks varying from − 0.1 to − 3.2‰. The limited area on which the 4 per 1000 target is feasible and generalized SOC losses were mainly linked to the current high SOC stocks in volcanic and calcareous soils on the island and lack of practices capable of further increasing C inputs in current cropping systems. We concluded that C sequestration potential in the Caribbean is rather limited and that increasing SOC stocks, even lower than 4 per 1000, should be the primary target in adaptation to climate change, by increasing the resilience of cropping systems based mainly on SOC-poor soils. © 2021, The Author(s).","C sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Compost use; Cropping system; Land use change; Reduced tillage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099832060

Uttarakhand, being a sensitive mountainous region in India, faces the brunt of frequent climate-related disasters and their severe impacts. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how authorities perceive the issue of climate-related disasters and their level of commitment toward mitigation and adaptation programs. Design/methodology/approach: The literature review method was used for a holistic understanding of the impact of climate change and consequential disasters. A questionnaire survey method, comprising open- and closed-ended questions, was also used on officials of different departments. Findings: Among the noteworthy findings of the study include the understanding of the perceptions of authorities and their role in decision-making on mitigating impacts of climate change-related disasters, their support or lack of it, for measures toward capacity building and spreading awareness of the intervention programs by the government. The study analyzes the perception of decision-making officials at state and district levels and infers that the variation on opinions may be attributable to multiple factors, including their past experiences of dealing with disasters. Originality/value: This study offers insights into the role of perception of local government officials concerning climate change-related disasters and alleviation of their consequences through related programs. The findings have the unique potential to serve as a guide for the government at state and district levels to assess various aspects of different disaster mitigation measures based on sectors and departments. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Climate change; Disaster; Extreme events; Government officials; Perception; Resilience","capacity building; climate change; decision making; holistic approach; literature review; local government; mitigation; mountain region; perception; questionnaire survey; India; Uttarakhand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089856115

However, its intermittency leads to a wide gap between supply and demand of the user. The battery energy storage in conjunction with the wind generation system controls the energy flow and curb the variability issues hampering the power quality of the grid. Here, in this work, wind power based microgrid is interfaced to a 3-phase AC distribution network with seamless transfer between the grid to standalone/standalone to the grid operating mode. In the case of the grid failure, the control seamlessly transits from the current control to the voltage control. The grid connected mode and standalone mode of operation are enabled according to the signal provided to the static transfer switches (STS). The power quality (PQ) improvement along with energy surety and sufficiency are perceived by managing the local load support. The self-correcting sign-sign (SCSS) adaptive filter is used to control the microgrid in the grid connected mode of operation, while the enhanced proportional resonant (EPR) controller with binary generalized integrator based phase locked loop (BGI-PLL) is utilized in the voltage control mode. The improved encoderless scheme adopted to estimate the speed and rotor position of the wind generator, reduces the cost of the mechanical sensors.

Most approaches to engaging society with energy and climate change fail to address the systemic nature of this challenge, focusing on discrete forms of participation in specific parts of wider systems. Our systemic approach combines comparative case mapping of diverse public engagements across energy systems with participatory distributed deliberative mapping of energy system futures. We show how UK public participation with energy is more diverse than dominant approaches posit. Attending to these more varied models of participation opens up citizen and specialist views, values and visions of sustainable energy transitions, revealing support for more distributed energy system futures that recognize the roles of society. Going beyond narrow, discrete understandings of communication and public engagement towards systemic approaches to mapping participation can provide plural and robust forms of social intelligence needed to govern low-carbon transitions in more socially responsive, just and responsible ways. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Carbon; Climate change; Public policy; Distributed energy systems; Low carbon energies; Low-carbon transitions; Public engagement; Public participation; Social intelligence; Sustainable energy; Systemic approach; Mapping; alternative energy; climate change; communication; future prospect; local participation; mapping; participatory approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105763674

Public elementary school students in Yunlin County, which was severely affected by river-dust, were selected as the participants. Study 1 consisted of three-wave follow-up data (801 person-times) in high-/low-dust exposure regions to examine pulmonary function. Study 2 used 147 and 73 students in the high-/low-dust exposure regions, respectively, to establish our health education intervention. Paired t tests, repeated measures ANOVA, and generalized estimating equation were used to analyze the short- and long-term effects. The results showed that the students’ pulmonary function in schools that installed protective equipment was improved. The health education (such as the usage of correct masks and our designed PM2.5 full-cover sand-proof clothing) improved the students’ cognition and behaviors related to river-dust episodes and yielded both short- and long-term effects. Therefore, we suggest more schools with high-dust exposure to adopt protective equipment and health education program.

Climate change will affect the timing and quantity of water available in the environment as well as have an adverse effect on the quality of that water. Floods, droughts, and changing patterns of water scarcity—when water is not available in sufficient enough quantities or of a suitable quality at the right time to fulfill demand—are all critical factors when considering how and where Indiana will be able to economically develop in the future. Management of water resources will become even more important as different sectors try to minimize the risk of water scarcity in the face of increasing climate variability. This paper focuses on observed changes to Indiana’s water resources and how the availability and quality of those resources are likely to change in the face of future climate. Generally, Indiana is becoming wetter but with the projected increase coming primarily in the winter and spring. Summer water use will increase the likelihood of water shortages and the need for improved water management.

This phenomenon mainly ascribes to the lack of effective geometry and electronic engineering of copper active center from an atomic level. Herein, highly exposed atomically dispersed Cu-Nx (x denotes Cu–N coordination number) sites anchored on 3D porous carbon matrix are successfully synthesized through facile one step thermal activation, and Cu-N4 sites exhibit boosted activity and selectivity compared to its nearly inert Cu-N3 counterparts. Aided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the edge-hosted Cu-N4 moieties are revealed as key active sites for efficient CO generation via optimized local coordination environment and electronic properties, which strongly interact with *COOH intermediate and facilitate the desorption of *CO. As a result, Cu-N4 catalyst achieves high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of over 90% from −0.6 to −1.1 V vs. RHE with a maximum value of 98%, surpassing the previously reported Cu SACs for CO2-to-CO conversion.

After sulfation roasting (acid-to-lithium molar ratio (nH2SO4:nLi) = 0.95, 550 °C and 3 h), the roasted products were subject to the 1st stage of water leaching. Under optimum conditions (30 °C, 2 h and liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio of 4 mL/g), the extraction of Li and Mn reached 90% and 10%, whereas extractions of Co and Ni were negligible. The water leaching residues were then treated by the 2nd stage of acidic leaching (2 mol/L H2SO4 solution with L/S ratio of 5 mL/g at 60 °C for 2 h) which resulted in an additional 98% Ni, 97% Co and 90% Mn being leached from the residue. An investigation of the phase transformation mechanism indicated that the extraction behaviors of valuable metals might be induced by the different reduction pathways of the metals while controlling the roasting conditions. With roasting temperature &lt;550 °C and roasting time &lt;2 h, Li within the crystalline LiCoxNiyMn1-x-yO2 was de-intercalated and transformed to soluble Li2SO4, while Ni, Co and Mn in the LiCoxNiyMn1-x-yO2 decomposed to MnCo2O4 and Ni6MnO8 because of the co-existence of sulfuric acid and carbon reductant from the graphite anode material. When nH2SO4:nLi was higher than 1.2, Li was further converted to Li2Mn2(SO4)3. Under the conditions of roasting temperature &gt; 550 °C and roasting time &gt;2 h, MnCo2O4 and Ni6MnO8 were further reduced into low-valence states CoO and (NiO)0.75(MnO)0.25.

While measures to improve air quality in megacities such as Delhi are typically aimed at reducing levels of particulate matter (PM), ozone could become a greater threat if these measures focus on PM alone, as some air pollution mitigation steps can actually lead to an increase in surface ozone. A better understanding of the factors controlling ozone production in Delhi and the impact that PM mitigation measures have on ozone is therefore critical for improving air quality. Here, we combine in situ observations and model analysis to investigate the impact of PM reduction on the non-linear relationship between volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone. In situ measurements of NOx, VOC, and ozone were conducted in Delhi during the APHH-India programme in summer (June) and winter (November) 2018. We observed hourly averaged ozone concentrations in the city of up to 100 ppbv in both seasons. We performed sensitivity simulations with a chemical box model to explore the impacts of PM on the non-linear VOC-NOx-ozone relationship in each season through its effect on aerosol optical depth (AOD). We find that ozone production is limited by VOC in both seasons, and is particularly sensitive to solar radiation in winter. Reducing NOx alone increases ozone, such that a 50% reduction in NOx emissions leads to 10-50% increase in surface ozone. In contrast, reducing VOC emissions can reduce ozone efficiently, such that a 50% reduction in VOC emissions leads to ∼60% reduction in ozone. Reducing PM alone also increases ozone, especially in winter, by reducing its dimming effects on photolysis, such that a 50% reduction in AOD can increase ozone by 25% and it also enhances VOC-limitation. Our results highlight the importance of reducing VOC emissions alongside PM to limit ozone pollution, as well as benefitting control of PM pollution through reducing secondary organic aerosol. This will greatly benefit the health of citizens and the local ecosystem in Delhi, and could have broader application for other megacities characterized by severe PM pollution and VOC-limited ozone production.

The objective of this study is to explore the response of N loss (leaching, NH3 volatilization and N2O emission) to different biochar applications (0,20,40 t/hm2) and irrigation patterns (controlled irrigation, flooding irrigation) in paddy fields of the Taihu Lake region (TLR) with the combination of field experiments and laboratory analysis. Based on the long-term observation of rice growth period, the ammonium N (NH4+–N), nitrate N (NO3−–N) and total N (TN) leaching of paddy fields applied with water-saving irrigation (WSI) and biochar was measured in the plots of lysimeter. The impact of biochar application on NH3 volatilization, N2O emission in different water-carbon modes were clarified and the effect of water-carbon management modes on rice yield and yield components was analyzed. The results showed that the application of biochar reduced the NO3−–N and TN leaching by 29.98%–38.63% and 12.77%–13.36%, increased rice seed setting rate and actual yield by 12.15%–15.28% and 1.67%–5.54%. Biochar addition inhibited NH3 volatilization and N2O emission. Under low-volume biochar (20 t/hm2), the main form of N leaching in rice fields was NO3−–N, the NO3−–N leaching accounted for 33.67% – 50.24% of the TN leaching; under high-volume biochar (40 t/hm2), N leaching in rice field was dominated by NH4+–N, the NH4+–N leaching accounted for 16.50% – 47.47% of the TN leaching. Controlled irrigation can not only reduce the water leakage in paddy fields but also reduce the N concentration in water leakage compared with flooding irrigation so that the total leaching of NH4+–N, NO3−–N and TN in rice fields can be reduced by 23.44%, 47.89% and 50.69%. This study suggests that to make biochar beneficial for reducing environmental impacts of soil N effluxes and realizing cleaner production in rice cultivation, WSI technique and adapted use of biochar are of great importance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; N leaching; N2O emission; NH3 volatilization; Paddy field; Water-saving irrigation","Agricultural robots; Ammonia; Carbon; Cultivation; Floods; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Leaching; Leakage (fluid); Nitrogen fertilizers; Pollution control; Water conservation; Cleaner production; Controlled irrigations; Irrigation patterns; Laboratory analysis; Long term observations; Non-point source pollution; Utilization efficiency; Water-saving irrigation; Agricultural runoff",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099229107

Previous studies have investigated temporal changes in flood risk with various single factor, few have considered the joint effects of climate change, urbanization and socio-economic development. Here, based on the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of future (2030–2050) flood risk over the PRD combined with a thorough investigation of climate change, urbanization and socio-economic development. Precipitation extremes were projected using the regional climate model RegCM4.6, and urbanization growth was projected based on the CA-Markov model. The economic and population development was estimated by the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). Flood risk mapping with different RCPs-urbanization-SSPs scenarios was developed for the PRD based on the set pair analyze theory. The results show that climate change and urbanization are expected to exacerbate flood risk in most parts of the PRD during the next few decades, concurrently with more intense extreme precipitation events. The high flood risk areas are projected mainly in the urban regions with unfavorable terrain and dense population. The highest flood risk areas are expected to increase by 8.72% and 19.80% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions may effectively mitigate the flood risk over the PRD. This study highlight the links between flood risk and changing environment, suggesting that flood risk management and preventative actions should be included in regional adaptation strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Flood risk; Pearl River Delta; Set pair analyze; SSP scenarios; Urbanization","Climate change; Climate models; Economic and social effects; Economics; Flood control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Markov processes; Precipitation (meteorology); Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Adaptation strategies; Climate change impact; Comprehensive assessment; Extreme precipitation events; Flood risk management; Precipitation extremes; Regional climate modeling; Socio-economic development; Floods; climate change; climate effect; extreme event; flood control; flood damage; risk assessment; urbanization; article; carbon footprint; climate change; economic development; Markov chain; precipitation; risk assessment; risk management; river; theoretical study; urbanization; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094609866

Its quasi-one-dimensional counterpart, the penta-tetra-pentagonal (PTP) molecule chain, can be obtained by carving it from the 2D TPO-carbon structure, and it has also had much attention. Here, we present a first-principles study for the spin-dependent electron transport for model devices which consist of PTP molecule chains with different lengths sandwiching between two semi-infinite zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbon (zGNR) electrodes. By using the non-equilibrium Green’s function formalism in combination with density-functional theory, a length-independent, stable and perfect spin-filtering can be found in these PTP molecules based devices with parallel configuration in electrodes. Further, the coexistence of dual spin-filtering and -rectifying with a high ratio is demonstrated in the device with antiparallel spin configuration in electrodes. Interestingly, a two-state molecular conformational switch can be realized by mechanically rotating the plane between the PTP molecule chain and zGNR electrodes from coplanar to perpendicular, and the device exhibits a substantially large current modulation, and the ON/OFF switching ratio can reach up to 103within the considered bias window. Furthermore, the physical mechanisms are revealed and discussed by presenting the transmission spectra at the Fermi energy in combination with the separation of local device density of states at the Fermi level. All these theoretical predictions might trigger a new avenue to expand the application of carbon allotrope materials in nanoelectronics. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Density functional theory; Electrodes; Electron transport properties; Graphene; Graphene nanoribbon; Nanoribbons; Conformational switches; First-principles study; Multifunctional devices; Parallel configuration; Quasi-one dimensional; Spin configurations; Spin-dependent electron transport; Transmission spectrums; Molecules",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102924069

The authors question the assumptions behind evaluating the programme primarily on the grounds of aggregating its direct environmental impacts - whether with regard to protecting fragile ecosystems or promoting development that reduces greenhouse gas emissions - from thousands of small projects to the global level.

Conventional metal catalysts suffered from low durability and sluggish kinetics impede the practical application. On the other hand, doped carbon materials recently demonstrate superior catalytic performance in CERR, which shows the potential to diminish the problems of metal catalysts to some extent. Herein, we present the design and fabrication of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) co-doped metal-free carbon materials as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for reduction of CO2 to CO, which exhibits an excellent performance with a high faradaic efficiency of 92% (−0.55 V vs. RHE) and up to 24 h stability. A series of characterizations including TEM and XPS verified that nitrogen and phosphorous are successfully incorporated into the carbon matrix. Moreover, the comparisons between co-doping and single doping catalysts reveal that co-doping can significantly increase CERR performance. The improved catalytic activity is attributed to the synergetic effects between nitrogen and phosphorous dopants, which effectively modulate properties of the active site. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also performed to understand the synergy effects of dopants. It is revealed that the phosphorous doping can significantly lower the Gibbs free energy of COOH* formation. Moreover, the introduction of the second dopants phosphorous can reduce the reaction barrier along the reaction path and cause polarization of density of states at the Fermi level. These changes can greatly enhance the activity of the catalysts. From a combined experimental and computational exploration, current work provides valuable insights into the reaction mechanism of CERR on N, P co-doped carbon catalysts, and the influence from synergy effects between dopants, which paves the way for the rational design of novel metal-free catalysts for CO2 electro-reduction. © 2020 Science Press","Co-doping, DFT; CO2 reduction; Metal-free catalyst","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Computation theory; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Doping (additives); Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Greenhouse gases; Metals; Nitrogen; Petroleum prospecting; Phosphorus; Catalytic performance; Computational exploration; Electrocatalytic activity; Electrochemical reductions; Faradaic efficiencies; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Nitrogen-doped carbons; Value-added chemicals; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086672244

According to the results, the OC and EC concentrations were overestimated by approximately 22.8 ± 33.8 and 32.5 ± 33.5%, with the actual values being 11.9 ± 3.0 and 5.13 ± 2.24 μg m-3, respectively. It was found that carbonates had a larger influence from May to October than during the other months, which was significantly correlated with the amount of TSPs on the filter. Furthermore, the mass absorption cross-section of EC (MACEC) increased from 4.52 ± 1.32 to 6.02 ± 1.49 m2 g-1; this indicated that carbonates can significantly decrease MACEC, thus causing an underestimation of approximately 23.9 ± 16.7%.

From the perspective of city category, the low-carbon development scores present an order as follows: service-oriented cities > comprehensive cities > ecology-prioritized cities > industrial cities. Geologically speaking, eastern cites perform best, western cities come second and central cities come last. Of the three batches of low-carbon city pilots, the scores follow the pattern of Batch 1 > Batch 2 > Batch 3. Most cities are characterized by high carbon consumption and reduced efforts in low-carbon management and capital investment.

We conducted a field campaign in Ningbo to measure the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on air pollutants including NO2, O3 and CO from 21 January to 23 March 2020, using a home-made low-cost sensor package. The average concentrations of NO2, O3 and CO were observed to be 7.2, 37.5 and 648.5 ppb, respectively, during the lockdown. Compared with the previous year, the concentrations of NO2 and CO decreased by 63.1% and 6.9%, while the concentration of O3 increased by 37.9%. The significant reduction of NO2 concentration may be attributed to the reduced emissions of freighters and heavy trucks with lower port cargo throughput, which led to a decrease of NO concentration. The increase of O3 concentration was probably due to the lower titration of O3 by NO. After the lockdown, the concentrations of O3 and NO2 increased by 15.5% and 143.1%, respectively, compared with those during the lockdown. The temporal variations of the concentrations of NO2, O3 and CO measured by the sensor package were coincident with those obtained by the reference apparatus, which proves the sensor package to be suitable for air quality monitoring in field campaigns.

Since rider-hailing is a crowdsourcing system, the user scale can have a great impact on the emission performance of the system. A clearer pattern of the impact of user scale on emission performance of the ride-hailing system should be provided for better local market development and policymaking. In this study, based on massive Didi GPS records, we proposed a cross simulation model to evaluate the impact of user scale on the emission performance of the ride-hailing system and adapted the Gibbs sampling for a comprehensive computation. The result shows a strong impact of user scale on the emission performance. The mean of void cruising distance proportion varies from 2.12% to 44.58% under all situation simulation. Moreover, according to the simulation results under different day conditions, the relationship between the user scale and emission performance is not concerned with the day condition but the local regular travel pattern. Based on this relationship, we provided approximate user scales under expected thresholds of the emission and efficiency performance of ride-hailing.

The development of wind power in the Arctic can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this environmentally fragile region. In practice, wind power forecasting is essential to maintain the grid balance and optimize electricity generation. This study first applies various learning methods for wind power forecasting. It comprehensively compares the performance of models categorized by whether considering weather factors in the Arctic. Nine different representative types of machine-learning algorithms make several univariate time series forecasting, and their performance is evaluated. It is demonstrated that machine-learning approaches have an insignificant advantage over the persistence method in the univariate situation. With numerical weather prediction wind data and wind power data as inputs, the multivariate forecasting models are established and made one to six h in advance predictions. The multivariate models, especially with the advanced learning algorithms, show their edge over the univariate model based on the same algorithm. Although weather data are mesoscale, they can contribute to improving the wind power forecasting accuracy. Moreover, these results are generally valid for the five wind farms, proving the models' effectiveness and universality in this regional wind power utilization. Additionally, there is no clear evidence that predictive model performance is related to wind farms' topographic complexity. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Electricity generation; Machine learning approaches; Multivariate forecasting; Numerical weather prediction; Short-term wind power forecasting; Topographic complexity; Univariate time series; Wind power forecasting; Learning algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104849377

Nonetheless, most existing studies focus on the physical impacts rather than the economic impacts, failing to provide references for the cost-benefit analysis of different abatement policies and measures. With this motivation, this study firstly employs a downscaled climate system model to project temperature paths in the future. Then, an integrated model is established to quantify both physical and economic impacts of long-term future temperature rise on the existing ESI components. Finally, the maximum climate-attributable impacts on China's ESI are assessed for the period from 2018 to 2099. Our major findings are that: (1) 10.2% of the generator ratings, 17.8% of the transmission and distribution line ratings and 10.0% of the transformer ratings are at risk of outage from expected climate change effects. (2) Around $258 billion of the existing ESI assets are at risk of outage due to the future surface temperature rise, representing 14.2% of the ESI assets in 2017. (3) The impacts of climate change on ESI vary substantially among different provinces and among different infrastructure components. These obtained results can provide important guidance for the mitigation and adaption strategies for the climate change impacts on the electricity sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; Climate change; Electricity supply infrastructure; Temperature","Climate models; Cost benefit analysis; Economic and social effects; Outages; Climate change impact; Climate system model; Integrated modeling; Policies and measures; Reliable power supply; Surface temperatures; Transformer ratings; Transmission and distribution; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; cost-benefit analysis; electricity supply; estimation method; infrastructure; surface temperature; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099813590

Projections of temperature extremes across different climate zones and their impacts on related mortality and adaptation have not been well studied. Methods: We projected site-specific future temperature extremes by statistical downscaling of 8 global climate models followed by Bayesian model averaging from 2021 to 2060 across Taiwan under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. We then calculated the attributable mortality (AM) in 6 municipalities and in the eastern area by multiplying the city/county- and degree-specific relative risk of mortality according to the future population projections. We estimated the degree of adaptation to heat by slope reduction of the projected AM to be comparable with that in 2018. Results: The annual number of hot days with mean temperatures over 30 °C was predicted to have a substantial 2- to 5-fold increase throughout the residential areas of Taiwan by the end of 2060 under RCP8.5, whereas the decrease in cold days was less substantial. The decrease in cold-related mortality below 15 °C was projected to outweigh heat-related mortality for the next two decades, and then heat-related mortality was predicted to drastically increase and cross over cold-related mortality, surpassing it from 2045 to 2055. Adjusting for future population size, the percentage increase in heat-related deaths per 100,000 people could increase by more than 10-fold under the worst scenario (RCP8.5), especially for those over 65 years old. The heat-related impacts will be most severe in southern Taiwan, which has a tropical climate. There is a very high demand for heat-adaptation prior to 2050 under all RCP scenarios. Conclusions: Spatiotemporal variations in AM in cities in different climate zones are projected in Taiwan and are expected to have a net negative effect in the near future before shifting to a net positive effect from 2045 to 2055. However, there is an overall positive and increasing trend of net effect for elderly individuals under all the emission scenarios. Active adaptation plans need to be well developed to face future challenges due to climate change, especially for the elderly population in central and southern Taiwan. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian model average; Climate zone; Crossover; Representative concentration pathway; Statistical downscaling","Bayesian networks; Climate models; Population statistics; Bayesian model averaging; Elderly populations; Extreme temperature events; Global climate model; Heat related mortality; Spatio-temporal variation; Statistical downscaling; Temperature extremes; Climate change; air temperature; Bayesian analysis; downscaling; extreme event; mortality; population dynamics; regional climate; weather forecasting; aged; article; averaging; city; climate change; cold stress; controlled study; global climate; heat acclimatization; human; mortality risk; population projection; residential area; risk factor; Taiwan; tropic climate; Bayes theorem; epidemiology; heat; mortality; Taiwan; temperature; Taiwan; Aged; Bayes Theorem; Cities; Climate Change; Hot Temperature; Humans; Mortality; Taiwan; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095809705

In this study, we investigated the effects of carbon amendment in the subsoil on nitrate leaching and the emission of greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O) using a soil column experiment. Carbon amendment resulted in over 39% reduction in nitrate leaching and 25.3% to 60.6% increase of total N content in the subsoil zone as compared to non-amended control. Strikingly, the abundance of nirS, nosZ, and 16S rRNA were higher in the treatment than the corresponding controls while no significant effect was detected for nirK. Carbon amendment explained 14%, 10%, and 4% of the variation in the community of nosZ, nirS, and nirK, respectively. It also considerably (more than 7 times) enriched genera such as Anaerovorax, Pseudobacteroides, Magnetospirillum, Prolixibacter, Sporobacter, Ignavibacterium, Syntrophobacter, Oxobacter, Hydrogenispora, Desulfosporomusa, Mangrovibacterium, and Sporomusa, as revealed by the analysis of 16S rRNA amplicon. Network analysis further uncovered that carbon amendment enriched three microbial hubs which mainly consists of positively correlated nirS, nosZ, and anaerobic bacterial populations. In summary, carbon amendment in the subsoil mitigated nitrate leaching and increased the nitrogen pool by possible activation of denitrifying and anaerobic bacterial populations. Key points: • Carbon amendment in subsoil reduced NO3-leaching by over 39% under high N input. • Carbon amendment increased the total N in subsoil from 25.3% to 60.6%. • Carbon amendment enriched nirS- and nosZ-type denitrifying bacteria in subsoil.

Traditionally, the maintenance of scattered trees on farm to reap several tangible and intangible benefits is a way of life. Presently, these systems are often known as low-hanging fruit and become a key weapon to fight climate change evil by offsetting greenhouse gas (GHG) emission through carbon sequestration. Therefore, to quantify the offsetting potential of GHG emission and area occupied by these tree-based systems in Rajasthan was undertaken. The study was carried out into two major aspects: estimation of agroforestry area using satellite remote sensing data, and to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of existing agroforestry by using dynamic CO2FIXv3.1 model for a simulation period of 30-years in five districts (20% sampling), namely, Bikaner, Dausa, Jhunjhunu, Pali and Sikar from Rajasthan, India. The estimated area under agroforestry in Rajasthan was 1.49 million ha. The findings revealed that the major tree species existing on farmer’s field were Prosopis cineraria, Tecomella undulata, Capparis decidua, Acacia tortilis, Prosopis juliflora, Azadirachta indica and Ziziphus mauritiana with an observed number of trees in selected districts varied from 1.40 to 14.90 ha−1(with average tree density of 9.71 ha−1). The total biomass (tree + Crop) varied from 2.22 to 19.19 Mg ha−1, whereas the total biomass carbon ranged from 1.00 to 8.64 Mg C ha−1. The soil organic carbon ranged from 4.51 to 16.50 Mg C ha−1. The average estimated carbon sequestration and mitigation potential of the agroforestry were 0.26 Mg C ha−1 year−1and 0.95 Mg CO2 eq ha−1 year−1 on farmers' field of Rajasthan. At the state level, the reduction of GHG emission potential of agroforestry was found to be 1.42 million tonnes annually, which helps to cut carbon footprint and achieve targets of Paris agreement. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Agroforestry area; Arid agroforestry; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; CO2FIX model; Transect analysis","agroforestry; arid region; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; climate change; global warming; greenhouse gas; organic carbon; soil carbon; India; Rajasthan; Acacia tortilis; Azadirachta indica; Capparis decidua; Prosopis cineraria; Prosopis juliflora; Ziziphus mauritiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085892075

Nevertheless, there are several challenges in the planning and design process of the energy infrastructure towards this goal for whole communities. The preponderance of the zero emission concepts at community scale, including unclear definitions of key terms, the availability of supporting tools, and the energy planning approaches could affect the design and decision-making process of stakeholders. In this paper, the state of the art and the state of practice of energy master planning of net-zero emission communities are critically reviewed in order to identify the key research challenges and opportunities to enhance decision-making and hasten their wider adoption. Energy master planning approaches, tools, technologies and decision-making indicators used towards net-zero emission targets are evaluated in selected case studies worldwide. The analysis and research findings show an inconsistency in the scope, definition and approaches in energy master planning of net-zero emission communities. In addition, energy resilience and social metrics and criteria are rarely included in the energy master planning of net-zero emission communities. A conceptual energy master planning framework is proposed that can support performance-based decision-making in the design and planning of net-zero emission communities. A more integrated energy master planning approach and tools, as well as more comprehensive and multi-dimensional assessment metrics, are required for improved and effective decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Conceptual framework; Energy master planning; Energy planning; Net-zero emission communities; Performance-based decision-making; Sustainability","Air pollution; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Assessment metrics; Decision making process; Design and planning; Energy infrastructures; Performance based; Planning and design; Research challenges; Zero emission concept; Decision making",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097777287

CCN activation is calculated using aerosol physical and chemical characteristics in cloud droplet nucleation (CDN) schemes. We applied three different CDN schemes to study the variability of climate predictions from aerosol-cloud interactions using the ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry-climate model (EMAC). Tuning has been performed for each simulation to achieve net radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere. EMAC generally performs well in simulating climate in comparison to observations. The choice of CDN scheme has a large impact on estimated cloud radiative effects especially in regions with high anthropogenic fine particle pollution. Most pronounced regional variability is found in Europe, India, and China. This is mainly due to differences in the calculated CCN activation of small (Aitken) size particles. Köhler methods, which consider both aerosol physical and chemical properties in the CDN calculations, are recommended for investigating anthropogenic aerosol effects on climate. The tuning process towards radiative balance confines these impacts and can be regarded as important as the choice of CDN scheme. Regional variability is also found in Central Africa and South America, related to the high sensitivity of cloud optical parameter tuning as well as differences among CDNC. The tunable parameters affect the water budget and cloud optical properties, and the sensitivity of CDN. The overall variability of simulated climate, induced by different CDN schemes, is found to be less than 27%, which can be restricted by parameter tuning. In general, tuning tends to improve the general performance of the climate model, but not necessarily for all variables. We find that it is important to consider the regional sensitivity of various CCN activation and tuning parameters to optimally simulate climate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosol; Aerosol-cloud interactions; CCN activation; Cloud; EMAC atmospheric chemistry model; Tuning parameters","Aerosols; Atmospheric chemistry; Budget control; Chemical activation; Crystallization; Drops; Nucleation; Optical properties; Aerosol-cloud interaction; Chemistry-climate models; Cloud condensation nuclei; Cloud optical properties; Cloud radiative effects; General circulation model; Physical and chemical characteristics; Physical and chemical properties; Climate models; aerosol; atmospheric chemistry; climate modeling; climate prediction; cloud condensation nucleus; cloud droplet; cloud radiative forcing; comparative study; nucleation; physicochemical property; China; Europe; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096939226

We classified and estimated the amount of plastic residues generated as a consequence of COVID-19 diagnostic tests and analyzed the relationships of the plastics generated with number of confirmed cases, population size, and gross domestic product in each country. We evidenced that the RT-PCR generates 37.27 g of plastic residues per sample. All patients COVID-19 tested with RT-PCR have generated 15,439.59 tons of plastic residue worldwide, until August 2020. The plastic residues generated by the COVID-19 tests have no relation with size population or gross domestic product of the countries. There is also no relationship between the plastic residues generated by the COVID-19 tests and the confirmed cases. About 97% of the plastic residues from diagnostic tests for coronavirus are incinerated due to their hazardous nature to humans, but toxic chemicals are released into the environment during the process. In the short term, there is a need to reduce plastic waste and improve controls of gas emissions from incineration plants in countries where there is a deficit. In the long term, biodegradable biomedical manufacturing that are free of releasing toxic chemicals when they are incinerated, must be considered. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; COVID-19; Environment impacts; Human health; Plastic; SARS-CoV-2","Contamination; Diagnosis; Environmental impact; Functional polymers; Gas emissions; Polymerase chain reaction; Population statistics; Testing; Waste incineration; Cross contamination; Diagnostic tests; Gross domestic products; Incineration plant; International organizations; Medical plastics; Population sizes; Scientific community; Plastics industry; plastic; plastic; atmospheric pollution; classification; COVID-19; disease control; disease transmission; environmental fate; health impact; incineration; plastic waste; public health; quantitative analysis; viral disease; waste disposal; Article; classification; community; contamination; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; environmental impact; gross national product; incineration; landfill; pandemic; population size; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; waste disposal; human; pandemic; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Humans; Pandemics; Plastics; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097714146

While there is a considerable body of literature on the scale of the problem, there is very little research on the lived experiences of communities, their concerns and priorities, and how they are coping with environmental and climate hazards. As a result, a top-down approach is often adopted in adaptation projects that may not meet the real needs of communities, endangering the long-term sustainability and viability of interventions. Through a series of participatory focus groups carried out in Kiribati in 2019, this study explores what communities prioritise and wish to see implemented to cope and build resilience to present and foreseeable future challenges. The outcomes of this research show environmental risks and hazards faced by communities are strongly associated with climate projections. Communities are currently trying to adapt to challenges, both old and new, with technologies and materials available. While there is a degree of spontaneous adaptation occurring, these problems are insurmountable without solving present challenges in Kiribati, such as access to better technology and markets without becoming over-reliant. Including communities in co-designed interventions can also ensure sustainability in climate adaptation projects. The findings of this research can inform policy and climate change adaptation measures in other similar atoll islands in the Pacific. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate adaptation; Climate change; Coping strategies; Focus groups; Kiribati; Pacific; Resilience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089908747

Notwithstanding the increasing attention at the global and European level, precise recommendations for the governance of climate change at the geographical macro‐regional level are still lacking. Macro‐regions span several states with some common morphological or climatic features and adopt wider‐scale strategies which are not mandatory or do not take sufficient account of the specificities of any included regions. Each region is differently administered and adopts specific climate adaptation strategies for addressing just the challenges of the territories they govern, without considering the effects on the neighbouring ones. They also decentralize the climate policies towards the lowest levels of government, and this has increased the number of local bodies involved and promoted the participation of non‐governmental players and citizens. Within the macro-regions, local climate conditions and their changes can be similar; however, their impacts can vary significantly at the individual territory level, and their effects can extend beyond traditional administrative boundaries. Dealing with these changes is particularly challenging in the Alpine area, which extends across 48 regions/autonomous provinces belonging to eight different European countries and is governed by three different international/transnational strategies. This territory represents a fragile ecosystem due to the current climate changes, which have influenced the climate conditions differently at the local level, as well as the richness of natural resources, and the opportunity to exploit them for economic reasons. South Tyrol (IT) is one of the autonomous provinces located in this area that is currently addressing the expected and unexpected impacts of climate change. Unlike other Italian Alpine regions, this region boasts a wider legislative autonomy, which enables the creation of more targeted climate adaptation policies and their decentralisation to the lowest level of administration, including the non‐governmental players and citizens. As a result, the climate adaptation governance framework appears complex and hard to govern due to the plurality of actors and governmental levels at Alpine and regional/provincial levels. The present article sheds light on this framework, analysing specifically the three above‐mentioned governance issues: governance structures, stakeholders’ involvement mechanisms, and links with the existing wider‐scales strategies. While discussing these topics, it then refers specifically to South Tyrol for the case study. Based on the documental analysis of the climate adaptation strategies and resultant findings, the preferred governance mechanism for addressing the specific climate adaptation challenges of Alpine regions would involve adopting some of the regulations included in regional mono‐sectoral plans. These regulations do not relate to wider‐scale strategies at the macro‐regional level and refer just to the administered territories. The participation of local institutions and citizens in defining and implementing these regulations is limited and not incentivized. Although important, interactions across Alpine, national, and sub‐national policy domains are limited. These limitations are revealed in South Tyrol and partially also in other European Alpine regions. © 2021 by the author.

Here, Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer models were used to evaluate climatic change effects and mitigation strategies on maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yields in soils of the subtropical and semi-arid region of Chaco. Simulations were performed for the DK747 and A8000 genotypes, calibrated for the CERES-Maize model in a previous report and for the CROPGRO-Soybean model in the present study, respectively. Both crops markedly differ in their response to climatic change and putative levels of atmospheric CO2 concentration. The observed significant reductions in maize yields in future climate scenarios (5–42% compared with the baseline, 1986–2010) were more associated with increased temperatures that shortened the crop cycle than with water stress. Delaying the sowing date is a feasible strategy to mitigate this effect. Projected temperature increases are expected to play a secondary role in determining soybean yields. Instead, water stress will continue to be an important constraint to soybean yield in the context of global warming, but this effect is strongly affected by rainfall regimes. Responses to raising CO2 levels were more pronounced in soybean (+10–40%) than in maize (+2–4%). Soil degradation exacerbated the negative effects of global warming on crop yields, especially on maize, which highlights the importance of soil conservation practices. The observed high interannual climatic variability and the different sensitivities of maize and soybean to climatic variables indicate that crop diversification would be the key to improve the resilience of the agrosystems under the future scenarios. © 2020 The Authors.

Heat pump (HP) water heaters are several times more efficient than the electric resistance (ER) water heaters common in homes. Currently, North Carolina only requires electric water heaters with tanks larger than 55 gallons to be HP water heaters in new homes, thus allowing inefficient ER water heaters in smaller residences. We considered a hypothetical change to North Carolina's building code requiring HP water heaters in all new residential units constructed in 2018. Using housing data from the US Census Bureau, along with electricity rates and emissions factors from the US Energy Information Administration, we quantified changes in costs expected from tightened efficiency requirements. We estimate that requiring HP water heaters in all new residential construction incurs a one-time statewide cost of $29.5 million, but leads to a total 10-year savings of $108.7 million for residents, as well as 10-year reductions in carbon dioxide emissions of 441,000 metric tons. When rebates from electric utilities are included, total 10-year statewide savings increase to $125.3 million.

The importance of iodine for human health has been known for over a century, with low iodine in the diet being linked to goitre, cretinism and neonatal death. Research over the last few decades has shown that iodine has significant impacts on tropospheric photochemistry, ultimately impacting climate by reducing the radiative forcing of ozone (O 3) and air quality by reducing extreme O 3 concentrations in polluted regions. Iodine is naturally present in the ocean, predominantly as aqueous iodide and iodate. The rapid reaction of sea-surface iodide with O 3 is believed to be the largest single source of gaseous iodine to the atmosphere. Due to increased anthropogenic O 3, this release of iodine is believed to have increased dramatically over the twentieth century, by as much as a factor of 3. Uncertainties in the marine iodine distribution and global cycle are, however, major constraints in the effective prediction of how the emissions of iodine and its biogeochemical cycle may change in the future or have changed in the past. Here, we present a synthesis of recent results by our team and others which bring a fresh perspective to understanding the global iodine biogeochemical cycle. In particular, we suggest that future climate-induced oceanographic changes could result in a significant change in aqueous iodide concentrations in the surface ocean, with implications for atmospheric air quality and climate. © 2021 The Authors.","global iodine cycle; halogens; iodide; iodine; ozone; sea-air interactions","Air quality; Atmospheric radiation; Biogeochemistry; Climate change; Iodine; Iodine compounds; Surface reactions; Surface waters; Trace elements; Aqueous iodide; Atmospheric air; Biogeochemical cycle; Future climate; Gaseous iodines; Radiative forcings; Rapid reactions; Twentieth century; Chemical contamination",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105076181

These may be due to the different GHG accounting methods, including those used by different Low-Carbon Policies (LCPs). To have a clearer understanding of the life cycle performance of AJF, the carbon footprint of ten pathways was estimated, comprising promising feedstocks – such as soybean, palm, sugarcane, sugarcane residues, forestry residues, used cooking oil, beef tallow, and steel off-gases – and ASTM-approved technologies: Hydroprocessed Fatty Acids, Alcohol-to-Jet, and Fischer-Tropsch. Six methodological approaches were used: the attributional and the consequential life cycle assessment, as well as guidelines for the four LCPs: Renovabio (Brazil), CORSIA (aviation sector), RFS (United States), and RED II (Europe). Soybean-based pathway (24 to 98.7 gCO2e/MJ) had the low to no potential for reducing GHG when compared to their fossil counterparts, mainly due to land use change. Of all food-based pathways, AJF produced from sugarcane performed the best (-10.4 to 43.7 gCO2e/MJ), especially when power surplus was credited. AJF from palm oil could present significant GHG reduction for palm expansion in degraded pasturelands. By contrast, Fischer-Tropsch of lignocellulosic residues showed the highest potential for reducing GHG (-95% to -130%). Different from food-based pathways, the potential GHG reduction of residues-based pathways converged within a narrower range (-130% to -50%), except when residual feedstocks have to be redirected from their current economic use. It could lead to GHG emissions higher than fossil fuel. © 2020 The Authors","Alternative jet fuel; Attributional modeling; Carbon footprint; Consequential modeling; Life cycle assessment; Low-carbon policies","Alternative fuels; Carbon footprint; Emission control; Fatty acids; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Jet fuel; Land use; Life cycle; Palm oil; Soybean oil; Accounting methods; Consequential life-cycle assessment; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Life-cycle performance; Lignocellulosic residues; Low-carbon policies; Methodological approach; Sugarcane residues; Greenhouse gases; fatty acid; fuel; palm oil; steel; carbon emission; carbon footprint; environmental policy; fuel; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; modeling; Arecaceae; Brazil; carbon footprint; degradation; environmental policy; Europe; forestry; life cycle assessment; model; pastureland; reduction (chemistry); soybean; sugarcane; trend study; United States; Brazil; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096023194

SO2 is one of the main gaseous pollutants in ship exhaust, resulting from the use of marine heavy fuel oil with high sulfur content. Therefore, it is necessary to detect the fuel sulfur content (FSC) to regulate ship exhaust emissions. Optical remote sensing methods, such as differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS), light detection and ranging (LIDAR), and ultraviolet (UV) camera techniques, are regarded as simple and effective remote monitoring methods. One common technique is to estimate the SO2 concentration in a ship plume using its local optical characteristics and use this to calculate FSC. One drawback of this technique is that there are always errors in the estimations of the SO2 concentration despite the continuous improvement of such estimations. Another drawback is that calculating FSC from SO2 often requires additional measurement methods. Here, a sulfur content prediction model based on a deep convolutional neural network using a UV camera is introduced. First, a ship benchmark test is performed. In the test, a large number of ultraviolet characteristic images of the ship exhaust plume are taken with a UV camera and the corresponding FSC data are collected. Next, a visual geometry group (VGG)-16 convolutional neural network model based on transfer learning is built. The model extracts all the features of the exhaust plume image as input data to the deep neural network and outputs the predicted FSC as a classification label. The results show that the model can predict the FSC value with high accuracy corresponding to the exhaust plume image. This study proves that it is theoretically feasible to apply a convolutional neural network to learn features of ultraviolet ship exhaust plume images for FSC predictions, which can provide guidance for the remote regulation of ship exhaust emissions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Convolutional neural network; Exhaust plume; Fuel sulfur content; Ultraviolet camera","Absorption spectroscopy; Benchmarking; Cameras; Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Fog; Forecasting; Fuels; Learning systems; Light absorption; Marine pollution; Optical radar; Predictive analytics; Remote sensing; Ships; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Thermal plumes; Transfer learning; Classification labels; Continuous improvements; Differential optical absorption spectroscopy; High sulfur contents; Light detection and ranging; Measurement methods; Optical characteristics; Optical remote sensing; Convolutional neural networks; fuel; sulfur; artificial neural network; exhaust emission; plume; prediction; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sulfur dioxide; Article; chemical analysis; concentration (parameter); convolutional neural network; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; exhaust gas; image analysis; information processing; mathematical computing; remote sensing; ship; ultraviolet radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100219661

Water-Energy-Food Nexus is central for sustainable development and promoting efficient management of resources. Nevertheless, an efficient and sustainable Water-Energy-Food Nexus design requires the participation of multiple stakeholders in the decision-making process. This work presents a multi-objective optimization model for the design of a Water-Energy-Food system that involves the sustainable production of water, energy and food in areas that share economic activities through the industrial, agriculture and livestock sectors. Additionally, a multi-stakeholder assessment is presented to generate a set of solutions, where different priorities are given to the stakeholders. This approach allows quantifying the level of satisfaction of each of the stakeholders. Integration of resources is addressed according to economic and environmental objectives, such as the minimization of the cost of the system, water abstraction and greenhouse gas emissions. As case study, a region located in Mexico was selected based on its industrial activity and the challenges it currently faces in meeting resource demands due to low water availability. Results show that water reuse is crucial to improve the Water-Energy-Food Nexus sustainability. Also, it was found that the most affected sector for water scarcity is the agricultural sector. This model can be the basis for planning the Water-Energy-Food Nexus at regional level involving different stakeholders and for determining sustainable interactions between resources. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Multi-stakeholder; Optimization; Resources integration; Sustainability; Waste management; Water-energy-food nexus","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate change; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial economics; Multiobjective optimization; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Decision making process; Efficient managements; Environmental objectives; Multi-objective optimization models; Optimization approach; Sustainable assessment; Sustainable interactions; Sustainable production; Water resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097126360

In this context, our goal was to describe if there is a direct relationship between the weathering of different metamorphic rocks and the genesis of Luvisols and Planosols in a semiarid region of Brazil, describing the implications of the genesis of these soils for their agricultural potential. For this, two Planosols profiles and three Luvisols profiles were classified, described morphologically and sampled for the development of physical, chemical, mineralogical and micromorphological analyzes. Samples of the respective parent rocks were collected for petrographic analysis and physical and chemical attributes were used in multivariate statistical analysis. The results indicate that: a) weathering of gneiss and amphibolite results in genesis of Planosols and Luvisols respectively, b) hematite was more associated with Luvisols and goethite was more associated with Planossols, and this variation in the content of iron oxides influenced some morphological attributes of these soils, c) clay formation in situ called argillation was the main process responsible for the genesis of Bt horizons in both soils, d) alterations of plagioclases, biotite and amphibole influenced the release of plant nutrients such as Ca+2, Mg+2 and K+ and e) the set of attributes analyzed led us to affirm that Luvisols have a more relevant agricultural potential than Planosols in the semiarid region studied. Our conclusions can be extrapolated to other regions of the world under similar geoclimatic conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Amphibolite weathering; Argillation process; Bisialitization process; Gneiss weathering; Rubification process","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Arid regions; Chemical analysis; Feldspar; Hematite; Metamorphic rocks; Mica; Multivariant analysis; Soils; Agricultural activities; Chemical attributes; Multivariate statistical analysis; Petrographic analysis; Plant nutrients; Scientific community; Semi-arid climate; Semi-arid region; Weathering; amphibole; amphibolite; biotite; chemical weathering; gneiss; goethite; Luvisol; metamorphic rock; pedogenesis; Planosol; semiarid region; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097708556

Two WBC were evaluated, one with a higher content of WS (WBC[sbnd]HC) and another with a lower content (WBC-LC). Different WS recycling and transportation scenarios were evaluated. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was used, considering a cradle-to-gate scope, comparing two methods for calculation of GHG emissions: IPCC GWP100 and GWPbio. The transport analysis was carried out considering the WBC production in 26 Brazilian cities, according to different locations where waste WS are generated. In order to increase the robustness of the study, a sensitivity analysis was performed for: types of WS allocation, the origin of WS (waste x virgin materials), transportation efficiency, and electricity grid matrix. We verified that the waste WS content increase in WBC resulted in climate change mitigation for all cases and scenarios (when the biogenic carbon is considered). However, this benefit can vary according to WS availability and transport efficiency. Therefore, transportation must deserve special attention for the CE evaluation. When the GWPbio method is used and CO2 capture during the eucalypt growth is accounted for, the GHG emissions of WBC production can be very low (15 kgCO2-eq/m³). We conclude that recycling wood waste to use in WBC can be considered a good CO2 sink and a pathway for the low-carbon and circular construction industry. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-concrete; Biogenic carbon; Circular economy; Climate change; Life cycle assessment (lca); Transportation","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Concrete industry; Concrete products; Construction industry; Efficiency; Greenhouse gases; Materials handling; Recycling; Sensitivity analysis; Wood; Circular economy; Climate change mitigation; Electricity grids; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Transport analysis; Transport efficiency; Transportation efficiency; Transportation scenario; Life cycle; carbon dioxide; concrete; unclassified drug; wood bio concrete; biogenic emission; carbon sink; climate change; concrete; construction material; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; recycling; transport process; waste management; wood; Article; biogenesis; carbon footprint; climate change; economic aspect; environmental management; environmental monitoring; geographic distribution; life cycle assessment; particle size; recycling; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; sensitivity analysis; waste; wood; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098186882

It is still urgently desirable but quite challenging to explore a promising catalyst for CO2 photoreduction due to the severity in the fast recombination of electron holes and the deficiency of active sites, which have a tremendous influence on the catalytic behavior. In this regard, mesoporous TiO2 nanospheres containing oxygen vacancies (OVs) and metallic Au nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully prepared and showed markedly enhanced CO2 reduction activity and CH4 selectivity by the simple combination of photocatalysis with the simultaneous photothermal effect under full-spectrum irradiation. The dual introduction of OVs and a Au/TiO2 Schottky junction can not only serve as an electron sink to significantly improve the charge separation/transfer efficiency but also show effective photothermal conversion to raise the local temperature of the catalyst, thus resulting in an enhanced shuttle of electrons and desorption of products. This study not only offers new insights into the integrated tuning of charge recombination processes but also demonstrates that the photothermocatalysis has great potential in CO2 reduction. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","Au deposition; cooperative effect; oxygen vacancy; photothermal effect; photothermocatalytic CO2reduction","Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Energy policy; Gold nanoparticles; Greenhouse effect; Oxide minerals; Oxygen vacancies; TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium dioxide; Catalytic behavior; Charge recombination process; Charge separations; Co-operative effects; Local temperature; Photo-thermal conversions; Photothermal effects; Schottky junctions; Gold",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103683451

One of the most important sectors in Hungary is agriculture, so the agricultural drought is a particularly important area to be examined. The purpose of the study is to determine how vulnerable each county (NUTS-3 regions) is to the expected effects of drought. The study provides an assessment framework of drought-related vulnerabilities and the preparedness of drought policies at the NUTS-3 level in Hungary. The drought-related vulnerability of NUTS-3 regions was determined by selected exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity indicators. The calculation of drought vulnerability is based on the IPCC 2007 methodology, while the input data were derived from the National Adaptation Geo-information System online data platform and Hungarian agro-statistical data sources. An assessment framework of drought-related policy performance of NUTS-3-level climate change strategies was developed. The evaluation methodology is based on a specific scorecard of evaluation criteria related to the performance of the county’s drought-related objectives and measures. According to the relationship between the county’s drought-related vulnerability and policy performance, the counties were classified into four types. The main results show that several counties fail the target by overestimating the role of drought prevention, with little vulnerability index. In contrast, many counties are not adequately prepared for the impacts of drought, despite their high vulnerability index. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agriculture; Climate change; Drought policy; Hungary; Vulnerability","climate change; drought; drought stress; environmental assessment; environmental indicator; hazard management; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; methodology; policy analysis; vulnerability; Hungary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104017272

Arctic lakes and small ponds are known to act as an important source of atmospheric methane. However, not much is known about other types of water bodies in permafrost regions, which include major rivers and coastal bays as a transition type between freshwater and marine environments.We monitored dissolved methane concentrations in three different water bodies (Lena River, Tiksi Bay, and Lake Golzovoye, Siberia, Russia) over a period of 2 years. Sampling was carried out under ice cover (April) and in open water (July-August). The methane oxidation (MOX) rate and the fractional turnover rate (k0) in water and melted ice samples from the late winter of 2017 was determined with the radiotracer method. In the Lena River winter methane concentrations were a quarter of the summer concentrations (8 nmol L-1 vs. 31 nmol L-1), and mean winter MOX rate was low (0.023 nmol L-1 d-1). In contrast, Tiksi Bay winter methane concentrations were 10 times higher than in summer (103 nmol L-1 vs. 13 nmol L-1). Winter MOX rates showed a median of 0.305 nmol L-1 d-1. In Lake Golzovoye, median methane concentrations in winter were 40 times higher than in summer (1957 nmol L-1 vs. 49 nmol L-1). However, MOX was much higher in the lake (2.95 nmol L-1 d-1) than in either the river or bay. The temperature had a strong influence on theMOX (Q10 D 2:72-0:69). In summer water temperatures ranged from 7-14 °C and in winter from -0:7 to 1.3 °C. In the ice cores a median methane concentration of 9nM was observed, with no gradient between the ice surface and the bottom layer at the ice-water interface. MOX in the (melted) ice cores was mostly below the detection limit. Comparing methane concentrations in the ice with the underlaying water column revealed methane concentration in the water column 100-1000 times higher. The winter situation seemed to favor a methane accumulation under ice, especially in the lake with a stagnant water body. While on the other hand, in the Lena River with its flowing water, no methane accumulation under ice was observed. In a changing, warming Arctic, a shorter ice cover period is predicted. With respect to our study this would imply a shortened time for methane to accumulate below the ice and a shorter time for the less efficient winter MOX. Especially for lakes, an extended time of ice-free conditions could reduce the methane flux from the Arctic water bodies. © Author(s) 2021.",,"concentration (composition); glacial lake; global warming; ice cover; methane; oxidation; permafrost; seasonality; tracer; Lena River; Russian Federation; Serbia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103062101

CO is not only an inhibitor of nitrogenase, but it is also a substrate, undergoing reduction to hydrocarbons (Fischer–Tropsch-type chemistry). The C−C bond forming capabilities of nitrogenase suggest that multiple CO or CO-derived ligands bind to the active site. Herein, we report a crystal structure with two CO ligands coordinated to the FeMo-cofactor of the molybdenum nitrogenase at 1.33 Å resolution. In addition to the previously observed bridging CO ligand between Fe2 and Fe6 of the FeMo-cofactor, a new ligand binding mode is revealed through a second CO ligand coordinated terminally to Fe6. While the relevance of this state to nitrogenase-catalyzed reactions remains to be established, it highlights the privileged roles for Fe2 and Fe6 in ligand binding, with multiple coordination modes available depending on the ligand and reaction conditions. © 2020 The Authors.

To investigate whether a regional-scale reduction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic can be detected using space-based observations of atmospheric CO2, we have analysed a small ensemble of OCO-2 and GOSAT satellite retrievals of column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2, i.e. XCO2. We focus on East China and use a simple data-driven analysis method. We present estimates of the relative change of East China monthly emissions in 2020 relative to previous periods, limiting the analysis to October-to-May periods to minimize the impact of biogenic CO2 fluxes. The ensemble mean indicates an emission reduction by approximately 10 % ± 10 % in March and April 2020. However, our results show considerable month-to-month variability and significant differences across the ensemble of satellite data products analysed. For example, OCO-2 suggests a much smaller reduction (g 1 %-2 % ± 2 %). This indicates that it is challenging to reliably detect and to accurately quantify the emission reduction with current satellite data sets. There are several reasons for this, including the sparseness of the satellite data but also the weak signal; the expected regional XCO2 reduction is only on the order of 0.1-0.2 ppm. Inferring COVID-19-related information on regional-scale CO2 emissions using current satellite XCO2 retrievals likely requires, if at all possible, a more sophisticated analysis method including detailed transport modelling and considering a priori information on anthropogenic and natural CO2 surface fluxes. © Author(s) 2021.

In addition to being a two-way barrier to protect against virions droplets both in terms of “source control” (for the benefits of the community) and “physical protection” (for wearer), face masks also allow maintaining physiological temperatures and humidity of the nasal cavity and mouth, independently from the external environmental conditions. Beyond compromising the viral transmission speed, exposure to cold environments could have a detrimental effect on the host’s susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. The innate human immune system becomes in fact weaker with cooler nose temperatures and thus more vulnerable to viral replication. Furthermore, there is evidence that warm, humid climates are associated with reduced spread of SARS-CoV-2, while cold dry conditions favor its stability and transmissibility. In the early stage of a viral infection, a physiological body temperature in the upper airways supports the innate immune system, endorsing the muco-ciliary clearance, inhibiting, or deactivating any first settlement of viruses. Face masks are therefore strongly recommended also outdoors, especially under cold weather conditions, not only as a physical barrier against the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but also to prevent the rapid cooling of the nasal mucosa and the inhibition of the human innate defense of the upper airways. © 2021 by the authors.

The implementation for flexibility modification of thermal power units and deep peak regulation ancillary service market alleviates the contradiction between rapid capacity growth and limited system flexibility. This paper establishes three flexibility modification schemes and two price rules for simulation and proposes an analysis framework for unit commitment problem based on mixed-integer linear programming to evaluate the policy mix effects. Results confirm the promoting effects of flexibility modification on integrating variable renewables and illustrate diverse scheme selections under different renewables curtailment. Particularly, there is no need for selecting expensive schemes which contain more modified units and more developed flexibility, unless the curtailment decrement is compulsorily stipulated or worth for added modification cost. Similarly, results also prove the revenue loss compensation effect of deep peak regulation ancillary service market and illustrate diverse price rule selections under different curtailment intervals. Price rule with more subdivided load intervals and bigger price differences among them is more effective, especially under the higher requirement for curtailment rate. Therefore, the government should further enlarge flexibility modification via but not limited to more targeted compensation price, while generators should further consider a demand-based investment. © 2021 by the author.

The production of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) used in EVs is an energy-intensive and costly process. It can also lead to significant embedded emissions depending on the source of energy used. In fact, about 39% of the energy consumption in LIB production is associated with drying processes, where the electrode drying step accounts for about a half. Despite the enormous energy consumption and costs originating from drying processes, they are seldomly researched in the battery industry. Establishing knowledge within the LIB industry regarding state-of-the-art drying techniques and solvent evaporation mechanisms is vital for optimising process conditions, detecting alternative solvent systems, and discovering novel techniques. This review aims to give a summary of the state-of-the-art LIB processing techniques. An in-depth understanding of the influential factors for each manufacturing step of LIBs is then established, emphasising the electrode structure and electrochemical performance. Special attention is dedicated to the convection drying step in conventional water and N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)based electrode manufacturing. Solvent omission in dry electrode processing substantially lowers the energy demand and allows for a thick, mechanically stable electrode coating. Small changes in the electrode manufacturing route may have an immense impact on the final battery performance. Electrodes used for research and development often have a different production route and techniques compared to those processed in industry. The scalability issues related to the comparison across scales are discussed and further emphasised when the industry moves towards the next-generation techniques.

These new technological tools promise to supply populations with clean energy and to fight climate change by reducing CO2 emissions, in perspective with sustainable development. Basing on a qualitative case study located in Rwanda, this article draws from the impacts of a photovoltaic solar power plant by concretely verifying to what extent its impact (evaluated in seven categories on four territorial levels) actually participates in this sustainability strategy. The article engages in an analytical discussion on the place of the solar power plant in a socio-technical Multi-Level Perspective, enriched with a Multi-Scalar approach. The study reveals three major paradoxes: (i) at the international level, the promotion of the energy transition to renewable energies (symbolized by the power plant) does not lead to systematic local electrification; (ii) although the operation of the power plant generates carbon credits from the Credit Carbon Mechanism, it does not necessarily ensure the implementation of local socio-economic development and yet this development is in principle linked to the allocation of the said credits; and (iii) due to its indirect impact on the electricity tariff, the power plant seems to limit the State's actions with regards to the fight against poverty, which seems contradictory to the impetus aroused by the new renewable energy economy.

They can form their own climate which is often characterized by higher temperatures and pollution levels, less wind, and solar access compared to their surroundings. This paper presents a systematic review of publications on cities in cold and polar climate regions as defined by the Köppen-Geiger climate classification to determine the most-researched topics, identify sparsely incorporated research areas, synthesize research evidence and summarize the most important results. In total, 101 papers have been included, categorized, and analyzed according to their publication year, country, climate, topic, method, keywords, citations, and publication channels. The articles were classified into nine main topics: urban heat island (UHI) magnitude, UHI mitigation, other UHI related, biometeorology, air pollution, urban boundary layer and atmospheric boundary layer, time series analysis, other urban meteorological phenomena, and research not falling under the previous eight categories. The most-covered topic was the UHI effect. The outweighing part of studies used on-site measurements for obtaining data, while some studies were dedicated to understanding the structure, or the temporal and spatial variability of the UHI, often by using numerical tools. The review reveals significant gaps in the research of microclimatic characteristics and physical properties of the materials in urban design. Ongoing climate change and the particular vulnerability of cold and polar climate regions makes it especially important to review, develop, and adopt climate adaption and mitigation strategies for sustainable urban development. © 2020","Climate adaptation; Cold and polar climate; Microclimate; Mitigation; Urban climate; Urban heat island","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Pollution; Time series analysis; Urban growth; Carbon dioxide emissions; Meteorological phenomena; Mitigation strategy; On-site measurement; Sustainable urban development; Temporal and spatial variability; Urban boundary layers; Urban heat island; Atmospheric boundary layer",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095991979

Most predictive models of community responses to climate change ignore individual-level biotic interactions despite their known importance for community diversity and functioning. Here, we consider plant fitness and diversity responses to climate change associated factors at three organisational levels: communities, populations and individual plants, to increase our understanding of how plant communities respond to climate change. Location: Montane grassland, Tasmania, Australia. Methods: In two plant communities, we manipulated temperature using open-top chambers and removed random and dominant species biomass. Two years after experimental manipulations, we assessed the impact of treatments on species diversity, community- and population-level functional traits and individual plant fitness. Results: Species diversity was affected by warming in one of the two communities, while community-level functional trait diversity metrics were unaffected by treatments. Mean community trait values were strongly impacted by dominant species biomass removal in both communities, notably increasing specific leaf area (SLA) and specific root length. SLA showed the strongest population-level trait response, with higher values found in warmed plots and lower values found in dominant species biomass removal plots. Neighbours had a stronger competitive effect on individual plant fitness in warmed compared to unwarmed conditions at the higher-elevation site and facilitation was common in both communities. Conclusions: We demonstrated that over short time scales, plant communities respond to experimental warming and biomass removal across multiple organisational levels. Competitive and facilitative interactions played a significant role in determining fitness outcomes, but competitive interactions dominated under warmed conditions. We highlight the importance of local-scale biotic interactions in mediating individual responses to warming and recommend their inclusion in future studies of how climate change will impact the long-term structure and function of plant communities through short-term impacts on individual plant fitness. © 2021 International Association for Vegetation Science","biomass removal; biotic interactions; climate change; competition; facilitation; fitness; functional diversity; grassland; trait; warming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101865499

However, changes in pollutant concentrations are also affected by chemical transformation and meteorology. Decreases in concentrations were also not as obvious in Beijing when compared with Hubei Province, where lockdown was especially strict. Declines in concentrations between 2019 and 2020 are evident for both NO2 (37.0 to 26.2 μg m-3) and SO2 (5.86 to 4.15 μg m-3), but there was little evidence of change for PM2.5 (50.0 to 53.8 μg m-3) and CO (0.71 to 0.74 mg m-3). Despite this, Fourier analysis revealed that the weekly cycle of PM2.5 evident in 2019 was not apparent in 2020. In 2019, CO showed both diurnal and weekly signals, but these were absent under the restrictions of 2020. This suggests that while concentrations may remain relatively constant, the temporal distribution of pollutants can show subtle changes under restrictions imposed in attempts to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

Power generation or landfill-gas-to-wire is a solution for landfill-gas utilization with electricity-supply benefits skipping complex purification/transportation steps. As municipal solid-waste is rich in biomass, landfill-gas-fired power generation, with carbon capture and sequestration, leads to negative emissions and, consequently, climate-change mitigation. This work investigates the feasibility of zero-emission landfill-gas-to-wire concepts with oxyfuel carbon sequestration against conventional landfill-gas-fired plant facing carbon charges. Economic analysis is supported by Aspen-HYSYS simulation assuming large-scale landfill-gas supply. Different gas-turbine pressure-ratios are economically sought for both conventional and oxyfuel power plants to establish most profitable configurations. The greatest net values of conventional and oxyfuel plants are respectively attained for combustion pressures around 8 and 20 bar. This indicates investment and compression costs pulling down gas-turbine pressure-ratio in the landfill-gas combined-cycle plant. At such conditions, carbon dioxide is captured at 0.875 kg/kWh entailing oxyfuel efficiency penalty of 9.2% based on landfill-gas lower heating value, and increasing the long-term break-even electricity price from US$36/MWh to US$104/MWh.

Reaching these targets will partly rely on the decarbonization of the gas sector and the development of the biomethane. In this context, this article aims to provide a vision of the European biogas sector development from 2020 towards 2030 and beyond. It appears that the biogas sector is facing a shift in its development paradigm. Indeed, this sector is still mainly dominated by a model based on energy crops, high feed-in tariffs and local electrical production via combined heat and power units. However, biogas sector is now moving towards a different model, where organic wastes, agricultural by-products as well as sequential crops are mainly used as feedstocks, biogas is upgraded to biomethane for various applications (transportation, chemical production, heat, etc.) and subsidy schemes are progressively reduced. Overall, current European policies are pushing the sector to increase its sustainability and to reduce biogas production costs. To answer these challenges, the main improvement tracks are identified and discussed. In the future, it is believed that the biogas sector should address these aspects to ensure its growth towards 2030 and beyond. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural sector; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Biomethane; Decarbonization; Renewable energy","Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Crops; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Agricultural by-products; Biogas production; Chemical production; Combined heat and power units; Energy crops; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Model-based OPC; Organic wastes; Biogas",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096507201

Failing to mitigate agricultural methane and nitrous oxide emissions could contribute to an overshoot of the RCP2.6 warming by about 0.4°C. We explore using additional CDR to offset alternative agricultural non-CO2 emission pathways in which emissions either remain constant or rise. We assess the effects on the climate of calculating CDR rates to offset agricultural emission under two different approaches: relying on the 100-year global warming potential conversion metric (GWP100) and maintaining effective radiative forcing levels at exactly those of RCP2.6. Using a reduced-complexity climate model, we find that the conversion metric leads to a systematic underestimation of needed CDR, reaching only around 50% of the temperature mitigation needed to remain on the RCP2.6 track. This is mostly because the metric underestimates, in the near term, forcing from short-lived climate pollutants such as methane. We test whether alternative conversion metrics, the GWP20 and GWP∗, are more suitable for offsetting purposes, and found that they both lead to an overestimation of the CDR requirements. Under alternative agricultural emissions pathways, holding to RCP2.6 total radiative forcing requires up to twice the amount of CDR that is already included in the RCP2.6. We examine the costs of this additional CDR, and the effects of internalizing these in several agricultural commodities. Assuming an average CDR cost by $150/tCO2, we find increases in prices of up to 41% for beef, 14% for rice, and 40% for milk in the United States relative to current retail prices. These figures are significantly higher (for beef and rice) under a global scenario, potentially threatening food security and welfare. Although the policy delivers a mechanism to finance the early deployment of CDR, using CDR to offset remaining high emissions may well hit other non-financial constraints and can thus only support, and not substitute, emission reductions. © 2021 Brazzola et al.

Yet the net effects of changes in active travel on changes in mobility-related CO2 emissions are complex and under-researched. Here we collected longitudinal data on daily travel behavior, journey purpose, as well as personal and geospatial characteristics in seven European cities and derived mobility-related lifecycle CO2 emissions over time and space. Statistical modelling of longitudinal panel (n = 1849) data was performed to assess how changes in active travel, the ‘main mode’ of daily travel, and cycling frequency influenced changes in mobility-related lifecycle CO2 emissions. We found that changes in active travel have significant lifecycle carbon emissions benefits, even in European urban contexts with already high walking and cycling shares. An increase in cycling or walking consistently and independently decreased mobility-related lifecycle CO2 emissions, suggesting that active travel substituted for motorized travel – i.e. the increase was not just additional (induced) travel over and above motorized travel. To illustrate this, an average person cycling 1 trip/day more and driving 1 trip/day less for 200 days a year would decrease mobility-related lifecycle CO2 emissions by about 0.5 tonnes over a year, representing a substantial share of average per capita CO2 emissions from transport. The largest benefits from shifts from car to active travel were for business purposes, followed by social and recreational trips, and commuting to work or place of education. Changes to commuting emissions were more pronounced for those who were younger, lived closer to work and further to a public transport station. Even if not all car trips could be substituted by active travel the potential for decreasing emissions is considerable and significant. The study gives policy and practice the empirical evidence needed to assess climate change mitigation impacts of urban transport measures and interventions aimed at mode shift to more sustainable modes of transport. Investing in and promoting active travel whilst ‘demoting’ private car ownership and use should be a cornerstone of strategies to meet ‘net zero’ carbon targets, particularly in urban areas, while also reducing inequalities and improving public health and quality of urban life in a post-COVID-19 world. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Active travel; Climate change mitigation; Cycling; Lifecycle CO2 emissions; Sustainable urban transport; Walking","car ownership; carbon emission; climate change; life cycle analysis; sustainability; urban area; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100003935

Therefore, the basic parameters of carbon footprint change were determined by conducting the literature review. The carbon footprint change of each province was modeled using artificial neural networks for 2015 due to data availability. The performance metrics of the model created are (R2 0.97622, MSE 3.19809, RMSE 1.78832). The carbon footprint values of each province were predicted with the lowest error for the years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, for which access data were available with the help of modeling. The spatial distributions of the prediction values were mapped using the geographic information system (GIS). An increase of 7 Mt on average was detected in the carbon footprint change of Turkey in 4 years. Furthermore, it was determined which parameter had a weighted effect in determining the carbon footprint values using the RReliefF algorithm, the feature selection method based on the established model’s prediction values. Accordingly, the parameters affecting the carbon footprint change on Turkey’s model were determined according to their weight as follows (income level 0.057, housing 0.029, the number of motor vehicles 0.028, sectoral industry size 0.025, population density 0.024, energy consumption 0.017, infrastructure 0.005, agricultural area 0.004, and agricultural production value 0.0008), respectively.

Imbued with notions of resilience and reflection, reflexivity is assumed to contribute to pro-environmental change. However, as the need to manage climate impacts becomes more immediate, political struggles over climate adaptation have become increasingly apparent. These impacts occur most often within local communities, in the context of competing economic interests and differing interpretations of climate science. Thus while it is increasingly difficult to deny climate change, conflicting priorities can lead to ignorance. In these circumstances, how communities build and share knowledge, and negotiate responses is central. Based on a study of a vulnerable region in Australia, we identify three processes through which the local community mobilized to disrupt local climate change adaptation. These included emphasizing uncertainty about the science of climate change, encouraging fear about property prices, and repositioning property owners as victims of climate adaptation policy. We argue that this response to climate adaptation constitutes the production of reflexive ignorance, which reinforces skepticism around scientific authority and defends particular economic interests. © 2021 London School of Economics and Political Science","adaptation; climate change; ignorance; reflexivity; risk","Australia; climate change; human; policy; Australia; Climate Change; Humans; Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100861496

Paul Valéry, Montpellier, France","Questions: Studies in functional biogeography have mostly focused on unmanaged ecosystems, and neglected testing how management intensity affects community-level response of plant traits to bioclimatic gradients. We hypothesize that trait–climate relationships for arable weeds spontaneously establishing in croplands subject to intensive management should differ from the relationships characterizing less intensively managed grassland ecosystems. Location: France. Methods: We computed community-weighted means (CWM) and variances (CWV) of 954 and 5,619 cropland and grassland plant assemblages, respectively, for three fundamental leaf traits (specific leaf area, SLA; leaf dry matter content, LDMC; leaf nitrogen content, LNC). Based on growing season length accounting for both temperature and soil water limitations (GSLtw), we compared trait–climate relationships between herbicide-free croplands and grasslands, and between herbicide-free and herbicide-sprayed cropland assemblages. The contribution of beta-diversity to the trait–climate relationships was then evaluated using multiple regression on distance matrices. Results: Distinct trait–climate relationships characterized herbicide-free cropland and grassland plant assemblages. CWM of all traits showed weaker relations with GSLtw in cropland relative to grassland assemblages. CWV of LDMC and LNC responded more sharply in croplands. Furthermore, no herbicide effect on trait–climate relationships was detected within cropland assemblages. These results seem to be explained by a greater taxonomic beta-diversity along the GSLtw gradient for grasslands. Conclusions: Specific trait–environment relationships characterize croplands, underlining that management intensity greatly affects trait–climate relationships for plant assemblages. Deciphering the interplay between land use intensification and climate is critical to accurately forecast functional vegetation changes in response to global changes, and hence to foster actions enhancing ecosystem resilience. © 2021 International Association for Vegetation Science","Agroecosystems; arable weeds; croplands; environmental filtering; functional biogeography; grasslands; leaf traits; management intensification; plant assemblages; trait-environment relationships","anthropogenic effect; bioclimatology; biogeography; environmental management; global change; land use change; seaweed culture; soil water; weed; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105093309

Cities, particularly building’s rooftops, constitute a promising infrastructure for enabling the use of locale solar resources. This study proposes a combined engineering–statistical methodology to assess the photovoltaic potential of residential rooftops. Using validated algorithms for solar simulation and geographical information system (GIS) for spatial dissemination, the proposed methodology deals with the lack of data and allows an accurate investigation of the geographical and technical potential. Applied to the municipality of Laghouat, the results reveal that suitable rooftops areas for PV installations in the examined typologies were approximately between 18 and 35%. Moreover, the deployment of distributed PV systems on residential rooftops provides significant technical potential, which could cover up to 55% of the annual electricity needs. These original findings offer a realistic assessment of the usable solar potential within municipalities, which helps decision-makers establish energy efficiency strategies by reducing energy consumption and increasing the share of renewable electricity production. Addition-ally, the discussion offers valuable insight into energy management and investigates eventual energy sharing among residential buildings to achieve a net-zero energy balance at the municipal level. © 2021 by the authors.

Cycling helps to reduce air pollution and traffic congestion, and so, it is one of the simplest ways to lower the environmental footprint of people. However, the cohabitation of cars and vulnerable road users, such as bikes, scooters, or pedestrians, is prone to cause accidents with serious consequences. In this context, technological solutions are sought that enable the generation of alerts to prevent these accidents, thereby promoting a safer city for these road users, and a cleaner environment. Alert systems based on smartphones can alleviate these situations since nearly all people carry such a device while traveling. In this work, we test the suitability of a smartphone based alert system, determining the most adequate communications architecture. Two protocols have been designed to send position and alert messages to/from a centralized server over 4G cellular networks. One of the protocols is implemented using a REST architecture on top of the HTTP protocol, and the other one is implemented over the UDP protocol. We show that the proposed alarm system is feasible regarding communication response time, and we conclude that the application should be implemented over the UDP protocol, as response times are about three times better than for the REST implementation. We tested the applications in real deployments, finding that drivers are warned of the presence of bicycles when closer than 150 m, having enough time to pay attention to the situation and drive more carefully to avoid a collision. © 2021 by the authors.

The aim of this study is to: (1) evaluate the land use change in Chonburi Province; the most urbanised city in the EEC of Thailand between 2006 and 2016, and (2) assess the land use change impact on ESV. Secondary data from land use maps for 2006 and 2016 was used to evaluate land use change and its impact on ESV using the land use transition matrix, land use dynamic degree, and the benefit transfer method. Urban and built-up land use were found to dominate other use types. The top three highest annual rates of land use change were found in water bodies, rangeland, and urban and built-up land. The ESV in 2016 was found to be 1.31% higher than for 2006. The ecosystem service functions (ESFs) contributing to the increase in ESV were waste treatment, hydrological regulation, climate regulation and recreation and service culture. Future land use planning should focus on increasing wetlands and protecting agricultural land in the study area since these contribute to the highest ESV. In addition, it is essential to balance economic development with ecological enhancement. © 2021, Chulalongkorn University - Environmental Research Institute.

Obtaining a clear understanding of where and how mining impacts ES and the methods used to show this is crucial for determining management approaches to overcome impacts. Here, we review the academic literature examining mining impacts to ES. We found only 60 papers assessed impacts to ES, with the majority focused on coal mining. Regulating services, such as carbon storage and erosion prevention, were most commonly assessed. We observed considerable variation in ES definitions and conceptualisations with no methodological consistency in ES assessments among studies. While we found negative impacts on ES were attributed to active mining operations and some positive impacts were related to restoration activities, our results also highlight major limitations to managing ES in mining regions. Assessing the full extent of impacts to ES from mining requires clear identification of changes in the ES chain – from biophysical supply to benefits and human wellbeing throughout the mining lifecycle. We propose a research agenda to address these knowledge gaps, which will help to improve pre- and post-mining ecosystem management for ES and human wellbeing. © 2020","Ecoservices; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem-based management; Mining; Systematic literature review; Wellbeing",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100079500

Using data collected in a survey of 338 citizens of Malmö, Sweden, we tested two hypotheses. H1: the motivation for personal decisions because they favour adaptation to the impacts of climate change correlates with the decision-making agent´s knowledge of specific local impacts of climate change, and H2: the motivation for personal decisions because they favour mitigation of climate change correlates with the risk perception of the decision-making agent. While decisions made because they favour mitigation correlated with negative net values of expected impacts of climate change (risk perception), decisions made because they favour adaptation correlated with its absolute value unless tipping point behaviour occurred. Tipping point behaviour occurs here when the decision-making agent abstains from decisions in response to climate change in spite of a strongly negative or positive net value of expected impacts. Hence, the decision-making agents´ lack of knowledge of specific climate change impacts inhibited decisions promoting adaptation. Moreover, positive experiences of climate change inhibited mitigation decisions. Discussing the results, we emphasised the importance of understanding the drivers of adaptation and mitigation decisions. In particular, we stress that attention needs to be paid to the balance between decisions solving problems ‘here and now’ and those focusing on the ‘there and then’. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the tight coordination of traits may provide underlying mechanisms of how locally adapted plant populations can become maladapted because of climate change. To better understand local adaptation in intraspecific trait coordination, we studied trait variability in the widely distributed foundation tree species, Populus fremontii using a common garden near the mid-elevational point of this species distribution. We examined 28 traits encompassing four spectra: phenology, leaf economic spectrum (LES), whole-tree architecture (Corner's Rule) and wood economic spectrum (WES). Based on adaptive syndrome theory, we hypothesized that trait expression would be coordinated among and within trait spectra, reflecting local adaptation to either exposure to freeze-thaw conditions in genotypes sourced from high-elevation populations or exposure to extreme thermal stress in genotypes sourced from low-elevation populations. High-elevation genotypes expressed traits within the phenology and WES that limit frost exposure and tissue damage. Specifically, genotypes sourced from high elevations had later mean budburst, earlier mean budset, higher wood densities, higher bark fractions and smaller xylem vessels than their low-elevation counterparts. Conversely, genotypes sourced from low elevations expressed traits within the LES that prioritized hydraulic efficiency and canopy thermal regulation to cope with extreme heat exposure, including 40% smaller leaf areas, 67% higher stomatal densities and 34% higher mean theoretical maximum stomatal conductance. Low-elevation genotypes also expressed a lower stomatal control over leaf water potentials that subsequently dropped to pressures that could induce hydraulic failure. Synthesis. Our results suggest that Populus fremontii expresses a high degree of coordination across multiple trait spectra to adapt to local climate constraints on photosynthetic gas exchange, growth and survival. These results, therefore, increase our mechanistic understanding of local adaptation and the potential effects of climate change that in turn, improves our capacity to identify genotypes that are best suited for future restoration efforts. © 2020 British Ecological Society","Corner's Rule; experimental common garden; foliage phenology; leaf economic spectrum; Physiology; plant–climate interaction; wood economic spectrum; xylem anatomy","adaptation; adaptive radiation; angiosperm; ecotype; environmental conditions; geographical distribution; intraspecific variation; local adaptation; resource assessment; resource use; Populus fremontii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097780144

To accomplish the research goal, the present study considered to evaluate bank line shifting, course change direction, change of channel patterns, change in channel width, rate of erosion, accretion and sedimentation, fluvial and floodplain landforms transformation, as well as hydrological dynamics. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal scale of morphological change were linked with drivers. For understanding the complex morphological process and response of the river, reliable historical time-series satellite images, and hydrological data were analyzed; as well as taking expert judgment and local knowledge into account. GIS and remote sensing (RS) tools, techniques and models were applied to process, analyze, and extract fluvial parameters from multitemporal Landsat satellite imagery. The results of the study demonstrate that erosion, accretion and historical migrated area significantly increased during the flooding period of 1988 and 1998 and that these hydromorphological hazards badly impacted on flood plain resources, agricultural systems, aquatic, and terrestrial biodiversity. Also, human interference, such as bridge construction and business purpose dredging badly impacted on the hydromorphological characteristics of this river. The results also reveal that Madhumati River had very low sinuosity in the time span 1973–2020. Gradually, the sinuosity value of this river is increasing over time. Sinuosity values of this river ranged between 0.98 (1973) and 1.11 (2020) with an average value 1.04 designating straight to sinuous nature. The scope of this research will suggest possible morphological adjustment for future management strategies of climate change, fluvial disasters, and develop resilience capability to the rural community. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bangladesh; Fluvial landforms; GIS; Morphodynamics; Remote sensing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092795298

However, next to scenarios about the future climate, scenarios about future vulnerability are essential, since also changing societal conditions fundamentally determine adaptation needs. At the international and national level, first initiatives for developing vulnerability scenarios and so-called shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) have been undertaken. Most of these scenarios, however, do not provide sufficient information for local scenarios and local climate risk management. There is an urgent need to develop scenarios for vulnerability at the local scale in order to complement climate change scenarios. Heat stress is seen as a key challenge in cities in the context of climate change and further urban growth. Based on the research project ZURES (ZURES 2020 website), the paper presents a new method for human vulnerability scenarios to heat stress at the very local scale for growing medium-sized cities. In contrast to global models that outline future scenarios mostly with a country-level resolution, we show a new method on how to develop spatially specific scenario information for different districts within cities, starting from the planned urban development and expansion. The method provides a new opportunity to explore how different urban development strategies and housing policies influence future human exposure and vulnerability. Opportunities and constraints of the approach are revealed. Finally, we discuss how these scenarios can inform future urban development and risk management strategies and how these could complement more global or national approaches. © 2021, The Author(s).","Adaptation to climate change; Heat stress; Urban areas; Vulnerability scenarios","Climate change; Planning; Risk management; Risk perception; Thermal stress; Adaptation needs; Adaptation strategies; Climate change scenarios; Climatic conditions; Human exposures; National level; Risk management strategies; Urban development; Urban growth; adaptive management; climate change; climate conditions; strategic approach; urban development; urban growth; urban planning; vulnerability; Baden-Wurttemberg; Germany; Ludwigsburg",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103857959

Climate change potentially worsens it and threatens the temple sustainability. The three objectives of this study are therefore to describe the microclimate characteristics determining the thermal comfort levels (indexed in the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET)) in the visitor area, define the adaptation level as a parameter for the mitigation strategies, and formulate the mitigation strategies for the extreme thermal condition in designing a climate-resilient archaeological park. This study utilized satellite image processing, seven-month field meteorological measurements, and surveys with a questionnaire to obtain the local and microclimate data, as well as visitors' thermal sensation and preferences. Subsequently, the data obtained were subjected to statistical analysis, and the results depict the uniqueness of local and microclimate characteristics of the archaeological site and visitors' adaptation level. The new PET's comfort range for hot months was discovered to be 33.5–36.0 °C. Based on the climate characteristics and subjective thermal comfort, this study formulated three mitigation strategies for the thermal condition of the visitor area. These are the placement of potted-tree clusters, planting numerous trees in the surrounding, and utilizing high solar reflective transparent coating. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Archaeological park; Climate characteristics; Mitigation; Thermal comfort",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101300873

In responding to this urgent and growing public health crisis, mitigation strategies are in place to reduce future greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) while adaptation strategies exist to reduce and/or alleviate the adverse effects of climate change by increasing systems’ resilience to future impacts. While these strategies have numerous positive benefits on climate change itself, they also often have other positive externalities or health co-benefits. This knowledge can be harnessed to promote and improve global public health, particularly for the most vulnerable populations. Previous conceptual models in mitigation and adaptation studies such as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) considered health in the thinking, but health outcomes were not their primary intention. Additionally, existing guidance documents such as the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidance for Climate Resilient and Environmentally Sustainable Health Care Facilities is designed primarily for public health professionals or healthcare managers in hospital settings with a primary focus on resilience. However, a detailed cross sectoral and multidisciplinary conceptual framework, which links mitigation and adaptation strategies with health outcomes as a primary end point, has not yet been developed to guide research in this area. In this paper, we briefly summarize the burden of climate change on global public health, describe important mitigation and adaptation strategies, and present key health benefits by giving context specific examples from high, middle, and low-income settings. We then provide a conceptual framework to inform future global public health research and preparedness across sectors and disciplines and outline key stakeholders recommendations in promoting climate resilient systems and advancing health equity. © 2021 by the authors.

Significant studies have been conducted on this pandemic, some of which have addressed understanding the relationship between different air pollutants and confirmed cases. In this study, the effects of four air pollutants (carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and sulfur dioxide) were assessed from February 19 to March 22, 2020 to explore how they can affect COVID-19 contagion in Iran. The mean concentrations of air pollutants were extracted from Sentinel 5P data. The COVID-19 confirmed case densities of two provinces, Semnan and Qom, were more than all other provinces. The effect of pollutants on the confirmed case densities was analyzed using multiple linear regression in order to estimate the impact coefficients for individual provinces. The impact coefficients determine the level of each pollutant’s contribution to the density of total confirmed cases. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone had both considerable negative and positive correlations with the density of confirmed COVID-19 cases, although sulfur dioxide was correlated more negatively than positively. In Semnan, a high hot spot province, nitrogen dioxide had the most significant effect on the density of confirmed cases among all pollutants, while the effect of carbon monoxide was greater in Qom. The results indicated that even short-term exposure to higher concentrations of the pollutants could lead to an increased risk of COVID-19 outbreaks, which should be considered in adopting adequate and appropriate control policies to manage the disease. © 2021, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Air pollutants; Confirmed cases; Impact coefficient; Iran; Sentinel-5P","Carbon monoxide; Disease control; Linear regression; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Sensitivity analysis; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollutants; Effect of carbons; Impact coefficients; Mean concentrations; Multiple linear regressions; Nitrogen dioxides; Positive correlations; Short-term exposure; Air pollution; carbon monoxide; concentration (composition); COVID-19; nitrogen dioxide; pollutant source; regression analysis; satellite data; sensitivity analysis; Sentinel; sulfur dioxide; virus; Iran; Semnan; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099303351

Nevertheless, transnational policies based on technological upgrade might not be always effective, as in the case of Europe, Northern and Southern countries face very different socioeconomic situations; conversely, policies seeking new ways of doing can be applied to overcome this technological gap. This research explores the applicability of two standards for thermal comfort, namely, ASHRAE 55–2017 and EN 16798–1:2019, to devise strategies aimed at reducing the energy consumption for heating and cooling in the European building sector, specifically focusing on the Mediterranean area. The climate of 32,564 locations has been analysed to assess the potential of applicability of these two standards, as well as natural ventilation and adaptive setpoint temperatures to reduce the energy demand of buildings.

S. japonica exhibits a high photosynthetic efficiency in natural seawater with low dissolved CO2 concentration, thus suggesting the presence of its carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM). However, the genes, proteins, and pathways involved in the CCM of S. japonica have not been fully identified and characterized. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is a crucial component of CCM in macroalgae. In this study, the cloning, characterization, and subcellular localization of a specific CA were described. Multisequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis indicated that this CA belonged to the gamma (Sjγ-CA) class. This enzyme has a full-length cDAN of 1370 bp, encodes a protein with 246 amino acids (aa; ca. 25.7 kDa), and contains the mitochondrial transit peptide of 16 aa and LbH_gama_CA_like domain of 159 aa that defined the γ-CA region. The Sjγ-CA was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified as an active recombinant CA. Immunogold electron microscopy and fluorescence localization illustrated that this enzyme is localized in the mitochondria, and its transcription level is up-regulated by low CO2 concentration. These findings showed that Sjγ-CA is a possible component of the CCM in S. japonica. This work is the first to report about the mtCA of macroalgae and provides a basis for further analysis on seaweed CCM. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon-concentrating mechanism; Carbonic anhydrase; Macroalgae; Mitochondrial CA; Saccharina japonica","Carbon dioxide; Clone cells; Escherichia coli; Mitochondria; Seaweed; Transcription; Carbon-concentrating mechanism; Fluorescence localization; Gamma carbonic anhydrase; Immunogold electron microscopies; Isolation and characterization; Photosynthetic efficiency; Phylogenetic analysis; Subcellular localizations; Carbonic anhydrase; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; complementary DNA; genomic DNA; polyclonal antibody; recombinant protein; transcriptome; carbonate dehydratase; brown alga; cell component; concentration (composition); detection method; enzyme; enzyme activity; macroalga; peptide; rocky shore; Article; cell inclusion; cellular distribution; controlled study; crystal structure; denaturation; enzyme activity; gametophyte; heterologous expression; hydration; immunogold electron microscopy; immunogold labeling; mitochondrial membrane; mitochondrion; molecular cloning; nonhuman; onion; phylogeny; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation; Saccharina japonica; seaweed; sequence analysis; Escherichia coli; genetics; mitochondrion; Escherichia coli; Japonica; Laminaria japonica; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Anhydrases; Escherichia coli; Mitochondria; Phylogeny",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097475289

Plant response to climate change on individual plant levels on a fine scale tends to change population structure, community composition and ecosystem processes and functioning. Therefore, we reviewed the literature on plant response and resilience to climate change in space and time at different scales on the Tibetan Plateau. We report that spatiotemporal variation in temperature and precipitation dynamics drives the vegetation and ecosystem function on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), following the water–energy dynamics hypothesis. Increasing temperature with respect to time increased the net primary productivity (NPP) on most parts of the Tibetan Plateau, but the productivity dynamics on some parts were constrained by 0.3◦ C decade−1 rising temperature. Moreover, we report that accelerating studies on plant community assemblage and their contribution to ecosystem functioning may help to identify the community response and resilience to climate extremes. Furthermore, records on species losses help to build the sustainable management plan for the entire Tibetan Plateau. We recommend that incorporating long-term temporal data with multiple factor analyses will be helpful to formulate the appropriate measures for a healthy ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau. © 2021 by the authors.

The FPS-SESA initiative seeks to promote inter-institutional collaboration and further networking with focus on extreme rainfall events. The main scientific aim is to study multi-scale processes and interactions most conducive to extreme precipitation events through both statistical and dynamical downscaling techniques, including convection-permitting simulations. To this end, a targeted experiment was designed considering the season October 2009 to March 2010, a period with a record number of extreme precipitation events within SESA. Also, three individual extreme events within that season were chosen as case studies for analyzing specific regional processes and sensitivity to resolutions. Four dynamical and four statistical downscaling models (RCM and ESD respectively) from different institutions contributed to the experiment. In this work, an analysis of the capability of the set of the FPS-SESA downscaling methods in simulating daily precipitation during the selected warm season is presented together with an integrated assessment of multiple sources of observations and available CORDEX Regional Climate Model simulations. Comparisons among all simulations reveal that there is no single model that performs best in all aspects evaluated. The ability in reproducing the different features of daily precipitation depends on the model. However, the evaluation of the sequence of precipitation events, their intensity and timing suggests that FPS-SESA simulations based on both RCM and ESD yield promising results. Most models capture the extreme events selected, although with a considerable spread in accumulated values and the location of heavy precipitation. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Extreme precipitation; Observational uncertainty; Southeastern South America; Statistical and dynamical downscaling","climate modeling; comparative study; computer simulation; downscaling; extreme event; numerical model; precipitation intensity; rainfall; regional climate; uncertainty analysis; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098775402

In this article we decompose changes in US residential energy supply and GHG emissions over the period 1990-2015 into relevant drivers for four end-use categories. The chosen drivers encompass changing demographics, housing characteristics, energy end-use intensities, and generation efficiency and GHG intensity of electricity. Reductions in household size, growth in heated floor area per house, and increased access to space cooling are the main drivers of increases in energy and GHG emissions after population growth. Growing shares of newer homes, and reductions in intensity of energy use per capita, household, or floor area have produced moderate primary energy and GHG emission reductions, but improved generation efficiency and decarbonization of electricity supply have brought about far bigger primary energy and GHG emission reductions. Continued decline of residential emissions from electrification of residential energy and decarbonization of electricity supply can be expected, but not fast enough to limit climate change to 1.5 ◦C warming. US residential final energy demand will therefore need to decline in absolute terms to meet such a target. However, without changes in the age distribution, type mix, or average size of housing, improvements in energy efficiency are unlikely to outweigh growth in the number of households from population growth and further household size reductions. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, climate represents only a fraction of the n-dimensional environment to which plant populations adapt, and studies are increasingly uncovering strong effects of nonclimatic factors on species’ distributions. We used a manipulative, factorial field experiment to quantify the effects of soil environment and precipitation (the putatively overriding climatic factor) on plant lifetime fitness outside the geographic range boundary of a native California annual plant. We grew plants outside the range edge in large mesocosms filled with soil from either within or outside the range, and plants were subjected to either a low (ambient) or high (supplemental) spring precipitation treatment. Soil environment had large effects on plant lifetime fitness that were similar in magnitude to the effects of precipitation. Moreover, mean fitness of plants grown with within-range soil in the low precipitation treatment approximated that of plants grown with beyond-range soil in the high precipitation treatment. The positive effects of within-range soil persisted in the second, wetter year of the experiment, though the magnitude of the soil effect was smaller than in the first, drier year. These results are the first we know of to quantify the effects of edaphic variation on plant lifetime fitness outside a geographic range limit and highlight the need to include factors other than climate in models of species’ distributions. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America","Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana; edaphic; geographic range limit; local adaptation; mutualism; range expansion; species distributions","climate change; environmental factor; experimental study; fitness; growth response; precipitation assessment; range expansion; soil-vegetation interaction; California; United States; Clarkia xantiana; Clarkia; plant; season; soil; Clarkia; Plants; Seasons; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100062094

Here we provide a comprehensive literature review to examine how GBI affects FWEN in urban centers, an area which is currently understudied. In order to do this, we undertake a systematic review of the literature using a meta-analytic approach and topic modelling. Based on our synthesis, we develop a conceptual framework of the key links between urban GBI and FWEN and the direction and magnitude of the relationship. We found that GBIs can benefit food supply, energy saving, and climate change mitigation but at a price of food safety and water contamination. Well-designed urban construction can help curb the negative effects. Therefore, we need to make deliberate and integrative policy to link GBI with each element in urban FWEN. Moreover, the focus of studies on GBIFWEN links is also heterogeneous across cities: urban agriculture and food security are priorities in cities located in Africa and Asia as well as in lower income and larger cities (but not metropolitan areas), while the cooling effect of green space has been a focus for cities of middle or high income. Finally, current research focuses on isolated analysis, lacking integrated studies needed for decision making supporting tools. While isolated analyses lead to connectivity failures and can result in adverse impacts, integrated analyses can identify interdependencies of environmental resources between parts of a cycle and across different scales, which can increase resource efficiency and minimize environmental degradation. Therefore, our key findings point out the importance of linking the effects of GBI on each component of FWEN in both research and policy making. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","FWE nexus framework; Green infrastructure; Nature-based solutions; Urban agriculture; Urban nexus; Urban sustainability","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate change; Decision making; Energy conservation; Enterprise resource management; Food supply; Sustainable development; Water pollution; Climate change mitigation; Conceptual frameworks; Environmental resources; Integrated analysis; Resource efficiencies; Urban agricultures; Urban construction; Water contamination; Thermal processing (foods)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099223515

However, the accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) in Mediterranean regions has been difficult to predict and is subject to multiple environmental and land management factors. Gains, losses, and no significant changes have all been reported. Here we compile chronosequence data (n = 113) from published studies and new field sites to assess the response of SOC to agricultural land abandonment in peninsular Spain. We found an overall SOC accumulation rate of +2.3% yr−1 post-abandonment. SOC dynamics are highly variable and context-dependent. Minimal change occurs on abandoned cereal croplands compared to abandoned woody croplands (+4% yr−1). Accumulation is most prevalent within a Goldilocks climatic window of ~13–17 °C and ~450–900 mm precipitation, promoting &gt;100% gains after three decades. Our secondary forest field sites accrued 40.8 Mg C ha−1 (+172%) following abandonment and displayed greater SOC and N depth heterogeneity than natural forests demonstrating the long-lasting impact of agriculture. Although changes in regional climate and crop types abandoned will impact future carbon sequestration, abandonment remains a low-cost, long-term natural climate solution best incorporated in tandem with other multipurpose sustainable land management strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural land abandonment; Chronosequence; Ecological succession; Land use change; Soil carbon sequestration; Spain","Agricultural robots; Forestry; Land use; Organic carbon; Soils; Accumulation rates; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Mediterranean region; Secondary forests; Secondary succession; Soil organic carbon; Sustainable land managements; Climate change; organic carbon; soil organic carbon; unclassified drug; abandoned land; accumulation rate; agricultural land; carbon sequestration; chronosequence; land management; land use change; soil carbon; soil organic matter; agricultural land abandonment; Article; carbon nitrogen ratio; chronosequence; controlled study; cropland; dynamics; environmental impact; forest; land use; nitrogen concentration; precipitation; priority journal; Spain; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096119321

Their resilience is being challenged due to socio-political consequences of increasingly frequent and severe storms, due to climate changes, influx of human and animal refugees and as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors prepared a systematic literature of ways cities can be transformed into more resilient, and sustainable regions by creatively enhancing the quality and quantity of blue and green areas in and around them. The literature review was conducted to provide holistic insights into selection, implementation monitoring, assessment, and valuation of Nature-based Solutions in diverse urban regions. The authors reviewed no fewer than 298 articles from 109 academic journals and related sources, published within 1997–2020. The focus of the articles was upon ‘nature-based’ changes that are being implemented in urban areas, globally to enhance their resilience and the ‘quality-of-life’ of humans and other species. By implementing nature-based solutions, and complimentary ‘urban wilding’ approaches, urban areas and their hinterlands are expanding their ‘blue’ and ‘green’ areas and are thereby decreasing the ‘heat-island’ effects, while improving human health by surrounding them with rich bio-diversities of locally adapted, aquatic and terrestrial plants and animals. Although, many NBS options have been documented to be beneficial, their environmental, economic and social/psychological dimensions have not been adequately quantified, especially in the context of climate changes, and with regard to COVID-19. It is essential that the benefits of NBS are quantified with easily measurable outcomes, that are readily understood by practitioners, city policy-makers and members of community organizations, based upon specific geographical and climatological contexts. This will help them accelerate implementation of NBS and wilding into their urban systems. The reviewers found that more research is needed on anticipatory learning, backcasting and community participation to help to effectively implement the appropriate NBS for improving the sustainability of urban systems. The reviewers provide guidance for urban leaders to incorporate NBS into their policies and strategies to improve urban resilience and equity and to more effectively reduce impacts of climate change, population growth and pandemics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Anticipatory learning; Bio-assessment; Enhanced urban resilience; Heat-island effects; Nature-based solutions; Pandemics; Rewilding; Transformative capacity; Urban sustainability indicators; Urban wellbeing","Animals; Population statistics; Storms; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Anticipatory learning; Community organizations; Community participation; Literature reviews; Population growth; Provide guidances; Terrestrial plants; Urban resilience; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098627562

Coastal Louisiana has extensive marsh habitats (fresh, intermediate, brackish, and saline) where soil cores were collected to a depth of 100 cm at 24 sites to assess long-term carbon accumulation and burial rates. Select soil depth intervals were analyzed for bulk density, total carbon, and radionuclide (137Cs and 210Pb) dating. Marsh habitat maps (years 1949–2013) were also used to determine the most frequently occurring habitat at each field site. Over 5 decades, half of the sites transitioned between marsh habitats at least once. Saline marshes tended to have lower mean total carbon density (0.04 ± 0.002 g cm−3) and lower mean long-term total carbon accumulation rates (211 ± 46 g TC m−2 yr−1, n = 5, based on 210Pb) compared to the other marsh habitats. Using marsh habitat specific accumulation rates and area, the total carbon burial rate for coastal Louisiana in year 2013 was estimated at 4.3 Tg TC yr−1 which accounts for about 5%–21% of the estimated tidal wetland burial rate globally. Historically, about 1.0 Tg TC yr−1 was lost due to reduced marsh area from 1949 to 2013. With no coastal restoration activity, the predicted wetland loss over the next 50 years could reduce carbon burial in coastal Louisiana to 2.1 Tg TC yr−1, a reduction of about 50% from the year 2013 rate, with potential to significantly alter the global carbon budget. © 2021.

However, although HSR can provide travel times similar to those provided by short-haul flights, and at lower emission levels, it also requires considerable investments in time and infrastructure to build. Instead, this study considers the feasibility of replacing short-haul flights with existing non-high-speed rail (NHSR). Our study is based in Finland, a country that has an extensive route network of short-haul flights but does not possess any HSR. We compared all 16 city pairs for which short-haul flights are offered with existing NHSR based on the total carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO2-eq) and real travel times from door-to-door. Two scenarios were developed based on the results, which suggest replacing all short-haul flights with NHSR in Finland. This would result in a 95% emissions reduction. In terms of travel times, NHSR could remain competitive against air travel on distances up to 400 km. © 2020 World Conference on Transport Research Society","Climate change; Emissions reduction; Modal shift; Short-haul flights; Train; Travel time","air transportation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; high-speed train; travel time; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087985704

However, the objective long-term impact of bikesharing on reducing auto-dependence is not well-examined, as prior studies have tended to rely on self-reported subjective mode substitution effects. We use a unique longitudinal dataset containing millions of geo-referenced vehicle registrations and odometer readings in Massachusetts over a six-year period - the Massachusetts Vehicle Census - to examine the causal impact of bikesharing on various metrics of auto-dependence in the inner core of Metro Boston. The difference-in-differences (DiD) framework is extended to accommodate spatial spillover effects with the inclusion of a spatial autoregressive lag leading to the spatial DiD (SpDiD) model. We also account for seasonal variation in bikeshare operations, where several stations are shut down for the winter months, by setting up a dynamic treatment definition. We find that a new bikeshare station reduces vehicle ownership per household by 2.2%, vehicle miles traveled per person by 3.3%, and per-capita vehicular GHG emissions by 2.9%. We also find strong evidence to support the use of bikesharing as a first/last-mile connector to mass transit. Auto-dependence reductions are around 10% (more than thrice as high as average) where bikeshare connections to transit stations are less than one kilometer long. Finally, we find that vehicle ownership reductions are almost immediate and last up to a year, while vehicle use and emission reductions are lagged over 1.5 years. These sizeable and measurable auto-substitution effects do support some of the claims of bikesharing advocates. These findings are especially important in the post-COVID-19 era, as cities strive to counter the pandemic-inspired safety skepticism about non-car travel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bikesharing; Difference-in-differences; Spatial autocorrelation; Vehicle emissions; Vehicle miles traveled; Vehicle ownership","Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Difference-in-differences; Dynamic treatments; Emission reduction; Seasonal variation; Substitution effect; Sustainable mobility; Vehicle registration; Vehicle-miles traveled; Vehicles; autocorrelation; car ownership; cycle transport; data set; neighborhood; public transport; seasonal variation; traffic emission; transportation planning; Massachusetts; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100510189

Results: Study revealed that among different agro-ecosystems (AESs), above ground biomass (AGB) carbon was found to be highest for Humid Alluvial Flood Free (HAFF) (7.92 Tg) followed by High Land (HL) (3.20 Tg) and lowest was recorded for Char Area (CA) where as total biomass carbon stock was high under Humid Alluvial Flood Free (HAFF) situation followed by Humid Alluvial Flood Prone (HAFP) and then High Land (HL). Bulk density (BD) was higher for agricultural land compare to forest soil, but cation exchange capacity and organic carbon were opposite. Profiles under forest land use system exhibited relatively higher SOCD than paddy irrespective of AESs with an exception in one location of HAFF where SOCD under paddy showed higher value than forest land use system. Interpretation: It is important to develop some strategies or methodologies to improve soil carbon reserve in this region to reduce CO2 emission. Moreover, monitoring of change in carbon stock over years in different agro-ecosystems is also important to evaluate efficiency of different methodologies and proper implementation. © 2021 Triveni Enterprises.

For example, with expected mass retirement of cranberry farms in New England, there is increasing interest in restoring retired cranberry farms back to wetlands. To understand how restoration of retired cranberry farms to wetland ecosystems influences climate-related ecosystem functions, we assessed methane and carbon dioxide emissions from different post-farming management options, including an actively farmed cranberry bog, young and old retired cranberry bogs, young and old restored cranberry bogs, and a natural reference bog. In addition to methane and carbon dioxide, we measured key soil properties influential in greenhouse gas flux, including soil organic matter, moisture, pH, redox potential, and bulk density. Greenhouse gas flux differed significantly by site type, with the restored systems functioning similarly to the natural reference wetland while retired sites had fluxes similar to the actively farmed site. The older restored site had significantly lower emissions of both methane and carbon dioxide than the newly restored site, indicating that over a larger time scale, restored systems may transition from net carbon dioxide sources to sinks. Overall, the results of this study suggest that in addition to the many other ecological benefits, the restoration of wetlands may also play a role in climate change mitigation through their ability to store carbon. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration","carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; cranberry bogs; development trajectory; ecosystem function; methane","agricultural land; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; ecosystem function; greenhouse gas; methane; restoration ecology; wetland; Vaccinium macrocarpon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097509517

Research and monitoring activities were expanded in 1991 by the U.S. Geological Survey Water, Energy, and Biogeochemical Budgets program to understand the processes, and their interactions, controlling water, energy, and biogeochemical fluxes. With help from many collaborators we have characterized trends and patterns in atmospheric deposition, climate, and hydrology, including glaciers and other ice features. Instead of acidic deposition, we documented high atmospheric inputs of reactive nitrogen (Nr), and have studied the ecological consequences in soils, surface water, and vegetation. Using paleolimnology, we documented the onset of human-caused change to lake primary producers ca. 1950 in response to increased Nr deposition and warming. Our results provided the basis for the Colorado Nitrogen Deposition Reduction Plan, a state policy that aims to reduce Nr emissions to protect resources in RMNP by 2032. Carbon cycle research revealed mountain wetlands now release more carbon than they store, and respiration and methane flux occurs even during winter through deep snow packs. Trend analyses found export of Nr to be closely tied to atmospheric inputs, but can lag in response to drought. Current research explores consequences of the combination of warming, changes in precipitation dynamics, and atmospheric deposition of Nr and dust on stream and lake CO2 dynamics, lake biology and trophic state, and soil carbon composition. Dramatic increases in park visitors have prompted studies on the effects of recreational use on water quality. New tools such as remote sensing and high frequency instream water quality sensors are being applied to lake and stream studies. Monitoring, combined with experiments, models, and spatial comparisons is an essential foundation for science-based resource management. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","alpine ecosystem; atmospheric deposition; biogeochemistry; carbon; nitrogen; subalpine ecosystem","Atmospheric chemistry; Biogeochemistry; Budget control; Carbon; Lakes; Landforms; Meteorological problems; Nitrogen; Precipitation (meteorology); Remote sensing; Water quality; Watersheds; Atmospheric depositions; Biogeochemical fluxes; Ecological consequences; In-stream water quality; Monitoring activities; Nitrogen deposition; Rocky Mountain National Park; U.s. geological surveys; Ecosystems; atmospheric deposition; biogeochemistry; carbon; freshwater ecosystem; national park; nitrogen; paleolimnology; subalpine environment; trend analysis; Colorado; Loch Vale; Rocky Mountain National Park; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103360477

Whereas the intrinsic and environmental drivers of LFMC in individual plants are fairly well understood, less is known about ecological interactions potentially affecting LFMC in diverse plant communities. Here, we asked how the interaction between climate and species diversity affects the spatial and temporal dynamics of LFMC in Mediterranean plant communities. We sampled LFMC in six plant communities located along a steep precipitation gradient in four monthly intervals and analysed how LFMC was affected by the structure of the community as well by site and climate conditions. LFMC varied greatly among species, and climate and species richness had an interactive effect on LFMC. On average, species richness had a strong negative effect on LFMC in sites with high rainfall, whereas in drier sites, richness had a small positive effect. Yet the effect of richness on LFMC varied across species, with some exhibiting a positive effect of richness on their LFMC. Individuals surrounded by more heterospecifics tended to have lower LFMC compared with ones surrounded by conspecifics. Our results highlight the interactive roles of climate and community characteristics on LFMC dynamics in eastern Mediterranean ecosystems. © 2021 IAWF.","ecophysiology; fire; global change ecology; live fuel moisture content; Mediterranean; plant-climate interactions; plant-plant interactions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096172329

However, large-scale process deployment is currently limited by unfavourable process economics resulting from significant up- and down-stream costs for obtaining pure CO2, separation of reaction products and increased logistical effort. We have discovered a method for economically viable recycling of waste CO2 that addresses these challenges. Our approach is based on integration of a CO2R unit into an existing manufacturing process: ethylene oxide (EO) production, which emits CO2 as a by-product. The standard EO process separates waste CO2 from the gas stream, hence the substrate for electroreduction is available at an EO plant at no additional cost. CO2 can be converted into an ethylene-rich stream and recycled on-site back to the EO reactor, which uses ethylene as a raw material, and also the anode product (oxygen) can be simultaneously valorized for the EO production reaction. If powered by a renewable electricity source, the process will significantly (ca. 80%) reduce the CO2 emissions of an EO manufacturing plant. A sensitivity analysis shows that the recycling approach can be economically viable in the short term and that its payback time could be as low as 1-2 years in the regions with higher carbon taxes and/or with access to low-cost electricity sources. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Aliphatic compounds; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Economics; Electrolytic reduction; Ethylene; Recycling; Sensitivity analysis; Clean manufacturing; Electrochemical conversion; Low-cost electricity; Manufacturing plant; Manufacturing process; Recycling of wastes; Renewable electricity; Renewable power generation; Costs; carbon dioxide; economic analysis; ethylene; reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103508819

In this article, we analyze the performance of a two-hop cooperative network with green self-sustaining nodes. The source and relay nodes are equipped with energy buffers, and store the energy harvested from the ambience. Signal transmission is powered at both source and relay solely by the stored energy. Both fixed and adaptive-rate transmission schemes are considered, and analytical expressions are presented for throughput and ergodic rate. Unlike all previous works that use discrete-state Markov chains to model the buffer dynamics, we use the more appropriate discrete-time continuous-state space Markov chain. We consider two different energy management policies at the source and relay: best-effort policy (BEP) and on-off policy (OOP). It is observed that for fixed-rate transmission, the better choice of buffer management policy (throughput-wise) at the source and the relay buffers depends on the relay location and target rate. On the other hand, for adaptive rate transmission, using BEP policy at both the energy buffers ensures best performance. The derived analytical expressions are validated by Monte Carlo simulations. © 2017 IEEE.","cooperative communication; Energy harvesting; Internet of Things; relays","Energy harvesting; Markov chains; Monte Carlo methods; Adaptive rate transmission; Analytical expressions; Battery replacements; Carbon foot prints; Continuous State Space; Cooperative networks; Management policy; Signal transmission; Cooperative communication",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091691145

During the era of primordial nucleosynthesis, the light elements 2H, 3He, 4He, and 7Li were produced in significant amounts, and these abundances have since been modified primarily by stars. Observations of 3He+ in H ii regions located throughout the Milky Way disk reveal very little variation in the 3He/H abundance ratio - the ""3He Plateau""- indicating that the net effect of 3He production in stars is negligible. This is in contrast to much higher 3He/H abundance ratios reported for some planetary nebulae. This discrepancy is known as the ""3He Problem.""We use radio recombination lines observed simultaneously with the 3He+ transition to make a robust assessment of the spectral sensitivity that these observations achieve. We detect spectral lines at ∼1-2 mK intensities, but at these levels, instrumental effects compromise our ability to measure accurate spectral line parameters.

This result calls into question all reported detections of 3He+ emission from any planetary nebula. The 3He/H abundance upper limit we derive here for NGC 3242 is inconsistent with standard stellar production of 3He and thus requires that some type of extra-mixing process operates in low-mass stars. © 2021.

To achieve deep decarbonisation, recent scholarship identifies the crucial role of broad policy mixes that create reinforcing effects between climate and energy policies to trigger technological innovation, restrict polluting activities, promote green growth, and ensure just energy transitions. Drawing on this literature, the article explores the conditions for developing such policy mixes in the US context in three policy phases. How and why have key policy conditions developed differently in the climate- and energy policy fields, and to what effect for decarbonisation policies? The analysis shows that growing political polarisation blocked bipartisan agreement, produced negative policy feedback, and caused instability in the climate policy field, whereas these mechanisms did not dominate the energy policy field. A more bipartisan approach to renewable energy policy allowed long-term experience and positive feedback in energy-policy programmes that helped to trigger technology innovation and subsequent GHG emissions cuts. Different policy conditions within these policy fields discouraged a coupling between them that could have facilitated green-growth policies. The economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic may potentially change policy conditions and build a path to deep US decarbonisation in the future, but only if political polarisation on climate change can be overcome. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Climate policy; Energy policy; Green growth; Political polarisation; United States","climate change; energy policy; greenhouse gas; innovation; international agreement; polarization; policy making; technological development; United States; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100949957

Using the synoptic climatological approach, the Lamb Weather Type (LWT) method was applied to NCEP/NCAR daily mean sea level pressure data. Basically, northwesterly (NW), northerly (N), and northeasterly (NE) circulation types (CTs), which blow from the Black Sea (BS), were thought to be important for sea-effect snowfall events to occur. Wind speeds and flows at 850-hPa, directional shear, and temperature difference between sea surface and 850-hPa level (SST-T850) thresholds were applied to these three CTs in order to find suitable snowfall cases originating from the Black-Sea. The results showed that 4, 14, and 111 snowfall episodes occurred during NW, N, and NE circulation types over Istanbul with the 2.8, 4.1, and 3.5 cm daily mean snow cover depths (DMSCD), respectively. In particular, it was found that interaction between a surface high located over continental Europe and a low pressure located over the central Black Sea, and a relatively warm sea surface temperature (SST), and cold temperature anomaly at the low level of the atmosphere (SST-T850 &gt; 17°C) are a favourable environment for the development of intense Black Sea-effect snowstorms (DMSCD &gt; 10 cm) sourced by NE cases.

The national Acid Rain Program (Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments - CAAA) helped reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) and resulted in sharp decreases in the acidity of atmospheric deposition. The decrease in acidic deposition produced a steady decline in the acidity of streams in many poorly buffered waters across the western Adirondacks and parts of the Catskill Mountains of New York. Until recently, however, there has been little evidence of biological recovery in most acid-sensitive streams in both regions. Long-term deposition and stream-chemistry records and fish-community data from quantitative surveys done during 1991–93 and again during 2012–19 at 13 sites in the upper Neversink River and its tributaries were evaluated to determine if chemical and biological recovery were evident in this Catskill Mountain watershed and if they could be linked to regional declines in acidic deposition. Between 1991 and 2019, large decreases in sulfate and nitrate deposition in the basin mirrored declines in total nationwide SO2 and NOx emissions. There were corresponding decreases in sulfate and nitrate concentrations in deposition at a National Trends Network station at Frost Valley (NY68) and coincident declines in sulfate concentrations at four long-term monitoring sites in the Neversink River watershed. Mean acid neutralizing capacity and pH increased and inorganic aluminum (Ali) concentrations from routine summertime samples decreased significantly at most moderately to severely acidified sites between the two study periods. Richness, density, and biomass of fish communities increased at most sites, while the density and biomass of brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis populations increased at fewer sites that were undergoing chemical recovery. Although recovery is far from complete, trends in deposition chemistry, water quality, and fish assemblages in streams of the upper Neversink watershed indicate that the 1990 CAAA is having positive impacts on aquatic ecosystems in the Catskill Mountain region, New York. © 2021","Acidification; Brook trout; Catskill streams; Clean air act amendments; Fisheries; Recovery","Acid rain; Air quality standards; Aquatic ecosystems; Data streams; Deposition; Fish; Landforms; Meteorological problems; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Recovery; Sulfur dioxide; Water quality; Watersheds; Acid neutralizing capacity; Atmospheric depositions; Chemical and biologicals; Clean air act amendments; Deposition chemistry; Nitrate concentration; Sulfate concentrations; Terrestrial ecosystems; Rivers; aluminum; nitrate; nitrogen oxide; river water; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; acid deposition; acidification; atmospheric deposition; biological analysis; biomass; chemical analysis; clean development mechanism; concentration (composition); ecological impact; emission inventory; mountain stream; watershed; acid deposition; acidification; aquatic environment; Article; biomass; concentration (parameter); law; nonhuman; pH; population density; priority journal; river basin; Salvelinus fontinalis; species richness; stream (river); waste water recycling; water quality; watershed; Adirondack Mountains; Appalachians; Catskill Mountains; New York [United States]; United States; Salvelinus fontinalis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100739293

In these systems, a new component is introduced, forest litter, which consti-tutes one of the main ways of incorporating carbon into the soil–plant system. The present work seeks to establish a methodological approach to study the dynamics of litter production and decomposition in an integrated way. The general objective was to characterize and compare the litter production dynamics in 14-year-old Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex Maiden and Pinus taeda L. commercial plantations. During two years, seasonal evaluations of fall, decomposition and accumulation of litter were carried out in stands of both species. In turn, the contribution of carbon from forest species to the soil through isotopic analysis techniques was quantified. Litterfall in E. grandis showed maximums during the spring of the first year and in the spring and summer of the second. In P. taeda, the maximums occurred in summer of the first year and in autumn of the second. In relation to the decomposition rate, the results based on short periods of evaluation between 15 and 21 months did not show differences between species, nor for the different moments of beginning of the evaluation, obtaining average values of 0.0369 month−1 for E. grandis and 0.0357 month−1 for P. taeda. In turn, both the decomposition rate of the material as a whole and the estimates of accu-mulated biomass in equilibrium state did not show significant differences between the species. Additionally, there was a relevant incorporation of carbon into the soil by forest species, funda-mentally in the first few centimeters, substituting an important proportion of the carbon inherited by the original cover of native pastures. Finally, it is necessary to specify that the scope of the findings obtained is greatly limited by the sample size used in this study. © 2021 by the authors.

The simulation results are often highly uncertain due to imperfections of the model structure and inevitable uncertainties of input data. The trend towards monitoring of combined sewer overflows (CSO) structures produces more and more data which can be used to replace parts of the models and reduce uncertainty. In this study we use highly resolved online flow and quality monitoring data to optimize static outflow settings of CSO tanks. In a second step, the additional benefit of real time control (RTC) strategies is assessed. In both cases the aim is the reduction of CSO emissions. The methodology is developed on a conceptual drainage system with two CSO tanks and then applied to a case study area in Southern Germany with six tanks. A measured time series of six months is sufficient for reliable optimization results in the conceptual catchment as well as in the case study area system. In the investigated system the choice of the optimization objective (minimum overflow volume or total suspended solids (TSS) load) had no significant influence on the result. The presented method is particularly suitable for areas in which reliable monitoring data are available, but hydrological parameters of the catchment areas are uncertain. One strength of the proposed approach lies in the accurate representation of the distribution of emissions between the individual CSO structures over an entire system.

This study is framed on the assumption that rural women are likely to be affected differently by climate change due to cultural differences. The life history approach was utilised to conduct empirical research in the Bamenda Highlands Region, Cameroon on ethnicity and differential effects of climate change among female farmers in the communities of Kom and Oku representing a matrilineal and patrilineal communities respectively. The research found that single and married women in both matrilineal and patrilineal societies experienced similar patterns of vulnerability relating to socio-economic and cultural discrimination stemming from patriarchal dominance. However, the study also highlighted that contrary to other communities women are not more economically empowered under matrilineal systems than their counterparts in patrilineal societies. In contrast, widows in patrilineal societies were found to have more autonomy in the control of land and other resources than those in matrilineal societies.

There is a need to search for materials that will reduce environmental degradation and ensure sustainability. Natural pozzolanic materials possess certain characteristics such that their use in mortar and cement production could reduce the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to the transformation of limestone (CaCO3) into lime for production of Portland cements. Colossal deposits of volcanic pozzolan outcrop in the Njimbouot II locality and the characterization of those materials is vital in deciphering their suitability in cement production as a construction material for sustainable development. Grinding is the only treatment performed on pozzolans in order to increase their specific surface area and reactivity. The rate of substitution of cement with pozzolan in the samples varied from 0%, 10%, and 15% to 25%. Mechanical tests were carried out after 7, 28 and 90 days on mortar specimens (4 × 4 × 16 cm3). Results revealed the presence of amorphous phases. The activity index obtained was approximately 75% and the lapilli and volcanic ash in this area are classified as pozzolans (classificationASTM C618). Regardless of the rate of substitution, the mechanical proprieties of mortars are observed to increase with age. The compressive strength values changed from 33.72 to 52.5 MPa while the flexural strength evolved from 5.62 to 8.29 MPa revealing that the Njimbouot II Pozzolan are advantageous in the manufacture of ecological cements. ©2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Ecological cements; Mechanical properties; Partial substitution; Volcanic pozzolan","Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Cement manufacture; Compressive strength; Lime; Mortar; Portland cement; Sustainable development; Volcanoes; Activity index; Amorphous phasis; Cement production; Composite cements; Infrastructural development; Mortar specimens; Pozzolanic materials; Volcanic ash; Pozzolan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103549526

Dall’s sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) in northwestern regions of the USA and Canada, survive long, severe winters and reproduce during summers with short growing seasons. We sought to understand the vulnerability of Dall’s sheep to a changing climate in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska, USA. We developed ecological hypotheses about nutritional needs, security from predators, energetic costs of movement, and thermal shelter to describe habitat selection during winter, spring, and summer and evaluated habitat and climate variables that reflected these hypotheses. We used the synoptic model of animal space use to estimate parameters of habitat selection by individual females and calculated likelihoods for ecological hypotheses within seasonal models. Our results showed that seasonal habitat selection was influenced by multiple ecological requirements simultaneously. Across all seasons, sheep selected steep rugged areas near escape terrain for security from predators. During winter and spring, sheep selected habitats with increased forage and security, moderated thermal conditions, and lowered energetic costs of movement. During summer, nutritional needs and security influenced habitat selection. Climate directly influenced habitat selection during the spring lambing period when sheep selected areas with lower snow depths, less snow cover, and higher air temperatures. Indirectly, climate is linked to the expansion of shrub/scrub vegetation, which was significantly avoided in all seasons. Dall’s sheep balance resource selection to meet multiple needs across seasons and such behaviors are finely tuned to patterns of phenology and climate. Direct and indirect effects of a changing climate may reduce their ability to balance their needs and lead to continued population declines. However, several management approaches could promote resiliency of alpine habitats that support Dall’s sheep populations.

Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change owing to their high dependence on agriculture for livelihood sustenance. Building smallholder farmers’ livelihood resilience to the adverse effects of environmental change is critical to addressing their vulnerabilities. This paper comparatively assessed livelihood resilience of smallholder farmers in Isiolo County, Kenya and Northwestern Cameroon in the face of environmental changes. The results are based on household surveys of 339 farmers in Kenya and 350 farmers in Cameroon. Findings showed that using the same measures of livelihood resilience, farmers’ resilience were significantly different in the Kenyan and Cameroonian study areas (p < 0.05), with farmers in Cameroon being relatively more resilient than farmers in Kenya. In both study sites, a statistically significant causal relationship (p < 0.05) existed between farmers’ resilience and livelihood capital assets such as human capital (number of household members between 18 to 55 years, education level), natural capital (number of farms, size of farmland, number of agroforestry trees on the farm), financial capital (access to bank account, ownership of livestock, ownership of farmland, trees, and farm equipment), social capital (participation in agricultural group), and physical capital (use of irrigation). However, some livelihood capital assets were more important for building resilience in Isiolo County, Kenya while others were more important in Northwestern Cameroon. On the basis of these findings, it is recommended that climate change adaptation interventions and policies should take a critical look at the determinants of resilience in order to come up with effective plans of action that can enhance farmers’ resilience to environmental changes occurring in Kenya and Cameroon, and elsewhere. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Cameroon; Climate change; Kenya; Livelihood resilience; Smallholder farmers","Agricultural robots; Farms; Forestry; Surveys; Agricultural sector; Causal relationships; Climate change adaptation; Comparative analysis; Environmental change; Financial capital; Household members; Smallholder farmers; Climate change; agroforestry; comparative study; ecosystem resilience; environmental change; human capital; livelihood; natural capital; ownership; smallholder; social capital; Cameroon; Isiolo; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103541166

It was within this context that this study appraised smallholder farmers’ agroforestry practices faced with climate change adversities. Biophysical and socio-economic data were collected from ten villages in Cameroon. Findings showed that climate parameters have experienced significant fluctuations in the past five decades. Smallholder farmers practice several agroforestry practices and integrate a plethora of tree/shrub species on agroforestry plots in order to adapt to climate change. Six main types of agroforestry trees/shrub species (trees/shrubs used for fuelwood, fruits, building materials, fodder, soil improvement, medicines) were integrated by smallholder farmers within agroforestry plots. T test and Chi-square test statistics indicated a strong non-causal relationship between explanatory variables (institutional and socio-economic attributes) and smallholder farmers’ agroforestry practicing decision faced with CVC. Logistic regression showed that a strong positive causal relationship exists between four explanatory variables (age of household head, access to information, access to credit and degree of vulnerability) and smallholder farmers’ agroforestry practicing decision faced with CVC. The study therefore recommends that institutional and socio-economic factors (credit facilities and reliable information) fostering smallholder farmers’ practice of agroforestry faced with CVC should be provided by governmental and non-governmental agencies in order to enhance the odds of smallholder farmers practicing agroforestry faced with the adverse effects of CVC. © 2020, NAAS (National Academy of Agricultural Sciences).","Agroforestry practices; Cameroon; Climate change; Climate variability; Smallholder farmers","Forestry; Logistic regression; Statistical tests; Causal relationships; Climate parameters; Climate variability and change; Explanatory variables; Governmental agency; Smallholder farmers; Socio-economic data; Socio-economic factor; Climate change; agricultural worker; agroforestry; climate change; decision making; regression analysis; rural development; rural planning; smallholder; Cameroon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092700210

Cannabidiol (CBD), which accumulates in biomembranes, may be a promising protective antioxidant compound. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of short-term (24 h) and long-term (48 h) CBD application on the proteomic profile of biological membranes in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes. The data obtained show that UVB radiation quantita-tively and qualitatively modified cell membrane proteins, with a particular research focus on adducts of proteins with the lipid peroxidation products malondialdehyde (MDA) or 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). CBD application reduced the UVB-enhanced level of these protein adducts. This was particularly notable amongst proteins related to cell proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, CBD dramatically increased the UVB-induced expression of proteins involved in the regulation of protein translation and cell proliferation (S3a/L13a/L7a ribosomal proteins), the inflammatory response (S100/S100-A6 proteins), and maintenance of redox balance (peroxiredoxin-1, carbonyl reductase 1, and aldo-keto reductase family 1 members). In contrast, CBD effects on the level of 4-HNE-protein adducts involved in the antioxidant response and proteasomal degradation process indicate that CBD may protect keratinocytes in connection with protein catabolism processes or pro-apoptotic action. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the relative contribution of hydroclimatic variables (relative humidity, terrestrial water storage, day and night-time land surface temperatures) on vegetation growth of agricultural and nonagricultural areas at the global scale remains unexplored. Using satellite-based datasets, we examined the changes in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the four hydroclimatic variables during 2003–2014. Also, the relative contribution of the four hydroclimatic variables on vegetation growth in agricultural and nonagricultural areas was estimated. A significant (p-value < 0.05) greening has occurred in the agricultural regions of India and Brazil during 2003–2014. Whereas in nonagriculture areas, a considerable greening occurred only in India and China during the 2003–2014 period. Among the four hydroclimatic variables, both day-time and night-time land surface temperature are the significant contributors of vegetation growth in the two-thirds of the global landmass. Terrestrial water storage is a substantial contributor to the vegetation growth in the tropics and subtropics. Night-time land surface temperature is strongly associated with the vegetation growth in the colder regions. The hydroclimatic variables do not explain the considerable amount of the total variance of vegetation growth over the agricultural areas in China, which is due to human agricultural management practices. Generally, the response of hydroclimate variables on vegetation growth in the agricultural and nonagricultural areas has significant implications in many areas, including food security, carbon sequestration, water resource management, and climate change. © 2021.

Within the European research program “Clean Sky 2”, a morphing leading edge with gapless chord-and camber-increase for high-lift performance was developed. The MLE is able to morph into two different aerofoils—one for cruise and one for take-off/landing, the latter increasing lift and stall angle over the former. The shape flexibility is realised by a carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) skin optimised for bending and a sliding contact at the bottom. The material is selected in terms of type, thickness, and lay-up including ply-wise fibre orientation based on numerical simulation and material tests. The MLE is driven by an internal electromechanical actuation system. Load introduction into the skin is realised by span-wise stringers, which require specific stiffness and thermal expansion properties for this task. To avoid the penetration of a bird into the front spar of the wing in case of bird strike, a bird strike protection structure is proposed and analysed. In this paper, the designed MLE including aerodynamic properties, composite skin structure, actuation system, and bird strike behaviour is described and analysed. © 2021 by the authors.

The Cring-C3N4 was characterized in order to check its ability in harvesting light in the visible region and transferring the charge carriers. Degradation of methylene blue (MB) after being adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst and also the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 were studied for proving applicability of Cring-C3N4 in solving pollution problem and fuel crisis. The results were compared with those of bulk C3N4. The results showed that the adsorption process was fit to the Langmuir model (with a Qmax of 130 mg/g) with a kinetic of the pseudo second order (with a Qe.cal of 180 mg/g). The photodegradation rate constant of MB proved that Cring-C3N4 nanosheets had a catalytic activity (0.0616/h) almost 26 times more than g-C3N4 in the presence of light. At a melamine/glucose mass ratio of 1000/50, the photoconversion rate of CO2 to CH4 (16.24 μmol/g·h) achieved nearly 24 times greater when compared to g-C3N4 and was comparable with the photodegradation rate of MB. In the presence of light, it was observed that the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane was via a process of eight electrons which predominated over the production of carbon monoxide with a process of two electrons. The Cring -C3N4 synergistically extended lifetime and photocarrier diffusion length. This photocatalyst can be effectively utilized in sustainable solar-to-fuel conversion processes as well as in environmental pollutant remediation. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Carbon monoxide; Carrier mobility; Catalyst activity; Nanosheets; Pollution; Rate constants; Adsorption process; Charge carrier transfer; Environmental pollutants; Extended lifetime; Photodegradation of methylene blue; Photodegradation rate; Pollution problems; Pseudo second order; Carbon nitride",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103455042

The objective of this study was to determine the greenhouse gas (including carbon dioxide, CO2; methane, CH4; and nitrous oxide, N2O) and odour (including ammonia, NH3; and hydrogen sulphide, H2S) emission rate estimates (EREs) from the open-to-air processes of a biological nutrient removal (BNR) type MWTP in Saskatoon, SK, Canada. This MWTP experiences seasonal temperatures from −40 °C to 30 °C with the resultant wastewater temperatures considered herein of 13 °C and 17 °C being chosen based on monitoring data for winter and summer, respectively. Laboratory-scale reactors simulating anaerobic, anoxic, aerobic, and settling treatment processes were used to monitor gas EREs using wastewater samples taken from the analogous MWTP processes during the winter and summer seasons. Results indicated that the overall winter EREs for CO2, CH4, and N2O were 45,129 kg CO2/d, 21.9 kg CH4/d, and 3.20 kg N2O/d, respectively, while the H2S EREs were insignificant. The higher temperature for the summer samples resulted in increased EREs for CH4, N2O, and H2S EREs of 33.0 kg CH4/d, 3.87 kg N2O/d, and 2.29 kg H2S/d, respectively. However, the CO2 EREs were reduced to 37,794 kg CO2/d. Overall, the aerobic reactor was the dominant source of the GHG emissions for both seasons. In addition, studied changes in the aerobic reactor aeration rates (in reactor) and BNR treatment configurations (from site) further impacted the EREs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biological nutrient removal (BNR) system; Greenhouse gas (GHG) and odour emission rate estimates (EREs); Municipal wastewater","ammonia; carbon dioxide; hydrogen sulfide; methane; nitrous oxide; carbon dioxide; fragrance; methane; nitrous oxide; aeration; cold region; estimation method; greenhouse gas; hydrogen sulfide; laboratory method; municipal solid waste; odor; wastewater; wastewater treatment plant; air pollution; Article; Canada; cold; environmental temperature; greenhouse gas; nitrous oxide emission; odor; seasonal variation; summer; waste water treatment plant; winter; greenhouse effect; wastewater; water management; Canada; Saskatchewan; Saskatoon; Varanidae; Canada; Carbon Dioxide; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Nutrients; Odorants; Waste Water; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098554668

Here we show, through remote sensing analysis and field works, the planform evolution and riverbed topography of a small river located in the upper foreland Amazon basin, the Ichilo River. By tracking planform changes over 30 years, we identified the factors that control meander migration rates in the Ichilo River: cutoffs, climate and human interventions. The data suggest that neck cutoffs are the main controls in the Ichilo River, with an annual density of 0.022 cutoffs/km. In addition, climate controls have been identified in the form of high-precipitation events that may have promoted cutoffs, an increase in meander migration rate and channel widening. The width distribution of the Ichilo River is well represented by general extreme value and inverse Gaussian distributions. The spatiotemporal variability of meandering migration rates in the Ichilo River is analysed in two locations where neck cutoffs are expected. Analysing the distance across the neck in these two points, we predict the occurrence of a new cutoff. The combined methodology of bathymetric surveys and structure from motion photogrammetry shows us the Ichilo riverbed topography and banks at high resolution, where two scour holes were identified. Finally, we discuss the impact of planform changes of the Ichilo River on communities that are established along its riverbanks. © 2020 The Authors.

These targets thus remain unconfirmed as H II regions. With only ∼2500 confirmed H II regions in the Milky Way, Galactic surveys are deficient by several thousand nebulae when compared to external galaxies with similar star formation rates. Using sensitive 9 GHz radio continuum observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, we explore a sample of H II region candidates in order to set observational limits on the actual total population of Galactic H II regions. We target all infrared–identified “radio-quiet” sources from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Catalog of Galactic H II regions between 245° ℓ 90° with infrared diameters less than 80′′. We detect radio continuum emission from 50% of the targeted H II region candidates, providing strong evidence that most of the radio-quiet candidates are bona fide H II regions. We measure the peak and integrated radio flux densities and compare the inferred Lyman continuum fluxes using models of OB stars. We conclude that stars of approximately spectral type B2 and earlier are able to create H II regions with similar infrared and radio continuum morphologies as the more luminous H II regions created by O stars. From our 50% detection rate of “radio-quiet” sources, we set a lower limit of ∼7000 for the H II region population of the Galaxy. Thus the vast majority of the Milky Way’s H II regions remain to be discovered. © 2021. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102521557

Non-Indigenous forest management showed no recognition of, or respect for, Nisga'a traditional approaches to land management. Traditional Nisga'a resource management is a resilience-oriented management approach. Future approaches need to be based on Indigenous people's knowledge and rights while at the same time utilising valuable knowledge from non-Indigenous sources. An inclusive management approach focused on restoring ecosystem function can enhance Nisga'a forest resilience. SUMMARY This study examines and characterizes the potential impacts of climate change on the lands of the Nisga'a Nation in British Columbia, Canada, and how these impacts might affect traditional forest practices. The study results were integrated with a review of current Nisga'a forest policy. The current forest policy has developed an inflexible approach to forest management that perpetuates a top-down decision-making framework inherited from the past relationship with the provincial government. Building from the experiences of the Nisga'a Nation, it is revealed that inflexible forest policies coupled with climate change impacts could lead the forest ecosystems to ecological thresholds. No approach by itself will be sufficient to meet the challenges these changes will bring to Indigenous peoples and society in general. An integrative approach, where the forest management is undertaken from a resilience point of view, is needed if current conditions are to be improved. © 2021 Commonwealth Forestry Association.

Three maize varieties, i.e., [BH-660 (late maturing), BH-540 (medium maturing) and Melkasa-1 (short maturing)] along with three planting dates [early (25-Apr), normal (25-May) and late (25-Jun)], four N fertilizer rates (64, 96, 128 and 160 kg N/ha) and three water levels [rainfed (no irrigation), two irrigations (each 30 mm at time of flowering and 5 d after flowering with total = 60 mm) and five irrigations (each 30 mm at time of flowering to early grain-filing, which were applied every five days in total = 150 mm)] were evaluated as the adaptation strategy. The mid-century (2040–2069) temperatures and solar radiation were extracted from multiple model means across the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) models under the highest Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5). Maize productivity was evaluated assuming that maize was grown on shallow sandy loam soils. Yield of an early, medium and late maturing maize were changed by −13 to −8%, −10 to +4% and + 3 to +13%, respectively, relative to the baseline period (1980–2005). The days to maturity decreased by about 16%. Under rainfed condition, N application up to 64, 128 and 160 kg/ha significantly improved yield for early, medium and late maturing varieties, respectively.

These indicators were chosen as representative of the potential of these strategies to improve the soil physical condition. That for, the effectiveness of conservation agriculture (CA), crop rotations (ROT), additions of organic matter (ExO), irrigation (IRR) and innovative grassland management (GSS) was assessed by monitoring soil bulk density (BD) and soil available water holding capacity (AWHC) in a network of 159 agricultural fields across homogeneous agro-climatic zones in the region. A sampling protocol designed to compare groups of plots with or without adaptive practices, and with equal soil characteristics within each zone, allowed to determine the effect size of each strategy (measured as response ratios, RR, calculated as the relative value of BD and AWHC in fields with adaptive management vs. without). Both parameters responded to soil and crop management, although the observed effect was highly variable. Only the ExO strategy showed an overall positive effect on BD. ROT, IRR and GSS displayed no effect and, in the case of CA, the effect was negative. In terms of AWHC, although the results within the zones were heterogeneous, the overall effect associated to the strategies ROT, ExO, IRR and GSS was neutral, and only CA resulted in an overall negative effect. The observed variability in terms of the effectiveness of the five strategies tested in this region highlights the need to understand the complexity of interrelationships between management and dynamic soil properties at the regional scale. © 2021 by the authors.

Several technologies have been developed to convert biomass into energy, and anaerobic digestion is one such technology to convert food waste and animal manure into power by biochemical conversion and combustion. Many studies have looked at the optimization of the biomass supply chains in combination with environmental impacts. However, there are very few studies in the literature for determining the optimum location of biopower plants fed by food waste and manure. This study evaluates the optimum locations, sizes, and the number of plants for biopower production in Wisconsin using both mixed-integer linear programing and geographic information system network analysis (ArcGIS V10). The main objective of the study is to maximize the profits of biopower facilities accounting for both the profits from the biopower supply chain and carbon credits. In this study, two scenarios (base case and a future case) were evaluated by varying the carbon credits and the food waste tipping fee: the base case with $0 carbon credits and $0 food waste tipping fee and the future case with $15/ton CO2 savings and $40 tipping fee/ton collected for the food waste. The key results showed that the inclusion of a carbon credit and tipping fee policies increased the profitability of biopower production and predicted an increase in biopower production capacity from 15 to over 77 MW in WI, representing 1% of its annual electricity consumption. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","anaerobic digestion; biopower plant; GIS optimization; sustainability framework","Carbon; Fertilizers; Food waste; Geographic information systems; Integer programming; Location; Manures; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Supply chains; Waste incineration; Anaerobic co-digestion; Annual electricity consumption; Biochemical conversion; Biomass supply chain; Integrated optimization; Mixed integer linear programing; Production capacity; Renewable energy generation; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103516999

To support mitigation and adaptation efforts, information on climate change in Bali is needed. Sustainability in the field of animal husbandry is of course very important. Especially for beef cattle,. The aim is to assess the sustainability of smallholder livestock based on climatological conditions, land resources, and farmer profiles. The research was conducted in Bangli and Gianyar Regencies, Bali Province. The material used is 200 farmers with direct interviews. The method used was the Participating Rural Appraisal (PRA) survey. The results of the research on land resources in Bangli Regency were 42,502 ha of plantation land (29.92%) with the type of coffee plantation, while in Gianyar Regency using an area of 14,790 ha (40.19%). From the breeder profile. The results showed that most of the farmers were old, had low education, had low main jobs as breeders and livestock. The positive thing is that farming takes a long time and has good detection capabilities so that it can be detrimental to the experience that climatological conditions, land resources, and farmer profiles can continue for small farmers in Bali. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Climate change; Landforms; Sustainable development; Animal husbandry; Beef cattle; Climatological conditions; Coffee plantation; Detection capability; Indonesia; Land resources; Plantation land; Agriculture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102678005

This article describes a pilot exercise inspired by the recommendation domain literature that aimed at mapping, beyond “classical” biophysical and socio-technical variables, the institutional variables (i.e., the existence of policy incentives in national policy documents) that could influence the large-scale implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices. Four practices were considered: cereal-legume intercropping, fodder legume cultivation, farmer managed natural regeneration (FMNR) of Parkia biglobosa, and crop residue mulching. The biophysical and socio-technical variables were classified based on thresholds identified in the literature and mapped with a geographic information system. The policy documents considered were investment plans, adaptation plans for climate change, nationally determined contributions, and Technology Needs Assessments project reports. Sixteen policy documents for four countries were thoroughly reviewed and classified as unfavorable, intermediate, and favorable for the four selected practices, based on a decision tree built for that purpose. Our analysis shows that areas where biophysical, socio-technical, and institutional variables are aligned for the four practices considered are small, particularly for fodder legume cultivation and crop residue mulching. For cereal-legume intercropping, incentives from national policies strongly differ from one country to another while for FMNR of Parkia biglobosa policies are more homogeneously conducive across countries. Nonetheless, it was possible to identify areas where biophysical, socio-technical, and institutional dimensions of the transition toward climate-smart agriculture (CSA) were aligned, for example, cereal-legume intercropping in southern Mali. The delineating of favorable and unfavorable areas allows specific recommendations to be made for policymakers as levers for action differ in favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable zones. Based on the exploration made for the four practices, this study highlights the need for further articulations from local to national scale to implement CSA. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Innovation; Recommendation domains",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090696412

For the last two decades, the concept of urban consolidation centres (UCCs) has been implemented in different cities. UCCs that were started for special subsectors (e.g. construction material handling) are relatively successful; however, general purpose UCCs are not performing well at all. Most UCCs are financially dependent on government support. The UCC concept can be successfully implemented by developing a consistent subsidy or tax scheme aiming to internalize the negative external effects of conventional urban goods distribution. In this paper, we describe and test such policy - a delivery cap and price (DCAP) scenario, combined with a subsidy for a UCC alternative – to reduce carbon emissions for urban goods delivery. The scenario introduces a cap on goods deliveries made to shopkeepers by conventional vehicles, using so-called carbon credit points (CCPs). We demonstrate this policy with a stylized implementation of a city logistics agent based model for the inner city of Rotterdam. The results indicate that this financial scheme could positively influences the use of UCC, ensures its financial viability and significantly reduce the external effects of urban freight transport. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based modelling; Cap and trade; Carbon credit points; City logistics; Urban consolidation centre; Urban freight transport",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076831054

The first site presented the ‘Polluted site’, which is situated in the oasis close to the industrial area. While, the second site referred to the ‘Control site’ located at 37 km from the industrial area. Using HPLC ES-MS, 21 phenols were identified and quantified in methanol extract from pomegranate fruit peel. The results showed that various phytochemical substances, including phenols acids and flavonoids, were identified and quantified in the peel extract. The polyphenols content and the flavonoids contents in peel obtained from polluted site were higher than that collected from the control site. The concentrations of the identified polyphenols were ranged between 0.39 and 7803.68 mg/ kg DW. The stimulation of some free phenolic compounds such syringic acid, transfrulic acid, epicatechin, rutin and quercetin was enregistred only in peel collected from contaminated environment. The quali-qualitative changes between sites are probably related to the difference in the air quality. The increase of polyphenols could be implicated during adaptive mechanisms under air pollution.

The treatments used pure FAs consisting of C18:2n-6 FA (LA), C18:3n-3 FA (LNA), or a mixture of these FAs at 1:1 ratio (Combo). In vitro rumen incubation was performed in 50 mL glass serum bottles containing 2 mg of pure FAs, 15 mL of rumen buffer (rumen fluid+anaerobe culture medium = 1:2), and 150 mg of synthetic diet (411 g cellulose, 411 g starch, and 178 g casein/kg dry matter) at 39°C for 8 h with five replications and three blanks. In rumen fermentation indices, LA exhibited highest (P &lt; 0.05) ammonia-N and total gas volume after 8 h of incubation. Furthermore, LA presented lower (P &lt; 0.05) pH with higher (P &lt; 0.05) total volatile fatty acid (P = 0.034) than Combo, while LNA was not different compared with those in the other treatments. Additionally, Combo produced highest (P &lt; 0.05) CO2 with lowest (P &lt; 0.05) CH4. In the early hours of incubation, LA improved (P &lt; 0.005) Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus flavefaciens, while LNA improved (P &lt; 0.005) Ruminococcus albus. After 8 h of incubation, LNA had lower (P &lt; 0.05) methanogenic archaea than LA and Combo but had higher (P &lt; 0.05) rumen ciliates than LA. R. albus was higher (P &lt; 0.05) in LA than in LNA and Combo. It was observed that the rate of biohydrogenation of n-6 and n-3 FAs was comparatively lowest (P &lt; 0.05) in Combo, characterized by higher C18:2n-6 and/or C18:3n-3 FA and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) concentrations with lower (P &lt; 0.05) concentrations of C18:0 and saturated FA and the ratio of saturated FAs to PUFAs. Therefore, this study concluded that dietary C18:2n-6 could improve populations of fibrolytic bacteria and rumen fermentation indices, but dietary mixture of pure C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3 is recommended because it is effective in reducing enteric methane emissions and resisting biohydrogenation in the rumen with less effect on rumen microbes. © Copyright © 2021 Amanullah, Kim, Paradhipta, Lee, Joo, Lee, Kim and Kim.","biohydrogenation; fatty acid; methane emission; rumen fermentation; rumen microbes","buffer; carbon dioxide; casein; cellulose; docosahexaenoic acid; essential fatty acid; glass; linoleic acid; oleic acid; omega 3 fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; saturated fatty acid; short chain fatty acid; volatile fatty acid; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; artificial diet; bacterium culture; chemical composition; controlled study; diet supplementation; DNA extraction; fatty acid analysis; fermentation; greenhouse gas; high performance liquid chromatography; hydrogenation; incubation temperature; methanogenesis; microbial community; nonhuman; pH; real time polymerase chain reaction; rumen; rumen fluid; rumen microorganism; ruminant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102992301

Substantial research has been dedicated to these areas in the last few decades. These reductions require both electrons and protons and their thermodynamic potentials often make them compete with hydrogen evolution reaction i.e., the reaction of protons and electrons to generate H2. These reactions are abundant in the environment in microorganisms and are facilitated by naturally occurring enzymes. This review brings together the state-of-the-art knowledge in the area of enzymatic reduction of CO2, NO2- and H+ with those of artificial molecular electrocatalysis. A simple ligand field theory-based design principle for electrocatalysts is first described. The electronic structure considerations developed automatically yield the basic geometry required and the 2nd sphere interactions which can potentially aid the activation and the further reduction of these small molecules. A systematic review of the enzymatic reaction followed by those reported in artificial molecular electrocatalysts is presented for the reduction of CO2, NO2- and H+.

Design/methodology/approach: Data on the consumption of cement and site works for 100 ongoing building construction sites were gathered for a period of 12 months. The variance partitioning capabilities of the Ordinary Least Squares and Hierarchical Linear Modelling forms of regression analysis are comparatively used to evaluate the sensitivity of cement demand to the meteorological profile of wet-humid climate Findings: The study outcome provides statistical evidence demonstrating that the meteorological profile of wet-humid climate induces a significantly high percentage of the variance in the real-time demand for bagged cement on construction sites. However, nested within this variance, are the fixed effects of the cement footprint of the building architecture inherent in the locality. Particularly, positive changes to reduce the wet trade composition of buildings or compensating changes in technological bias, are necessary to combat weather interference in the humid tropics. Research limitations/implications: The findings are exploratory, and not for the purposes of holistically forecasting cement demand, and can therefore only form part of a more comprehensive decision support system, bespoke to the study area. Practical implications: The study outcome provides a back-end view to climatic adaptation in wet humid settings, making a compelling case for localized climate-risk adaptive supply chain strategies and policies geared towards sustainability in cement usage. Originality/value: The study delineates the confounding impact of weather, distinct from local building architecture and technological bias, thus creating a methodological platform for replication and comparative productivity studies in diverse geographical areas. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cement demand; Climate; Supply chain; Weather; Wet trades","Commerce; Decision support systems; Regression analysis; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Tropics; Weathering; Building construction sites; Climate; Climatic adaptation; Design/methodology/approach; Ordinary least squares; Statistical evidence; Supply chain strategy; Wet trades; Cements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082189311

The measured concentrations of OC, OC volatility fractions (i.e., OC1, OC2, and OC3), elemental carbon (EC), ozone (O3), sulfate, the ratio of potassium ion to potassium (K+/K), and selected metal elements were used as the input to the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. PMF resolved tailpipe emissions, non-Tailpipe emissions, secondary organic aerosols (SOA), biomass burning, and local industrial activities as the main sources contributing to ambient OC at both sampling sites. Vehicular exhaust emissions, non-Tailpipe emissions, and SOA were dominant sources of OC across our sampling sites, accounting cumulatively for more than 80% of total OC mass throughout the study period. Our findings showed a significant reduction in the absolute and relative contributions of tailpipe emissions to the ambient OC levels in CELA and Riverside over the time period of 2005-2015. The contribution of exhaust emissions to total OC in CELA decreased from 3.5 g m-3 (49%) in 2005 to 1.5 g m-3 (34%) in 2015, while similar trends were observed at Riverside during this period. These reductions are mainly attributed to the implementation of several federal, state, and local air quality regulations targeting tailpipe emissions in the area. The implementation of these regulations furthermore reduced the emissions of primary organic precursors of secondary aerosols, resulting in an overall decrease (although not statistically significant, P values ranging from 0.4 to 0.6) in SOA mass concentration in both locations over the study period. In contrast to the tailpipe emissions, we observed an increasing trend (by ∼4 to 14%) in the relative contribution of non-Tailpipe emissions to OC over this time period at both sites. Our results demonstrated the effectiveness of air quality regulations in reducing direct tailpipe emissions in the area, but also underpinned the need to develop equally effective mitigation policies targeting non-Tailpipe PM emissions.

To gain insight, trend analysis has been employed to inspect and quantify the change of precipitation in the highland of Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. Forty-eight-year long historical rainfall data series (1970–2017) from 30 rain gauges scattered across the study region was used for the analysis. Considering high spatial and temporal variability of rainfall data, the temporal scale chosen for the study was annual, rainy season (Mar–Jun), and bi-monthly. The trend was investigated using Mann–Kendall (MK) test. For serially correlated rainfall data series, modified Mann–Kendall (MMK) was applied for trend detection. Two variants of modified Mann-Kendall test were used in this study, namely, modified Mann–Kendall test using variance correction approach (mk1ylag) and bootstrapped Mann–Kendall Trend (pbmk) test. For quantification of trend magnitude, Theil–Sen approach (TSA) was used for calculation of Sen’s slope. Further, the abrupt change year detection in the trend was carried out using sequential Mann–Kendall (SQMK). All tests were performed using R-script. The application of abovementioned statistical test has shown statistically significant decreasing trend across majority of the stations at all temporal scale. It is observed that 10 stations located along the north-west to south-west boundary in mountainous region do not exhibit any significant trend. However, seven stations numbered as 14, 15, 38, 46, 514, 31 and 538 showed decreasing trends during most of the temporal scale. On analysing the trend magnitude of these seven stations, top three highest decreasing trend was found at station 31, 538, and 514 with trend magnitude as −9.325, −9.059, −7.516 mm/year, respectively. These three stations are located on north-west upper part of the study region. To understand the decade during which most of the stations experienced abrupt change, the period of 1970–2017 was broken down into four decades, 1980–1990; 1990–2000; 2000–2010; 2010–2017. Using SQMK, it was inferred that the decade of 2000–2010 witnessed drastic shift. Particularly for rainy season time series data, it is observed that the shift had occurred during the initial part of the decade 2000–2010 which can be attributed to increasing population and accelerated urbanisation. This result of declining and erratic trend of rainfall should be considered to design future strategies for agricultural sector, food security policy of the country and future water resource planning and management. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Mann–Kendall; Rainfall; Time series; Trend detection; Trend magnitude","acceleration; adaptive management; climate change; food security; groundwater resource; quantitative analysis; rainfall; raingauge; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; time series analysis; trend analysis; urbanization; Saudi Arabia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102559032

Energy conversation in buildings can play a vital role in meeting this high cooling demand. This paper attempts to consider the impacts of energy efficiency and renewable energy measures on the energy demand of Saudi Arabia’s residential buildings. The energy analysis and economic feasibility analysis of thermal insulations are performed in this paper by investigating the effect of residential buildings’ thermal insulations on the economic feasibility of grid‐connected photovoltaic systems. This was the combined effort of building owners and government, and buildings were examined if a photovoltaic system and thermal insulation were used. The study was conducted in the three climate zones in Saudi Arabia. The results showed that the building base case’s annual electrical energy consumption in Riyadh city was 67,095 kWh, Hail 57,373 kWh, and Abha 26,799 kWh. For the basic case‐building in Riyadh, 69% of the total electrical energy was used for cooling and heating. Applying the Saudi Building Code requirement for Riyadh will provide only 18% of the total energy used for cooling and heating. RETScreen 6.1 software was used to design a photovoltaic system; the analysis was done using technical and economic indicators. The annual yield factor for Riyadh, Hail, and Abha was 1649 kWh/kWp/year, 1711 kWh/kWp/year, and 1765 kWh/kWp/year, respectively. The capacity factors for Riyadh, Hail, and Abha were 18.8%, s19.5%, and 20.1%, respectively. The Unified photovoltaic Levelized energy costs were 0.031, 0.030, and 0.029 $/kWh for Riyadh, Hail, and Abha, respectively. Finally, the Net Present Value and greenhouse gas emissions reduction have been estimated. © 2021 by the authors.

It argues that there is potential for this traditionally gender-blind area of EU policy-making to become more gender-just. A statement of commitment to gender equality is regularly tagged onto Council climate change documents. Climate change as a policy issue is closely related to energy, which has always been at the heart of the EU’s policy remit. Energy use makes a major contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, and strategies for addressing climate change include improving energy efficiency and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. EU climate policy has three main components: mitigation, adaptation and climate diplomacy. Mitigation refers to strategies for reducing climate change, largely through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The effects of climate change are not the same for everyone.

Prior studies support improved air quality under NTCF mitigation, but with conflicting climate impacts that range from a significant reduction in the rate of global warming to only a modest impact. Here, we use state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model simulations conducted as part of the Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) to quantify the 21st-century impact of NTCF reductions, using a realistic future emission scenario with a consistent air quality policy. Non-methane NTCF (NMNTCF; aerosols and ozone precursors) mitigation improves air quality, but leads to significant increases in global mean precipitation of 1.3% by mid-century and 1.4% by end-of-the-century, and corresponding surface warming of 0.23 and 0.21 K. NTCF (all-NTCF; including methane) mitigation further improves air quality, with larger reductions of up to 45% for ozone pollution, while offsetting half of the wetting by mid-century (0.7% increase) and all the wetting by end-of-the-century (non-significant 0.1% increase) and leading to surface cooling of -0.15 K by mid-century and -0.50 K by end-of-the-century. This suggests that methane mitigation offsets warming induced from reductions in NMNTCFs, while also leading to net improvements in air quality. © 2021 The Author(s).

Climate change adaptation strategies can reduce the production risk relating to unforeseen climatic shocks and increase farmers’ food, income, and livelihood security. This paper investigates rice farmers’ adaptive capacities to adapt climate change strategies to reduce the rice production risk. The study collected 400 farm-level micro-data of rice farmers with the direct cooperation of Rajshahi District. The survey was conducted during periods between June and July of 2020. Rice farmers’ adaptive capacities were estimated quantitatively by categorizing the farmers as high, moderate, and low level adapters to climate change adaptation strategies. In this study, a Cobb–Douglas production function was used to measure the effects of farmers’ adaptive capacities on rice production. The obtained results show that farmers are moderately adaptive in terms of adaptation strategies on climate change and the degree of adaptation capacities. Agronomic practices such as the quantity of fertilizer used, the amount of labor, the farm’s size, and extension contacts have a substantial impact on rice production. This study recommends that a farmer more significantly adjusts to adaptation strategies on climate change to reduce rice production. These strategies will help farmers to reduce the risk and produce higher quality rice. Consequently, rice farmers should facilitate better extension services and change the present agronomic practice to attain a higher adaptation status.

However, a policy accounting for all the aspects associated with transport is lacking. Problems related to transport include a greater reliance on cars, increased congestion, and environmental impacts. The absence of an efficient public transport system is a notable cause of the prompt escalation of diverse problems, for example, increases in the number of personal automobiles causes congestion on the road, resulting in air pollution, ubiquitous greenhouse effects and noise pollution, which ultimately affect human health. Transit oriented development (TOD) has been suggested as a solution to these problems. This paper reviews the impacts of transit development on urban development, greenhouse impact, the environment, economy, property value, travel behavior, and health etc., highlighting the policy issues which hinder TOD. Implementation of TOD has a strong impact on shaping the urban form, redevelopment, and the upgradation of old areas. Controlling transit phenomena will also help to control the emission and mitigation of greenhouse gases. This study will help in improving the urban environment and climatic condition of regions. © 2021 by the authors.

The un-precedented global effects of climate change are wide‐ranging, including changing weather patterns that threaten food production, increased risk of catastrophic floods, and rising sea levels. Adapting to these impacts will be more difficult and costly in the future if radical changes are not made now. This review paper evaluates the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries’ potential for solar and wind energy resources to meet climate change mitigation requirements and assesses the ability of the GCC region to shift towards low‐carbon technologies. The review demonstrates that the GCC region is characterized by abundant solar energy resources. The northwestern, southeastern, and western mountains of the region are highlighted as locations for solar energy application. Oman displays the highest onshore wind speed range, 3–6.3 m s⁻1, and has the highest annual solar radiation of up to 2500 kWh/m2. Kuwait has the second highest onshore wind speed range, 4.5–5.5 m s⁻1, particularly in the western mountains, while northwestern Saudi Arabia has a range of 3–6 m s⁻1. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has the second highest annual solar radiation, 2285 kWh/m2, while Saudi Arabia and the state of Kuwait have equal annual solar radiation at 2200 kWh/m2. This review demonstrates that abundant offshore wind energy resources were observed along the coastal areas of the Arabian Gulf, as well as a potential opportunity for wind energy resource development in the Red Sea, which was characterized by high performance. In addition, the GCC countries will not be able to control and address the interrelated issues of climate change in the future if they do not eliminate fossil fuel consumption, adhere to the Paris Agreement, and implement plans to utilize their natural resources to meet these challenges. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, sustainable construction became a hot topic, which strives to reduce material consumption, limit constructional waste disposal, and decrease contribution to climate change. In line with Qatar's commitment to organizing a sustainable FIFA World Cup in 2022, this study aims to conduct an environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) for the construction of the Education City Stadium. The work presented here provides the first empirical LCA for analyzing the environmental and economic impacts of circular economy application in a World Cup stadium. In this research, the cyclopean concrete (CYC) methodology was utilized, which incorporate the site excavated boulders with the concrete mix to cast the under-raft foundation of the stadium. This approach was compared to the conventional concrete (CC) casting approach to assess the extent to which the newly developed methodology can reduce the environmental and economic burdens. The obtained results have shown a 32% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions when adapting the CYC approach. Thus, the CYC holds a strong promise to achieve the required structural behavior with a low-cost alternative material from existing waste products in Qatar and a lower environmental impact than the CC. © 2020 The Author(s)","Carbon footprint; Circular economy; FIFA world cup 2022™; Life cycle sustainability assessment; Recycled concrete; Sustainable construction","Climate change; Concrete mixtures; Construction industry; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Foundations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Recreation centers; Stadiums; Waste disposal; Alternative materials; Conventional concrete; Environmental and economic impacts; Environmental footprints; Environmental life cycle assessment; Material consumption; Raw material consumption; Sustainable construction; Sustainable development; building construction; concrete structure; economic cycle; environmental economics; environmental impact; foundation; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; waste management; Qatar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099201866

To scale-up water-condition assessment, there is a need to use new tools that enable prediction of large-scale changes in water quality by expanding the analysis to landscape-levels and bioclimatic predictors. In addition, the traditional use of linear models in biomonitoring can be inappropriate in detecting complex relationships, such as changing patterns of aquatic community structure and complex environmental gradients. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as Rough Sets Theory (RST) can be particularly useful for dealing with vague, imprecise, inconsistent and uncertain knowledge involving biotic and abiotic data to enable the classification and prediction of changes in stream water. Here, we applied RST to estimate the water quality in streams of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest by analyzing connections between landscape and climate data with the inclusion of up to 15 families of aquatic insect groups from the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (usually known as EPT taxa). First, we developed different decision sets which were the arrangements of the response variable (EPT index) and the predictor classifications. Then, we applied the best decision sets to monitor the condition of stream water in the Atlantic Forest on a large-scale. Our results showed the best decision rules were 61% accurate. Depending on the initial stream condition, this approach on a large-scale led to variable accuracy. By combining the development of different decision sets, the application of the best one on a large-scale, and the use of open-access data (landscape and climate predictors), our study approach demonstrated the potential applicability to evaluate streams in an objective with low-cost manner. This method can complement the environmental assessment of streams based only on local variables. Our framework also creates new perspectives in the analysis of water quality to generate scenarios of changes in streams based on landscape measurements to optimize monitoring networks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Bioindicators; EPT index; Rough Sets Theory; water quality","aquatic organism; community structure; environmental gradient; insect; prediction; streamwater; water quality; Atlantic Forest; Ephemeroptera; Hexapoda; Plecoptera; Trichoptera; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101004365

How increased climate variability will impact plant reproduction is unclear. Methods: In a 4-year study on fruit production by an alpine plant community in northern Sweden, we applied three warming regimes: (1) a static level of warming with open-top chambers (OTC), (2) press warming, a yearly stepwise increase in warming, and (3) pulse warming, a single-year pulse event of higher warming. We analyzed the relationship between fruit production and monthly temperatures during the budding period, fruiting period, and whole fruit production period and the effect of winter and summer precipitation on fruit production. Results: Year and treatment had a significant effect on total fruit production by evergreen shrubs, Cassiope tetragona, and Dryas octopetala, with large variations between treatments and years. Year, but not treatment, had a significant effect on deciduous shrubs and graminoids, both of which increased fruit production over the 4 years, while forbs were negatively affected by the press warming, but not by year. Fruit production was influenced by ambient temperature during the previous-year budding period, current-year fruiting period, and whole fruit production period. Minimum and average temperatures were more important than maximum temperature. In general, fruit production was negatively correlated with increased precipitation. Conclusions: These results indicate that predicted increased climate variability and increased precipitation due to climate change may affect plant reproductive output and long-term community dynamics in alpine meadow communities. © 2021 The Authors.

However, these same companies have been susceptible to a number of issues that have been central to international airlines due to higher costs and competition pressures. When an aviation disaster occurs, there is widespread allocation of blame and responsibility, which has left engine manufacturers exposed until the true cause is identified. This can generate many issues with regards to reputational damage and ability to generate finance. We set out to analyse such interactions over time and region. Our results indicate that engine manufacturers have had to contend with substantial income and financial leverage issues in the aftermath of a major aviation disaster, irrespective of whether they have been identified as a causation factor in the incident itself. Further, we clearly identify that there exists an average one day loss of 1.64% in the immediate aftermath of aviation incidents. Substantial corporate instability is found to persist without the company being in any way responsible for the incident. Shortly thereafter, contagion effects increase as speculation diminishes and more factual evidence arrives.

In order to capture maximum emissions at the lowest cost, capture plants integrated with the power plants has to follow the operational regimes of the parent power plant. Therefore, capture plants has to be flexible enough to deal with the load variations on the power plants to meat grid demands. A test campaign has been carried out at the PACT 1tpd CO2 capture pilot plant to investigate capture plant flexibility in relation to power plant load variations. Monoethanolamine (40 wt.%) solvent was used to capture CO2 from gas turbine representative flue gases containing around 5% CO2. Pressurised Hot Water (PHW) is used to regenerate the solvent in the reboiler. Four Capture plant flexibility scenarios i.e. start-up, minimum stable generation, no-stripping and over-stripping, are investigated. No-stripping tests were performed to mimic the unavailability of steam for stripping over varied periods of time by stopping PHW flow to the reboiler. The results indicate that Specific Reboiler Duty (SRD) increased by 8.7 % when the PHW stoppage time was 30 min. Longer the PHW stoppage time, the longer it takes to recover the capture plant to the original steady state and higher the difference between the steady state capture efficiency and the average capture efficiency over the test period. For over-stripping tests, stripper pressure was reduced to 0.4 barg from the original value of 0.5 barg for a varied period of time followed by no-stripping. It was observed that longer the over-stripping period, longer the recovery time. The results indicates that SRD increased by 36 % when the over-stripping time was increased to an hour. In conclusion, it is possible to maintain 90 % overall capture efficiency, if the solvent is over-stripped for a long enough period, but reboiler duty will be increased. Optimisation of the capture process under these scenarios would be required in order to achieve a commercially-optimised balance i.e. minimum increase in SRD costs while achieving a capture efficiency that also minimises CO2 emission costs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture; CCGT; Dynamic operation; Over-stripping","Efficiency; Pilot plants; Solvents; Thermoelectric power plants; Capture efficiency; Capture process; Electricity system; Maximum emissions; Monoethanolamine; Peak load demand; Plant flexibilities; Thermal power plants; Carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; cost analysis; demand-side management; electricity generation; smart grid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101539454

Based on rainfall records during 1974–2016 at seven meteorological stations in the Gaza region, this study aims to (1) analyze the observed SP trend over the Gaza region, and (2) examine the SP sensitivity to climate indices. Pearson and Spearman correlations between climate indices and SP in the current and following years were calculated, and the seasonal period (particular month) with the highest correlation was identified. Results show that the climate indices, with greater impact on SP over the Gaza region in the autumn and spring, were in the order; El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) > East Atlantic/Western Russia (EAWR) > North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) > Arctic Oscillation (AO). The indices’ impact was minimal in the winter precipitation. ENSO types’ correlations (Southern Oscillation Index-SOI and Niño 3.4) were moderate and significant at α = 0.05. Rainfall at most stations positively correlates with AO and EAWR in spring and autumn. During the study period, warm phases of ENSO (i.e., El Niño) intensified autumn precipitation. Simultaneously with warm phases of EAWR or AO, more influence on autumn precipitation is exerted. Cold phases of ENSO (i.e., La Niña) have an adverse impact compared to El Niño. EAWR co-variation was evident only with the ENSO. Regarding AO, a non-meaningful action was noticed during the neutral phases of ENSO and EAWR. The findings of this study help understand and predict the seasonal trend of precipitation over the Gaza region. This is essential to set up climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in the EM region. © 2021 by the authors.

Universities must make changes to their mobility habits if they wish to comply with governmental carbon neutrality targets and lead with example. This research looks at Finland’s 14 universities and identifies the patterns and trends of academic mobility from a series of reports provided by the universities and their travel agencies. Moreover, we mapped the travel destinations to understand the scope of Finnish academic travel. The data revealed that Finnish universities are in different states of sustainability: some acting as clear trendsetters and others lagging. The results show that although the universities are performing well in some areas, as in preferring European destinations over intercontinental ones, there are still areas of improvement related to stopover reduction, the number of 1-and 2-day trips, and alternative transport forms to aviation. There is also a need for the standardization of targets and emission calculators. These key development areas are posed as recommendations through which the universities could easily reduce the carbon footprint of their mobility. © 2021 by the authors.

Consequently, the studies linking ICT and environmental sustainability are growing owing to its positive and adverse effects on environmental sustainability, and the noticeable disagreement in literature. Therefore, current work examines the criticality of ICT, human capital (education and return on education), and globalization in environmental sustainability, controlling urbanization and economic growth in the Latin American and Caribbean (LCA) region, where economic growth and globalization have substantially increased over the past three decades. Reliable panel econometric techniques, including second-generation unit root tests, Westerlund (2007, 2008) cointegration tests, and continuously-updated fully modified (CUP-BC) and continuously-updated bias-corrected (CUP-FM) long-run estimators are employed on the data for the period 1995–2017. The empirical estimations unfold that ICT (computed by a four components ICT index) and globalization contribute to reduce CO2 emissions. On the dark side, economic growth and urbanization degrade environment. Surprisingly, human capital adds to environmental degradation. The panel causality results reveal that ICT and globalization Granger cause CO2 emissions. These unique findings provide new insight to alleviate environmental degradation in the LCA region. Based on these outcomes, a comprehensive set of policies are directed for environmental sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental degradation; Globalization; Human capital; Information and communication technology; Urbanization","Carbon dioxide; Criticality (nuclear fission); Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Environmental technology; Life cycle; Personnel; Co-integration tests; Economic growths; Empirical estimations; Environmental sustainability; Information and Communication Technologies; Panel causality; Second generation; Social activities; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097883538

Although the existing literature on energy, development and environment is rich, only a handful of studies have investigated the impact of resource abundance on environmental pollution. Therefore, this study examines the association of natural resources and environmental quality in five northwestern provinces of China using annual data form 1995 to 2017. The structural break test confirms that variables are stationary with a mixed trend for all provinces. The results of fully modified ordinary least squared test vary among provinces stating that resources are associated with environmental pollution in four provinces; this deteriorating impact is more significant in Xinjiang and Shaanxi as compared to Gansu and Ningxia. However, the results for Qinghai province indicate that natural resource availability improves environmental quality and reduces CO2 emissions; nonrenewable energy and economic development deteriorate the environment in this province. Nevertheless, renewable energy sources outweigh the nonrenewable energy in terms of environmental sustainability and promote green development in northwestern China; furthermore, our estimations do not confirm the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis in all provinces. The robustness check confirms a long term connection for all variables and the causality analysis show diverse results for the selected provinces.

Global warming and human health concerns are motivating researchers to come out with newer ways of controlling air pollution effectively. On the other hand, there are significant challenges in complying with current and upcoming vehicle emission regulations, which are quite stringent. It is therefore quite important to monitor vehicular emissions closely, which can facilitate adopting effective control measures when necessary, and also in predicting the impact of vehicular emissions on ambient air quality. Traditionally, dynamometers (both engine and chassis) testing has been used extensively to measure and monitor vehicular emissions, and the database generated has been used as input in modeling the traffic-related air quality impact. Even though standard driving cycles are followed in dynamometer tests attempting to closely replicate real-world driving conditions, they may not necessarily represent actual real-world driving conditions and emissions thereof. Therefore, in recent years, significant scientific efforts have been directed to measure and analyze real-world driving emissions (RDE) from vehicles. In this paper, the state-of-the-art techniques and methods for vehicular emissions monitoring under real-world driving conditions are reviewed and discussed in detail. Different vehicle emissions monitoring methods are presented in comparison to dynamometer-based measurements. Several influencing factors which affect on-road and in laboratory measurements are identified and discussed. Potential applications of different emission control strategies are reviewed. Finally, guidelines are formulated for effective vehicular emissions monitoring, and to minimize discrepancies between on-road and laboratory based measurements, in order to have a sustainable road transport system in future. © 2020","Driving cycles; Dynamometers; Emissions; Real-world driving emissions; Vehicles","Air quality; Dynamometers; Emission control; Global warming; Roads and streets; Vehicles; Air quality impacts; Airborne pollutants; Automotive emissions; Human health concerns; Laboratory measurements; Monitoring methodologies; Road transport systems; State-of-the-art techniques; Quality control",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097795056

The present study aimed to obtain the basic information needed to evaluate the photosynthetic pigments and proline mechanisms of Avicennia marina and Rhizophora mucronata mangrove to the ambient salinity. The results reached that the free proline accumulated appreciably in leaves. The functional role of proline accumulation appears to be as a cytoplasmic osmoticum to lower cell water potential, provide hydration to bipolymer and serve as an energy source under high salinity environmental conditions. Mangroves showed variations in proline content between the two species. The highest value of proline was recorded 23.56 mg/g dry wt for R. mucronata and the minimum value was recorded 17 mg/g dry wt for A. marina. In addition, the mean value of proline was recorded 18.57 mg/g dry wt for A. marina and 23.98 mg/g dry wt for R. mucronata. The contents of chlorophyll-a in different analyzed mangroves was ranged from 4.46 to 6.05 mg/gf.wt. for A. marina, and from 3.69 to 4.29 mg/gf.wt. for R. mucronata. In addition, the chlorophyll-b content was ranged from 1.46 to 1.83 mg/gf.wt. for A. marina, and from 1.27 to 1.65 mg/gf.wt. for R. mucronata. The carotenoids contents in mangroves ranged from 2.94 to 2.29 mg/gf.wt for A. marina and from 2.04 to 2.09 mg/gf.wt for R. mucronata. In the present study, A. marina was relatively more tolerant and adapted to salinity, low rainfall and extreme temperature conditions than R. mucronata.

One of these sources that has the potential to supply the world’s energy needs is the ocean. Currently, ocean in West African region is mostly utilized for the extraction of oil and gas from the continental shelf. However, this resource is depleting, and the adaptation of ocean energy could be of major importance. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the possibilities of ocean-based renewable energy (OBRE) and analyze the economic impact of adapting an ocean energy using a thermal gradient (OTEC) approach for energy generation. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is conducted from the perspective of cost, energy security and environmental protection. Findings: This study shows that adapting ocean energy in the West Africa region can significantly produce the energy needed to match the rising energy demands for sustainable development of Nigeria. Although the transition toward using OBRE will incur high capital cost at the initial stage, eventually, it will lead to a cost-effective generation, transmission, environmental improvement and stable energy supply to match demand when compared with the conventional mode of generation in West Africa. Practical implications: This study will be helpful in determining the feasibility, performance, issues and environmental effects related to the generation and transmission of OBRE in the West Africa region. Originality/value: The study will contribute toward analysis of the opportunities for adopting renewable energy sources and increasing energy sustainability for the West Africa coast regions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ocean energy; Renewable energy; Sustainability; Thermal energy","alternative energy; economic impact; electrical power; future prospect; power generation; renewable resource; sustainability; thermal power; Nigeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082188700

However, apart from the environmental consequences of generating energy, how uncertainties in the economy moderate the impact of energy generation on the environment is yet to be given desired attention. Hence, this study investigates the role of economic policy uncertainty in the energy-growth-emissions nexus for 32 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa over the period from 1996 to 2014. Results from one-step system-GMM show that real GDP and generation of non-renewable energy both increases CO2 emissions. However, while economic policy uncertainty also propels high levels of emissions in the region, its moderation effect on the impact of both renewable and non-renewable energy generation leads to a reduction in emissions level in the region. This suggests an urgent need for the implementation of sound macroeconomic and energy policies in Sub-Saharan Africa to safeguard the energy sector from disruptions and to mitigate the resultant impact on the degradation of the environment in the region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Economic growth; Economic policy uncertainty; Non-renewable energy generation; Renewable energy generation; Sub-Saharan Africa","International trade; Mineral resources; Planning; Renewable energy resources; CO2 emissions; Economic expansion; Economic policies; Energy generations; Energy sector; Environmental consequences; Non-renewable energy; Sub-saharan africa; Energy policy; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; economic policy; energy policy; Gross Domestic Product; macroeconomics; power generation; uncertainty analysis; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098596223

When coupled with sea level rise (SLR), poor urban development design, and loss of habitats, severe flooding often impacts the coastal zone. In order to protect citizens and adapt to a changing climate, national and local governments need to investigate their coastal vulnerability and climate change risks. To assess flood and inundation risk, some of the critical data are topography, bathymetry, and socio-economic. We review the datasets available for these parameters in Jamaica (and specifically Old Harbour Bay) and assess their pros and cons in terms of resolution and costs. We then examine how their use can affect the evaluation of the number of people and the value of infrastructure flooded in a typical sea level rise/flooding assessment. We find that there can be more than a three-fold difference in the estimate of people and property flooded under 3m SLR. We present an inventory of available environmental and economic datasets for modeling storm surge/SLR impacts and ecosystem-based coastal protection benefits at varying scales. We emphasize the importance of the careful selection of the appropriately scaled data for use in models that will inform climate adaptation planning, especially when considering sea level rise, in the coastal zone. Without a proper understanding of data needs and limitations, project developers and decision-makers overvalue investments in adaptation science which do not necessarily translate into effective adaptation implementation. Applying these datasets to estimate sea level rise and storm surge in an adaptation project in Jamaica, we found that less costly and lower resolution data and models provide up to three times lower coastal risk estimates than more expensive data and models, indicating that investments in better resolution digital elevation mapping (DEM) data are needed for targeted local-level decisions. However, we also identify that, with this general rule of thumb in mind, cost-effective, national data can be used by planners in the absence of high-resolution data to support adaptation action planning, possibly saving critical climate adaptation budgets for project implementation. © 2021 by the authors.

In this regard, expansion of the DG units compared to the expansion of centralized generation units should be evaluated economically and technically. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach for modeling the composite centralized and distributed generation expansion planning problem in the regulated power system. An integrated objective function is presented to involve the most important decision-making factors overall the power system. The purpose is to find the optimal combination of generation expansion created by power plants and DG units to minimize the total costs related to generation expansion, operation, maintenance, fuel, emission, distribution loss and expected energy not supplied, for the decision-making period. The proposed model reveals as a mixed integer nonlinear programming where, genetic algorithm is applied to find the optimal solution which contains the capacity, technology and operation strategy of non-stochastic DG units that will be optimally allocated into some distribution feeders.

Thirty-eight years temperature and precipitation data on Ikogosi, reveals a deviation in this erstwhile norm and portends a trend that on short-term and regional variations predict a more extreme warm climate. In contrast to previous ones, the fifth IPCC report emphasizes on the socio-economic facets of climate change. It also discusses on its dual role in sustainability and risk management, it dwells on reducing greenhouse gases and adaptation approaches to climate change. In view of this impending change, precipitation and temperature are vital climatic constraints which should be investigated for deviations that could adversely affect agriculture, architecture, societal and urban planning. Also, since a warming atmosphere is allied with substantial precipitation, all human based activities either directly or indirectly trigger greenhouse gas emissions and high precipitation. This explores the most prominent of these greenhouse gases, CO2 which warms the atmosphere as its volume increases in the atmosphere. In effect, the degree of future global warming will be a function of how much more volume of CO2 humankind emits. Although current CO2-induced warming of Earth is essentially irreversible on human timescales, weather researches to obtain scientific information, is very relevant. This is a dynamic prerequisite for society to make informed decisions on mitigation, adaptation, and other ways to tackle climate change. Thus, this study seeks to analyse the measure of observed climatic changes in Ikogosi. This is in order to promote the application of this study model to similar geographical locations. The potential energy available for certain extreme weather events has been analysed with existing theoretical explanations, ORIGIN software program and statistical regression analysis. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Potential energy; Precipitation (meteorology); Risk management; Extreme weather events; Geographical locations; Informed decision; Precipitation data; Regional variation; Scientific information; Statistical regression analysis; Uniform temperature; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103689525

A major aim is to disentangle the diffusion effects across different steps within the policy cycle by employingEvent History Analysis and spatial panel autoregressive models. Geographical proximity, party channels and transnational city networks are predictors of the diffusion process. Differences in diffusion effects between policy adoption and substantial policy output indicate that emulation as well aslearning influence policy activity. Furthermore, increasing deployment of solar photovoltaic systems in neighbouring municipalities is associated with an intensification of climate policy in the focal municipality. The absence of similar effects for other renewable energy technologies hints at the conditional nature of policy learning with respect to the policy-makers' vote- and policy-seekingbehaviour. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.","Climate policy; diffusion; energy policy; learning; local politics","energy policy; environmental policy; governance approach; learning; policy analysis; policy approach; policy implementation; policy making; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068407010

Incorporating machine learning methods to set up a reliable control scheme seems to be a promising idea to handle the energy efficiency of complex building dynamic systems with uncertainties, while data-driven control laws are becoming well-off in the system engineering community. In this paper, a data-driven approach is considered to choose energy set points to manage climate control up to satisfactory level through incorporating Gaussian Processes method, where the predictive model is built by correlating the dynamics, complexity and interrelated energy consumption recordings of the building into Finite Horizon Control (FHC) technique that provides (sub)optimal solutions for each time step. In the end, a demonstrative example is illustrated to give a clear picture of the proposed modelling method and its potentials in the case of building climate control. © 2021, International Organization on 'Technical and Physical Problems of Engineering'.

The in-depth relations between observed magnetic anomalies and the magnetic mineralogy of the underlying rocks and the associated chemical reactions are essential to understanding the hydrocarbon potentialities. A high-resolution land magnetic survey has been conducted covering an area of 3600 km2, and several filters have been applied to the measured total field including reduction to pole, normalized source strength, tilt-depth and 3D Euler deconvolution with un-prescribed structural index, to accomplish the goals. Regularized focused inversion was applied to six selected profiles on the total magnetic intensity field to model variations in subsurface magnetic susceptibilities and to study the relation with hydrocarbon reservoirs in the area. Results show perfect structurally controlled sub-basins, with variable thickness of the sedimentary cover ranges for the Paleozoic to Miocene units. The depth of the top basement rocks ranges from 1500 to 7000 m. The calculated depths to the edges from magnetic analysis ranges from 292 to 3322 m. Some faults can be detected at 3900 m, and five possible sedimentary basins (depocenters) can be detected within the Qattara Ridge, trending NW–SE and N–S. Magnetic results also show that the central part of Qattara Ridge is affected by low magnetic anomaly, and many magnetization sources can be detected in the northern directions. The common trend in these sources is NW–SE. Most shallow depth to magnetic sources is concentrated at the northern part of the area, while the deeper sources are distributed in the west and south of the study area. The maximum depth recorded is about 3988 m. Inversion shows remarkable relations between the inverted magnetic susceptibilities and the different hydrocarbon productive and sealing zones in and close to the study area. The localized variations in the inverted anomalous magnetic susceptibilities in the Qattara Ridge were possibly produced by different intrasedimentary mineral magnetic phases developed near the surface due to hydrocarbon occurrences. Reducing gases, coming from the possible underlying hydrocarbon reservoir, play a critical role in the formation of these secondary magnetic minerals. The reservoir in the Qattara Ridge, based on the present study, is characterized by low magnetic susceptibility and low surface magnetic anomaly in the studied locations of productive wells. The interpretations show matching between the sedimentary thickness and position of the faults deduced from both the available drilled wells and seismic data with our magnetic results. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","hydrocarbon potentialities; Magnetic inversion; magnetic minerals; magnetic susceptibility; Qattara Ridge; tectonostratigraphy; Western desert","Filtration; Hydrocarbons; Indexing (materials working); Magnetic susceptibility; Minerals; Sedimentology; Seismology; Euler deconvolution; Hydrocarbon reservoir; Land magnetic surveys; Magnetic anomalies; Magnetic intensities; Magnetic mineralogy; North western deserts; Western Desert , Egypt; Magnetism; data interpretation; hydrocarbon reservoir; inverse analysis; magnetic mineral; magnetic susceptibility; magnetization; magnetometer; sedimentary basin; tectonostratigraphy; Egypt; Matruh [Egypt]; Qattara Depression; Western Desert",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103283198

Sudan has much unrealized potential for generating solar energy, particularly in the northern region. This research study focuses on designing a 1-GW solar power station in northern Sudan using the PVsyst7.0 software program. To determine the appropriate location for the solar-energy station, 14 criteria were evaluated. This process is generic and suitable for use in any other country. The method for conducting cash-flow estimates and return on investment is illustrated in the economic evaluation. The city of Dongola, the capital of the northern state, was selected because of its high annual irradiance on a horizontal surface at ∼2333.2 kWh/m2. The simulation results show that the annual optimum tilt angle of inclination for photovoltaic (PV) modules is 30°, the energy production is 1 979 259 MWh/yr and the average annual performance rate is 0.810. In addition, the electric power consumption per capita in Sudan is 269 kWh/yr, so the proposed solar power plant with 1 979 259 MWh/yr can provide energy to 7.4 million people per year annually and reduce carbon emissions by ∼18 million tons of carbon dioxide per year. Economic calculations show that the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is 0.06/kWh, the discounted payback period is ∼11 years and the net present value is 635 291 000. As a result, the proposed grid-connected PV solar plant is considered economically, technically and environmentally feasible in Sudan. © 2021 The Author(s).","analytic hierarchy process; design; evaluation; photovoltaic; simulation; solar energy; Sudan","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Electric power plants; Electric utilities; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Design and simulation; Economic evaluations; Electric power consumption; Levelized cost of electricities; Optimum tilt angles; Photovoltaic modules; Solar photovoltaic power; Solar power station; Solar power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104972530
