The catalytic performance of the resulting catalyst samples in the hydrodechlorination (HDCl) of 1,2-dichloroethane at 220°C was investigated, to gain understanding of metal alloying phenomena governing the variation in ethene selectivity with time on stream (TOS). Metal dispersion was also investigated by O2 chemisorption and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). PtCuCaH(b) catalyst, synthesised by reduction with CaH 2 at 450°C, showed a high selectivity towards ethene in comparison with that of catalysts synthesised by reduction with either NaH or hydrogen. In view of the chemisorption and TEM results, the significant high selectivity of this catalyst towards ethene was attributed to the fact that reduction by CaH2 enhanced alloying of Pt and Cu. On the other hand, the ethene selectivity of PtCuCaH(b) catalyst did not show any variation with TOS, but reached a steady state at early TOS. This suggested that Pt and Cu alloying did not take place during the course of the reaction, but might have occurred during the reduction process.",,"Chemisorption; Dispersions; Hydrides; Negative ions; Platinum; Synthesis (chemical); Dispersion characteristics; Hydride anions; Metal dispersions; Platinum-copper catalysts; Catalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547262496

Retarded static injection timing increased ""BSFC"", smoke intensity, but reduced ""Nox"" emissions, while injection pressure had a greater effect than static injection timing on NOx emissions and had a lesser effect on ""BSFC"".

The purpose of our study was to develop a device for delivery of fibroblasts with use of current microcoil technology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell carrier devices and cell-free devices were fabricated by associating collagen gels (with or without fibroblasts) with platinum microcoils. During the propagation of control cell carrier devices for 1 week in culture, cell-mediated gel contraction (CMGC) occurred. Modified cell carrier devices created by glutaraldehyde cross-linking, ascorbate coculture, or extended CMGC were also characterized in vitro. Devices were deployed through microcatheters (533 μm lumen, 160 cm length). Gel retention, cell retention, cell death, and the ability to support local cell migration were analyzed in vitro. RESULTS: Cell viability was reduced by glutaraldehyde cross-linking but not by microcatheter transit. During microcatheter transit, cell carrier devices liberated minimal particulate matter and cellular DNA. Liberated particulate matter was reduced by glutaraldehyde cross-linking (P < .05) and extended CMGC (P < .04). Only cell carrier devices treated with glutaraldehyde cross-linking did not exhibit cell migration after microcatheter transit. Passage of cell-free devices through microcatheters sheared off most of their collagen gel. CONCLUSION: Collagen gel-platinum microcoil complexes can mediate efficient transmicrocatheter delivery of viable, migration-capable fibroblasts. CMGC is a necessary component of the process of gel stabilization that enables successful microcatheter transit. Although extended CMGC and glutaraldehyde cross-linking enhance gel stabilization, glutaraldehyde cross-linking decreases cell viability and migratory potential.",,"ascorbic acid; cell DNA; collagen gel; glutaraldehyde; platinum; article; brain artery aneurysm; catheterization; cell culture; cell death; cell migration; cell therapy; cell viability; coculture; coil embolization; cross linking; culture medium; device; endovascular cell therapy; fibroblast; human; human cell; microcoil embolization; newborn; particulate matter; Biomedical Engineering; Catheterization; Cell Death; Cell Movement; Cell Survival; Cell Transplantation; Cells, Cultured; Collagen; Coloring Agents; Cross-Linking Reagents; DNA; Fibroblasts; Gels; Glutaral; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Platinum; Tetrazolium Salts; Thiazoles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34648843090

The successful implementation of such policies requires effective forest monitoring systems that are reproducible, provide consistent results, meet standards for mapping accuracy, and can be implemented from national to pan-tropical levels. Remotely sensed data, supported by ground observations, are crucial to such efforts. Recent developments in global to regional monitoring of forests can contribute to reducing the uncertainties in estimates of emissions from deforestation. Monitoring systems at national levels in developing countries can also benefit from pan-tropical and regional observations, mainly by identifying hot spots of change and prioritizing areas for monitoring at finer spatial scales. A pan-tropical perspective is also required to ensure consistency between different national monitoring systems. Data sources already exist to determine baseline periods in the 1990s as historical reference points. Key requirements for implementing such monitoring programs, both at pan-tropical and at national scales, are international commitment of resources to increase capacity, coordination of observations to ensure pan-tropical coverage, access to free or low-cost data, and standardized, consensus protocols for data interpretation and analysis. © IOP Publishing Ltd.","Deforestation monitoring; Pan-tropical; Remote sensing observations","Data processing; Deforestation; Developing countries; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Remote sensing; Tropics; Uncertainty analysis; Consensus protocols; Forest monitoring systems; Ground observations; Monitoring programs; Pan-tropical; Remotely sensed data; Technical capabilities; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Monitoring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37649009164

A comprehensive model for graphite nozzle erosion minimization and a numerical code has been advanced to predict the nozzle throat recession rates at high pressures. Four different kinetic schemes for heterogeneous graphite oxidation reactions were compared. The recession rate was found to increase almost linearly with pressure. The magnitudes of recession rates depend on the chemical kinetic scheme and the propellant composition. Contrary to popular belief, at lower pressures (P &lt; 14 MPa), the heterogeneous kinetic rates showed a pronounced effect on the erosion rates, though at higher pressures, the nozzle throat erosion is mainly diffusion controlled. This observation stresses the importance of more accurate and definitive kinetic parameters for graphite oxidation reactions, especially at lower pressures. It was also observed that, besides H2O, the OH species affects the nozzle recession rate greatly. For the metallized propellant, the concentrations of major oxidizing species such as H 2O, OH, and CO2 are substantially reduced in comparison with the nonmetallized propellant, resulting in significant reduction of the erosion rates. A comparison of experimental data and predicted results from the graphite nozzle erosion minimization code shows excellent agreement especially for the nonmetallized propellant To substantially reduce the throat recession rates at high pressures, it is suggested that the boundary-layer control at the throat region could be an effective method for future nozzle design considerations.

These quantities are less than one percent of each country's total emissions. Trade with the rest of the world reduced emissions by much larger amounts, roughly four percent of each country's emissions. The sectoral patterns of carbon intensity are strongly correlated between Japan and the US; in addition, greater carbon intensity has a small but significantly positive effect on net exports. Policies that tax or otherwise regulate carbon emissions are needed to discourage this destructive route to competitiveness. However, the most important policy implication may be that US industry could cut its carbon emissions by more than half if it matched the environmental performance of industry in Japan. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Physical and chemical phenomena on very different timescales have to be taken into account (excitation, emission, chemical reactions, diffusion) at different levels of refining. This refining covers a very wide region of parameters starting from the structure of species up to the macro chemical mechanism of their conversion. This multilevel approach is described in detail in the paper and includes interaction and data transfer between different levels of phenomena description. In the framework of the approach, unknown properties of molecules, ions and atoms (structure, potential energy curves, transition dipole moments) are calculated based on quantum-chemical methods. The calculation results are used to evaluate rate characteristics of physical and chemical processes. The developed kinetic state-to-state scheme is then used to calculate the macro properties of the system under investigation. As an example of the multilevel approach, the emission properties of the Ar-GaI3 positive column discharge plasma were calculated using the Chemical Work Bench computational environment.

We conducted a field study in eastern Nebraska, USA to quantify GHG emissions, changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and the net global warming potential (GWP) in four irrigated systems: continuous maize with recommended best management practices (CC-rec) or intensive management (CC-int) and maize-soybean rotation with recommended (CS-rec) or intensive management (CS-int). Grain yields of maize and soybean were generally within 80-100% of the estimated site yield potential. Large soil surface carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were mostly associated with rapid crop growth, high temperature and high soil water content. Within each crop rotation, soil CO2 efflux under intensive management was not consistently higher than with recommended management. Owing to differences in residue inputs, SOC increased in the two continuous maize systems, but decreased in CS-rec or remained unchanged in CS-int. N2O emission peaks were mainly associated with high temperature and high soil water content resulting from rainfall or irrigation events, but less clearly related to soil NO2-N levels. N2O fluxes in intensively managed systems were only occasionally greater than those measured in the CC-rec and CS-rec systems. Fertilizer-induced N2O emissions ranged from 1.9% to 3.5% in 2003, from 0.8% to 1.5% in 2004 and from 0.4% to 0.5% in 2005, with no consistent differences among the four systems. All four cropping systems where net sources of GHG. However, due to increased soil C sequestration continuous maize systems had lower GWP than maize-soybean systems and intensive management did not cause a significant increase in GWP. Converting maize grain to ethanol in the two continuous maize systems resulted in a net reduction in life cycle GHG emissions of maize ethanol relative to petrol-based gasoline by 33-38%. Our study provided evidence that net GHG emissions from agricultural systems can be kept low when management is optimized toward better exploitation of the yield potential. Major components for this included (i) choosing the right combination of adopted varieties, planting date and plant population to maximize crop biomass productivity, (ii) tactical water and nitrogen (N) management decisions that contributed to high N use efficiency and avoided extreme N2O emissions, and (iii) a deep tillage and residue management approach that favored the build-up of soil organic matter from large amounts of crop residues returned. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Agriculture; C sequestration; Global warming potential; Intensive cropping systems; Maize; Nitrous oxide","carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; crop yield; global warming; greenhouse gas; maize; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; soil emission; Nebraska; North America; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548378667

Indian public policy is to use a blend of 10% ethanol with petrol within the next few years. This translates into a large requirement for fuel ethanol. This paper examines the potential suitability of various carbohydratebased agri-resources for ethanol production in India, and the resources required for this in different agroclimatic regions. The results show that sugarcane has the highest ethanol potential, followed by cassava, potato and cereals. On the basis of growing time (days) in the field, however, the large differences among crops disappear and their ranking at state and district level also changes. It was calculated that the biomass as well as land requirement for fuel ethanol for 2010-11 in India would be small, taking into account the total food grain production and land used for agriculture. Utilization of only 3-7 million tons of damaged food grains or surplus food stocks could meet the requirement for fuel ethanol up to 2010. This may, however, involve trade-offs with food security. Agricultural residues, especially rice straw, currently burnt in north-western India, and causing air pollution and global warming, could be a useful and cheap resource, if the technology for cellulose conversion is made available and is cost-effective. A proper auditing of costs involved in producing biomass for gasohol, their implications for energy security and the environment, and trade-offs with food security is required for policy consideration.","Biomass; Cereals; Ethanol; Gasohol; India; Renewable energy","Manihot esculenta; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35649001873

While a gas permeates through a capillary at a suitable pressure, the adsorbed layer may attain a thickness enough to fill the entire membrane pore. Poiseuille flow of the condensed phase follows. Our computed results have established that for a passage through a nano-porous membrane, gas having lower condensation pressure condenses in the pores at a pressure which is about an order of magnitude lower than its vapor pressure at the concerned temperature. In the case of propane/methane and butane/methane binary mixtures, propane and butane are preferentially condensed and permeation rates up to 700 g mol/m2 s bar for propane and 600 g mol/m2 s bar for butane have been achieved at a temperature lower than the critical temperature of the permeating species and higher than the critical temperature of the non-permeating species. Since methane has a much lower critical temperature than both propane and butane, it gets physically dissolved in the condensed phase of propane, butane in the case of propane/methane and butane/methane binary mixtures, respectively. An equation of state (EOS) approach has been adopted to calculate the fugacity of methane in the gas, as well as in the condensed phase, in order to estimate its solubility. The Peng-Robinson equation of state was used. Computation of the separation factor for methane/propane and methane/butane was performed over a wide range of temperature, pressure, and gas composition. The separation factor which is expectedly a function of these variables ranged from 0.3-75 for methane/propane and 0.7-140 for methane/butane binary mixtures. It has been established that an acceptable degree of separation is achievable at moderate pressure and at low temperature for the removal of propane and butane from natural gas. The results have the potential to be used for further refinement and optimization of the process conditions so that this strategy can be exploited for large-scale removal of lower hydrocarbon from natural gas at a low cost. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

The coupled model consists of the modified fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM5) with direct radiative forcing of the Asian dust aerosol through the NCAR Column Radiation Model and the Asian Dust Aerosol Model. The noncoupled model is MM5 without the direct radiative forcing of the Asian dust aerosol. The results indicate that the radiative cooling of the dust aerosol over the high-dust-concentration (HDC) region induces sinking motion and positive pressure perturbation near the surface, whereas the radiative warming of the aerosol near the top of the HDC layer induces rising motion and negative pressure perturbation, thereby enhancing the stable stratification in the dust layer. The induced positive pressure perturbation near the surface causes a dipole shape of the pressure perturbation field by forming a negative pressure perturbation toward the low pressure center downstream near the surface. This negative pressure perturbation is so deep and wide that the perturbation of the meteorological fields extends in the wide and deep regions away from the HDC region. The associated secondary circulation of this pressure perturbation reduces the low-level wind speed in the upstream HDC region but strengthens the downstream wind speed, resulting in reduction of dust emission in the upstream source region and downstream enhancement. Some of the dust aerosols lifted to the higher level by the synoptic rising motion are transported to the downstream direction more quickly with the upper-level strong wind, resulting in a bent-over shape of dust cloud in the downstream region with a maximum concentration near the surface and a secondary maximum in the upper level. The radiative flux convergence between these maximum dust layers produces a warm layer, thereby further enhancing the stable stratification. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric radiation; Dust; Thermal stratification; Wind effects; Direct radiative forcing; Meteorological fields; Pressure perturbation; Radiative warming; Atmospheric aerosols; aerosol; dust; perturbation; radiative forcing; Asia; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36549088639

The hydraulic properties and microbial soil contamination were determined before and after wastewater application.

As these systems were progressively reduced, the climate in the middle latitudes changed from paratropical to a subtropical monsoon climate with a moist summer, and later to a climate with a moist winter, and, in the Late Eocene, to a humid climate without any marked seasonal variation in precipitation.

Convoluted regions in the xenolith were probably formed by rapid crystallization of the partial melt produced during impact. Oxygen isotopic ratios in the host CAI are correlated both with melilite chemistry and location in the inclusion. The region immediately inside the Wark-Lovering rim of the CAI consists of 16O-rich gehlenite with Δ17O ranging down to - 20‰ but melilite becomes progressively 16O-poor (Δ17O ∼ 0‰) and Mg-rich towards the interior. In the absence of Mg isotopic fractionation, this variation is best attributed to O isotopic exchange between the nebular gas and the partially molten inclusion during its crystallization. This event lasted less than 200 h, which implies that the host CAI was transported between two nebular reservoirs with distinct O isotopic compositions during this time. Examination of possible transport mechanisms suggests that the transport occurred over a distance of less than 1 astronomical unit. The close-to-canonical 26Al/27Al ratio of 4.1 × 10- 5 determined from both inclusions implies that at most 670,000 yr after the birth of the Solar System, the 16O-rich reservoir was spatially limited and an 16O-poor reservoir with typical planetary isotopic composition was available for planet formation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot always distinguish between the two. Although glioma cell line studies substantiated a plausible imaging superiority of 99mTc-tetrofosmin (99mTc-TF) over other radiopharmaceuticals, little has been reported on its in vivo imaging properties. We assessed 99mTc-TF single-photon emission CT (SPECT) in cases where morphologic brain imaging was inconclusive between recurrence and radionecrosis. Methods: A total of 11 patients (7 men, 4 women) were evaluated. The initial diagnosis was glioblastoma multiforme (4), anaplastic astrocytoma (1), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (3), grade-II astrocytoma (2), and low-grade oligodendroglioma (1). All patients had been operated on and then received adjuvant external-beam radiotherapy. After a mean follow-up period of 25 months, there was clinical suspicion of recurrence, for which 99mTc-TF SPECT was performed. Results: In 8/11 cases, an abnormally increased tracer uptake appeared in the region that CT and/or MRI indicated as suspicious; in half of these cases, recurrence was confirmed histologically after surgery and in the other four by growth of the lesion over a 6-month follow-up period, and clinical deterioration. The remaining 3/11 patients had faint tracer uptake in the suspicious region, compatible with radiation injury; these lesions remained morphologically unaltered in a mean 12-month follow-up period, with no clinical deterioration in the patient's condition, a course strongly favoring the diagnosis of radiation injury. Conclusions: Metabolic brain imaging by 99mTc-TF could offer useful information in the workup of treated brain tumors, where radiomorphologic findings between recurrence and radionecrosis are inconclusive. © 2007 The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine.","99mTc-Tetrofosmin; Glioma; Radiation injury; Recurrence; SPECT","tetrofosmin tc 99m; organophosphorus compound; radiopharmaceutical agent; technetium complex; technetium Tc 99m 1,2 bis(bis(2 ethoxyethyl)phosphino)ethane; technetium Tc 99m 1,2-bis(bis(2-ethoxyethyl)phosphino)ethane; unclassified drug; adult; article; astrocytoma; brain cancer; brain scintiscanning; cancer grading; cancer growth; cancer surgery; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; differential diagnosis; external beam radiotherapy; female; follow up; glioblastoma; glioma cell; histology; human; human cell; in vivo study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oligodendroglioma; pilot study; priority journal; prospective study; radiation injury; radiation necrosis; single photon emission computer tomography; tumor recurrence; brain; brain tumor; glioma; methodology; middle aged; pathology; recurrent disease; scintiscanning; single photon emission computer tomography; tumor cell line; Adult; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Glioma; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Organophosphorus Compounds; Organotechnetium Compounds; Pilot Projects; Radiopharmaceuticals; Recurrence; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35848954505

Improvement of the energy efficiency of the transportation sector can help in alleviating socio-economic pressures resulting from the inflating fuel bill and in lowering the relatively high CO2 emission intensity. Current legislations mandate that all passenger cars operating in Jordan are to be powered with spark ignition engines using gasoline fuel. This paper examines potential benefits that can be achieved through the introduction of diesel cars to the passenger cars market in Jordan. Three scenarios are suggested for implementation and investigated with a forecasting model on the basis of local and global trends over the period 2007-2027. It is demonstrated that introducing diesel passenger cars can slow down the growth of energy consumption in the transportation sector resulting in significant savings in the national fuel bill. It is also shown that this is an effective and feasible option for cutting down CO2 emissions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The UVA protection was mediated via the UVA induction of the stress protein heme oxygenase-1, and its enzymatic product carbon monoxide (CO). Because UVB-induced immunosuppression is an accompanying and prerequisite feature of the promotion phase of photocarcinogenesis, the potential for immunoprotective CO to act as an anti-skin cancer agent was tested in this study. Groups of female albino Skh:hr-1 hairless mice were irradiated chronically with daily minimally erythemogenic doses of solar simulated UV radiation (SSUV) during a 10 week-period to induce photocarcinogenesis. The effect of repeated topical application of lotions containing a CO-releasing molecule (CORM-2; tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer) at 250 or 500 μM, that had previously been shown in short-term experiments to provide photoimmune protection in mice, was measured. Tumor development was monitored for 29 weeks. Topical CORM-2 treatment was observed to reduce the acute and chronic inflammatory erythema reaction compared with control irradiated mice that did not receive CORM-2 lotions, and to reduce the chronic epidermal hyperplasia accompanying tumor outgrowth. The CORM-2 treatments provided a significant moderate inhibition of early tumor appearance dose-dependently, significantly reduced the average tumor multiplicity, increased the regression of established tumors dose-dependently, and inhibited the formation of large locally invasive tumors. The CORM-2 treatments also reduced the expression of immunosuppressive IL-10 in the uninvolved epidermis and dermis of tumor-bearing mice, and enhanced immunopotentiating epidermal IL-12 expression. Therefore CO signalling was revealed to have previously unrecognized anti-carcinogenic functions in the skin, consistent with a protective modulation of the epidermal cytokines. This is a novel observation that also implies that the UVA waveband that produces CO physiologically in exposed skin, might likewise be found to have an anti-photocarcinogenic action. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Carbon monoxide; Hairless mouse; Photocarcinogenesis","antineoplastic agent; carbon monoxide; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; tricarbonyldichlororuthenium; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; article; cancer regression; carcinogenesis; controlled study; disease course; drug dose comparison; drug effect; drug inhibition; epidermis hyperplasia; erythema; female; hairless mouse; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; signal detection; skinfold; solar radiation; tumor immunity; tumor volume; ultraviolet A radiation; ultraviolet B radiation; ultraviolet radiation; Animals; Carbon Monoxide; Carcinogens; Disease Progression; Down-Regulation; Female; Heme Oxygenase-1; Immunohistochemistry; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-2; Mice; Mice, Inbred HRS; Signal Transduction; Skin Neoplasms; Tumor Burden; Ultraviolet Rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548147436

In decaying litter from a recently burned spruce forest, Shannon diversity decreased significantly with N fertilization, and taxonomic richness declined from 44 to 33 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). In soils from a mature spruce forest, richness also declined with N fertilization, from 67 to 52 OTUs. Fungal community structure in litter differed significantly with N fertilization, primarily because fungi of the order Ceratobasidiales increased in abundance. We observed similar changes in fungal diversity and community structure with starch addition to litter, suggesting that N fertilization may affect fungal communities by altering plant carbon inputs.

[U-14C]-glucose pulse labeling experiments permitted the quantification of unidirectional fluxes into sucrose, starch and cell wall polysaccharides. Isotopic steady-state labeling with [1-13C]-, [2-13C]- or [U-13C]-glucose followed by the quantification by 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR of enrichments in carbohydrates and amino acids was also performed to determine 29 fluxes through central metabolism using computer-aided modeling. As a consequence of the suppression of SUS1 and SH1 isozymes, maize root tips diameter was significantly decreased and respiratory metabolism reduced by 30%. Our result clearly established that, in maize root tips, starch is produced from ADP-Glc synthesized in the plastid and not in the cytosol by sucrose synthase. Unexpectedly, the flux of cell wall synthesis was increased in the double mutant.

It is argued that, despite both sectors being affected by the same institutional rules and constraints at the EU level, and both being central to the delivery of high-quality health care in Europe, there are a surprising number of differences between the regulatory frameworks. That this stems in part from their different ""launch"" times, hence different institutional conditions of regulation, and commensurate political climates, as well as reflecting different aims and goals among member-state and EU-level policy makers, are among the paper's main conclusions. © 2007 by The Policy Studies Organization.","EU regulatory regimes; Free movement rules; Health protection schemes; Medical devices; Pharmaceuticals; Product life cycle","European Union; health care; health policy; institutional framework; policy making; public health; regulatory framework; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35349003626

Below the point-source detection limit, correlations in the large-scale structure lead to clustered anisotropies in the unresolved component of the far-infrared background (FIRB). The angular power spectrum of the FIRB anisotropies could be measured in large-area surveys with the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) on the upcoming Herschel Space Observatory. To study statistical properties of these anisotropies, the confusion from foreground Galactic dust emission needs to be reduced, even in the ""cleanest"" regions of the sky. The multifrequency coverage of SPIRE allows the foreground dust to be partly separated from the extragalactic background, composed of dusty star-forming galaxies as well as faint normal galaxies. The separation improves for fields with sizes greater than a few hundred square degrees and when combined with Planck data. We show that an area of ∼400 deg2 observed for about 1000 hr with Herschel SPIRE and complemented by Planck provides maximal information on the anisotropy power spectrum. We discuss the scientific studies that can be done with measurements of the unresolved FIRB anisotropies, including a determination of the large-scale bias and the small-scale halo occupation distribution of FIRB sources with fluxes below the point-source detection level. © 2007.

Much has been said about the US role in this report, which included significant support from the Department of Energy through the Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) and other Department of Energy (DOE) programs for climate model development and the production execution of simulations. The SciDAC-supported Earth System Grid Center for Enabling Technologies (ESG-CET) also played a major role in the IPCC AR4: all of the simulation data that went into the report was made available to climate scientists worldwide exclusively via the ESG-CET At the same time as the IPCC AR4 database was being developed, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), a leading US climate science laboratory and a ESG participant, began publishing model runs from the Community Climate System Model (CCSM), and its predecessor the Parallel Coupled Model (PCM) through ESG In aggregate, ESG-CET provides seamless access to over 180 terabytes of distributed climate simulation data to over 6,000 registered users worldwide, who have taken delivery of more than 250 terabytes from the archive. Not only does this represent a substantial advance in scientific knowledge, it is also a major step forward in how we conduct the research process on a global scale. Moving forward, the next IPCC assessment report, AR5, will demand multi-site metadata federation for data discovery and cross-domain identity management for single sign-on of users in a more diverse federation enterprise environment.

In the present study, in situ dissolution of carbonate sedimentary particles in Devil's Hole, Bermuda, was observed during summer when thermally driven density stratification restricted mixing between the bottom water and the surface mixed layer and microbial decomposition of organic matter in the subthermocline layer produced pCO2 levels similar to or higher than those levels anticipated by the end of the 21st century. Trends in both seawater chemistry and the composition of sediments in Devil's Hole indicate that Mg-calcite minerals are subject to selective dissolution under conditions of elevated pCO2. The derived rates of dissolution based on observed changes in excess alkalinity and estimates of vertical eddy diffusion ranged from 0.2 mmol to 0.8 mmol CaCO3 m-2 h-1. On a yearly basis, this range corresponds to 175-701 g CaCO3 m-2 year-1; the latter rate is close to 50% of the estimate of the current average global coral reef calcification rate of about 1,500 g CaCO3 m-2 year-1. Considering a reduction in marine calcification of 40% by the year 2100, or 90% by 2300, as a result of surface ocean acidification, the combination of high rates of carbonate dissolution and reduced rates of calcification implies that coral reefs and other carbonate sediment environments within the 21st and following centuries could be subject to a net loss in carbonate material as a result of increasing pCO2 arising from burning of fossil fuels. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","CaCO3 dissolution; Calcification; Carbonate minerals; Climate change; CO2; Coral reef; Mg-calcite; Ocean acidification","acidification; alkalinity; calcification; carbonate sediment; climate change; coral reef; dissolution; human activity; marine sediment; organic matter; shallow water; stratification; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Bermuda; Devils Hole; Nevada; North America; United States; Anthozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34948891019

ENEA, Via Martiri di Monte Sole, Bologna, Italy","Background, Aims and Scope. The interest in recycling materials at the end of their life is growing in the industry in general. As regards the Wastes of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), an appreciable increase of these materials has been noticed in the last decades, 117 • 103 tons of WEEE have been produced in Italy in 2002 according to Ecohitech [1] and the increase in this kind of waste is three times higher than that of the municipal waste according to the FISE ASSOAMBIENTE report [2]. Within WEEE, End-of-Life Cathode Ray Tube (EOL CRT) glass, the main part of TV sets and PC monitors, is here analysed using both a technical approach to establish a possible reuse of the glass in a open-loop recycling field (ceramic industry) and a methodology (LCA) capable of providing environmental evaluations. Methods. The technological characterization was performed by chemical resistance tests (UNI EN ISO 10545-13), staining tests (UNI EN ISO 10545-14) with blue methylene and potassium permanganate (KMnO4), and surface abrasion tests (UNI EN ISO 10545-7). The LCA study was conducted using the SimaPro 5.0 software and Eco-Indicator 99 as an evaluation method. Results and Discussion. The good technical results, reached by using cleaned EOL CRT panel glass inside a ceramic glaze formulation instead of a commercial frit, are supported by the environmental impact evaluation, which shows a decrease of the overall potential damage (measured in Points) of 36% and, in particular, a reduction of 53% in 'Human health', 31% in 'Ecosystem quality' and 24% in 'Resources'. Conclusions. This study has demonstrated that this new, open-loop recycling strategy for the CRT glass significantly reduces the environmental impact of the ceramic glaze production process. In fact, in all damage categories examined in this study, there is a minor impact. An improvement is evident in the respiratory inorganics sub-category related to the lowering of dusts mainly and to a lesser amount with NOx and SOx in the climate change sub-category, due mainly to the reduction of CO2 emission correlated to the avoided combustion of the mixture which feeds melting furnaces in the frit production. Thus, the damage decrease in 'Ecosystem quality' is prevalently due to the lower NOx emissions by the kilns in the frit production that is evident in the acidification/eutrophication sub-category. Finally, the significant saving in the 'Resource' category is principally linked to the fossil fuels sub-category, thanks to the methane saving which stokes the melting furnaces. Perspectives. Furthermore, the decrease in CO2 emission (94.4%) evident in the climate change sub-category is a very important topic because it is in line with the Kyoto protocol (1997), where significant efforts have been exerted for the reduction of the green house gases emission, notably CO 2. The CO2 emission is correlated to the combustion of the mixture which feeds melting kilns in the frit production, therefore the recycling of secondary raw materials, already in a glass state, can reduce the emissions of this gas. This reduction can be termed as environmental credit and it is an example of an allocation of environmental loads in a open-loop recycling, where waste from one industrial system are used as raw materials in another product system. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Behm GmbH).","Cathode ray-tube glass; Ceramic glaze; Life cycle assessment; Recycling","carbon dioxide; glass; article; ceramics; electrode; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment; priority journal; recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35748962300

The lower Khorpy Group (T2-J3) consists of two units: the Boktor (T2-J2) and Kholvasi (J2-3). The Boktor Sequence (400 m thick) is represented by pelagic cherts with an admixture of cherty-clayey shales and volcanic rocks. The Kholvasi Sequence (500 m thick) is built up of the predominant siltstones and clayey shales with rare intercalations and lenses of clayey cherts and cherty-clayey shales. The upper Komsomolskaya Group (K1) has a terrigenous composition and includes the Gorin, Pionerskaya, and Pivan formations of 5 km total thickness. It is made up of intercalated sandstones, siltstones, mudstones, and often turbidites (proximal to distal). The rocks contain abundant buchia fauna of Volgian-Valanginian age, as well as carbonized plant detritus and flora of the Early Cretaceous habit. The described complex is characterized by a nappe-fold structure typical of the accretionary prisms in the ocean-continent convergence zones. The predominance of the coherent type of accretionary prisms reflects the simple morphology of the oceanic plate. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2007.","Accretionary prism; Far East; Litho and biostratigraphy; Lower Amur region; Mesozoic",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37249028141

Water boiling and cooking experiments using the common cooking energy sources (fuel wood, kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and electricity) and common food items (water, yam and beans) were carried out. Energy surveys were carried out to determine the cooking energy use patterns in the urban and rural areas. It was found that fuel wood is the least expensive cooking energy source and LPG is the most expensive. Energy use efficiencies for boiling water were estimated at 25%, 46%, 73%, 79%, 66% and 90% for fuel wood, kerosene, gas, electric immersion coil, electric heating coil and electric hot plate, respectively. Energy intensity was found to be a comparative measure of energy efficiency. The impacts of air pollution from household cooking suggested a possibility of significant air pollutants contribution to the ambient environment using any of the energy carriers considered except electricity. The cooking energy use patterns showed that fuel wood is the predominant energy source for cooking in the rural areas while kerosene is the predominant energy source in the urban areas, revealing that the energy policy in the country had made no impact in the cooking energy sector. Recommendations for improving the energy supply situation were given and for removing the barriers that prevent the implementation of the recommendations. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It was found that while B-type carbonate substitution predominates in carbonate apatites (CAps), A-type is also detected. B-type carbonate substitution causes a broadening of the v1 P-O stretching mode that is associated with the atomic disorder and lowering of the local symmetry in CAps from C6 h2 to C3h. An ∼15 cm-1 shift of the v3c PO4 stretching IR mode was observed upon decarbonation of the CFAp. Such shift which was confirmed by lattice dynamics calculations points out that the P-O bond lengths on the mirror plane increase when carbonate leaves the apatite structure. The present results support the substitution mechanism proposed on the basis of neutron powder diffraction studies of the same samples whereby carbonate substitutes on the mirror plane of the phosphate tetrahedron. The intensity ratios of the v2 IR CO3 and v1 PO4 bands in samples of various carbonate contents provide a measure of the degree of carbonation for CAps. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

These scenarios based on IPCC's 21st century emission scenarios that combine a variety of assumptions about demographic, economic and technological driving forces likely to influence such emissions in the future, were used as input to a crop model to predict the impact of climate change on wheat yield at a location in south-eastern Australia. At this locality there are important likely changes in the primary climatic variables of temperature, rainfall and solar radiation. Generally, we found a strong and consistent positive trend in mean diurnal temperature range, followed by a significant negative trend in wheat yield under three climate scenarios with and without elevated CO2 concentration. It is possible that negative trends identified over the future decades may be artefacts of the method of substituting historical variance for future variance. We observed that from present climate to projected low, mid and high global warming scenarios, median wheat yield may decrease by about 29%. Under these scenarios, but with an elevated atmospheric CO2 climate, median wheat yield may decrease by about 25%. The effect of elevated CO2 reduces the severity of the warmer air temperatures and lower rainfall but the effect is small (4%). Advances in agronomy and breeding must boost crop yields by around 25% over the coming decades, to keep in step with predicted climate change. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Studies of bacterioplankton carbon demand (BCD) and growth efficiency (BGE) frequently report higher values in more productive systems, suggesting these aspects of carbon metabolism may be positively coupled. However, the existence of such a relationship in natural aquatic systems has yet to be identified. Using a comprehensive 2-year study of bacterioplankton carbon metabolism in a temperate estuary, we investigated BCD and BGE and explored factors that may modulate their magnitude and coherence, including nutrient concentrations, dissolved nutrient uptake and source and quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). During the course of our study, BCD ranged from 0.4 to 15.9gl1h -1, with an overall mean of 3.8gl1h-1. Mean BGE was similar to that reported for other estuarine systems (0.32) and of comparable range (that is, 0.06-0.68). Initial analyses identified a negative correlation between BCD and BGE, yet removal of the effect of temperature revealed an underlying positive coupling that was also correlated with long-term DOC lability. Whereas BCD was weakly related to ambient DOC concentrations, neither BCD nor BGE showed any relationship with ambient nutrient concentrations or nutrient uptake stoichiometries. We conclude that in this carbon-rich estuary, organic matter source and quality play an important role in regulating the magnitude of carbon metabolism and may be more important than nutrient availability alone in the regulation of BGE. © 2007 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.","Bacterioplankton; DOC; Estuary; Growth efficiency; Lability","carbon; article; bacterium; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; plankton; season; wetland; Bacteria; Carbon; Ecosystem; Plankton; Seasons; Water Microbiology; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36849039428

The study presented here seeks to understand what would constitute an improved role for climate prediction in contributing to sustaining agricultural production and food security in Southern Africa. Investigation undertaken during the 2002/2003 rainy season under regional conditions of elevated disaster risk shows, however, that a number of weaknesses and gaps persistently characterize climate information systems in the Southern African region, and constrain such systems' ability to benefit key sectors, particularly agriculture. The stakeholder identification of such gaps forms the basis for distilling concrete recommendations to improve process and organizational efficiency.

Specifically, the paper reviews and evaluates the implementation of the 10-year master plan to control air pollution in Tehran since its introduction in 2000. The paper argues that, thus far, the full implementation of many of the strategies of the master plan has lagged behind and a gap has emerged between the plan and its practice. Looking into the future, the paper identifies a list of challenges that need to be addressed systematically and comprehensively in order to turn the master plan and its strategies into meaningful and coordinated practice.

Unfortunately, this practice leads to environmental degradation because this flocculation effluent contains high concentrations of chromium (Cr6+), which is a heavy-metal pollutant. Consequently, it is recommended that the flocculation effluent be treated in a batch adsorption process, using powdered activated-carbon (PAC) in order to improve the quality of the flocculation effluent before its sub-surface injection. A representative sample of the untreated LP-OBDC was collected from a mud pit close to an oil-well in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Initial characterization of the untreated LP-OBDC showed that the concentration of Cr6+ was 5.26 g/m3. Flocculation of the LP-OBDCs was carried out using aluminum sulphate and sodium chloride as coagulant and flocculant, respectively. After flocculation, the Cr6+ was reduced to 5.01 g/m3 (i.e. a 4.75% reduction). The flocculation effluent was then subjected to an activated-carbon batch-adsorption process. At the end of the process, the Cr6+ content was further reduced to 2.77 g/m3 (i.e. a 44.7% reduction), which shows a significant improvement on the quality of the flocculation effluent. The adsorption mechanism of Cr6+ onto the PAC fitted the second-order kinetic model (with R2 = 1.00 approximately) with equilibrium being attained within 60 minutes of contact time. Performance characteristics of the PAC show that the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent at equilibrium is 1.60 mg/g (i.e. a 64.0% adsorption) at the initial chromium-concentration, C0, of 2.50 g/m3. Also, adsorption-capacity data, obtained using the regressed Freudlich's isotherm (Qe = 0.768 Ce1 / 1.32), were quite close to the pertinent experimental data (with R2 = 0.981). The adsorption intensity, n, is 1.32, indicating a strongly favourable adsorption, which shows that a large amount of chromium is adsorbed at low concentrations of adsorbate in the flocculation effluent. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A labor policy is also analyzed that would reduce the direct negative economic effects of the emissions restrictions. The politics of limiting greenhouse gas emissions are often dominated by relatively short-term considerations. Yet the current economic modeling of emissions limitations does not embody economic features that are likely to be particularly important in the short term, in particular, the politically sensitive unemployment rate. Moreover, only a few of these studies also consider policies that would offset the negative direct economic effects of emissions restrictions. For plausible estimates of the parameters, the model shows that, with the labor market imperfections, if there were no offsetting policies, the reductions in GNP in the U.S. in the first 10 years after emissions restrictions were imposed would be as much as 4%. However, if there were two policies, instead of just one: a counteracting labor market policy, as well as the emissions restrictions, the negative direct economic effects could be completely eliminated. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) is mainly used for welding of boiler components. Pulsed GTAW is another process widely used where high quality and precision welds are required. In all arc-welding processes, the intense heat produced by the arc and the associated local heating and cooling lead to varied corrosion behavior and several metallurgical phase changes. Since the occurrence of corrosion is due to electrochemical potential gradient developed in the adjacent site of a weld metal, it is proposed to study the effects of welding on the corrosion behavior of these steels. This paper describes the experimental work carried out to evaluate and compare corrosion and its inhibition in SA 516 Gr.70 carbon steel by pulsed GTAW process in HCl medium at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 M concentrations. The parent metal, weld metal and heat affected zone are chosen as regions of exposure for the study made at room temperature (R.T.) and at 100 °C. Electrochemical polarization techniques such as Tafel line extrapolation (Tafel), linear polarization resistance (LPR), and ac impedance method have been used to measure the corrosion current. The role of hexamine and mixed inhibitor (thiourea + hexamine in 0.5 M HCl), each at 100 ppm concentration is studied in these experiments. Microstructural observation, surface characterization, and morphology using SEM and XRD studies have been made on samples exposed at 100 °C in order to highlight the nature and extent of film formation. © 2007 ASM International.","Corrosion testing; Power plant carbon steel; Pulsed GTA welding","Corrosion behavior; Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW); Heat production; Power plant carbon steel; Carbon steel; Electric arc welding; Phase change materials; Polarization; Power plants; Steel metallurgy; Steel corrosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548503427

Box 600, N-4003 Stavanger, Norway","Implementation of CO2 capture and geological storage (CCGS) technology at the scale needed to achieve a significant and meaningful reduction in CO2 emissions requires knowledge of the available CO2 storage capacity. CO2 storage capacity assessments may be conducted at various scales-in decreasing order of size and increasing order of resolution: country, basin, regional, local and site-specific. Estimation of the CO2 storage capacity in depleted oil and gas reservoirs is straightforward and is based on recoverable reserves, reservoir properties and in situ CO2 characteristics. In the case of CO2-EOR, the CO2 storage capacity can be roughly evaluated on the basis of worldwide field experience or more accurately through numerical simulations. Determination of the theoretical CO2 storage capacity in coal beds is based on coal thickness and CO2 adsorption isotherms, and recovery and completion factors. Evaluation of the CO2 storage capacity in deep saline aquifers is very complex because four trapping mechanisms that act at different rates are involved and, at times, all mechanisms may be operating simultaneously. The level of detail and resolution required in the data make reliable and accurate estimation of CO2 storage capacity in deep saline aquifers practical only at the local and site-specific scales. This paper follows a previous one on issues and development of standards for CO2 storage capacity estimation, and provides a clear set of definitions and methodologies for the assessment of CO2 storage capacity in geological media. Notwithstanding the defined methodologies suggested for estimating CO2 storage capacity, major challenges lie ahead because of lack of data, particularly for coal beds and deep saline aquifers, lack of knowledge about the coefficients that reduce storage capacity from theoretical to effective and to practical, and lack of knowledge about the interplay between various trapping mechanisms at work in deep saline aquifers. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, despite the prevalence of these instruments as an outcropping of the broader shift toward neoliberal approaches to environmental policies, tremendous diversity exists in the way signatories to the Kyoto Protocol have deployed NEPIs. Drawing on recent geographical and political science research on the neoliberalization of nature, this article reexamines reasons for geographical variations in market environmentalism and, in particular, the role of national policy styles in refracting neoliberal influence on environmental policy. In so doing, I argue that policy styles are too frequently conceptualized in terms of state processes, overlooking complex and territorialized social relations between regulators and regulated parties. To illustrate this claim, I compare the implementation of climate policy in the United Kingdom and Germany, exploring the effects of national policy styles on NEPI deployment, factors contributing to industry reactions to market-based and voluntary measures, and how national policy styles color these evaluations. This is used to argue that understanding geographical variations in market environmentalism requires greater appreciation of the role of industry groups in the creation, defense, and evolution of national policy styles.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency requires all States with PM2.5 non-attainment counties or with sources contributing to visibility impairment at Class I areas to submit an emissions control plan. These emission control plans will likely focus on reducing emissions of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, which form two of the largest chemical components of PM2.5 in the eastern United States: ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate. Emission control strategies are simulated using three-dimensional Eulerian photochemical transport models. A monitor study was established using one urban (Detroit) and nine rural locations in the central and eastern United States to simultaneously measure PM2.5 sulfate ion (SO42-), nitrate ion (NO3-), ammonium ion (NH4+), and precursor species sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitric acid (HNO3), and ammonia (NH3). This monitor study provides a unique opportunity to assess how well the modeling system predicts the spatial and temporal variability of important precursor species and co-located PM2.5 ions, which is not well characterized in the central and eastern United States. The modeling system performs well at estimating the PM2.5 species, but does not perform quite as well for the precursor species. Ammonia is under-predicted in the coldest months, nitric acid tends to be over-predicted in the summer months, and sulfur dioxide appears to be systematically over-predicted. Several indicators of PM2.5 ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate formation and chemical composition are estimated with the ambient data and photochemical model output. PM2.5 sulfate ion is usually not fully neutralized to ammonium sulfate in ambient measurements and is usually fully neutralized in model estimates. The model and ambient estimates agree that the ammonia study monitors tend to be nitric acid limited for PM2.5 nitrate formation. Regulatory strategies in this part of the country should focus on reductions in NOX rather than ammonia to control PM2.5 ammonium nitrate. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the late 1980s a new concept is being developed which enables to make use of fossil fuels with a considerably reduced emission of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The concept is often called 'Carbon Capture and Storage' (CCS). CCS technologies are receiving increasing attention, mainly for their potential contribution to the optimal mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions that is intended to avoid future, dangerous climate change. CCS technologies attract a lot of attention because they could allow ""to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere whilst continuing to use fossil fuels"". CCS is not a completely new technology, e.g., the United States alone is sequestering about 8.5 MtC for enhanced oil recovery each year. Today, CCS technologies are widely recognised as an important means of progress in industrialized countries.","CCS technologies; CO2 capture; CO2 storage; CO2 transportation; Costs; Leakage","Atmospheric chemistry; Climate change; Costs; Enhanced oil recovery; Potential contribution; Sequestering; Carbon dioxide",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549099553

Coal is an affordable fuel source and provides a dual utility - it warms the house and allows cooking to take place in the same appliance utilising only one fuel. Despite affordability and accessibility of the fuel, the use of coal results in extremely high levels of air pollution and concomitant respiratory diseases - an estimated $160 million per annum in South Africa. Access to electricity does not result in households switching away from coal since electricity and electrical appliances are regarded as unaffordable. This paper presents information collected during a baseline energy survey in an electrified urban township in South Africa, and outlines the way in which coal is used and purchased by poor households. An alternative fire lighting method, proven to reduce smoke and air pollution form coal fires has been demonstrated to households with promising results. An integrated approach, addressing energy efficient housing design, the supply of clean and efficient energy appliances together with the use of the alternative fire lighting method, is recommended to address pollution from household coal use.","Coal; Coal stoves; Coal use; Household ependiture; Vosman Township",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36049003422

Gas slowly diffused from the borehole within superficial permeable sand. Seven persons living in three ground floor flats of a near building had to be hospitalized due to CO2 exposure. All the houses in the proximity were evacuated. At the request of the Fire Brigade two additional boreholes were drilled nearby, hoping that this could rapidly exhaust the gas stored underground. To the contrary the soil gas flux near houses increased and indoor CO2 air concentration rapidly rose to lethal values (15 to 30   vol.%). As a remediation we suggested to restore the continuity of the impervious gas cover by squeezing quick-setting cement into the formation through new boreholes to be drilled near the existing ones. Although the first cement squeeze reduced drastically the CO2 soil flux and indoor concentration, six additional squeezes had to be carried out in order to lower the gas emission below the gas hazard threshold. The gas was mostly made of CO2 (98   vol.%) with minor N2 and CH4. Its chemical and isotopic composition (δ13CCO2 = - 1.55; 3He/4He = 0.314   Ra) is similar to that of the gas manifestations of Mts. Sabatini and Alban Hills volcanic areas. Though being somewhat contaminated by crustal and shallow organic volatiles, these gases likely have a component originated in the mantle, that beneath the volcanic Roman Comagmatic Province is probably deeply contaminated with crustal material. The Fiumicino gas blowout indicates that the area of Central Italy characterized by strong CO2 degassing extends westerly to include the Tyrrhenian coast. © 2007.","CO2 hazard; Earth CO2 degassing in Central Italy; gas blowout; gas monitoring; remediation interventions","Gas blowout; Gas monitoring; Isotopic composition; Boreholes; Carbon dioxide; Degassing; Diffusion; Geochemistry; Health hazards; Gas emissions; blowout; borehole; carbon dioxide; crustal contamination; degassing; hazard assessment; isotopic composition; mantle source; pressure effect; soil gas; volatile organic compound; Eurasia; Europe; Fiumicino; Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Southern Europe; Tyrrhenian Coast",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447326494

However, in practice, researchers have found that carbon leakage from the implementation of the EU ETS is unlikely to be substantial because transport costs, local market conditions, product variety and incomplete information all tend to favour local production. This study investigates potential carbon leakage from six EU Member States (MSs) that implemented Environmental Tax Reform (ETRs) unilaterally over the period 1995-2005. The study uses the large-scale multisectoral integrated energy-environment-economy (E3) model of 27 European countries, energy-environment-economy model of Europe (E3ME), to undertake a dynamic comparative analysis to assess any carbon leakage effects over the longer term 1995-2012. A counterfactual Reference case is constructed, assuming that the six countries did not introduce ETRs; then alternative scenarios are developed to assess the effects of the ETRs, including effects on CO2 emissions for the EU25 economies. Most MSs recorded a reduction in CO2 emissions when comparing the Baseline case to the Reference case. The results show that carbon leakage is very small and in some cases negative, due to technological spillover effects. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, occupants of a refurbished office recorded their thermal sensations, assessment of lighting and air movement, perceptions of comfort and their reactions to adaptive opportunities. The observed mean thermal sensation votes and the overall comfort votes correlated best with mean diurnal internal and external temperatures, respectively. The results appear to indicate heat balance models not fully explaining surveyed responses as occupants reported higher discomfort levels than predicted by the PMV model using on-site temperature and air velocity measurements. In the study opening windows was voted to be the most favourite adaptive opportunity followed by controlling solar glare, turning lights off locally and controlling solar gain. Occupants also expressed desires to intervene with heating and ventilation currently operated centrally. An interesting result of the survey was that the occupants generally did not change their clothing during the day.

The survival of caged megafauna (Benthoctopus sp., Pachycara bulbiceps, Coryphaenoides armatus) exposed to CO2-rich and normal (control) seawater varied among species. Benthoctopus sp. and P. bulbiceps survived control conditions and month-long episodic exposure to acidic, CO2-rich waters (pH reductions of ∼0.1 U). All C. armatus in both treatments died, potentially due to cage-related stress, predation, and exposure to acidic waters. High survival by P. bulbiceps and Benthoctopus under month-long exposure to CO2-rich waters indicates a physiological capacity to cope, at least temporarily, with stresses that will accompany expected future changes in ocean chemistry. The abundance of free-ranging scavengers was not correlated with variation in pH levels near fish cages. Incidental observations of abyssal scavengers collected using time-lapse cameras during these experiments were used secondarily to evaluate the hypothesis that macrourid fishes avoid the odor of dead conspecifics. Caged macrourids in view of time-lapse cameras died within 2 to 3 d, eliciting a strong response from the regional scavenger assemblage which aggregated near the cage. The pattern of scavenger visits suggests avoidance among taxa and a succession of scavengers. Macrourids, a dominant abyssal scavenger, either did not respond to the death of their congener or possibly avoided the area. Lack of a response by macrourids may be due to (1) avoidance of sites of dead or dying congeners, (2) high sensitivity to ocean acidification, (3) low nutritional value or weaker odor plumes from carcasses of abyssal versus shallow-water taxa, or (4) rapid departure from sites where a carcass is inaccessible. Camera systems were not deployed in view of carcasses at control sites (away from CO2 pools) during each experiment, and we therefore cannot exclude the possibility that the pattern of scavenger visits was influenced by elevated carbon dioxide levels. © Inter-Research 2007.","Behavior; Benthoctopus sp.; Coryphaenoides armatus; Food fall; Macrouridae; Octopodidae; Pachycara bulbiceps; Zoarcidae","abyssal organism; acidification; behavioral response; cephalopod; deep-sea organism; food; nutritive value; odor; scavenger; California; North America; United States; Animalia; Benthoctopus; Benthoctopus sp.; Coryphaenoides armatus; Macrouridae; Octopodidae; Pachycara bulbiceps; Pisces; Zoarcidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37849051312

This is a crucial factor because in this zone the climatic conditions (especially the scarce rainfall) impede plant development. In this work, the influence in the long-term (13 years) of two types of physical management (terracing and strip planting) in the reforestation of a mountainside with Pinus halepensis Millar, together with the addition of an organic amendment (produced from municipal refuse), was evaluated by means of different biochemical and microbiological parameters, including those related to the size and general activity of microbial populations, such as microbial biomass C (MBC), basal respiration, ATP, dehydrogenase activity and hydrolase activities. Also, the study of labile C fractions (water-soluble C, WSC) provided information regarding the metabolic potential of the soil microorganisms. Three-way ANOVA showed that organic amendment significantly increased general microbial activity and carbon fractions. Strips produced, in the long-term, only a slightly positive effect on the microbial activity. The results indicate that terracing, if not accompanied by the addition of organic matter, impacts negatively on the soil microbiological characteristics, as reflected in the lower general microbial activity (ATP, basal respiration and dehydrogenase activity) and the lower specific microbial activity (β-glucosidase, protease and phosphatase activities) detected in the non-amended terraces in comparison with a natural area with no intervention. However, in the amended plots, it was the terraces which had higher BAA-protease and β-glucosidase activities than the strips. Microbial biomass C, basal respiration and dehydrogenase activity showed higher values in amendment treatments than in unamended treatments. These results allow us to conclude that terracing in semi-arid areas where water is scarce is a good reforestation practice but it should be accompanied by organic amendment because otherwise these techniques can have a negative effect on soil microbiological and biochemical properties. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The bulk carbonate-derived δ13C curve was constructed using ∼ 700 biostratigraphically constrained samples providing a 105-yr resolution. A multi-component study of δ13C and δ18O variability in petrographically and geochemically screened abiotic and biogenic calcite components delineates the degree of preservation and δ13C heterogeneity in these ancient epicontinental carbonates. Furthermore, it constrains the influence of kinetic and vital effects, and local-to-regional-scale C cycling on their δ13Ccarb values. The δ13C and δ18O values of micrites and bulk carbonates overlap regardless of lithofacies and show minimal intrasample variability. Overall, biogenic calcite δ13C and δ18O values are higher than the average isotope compositions of bulk carbonates and micrites, although δ13C values in contemporaneous samples are only minimally (0.3‰; 2 std err of ± 0.3‰) different relative to much larger differences in δ18O values. Although brachiopod δ13C and δ18O values are higher than average bulk carbonate and micrite values, their δ13C values exhibit considerable isotopic variability by taxa and ultrastructure. Notably, the δ13C values of brachiopod secondary shell layers overlap with bulk carbonate, micrite and marine cement δ13C values. Conversely, δ13C values of brachiopod tertiary prismatic layers, including Composita, are on average 2 to 5‰ higher than the δ13C values of contemporaneous bulk carbonates, micrites and brachiopod secondary shell layers. An observed average ∼ 2‰ decrease in the δ13C values of secondary cross-bladed laminar layers in productids relative to contemporaneous bulk carbonate, micrite and marine cement values suggests a previously unrecognized kinetic and/or vital effect on Carboniferous productid δ13C values given that they have the highest δ18O values of all analyzed components. The observed higher δ13C values in these tertiary prismatic layers are comparable to greater than the 13C-enrichment (∼ 1‰) previously documented in Pennsylvanian Composita. The overlap in δ13C values of bulk carbonates with diagenetically screened, microdrilled matrix, marine cements and brachiopod secondary shell layers indicates that the Chesterian bulk carbonate-derived δ13C values may reliably record, to within 1‰, the evolution of ambient seawater δ13C in the outer carbonate ramp of the Antler basin. Comparison of the Chesterian δ13C record to the bulk-carbonate C isotope curve derived from the Arrow Canyon, NV carbonate succession, further suggests that these bulk carbonate-derived δ13C records are reliable proxies of the composition and trends in seawater δ13C regionally along the equatorial eastern Panthalassan margin. The newly resolved Chesterian stratigraphy documents multiple δ13C excursions, including previously unrecognized significant C isotope shifts. A shift to higher frequency and amplitude shorter-term δ13C fluctuations in the upper third of the Chesterian Stage occurred simultaneously with a change in stratigraphic cyclicity from dominantly 3rd-order to 4th-order carbonate cycles suggesting a mechanistic linkage between ambient seawater δ13C and sea-level fluctuations in the Antler basin. This change in the character of the shorter-term δ13C fluctuations coupled with a subsequent significant (∼ 4‰) positive C isotope excursion across the mid-Carboniferous boundary, previously recognized in all Carboniferous curves, is interpreted to record the onset of late Paleozoic glaciation and glacio-eustasy. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Model simulations were evaluated for temporal patterns of N2O, NH4+, NO3- and water-filled pore space (WFPS) and total N2O emissions. Several soil and crop input parameter adjustments to the model were evaluated but only the recalculation of the WFPS at wilting point and at field capacity, using pedotransfer functions, resulted in a clear improvement of the simulated variables (WFPS in all cases, N2O in some cases). Therefore, only this adjustment was made to DNDC 8.3P. This change, however, resulted for some cases (both cropland and grassland) in retardation of nitrate leaching and to a lesser extent of NH4+ to the deeper soil layers. The goodness of fit of the simulated temporal pattern of N2O varied considerably between sites. The total simulated N2O emissions from cropland showed a good agreement with the measurements, although there was a systematic overestimation of 7.4 kg N2O-N ha-1. Grassland soils, in contrast, gave a low agreement between total simulated and measured N2O losses. On the basis of all measured data a regional emission factor of 3.16 with a 95% confidence interval of -0.89 to 7.21 could be calculated. DNDC simulations resulted in an emission factor of 6.49 with a 95% confidence interval of 4.04-8.93. The overall outcome of the N2O emission measurements and DNDC simulations were compared with several empirical regression models, which may be applicable for a temperate climate system. All of the tested regression models showed reliable results up to a N2O emission of 10 kg N2O-N ha-1. Higher emissions, however, were systematically underestimated. Though DNDC both under- and overestimated specific sites, the general agreement, over the whole range between measurements and simulations of total N2O losses (simulations=0.82×meas.+6.2), was better than for the different regression models. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We also focus here on developing new diagnostic tools that will help us to obtain more confidently the underlying thermospheric structure of Jupiter. First, using the brightness distribution for specific wavelength bands as proposed by Ben Jaffel et al. [Ben Jaffel, L., Magnan, C., Vidal-Madjar, A., 1988. Astron. Astrophys. 204, 319-326], we show that the spatial thickness of the atomic H layer above the homopause level can be measured directly as the separation between the vertical positions of respectively the line core and line wing optical limbs. This thickness also constrains the [H] column and the value KH of the eddy diffusion coefficient at the homopause level at the disc location under consideration. We also propose to refine the value of KH and [H], respectively, at a specific planetary latitude, using the Q ratio of the limb peak brightness to the intensity from other regions over the planetary disc. Finally, the relationship between the disc brightness distribution from specific wavelength bands of the emission line and the temperature gradient in the thermosphere is demonstrated, thus providing an accurate tool to access this key information from high resolution observations. Quick, preliminary comparisons with some existing HTS/STIS data show the H layer thickness at auroral latitudes (∼ 1700  km) is much smaller than at equatorial latitudes (∼ 3900  km). These results strongly support the existence of a gradient in both H density and KH versus latitude, with higher values of KH at high latitudes and higher values of the H density at the equatorial regions. Such a small H layer thickness at auroral latitudes is consistent with a high mixing in the atmosphere that brings the hydrocarbons upwards, reducing consequently the column of hydrogen that scatters photons. These preliminary results show the strength of the proposed approach and open new horizons to use strong resonant emission lines at high resolution as a diagnostic for the state and structure of planetary upper atmospheres. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Emergence, flowering, and ripening schedules were monitored from 1994 to 2004, a period that included years with marked differences in precipitation, growing-season temperature, and snowbankmeltout dates. Late-lying snow is a critical limiting factor in the high-mountain environment, delaying the emergence of edible greens and the blooming of root-food species by as much as 2 to 3 months in extreme years. Fruit and seed production are unreliable at high altitude because favorable moisture and temperature conditions rarely exist at all stages in the developmental process. Ethnographic data from arctic and subpolar regions with ET (effective temperature) values similar to those of the study area suggest that plant foods comprised less than 20 of the high-altitude summer diets of Front Range hunter-gatherers. Percentages would have been lower during cold, snowy intervals such as the Little Ice Age. Visitors to the alpine region, however, spent much of the year in warmer environments.

The coincidence of several factors, themselves not necessarily extreme, can have similar adverse implications, such as a combination of high spring-time temperatures and heavy rainfall. A combination of high temperature and heavy precipitation during spring can produce flooding when run-off due to snow-melt adds to river discharge from the rainfall. Such combined events are often referred to as 'complex extremes' (IPCC, Climate change 2001: impact, adaptation and vulnerability. Summary for policymakers. WMO, Geneva, Switzerland, p. 7, 2001) . A likely effect of a climate change is a shift in the frequency of both extremes in traditional sense as well as in complex extreme events. Results from a global climate model were downscaled through a higher-resolution nested regional climate model in order to obtain more realistic descriptions of regional climatic features in Norway. Empirically-based joint frequency distributions (two dimensional histograms) were used to study shifts in the frequency of complex extremes. A slight shift in the joint frequency distributions for spring-time temperature-and-rainfall was detected in downscaled results with HIRHAM from a transient integration with the ECHAM4/OPYC3 climate model following the IS92a emission scenario. The analysis involved values that spanned between ordinary and extreme values of the bivariate distributions complicating the estimation of a representative confidence interval as the data fall in the zone between different types of behaviour. The results from HIRHAM were spatially interpolated and compared with station observations, and substantial biases were revealed, however, the apparent model discrepancy is largely due to great small-scale variability due to a complex physiography. The general temporal trends predicted by the model are nevertheless realistic. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Floods; Hazards; Precipitation (meteorology); Probability distributions; Apparent model discrepancy; Bivariate distributions; HIRHAM; Physiography; Climatology; climate effect; climate modeling; flooding; global climate; hazard; precipitation intensity; rainfall; regional climate; river discharge; spring (season); temperature effect; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36248964079

Our aim was to characterize orexin-induced stimulation of duodenal bicarbonate secretion and modulation of secretory responses and mucosal orexin receptors by overnight food deprivation. Lewis X Dark Agouti rats were anesthetized and proximal duodenum cannulated in situ. Mucosal bicarbonate secretion (pH stat) and mean arterial blood pressure were continuously recorded. Orexin-A was administered intra-arterially close to the duodenum, intraluminally, or into the brain ventricles. Total RNA was extracted from mucosal specimens, reverse transcribed to cDNA and expression of orexin receptors 1 and 2 (OX1 and OX2) measured by quantitative real-time PCR. OX1 protein was measured by Western blot. Intra-arterial orexin-A (60-600 nmol·h-1·kg -1) increased (P &lt; 0.01) the duodenal secretion in fed but not in fasted animals. The OX1 receptor antagonist SB-334867, which was also found to have a partial agonist action, abolished the orexin-induced secretory response but did not affect secretion induced by the muscarinic agonist bethanechol. Atropine, in contrast, inhibited bethanechol but not orexin-induced secretion. Orexin-A infused into the brain ventricles (2-20 nmol·kg -1·h-1) or added to luminal perfusate (1.0-100 nM) did not affect secretion, indicating that orexin-A acts peripherally and at basolateral receptors. Overnight fasting decreased mucosal OX1 and OX2 mRNA expression (P &lt; 0.01) as well as OX1 protein expression (P &lt; 0.05). We conclude that stimulation of secretion by orexin-A may involve both receptor types and is independent of cholinergic pathways. Intestinal OX receptors and secretory responses are markedly related to food intake.

In this study, the effect of supplementary installed flue gas desulphurization (FGD) units at high-capacity power plants on regional air pollution in the Carpathian Basin is investigated. The dispersion and accumulation of the SO2 air pollutant are studied with the regional three-dimensional on-line atmosphere-chemistry model REMOTE. The changes in the SO2 air pollution are investigated by parallel simulations in a case study, where the single modified parameter is the SO2 emission rate. The results show that FGD units significantly reduce the horizontal and the vertical dispersion of the emitted SO2, and its transboundary transport, too. Beside the SO2 removal efficiency, the dispersion and accumulation also depend on the seasonal weather conditions. During winter, the dispersion and accumulation are higher than in other seasons.

In this study, we determined the water requirements of the larvae and the mechanisms it exploits to reduce the stress of drying. Larvae lost water at an exceptionally high rate (&gt;10%/h) and tolerated losing a high portion (&gt;70%) of their water content. Larvae were unable to absorb water from subsaturated water vapor (≤0.98 av) to replenish their water stores, thus this midge relies exclusively on the intake of liquid water to increase its pool of body water and maintain water balance. To reduce dehydration stress, the midge employed a variety of mechanisms. Behaviorally, the larvae suppressed water loss by clustering. In response to slow dehydration, glycerol concentration increased 2-fold and trehalose concentration increased 3-fold, responses that are known to decrease the rate of water loss and increase dehydration tolerance. No changes in the mass of cuticular lipids occurred in response to desiccation, but the observed shift to longer hydrocarbons likely contributes to reduced water loss as the larvae dehydrate. As the larvae dehydrated, their oxygen consumption rate dropped, resulting in a reduction of water loss by respiration. Lastly, one bout of slow dehydration also enhanced the larva's ability to survive subsequent dehydration, suggesting that the larvae have the capacity for drought acclimation. Thus, these hydrophilic midge larvae prevent dehydration by multiple mechanisms that collectively reduce the water loss rate and increase dehydration tolerance. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is primarily based on a limited literature review of climate change and health, with particular attention to the relationships between Healthy Cities and climate change, and on documentary analysis of information from organization reports and website content associated with Healthy Cities programs in Europe and Australia. Four semi-structured interviews with key people in two Healthy Cities programs in Europe and Australia were conducted to provide information to supplement and complement the published information and to verify theme identification. The main findings of this study are that, although there is no explicit connection between the local activities of Healthy Cities programs and the potential (or actual) adverse health impacts of climate change, Healthy Cities programs are involved in many local environmental actions and some of these actions, for example, those relating to improving air quality and reducing pollution, are linked implicitly to the health impacts of climate change. Through their local relationships and their participation in regional networks, Healthy Cities are able to make connections between local environmental actions and the health impacts of climate change. Furthermore, expanding Healthy Cities to include eco-social sustainability as a central aim not only has the potential to strengthen the links between local environmental actions and climate change, but also presents a relevant health development setting for exploring the social and environmental sustainability of cities. © The Author (2007).

To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents for the first time a model for such system: (i) using a consistent set of radiation characteristics of the medium derived from experimental data and from Mie theory; (ii) accounting for anisotropic scattering by both the bubbles and the filamentous microorganisms; (iii) considering the spectral dependency of radiation characteristics in the spectral range from 400 to 700 nm using a box model, and (iv) evaluating light transfer in a photobioreactor containing genetically engineered microorganisms with reduced pigment content. The steady-state one-dimensional radiation transfer equation is solved using the modified method of characteristics and a quadrature with 24 directions per hemisphere adapted to forward scattering media. The parameters investigated include the bacteria concentration, the bubble radius, and the void fraction, as well as the approximate scattering phase function. It was established that the strongly forward scattering by the bubbles must be accounted for and the truncated phase function (TPF) is recommended. In the absence of bubbles, ignoring in-scattering by the bacteria leads to errors as high as 20%. On the other hand, accounting for in-scattering with isotropic phase function gives acceptable results. Moreover, genetically reducing the pigment content of the microorganisms by an order of magnitude increases the significance of forward scattering of light by the microorganisms. This in turn, increases the penetration depth and can be accounted for by either the Henyey-Greenstein or the TPF approximations. Finally, the model presented can also be applied to (i) other types of microorganisms such as unicellular green algae or photosynthetic bacteria, (ii) different photobioreactor processes such as food product or pharmaceutical production, or (iii) photochemical reactors. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Airlift; Algae; Bubble column; Carbon dioxide mitigation; Cyanobacteria; Genetically modified bacteria; Light transfer; Modeling; Photobiological hydrogen production; Photobioreactor; Reduced pigment","Algae; Bubble columns; Carbon dioxide; Hydrogen production; Light scattering; Photosynthesis; Pigments; Airlifts; Carbon dioxide mitigation; Genetically modified bacteria; Light transfer; Photobiological hydrogen production; Photobioreactor; Bioreactors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548120182

The new extended model is then used for numerical calculations to test how the Swedish economy reacts to a carbon target. Special attention will be given to distributional effects and the connection between labour supply and work journeys in a sparsely populated country like Sweden. A differentiation between trip purposes and trip length, a complementary relationship between work journeys and labour supply, and a subdivision of households by density of population and income influence the numerical results. Our main conclusions from the analysis of a carbon target are that if the carbon tax revenue is recycled by decreasing the employers' social contribution fee, welfare costs are lower than with lump-sum replacements of tax revenue to households. The welfare cost may be reduced even further if work journeys are not additionally taxed as compared to the base year. However, the lower total welfare cost is obtained at the expense of making society more unequal, since both labour tax recycling (cuts in employers' social contributions) and exempting tax on work journeys will make low income groups carry a higher burden. An increased carbon dioxide tax is also shown to increase welfare differences between sparsely populated areas and city regions in Sweden. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Computable general equilibrium; Consumer demand; Distributional effects; Energy taxation; Transport","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Mathematical models; Social aspects; Sweden; Taxation; Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model; Consumer demand; Distributional effects; Energy taxation; Transportation; carbon dioxide; computable general equilibrium analysis; income; labor supply; national economy; pollution tax; population density; transport vehicle; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249814041

Current SOx and NOx emissions from the power sector could be reduced from 12 to less than 1 and from 5 to 2 million tons annually, respectively, using advanced technology. While direct CO2 emissions from new power plants could be reduced by over 87%, life cycle emissions could increase by over 25% due to the additional coal that is required to be mined and transported to compensate for the energy penalty of the carbon capture and storage technology. Strict environmental controls push capital costs of pulverized coal (PC) and integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants to $1500-1700/kW and $1600-2000/kW, respectively. Adding carbon capture and storage (CCS) increases costs to $2400-2700/kW and $2100-3000/kW (2005 dollars), respectively. Adding CCS reduces the 40-43% efficiency of the ultra-supercritical PC plant to 31-34%; adding CCS reduces the 32-38% efficiency of the GE IGCC plant to 27-33%. For IGCC, PC, and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants, the carbon dioxide tax would have to be $53, $74, and $61, respectively, to make electricity from a plant with CCS cheaper. Capturing and storing 90% of the CO2 emissions increases life cycle costs from 5.4 to 11.6 cents/kWh. This analysis shows that 90% CCS removal efficiency, although being a large improvement over current electricity generation emissions, results in life cycle emissions that are large enough that additional effort is required to achieve significant economy-wide reductions in the US for this large increase in electricity generation using either coal or natural gas. © 2007.","Coal; Electricity; Life cycle","Air quality; Coal gasification plants; Costs; Greenhouse effect; Life cycle; United States; Capital costs; External costs; Private costs; Pulverized coal plants; Coal; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; coal production; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; power plant; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35649018296

In particular, concentrations of two secondary pollutants, ozone and particulate matter, are often above regulated levels and can be dependent on emissions from upwind states. Here, impacts of statewide emissions on concentrations of local and downwind states' ozone and fine particulate matter are simulated for three seasonal periods in the eastern United States using a regional Eulerian photochemical model. Impacts of ground level NOx (e.g., mobile and area sources), elevated NOx (e.g., power plants and large industrial sources), and SO2 emissions are examined. An average of 77% of each state's ozone and PM2.5 concentrations that are sensitive to the emissions evaluated here are found to be caused by emissions from other states. Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia, Kentucky, and West Virginia are shown to have high concentrations of ozone and PM 2.5 caused by interstate emissions. When weighted by population, New York receives increased interstate contributions to these pollutants and contributions to ozone from local emissions are generally higher. When accounting for emission rates, combined states from the western side of the modeling domain and individual states such as Illinois, Tennessee, Indiana, Kentucky, and Georgia are major contributors to interstate ozone. Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Illinois are the major contributors to interstate PM2.5.

The aim of this paper is to study the prospects for using domestic biomass resources in Europe and specifically to investigate whether different policy objectives underlying the promotion of bioenergy (cost-effective climate change mitigation, employment creation and reduced dependency on imported fuels) agree on which bioenergy options that should be used. We model bioenergy use from a cost-effectiveness perspective with a linear regionalized energy- and transport-system model and perform supplementary analysis. It is found that the different policy objectives do not agree on the order of priority among bioenergy options. Maximizing climate benefits cost-effectively is in conflict with maximizing employment creation. The former perspective proposes the use of lignocellulosic biomass in the stationary sector, while the latter requires biofuels for transport based on traditional agricultural crops. Further, from a security-of-supply perspective, the appeal of a given bioenergy option depends on how oil and gas import dependencies are weighed relative to each other. Consequently, there are tradeoffs that need to be addressed by policymakers promoting the use of bioenergy. Also, the importance of bioenergy in relation to employment creation and fuel import dependency reduction needs to be further addressed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The velocity field and the capture efficiency prediction are investigated for different system arrangements. The analysis is carried out for systems respectively with and without fluid-dynamic obstacle in the working plane and for dust pollutants with particle diameters ranging from 1.0 to 100 μm and emission velocities between 1.0 and 7.0 m/s. The analysis, carried out using the commercial code FLUENT, shows that the system performances are dependent on operating conditions and are influenced by the presence of the above-mentioned obstacle on the working plane. In the case of working plane emission without obstacle the system capture efficiency is in general very low never exceeding 25%. Higher efficiencies are instead achieved for particle emission from a vessel placed in the system's working plane centre. In this case even unitary peak efficiencies are reached for particular operating conditions. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Air pollution; Dust; Ventilation; Dust pollutants; Performance analysis; Push-pull ventilation system; Computational fluid dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38749122070

Climate models used for future global warming predictions and attribution of past changes generally consider only global climate drivers, ignoring local drivers, such as land use change and urban effects. Impacts studies are generally carried out in isolation from each other and hence ignore interactions between different impacts sectors, such as hydrology, natural ecosystems and agriculture. Feedbacks from impacts to climate change, which often involve land ecosystem-atmosphere interactions, are often neglected. This can result in representations of global changes that are at best inconsistent and at worst completely misleading. Moreover, a number of climate change mitigation strategies, such as carbon sequestration and biofuels involve changes in land ecosystems. In addition to affecting climate through the exchange of carbon with the atmosphere, these land ecosystem changes may affect climate change or its impacts through a variety of additional processes, such as surface albedo change or changes in the surface moisture budget. Failure to account for these may have consequences that are potentially at odds with the aims of climate change mitigation. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.",,"atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon cycle; climate change; gas exchange",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547601807

Transient state kinetic studies performed using wild-type BphD and the hydrolysis-defective S112A variant indicated that large 3-substituents inhibited His-265-catalyzed tautomerization by 5 orders of magnitude. Structural analyses of S112A·3-Cl HOPDA and S112A·3,10-diF HOPDA complexes revealed a non-productive binding mode in which the plane defined by the carbon atoms of the dienoate moiety of HOPDA is nearly orthogonal to that of the proposed keto tautomer observed in the S112A·HOPDA complex. Moreover, in the 3-Cl HOPDA complex, the 2-hydroxo group is moved by 3.6 Å from its position near the catalytic His-265 to hydrogen bond with Arg-190 and access of His-265 is blocked by the 3-Cl substituent. Nonproductive binding may be stabilized by interactions involving the 3-substituent with non-polar side chains. Solvent molecules have poor access to C6 in the S112A·3-Cl HOPDA structure, more consistent with hydrolysis occurring via an acyl-enzyme than a gem-diol intermediate. These results provide insight into engineering BphD for PCB degradation. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Biphenyl catabolic (Bph) pathway; Carbon-carbon bond hydrolysis; Enol-keto tautomerization; Microbial degradation; Biodegradation; Carbon; Chemical bonds; Enzyme inhibition; Hydrolysis; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Enzyme activity; 2 hydroxy 6 oxo 6 phenylhexa 2,4 dienoic acid; arginine; histidine; hydrolase; polychlorinated biphenyl; protein BphD; unclassified drug; article; catalysis; chemical binding; chemical bond; degradation; enzyme engineering; enzyme inhibition; hydrogen bond; hydrolysis; microbial degradation; priority journal; steady state; stereochemistry; structure analysis; Amino Acid Substitution; Bacterial Proteins; Biodegradation, Environmental; Comamonas testosteroni; Environmental Pollutants; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Hydrolases; Hydrolysis; Isomerism; Kinetics; Mutation, Missense; Polychlorinated Biphenyls",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37549050177

The new concept of Low Level Temperature (LLT) is defined, and can be obtained when potential temperature observations are reduced to the height of the so-called Minimum Topography, a special low level topography that accentuates basins and valleys but smoothes out single summits and scarped slopes. The Vienna Enhanced Resolution Analysis (VERA) is used to produce a comprehensive set of LLT analyses over the Alpine region by evaluating three-hourly synoptic ECMWF data for the period 1980-2001. LLT fields are then evaluated climatologically in order to gain two-dimensional representations and single grid point time series. Mean LLT fields for different months and times of the day provide highly resolved spatial and temporal information on temperature fields over basins and valleys i.e., the main settlement areas in mountainous terrain. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,"air temperature; climatology; complex terrain; orographic effect; orography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35449007602

Yet this notion of 'earth system management' remains vaguely defined: It is too elusive for natural scientists, and too ambitious or too normative for social scientists. In this article, I develop an alternative concept that is better grounded in social science theory: 'earth system governance'. I introduce, first, the concept of earth system governance as a new social phenomenon, a political programme and a crosscutting theme of research in the field of global environmental change. I then sketch the five key problem structures that complicate earth system governance, and derive from these four overarching principles for earth system governance as political practice, namely credibility, stability, adaptiveness, and inclusiveness. In the last part of the article, I identify five research and governance challenges that lie at the core of earth system governance as a crosscutting theme in global change research. These are the problems of the overall architecture of earth system governance, of agency beyond the state, of the adaptiveness of governance mechanisms and of their accountability and legitimacy, and of the modes of allocation in earth system governance-in short, the five A's of earth system governance research. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we focused our attention on its physical and chemical characteristics, its cytotoxicity, and its role in the induction of the volatile organic compound (VOC) and/or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-metabolizing enzymes in human lung epithelial cells (A549). Size distribution showed that 92.15% of the collected PM were PM2.5 and the specific surface area was 1 m2/g. Inorganic (i.e. Fe, Al, Ca, Na, K, Mg, Pb, etc.) and organic (i.e. VOC, PAH, etc.) chemicals were found in collected PM, revealing that much of them derived from wind-borne dust from the industrial complex and the heavy motor vehicle traffic. The thermal desorption study indicated that organic chemicals were not only adsorbed onto the surface but also highly incrusted in the structure of PM. The lethal concentrations at 10% and 50% of collected PM were 23.72 μg/mL (or 6.33 μg/cm2) and 118.60 μg/mL (or 31.63 μg/cm2), respectively. The VOC and/or PAH-coated onto PM induced significant increases in mRNA expressions of cytochrome P450 (cyp) 1a1, cyp2e1, cyp2f1, nadph quinone oxydo-reductase-1, and glutathione s-transferase-pi 1, versus controls. Hence, we concluded that the metabolic activation of the very low doses of VOC and/or PAH-coated onto the inorganic condensation nuclei from Dunkerque City's PM is one of the underlying mechanisms of action closely involved in its cytotoxicity in human lung epithelial cells. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The terpenes mostly emitted by both species were α-pinene, β-pinene, β-myrcene and Δ3-carene. P. halepensis emission rates (average 31.45 μg g-1 DM h -1) were similar to those of Q. ilex (average 31.71 μg g -1 DM h-1). The effects of drought (reduction to one-third of full watering) and fertilization (250 kg N ha-1, 250 kg P ha -1, or both) were different depending on the species: the drought treatment significantly increased the terpene emissions from Q. ilex by 33%, and the fertilization treatments reduced the terpene emissions from P. halepensis by 38%. Terpene emission rates increased with time course in parallel to raising summer temperatures in P. halepensis and Q. ilex, whose emission rates were temperature related (r = 0.42 and r = 0.68, respectively) and light related (r = 0.32 and r = 0.57, respectively). There was a positive relationship for P. halepensis, and a negative relationship for Q. ilex, between emission rates and relative water contents. No relationship was found between emission rates and N or P foliar concentrations.

Pronounced regional differences were found. Southeastern sites exhibited the lowest current mean concentrations of nitrate, and the smallest predicted responses of PM2.5 nitrate and mass concentrations to reductions of nitric acid, which is the principal reaction product of the oxidation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and the primary gas-phase precursor of fine particulate nitrate. Weak responses of PM2.5 nitrate and mass concentrations to changes in nitric acid levels occurred even if sulfate concentrations were half of current levels. The midwestern sites showed higher levels of fine particulate nitrate, characterized by cold-season maxima, and were projected to show decreases in overall PM levels following decreases of either sulfate or nitric acid. For some midwestern sites, predicted PM2.5 nitrate concentrations increased as modeled sulfate levels declined, but sulfate reductions always reduced the predicted fine PM mass concentrations; PM2.5 nitrate concentrations became more sensitive to reductions of nitric acid as modeled sulfate concentrations were decreased. The California sites currently have the highest mean concentrations of fine PM nitrate and the lowest mean concentrations of fine PM sulfate. Both the estimated PM2.5 nitrate and fine mass concentrations decreased in response to modeled reductions of nitric acid at all California sites. The results indicate important regional differences in expected PM2.5 mass concentration responses to changes in sulfate and nitrate precursors. Analyses of ambient data, such as described here, can be a key part of weight of evidence (WOE) demonstrations for PM2.5 attainment plans. Acquisition of the data may require special sampling efforts, especially for PM2.5 precursor concentration data.

As a contribution to ongoing studies in this regard, this paper investigates whether, over protracted periods during the 20th century, climate change occurred in two regions of southern Italy - Puglia and Sicilia. A twofold approach was adopted: firstly, climate long time series describing the thermopluviometric regimes of the two regions were examined for trends, using as a basis data on monthly rainfall (mm) and minimum/maximum temperature (°C). For Puglia, both the rainfall and temperature data used were those recorded at 21 stations during the period 1921-2001, whereas for Sicilia data recorded at 18 stations was used, however the rainfall data was for the period 1956-2000, while temperature data was for the period 1924-2003. Secondly, a comparison was made between the RIVAS-MARTINEZ ombrothermic indices for the two periods 1955-1985 and 1986-2000. Both regression-analysis results and RIVASs-MARTINEZ indices indicate an increase in aridity and thus a growing vulnerability to desertification. However, any climate change under way can be greatly influenced by local orographic systems, meaning that different trends may be found even at stations located relatively close to each other. There is no uniform pattern to the trends in climate change emerging from the statistical analyses undertaken here. Therefore local government planning needs to take account of factors at a global scale (at the level of the Mediterranean basin as a whole), as well as factors at a regional and local scale, which are more closely linked to specific geomorphological characteristics. © 2007 Gebrüder Borntraeger.","Climatic parameters; Desertification; Ombrothermic indices; Regression analysis; Sicilia and Puglia","aridity; climate change; desertification; environmental conditions; global warming; regression analysis; time series analysis; vulnerability; Eurasia; Europe; Italy; Puglia; Sicily; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42549103212

Disparate experimental and survey results have led to questions about the appropriate quality and quantity of C to apply. We conducted a single-season glasshouse experiment in three soil types to determine how the quality (sugar, sawdust, sugar + sawdust), quantity (1 and 5 kg sugar or sawdust/m2), and mode of application (surface applied or mixed into soil) of C affected soil inorganic N pools, net mineralization rates, and aboveground biomass of coexisting C3 and C4 plant species. Carbon applied as sawdust mixed into the soil resulted in the highest level of immobilization in the short term (6 weeks), but all combinations and rates of sugar and sawdust application resulted in immobilization over this period. In the long term (24 weeks), most amendments immobilized N and suppressed aboveground biomass of the C3 grass, Bromus inermis, but the high rate of sugar resulted in the strongest immobilization and C3 suppression. However, this treatment also maintained the highest soil inorganic N pool at season's end, which calls into question its effectiveness if longer-term benefits are desired. Neither net mineralization rates nor soil inorganic N pools were correlated to the ratio of C4 to C3 plant biomass at season's end indicating that the mechanisms for favorable plant response to C addition are not understood. © 2007 Society for Ecological Restoration International.","Managed grassland; Sawdust; Species coexistence; Sugar","aboveground biomass; carbon sequestration; coexistence; community response; inorganic nitrogen; mineralization; plant community; restoration ecology; Bromus; Bromus inermis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37249059788

However, carbon emissions outside the project boundary, which is commonly referred to as leakage, may reduce or negate the sequestration benefits. This study assessed leakage from carbon-sink projects that could potentially be implemented in the study area comprised of 11 sub-districts in the Batanghari District, Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. The study estimates the probability of a given land use/cover being converted into other uses/cover, by applying a logit model. The predictor variables were: proximity to the center of the land use area, distance to transportation channel (road or river), area of agricultural land, unemployment (number of job seekers), job opportunities, population density and income. Leakage was estimated by analyzing with and without carbon-sink projects scenarios. Most of the predictors were estimated as being significant in their contribution to land use cover change. The results of the analysis show that leakage in the study area can be large enough to more than offset the project's carbon sequestration benefits during the period 2002-2012. However, leakage results are very sensitive to changes of carbon density of the land uses in the study area. By reducing C-density of lowland and hill forest by about 10% for the baseline scenario, the leakage becomes positive. Further data collection and refinement is therefore required. Nevertheless, this study has demonstrated that regional analysis is a useful approach to assess leakage. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Carbon leakage; Carbon-sink projects; Logistic modeling; Mitigation","assessment method; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; environmental degradation; forest management; land cover; land use change; leakage; Asia; Batanghari; Eurasia; Indonesia; Jambi [Indonesia]; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347383167

In order to explain the charge-current transport, the effect of tunnelling and thermionic field emission together with the Schottky barrier lowering were considered taking into account the voltage drop on the quasi-neutral bulk region. The modified TFE model describes reverse I-V characteristics in the temperature range between 300 K and 360 K. An observed agreement between measured and simulated characteristics enabled us to determine the Schottky barrier height and specific resistance of the SI GaAs base from the theoretical simulation. The results of calculated resistivities are compared with resistivities determined by the van der Pauw method. The value of the Schottky barrier height is in good agreement with the previously published data. A much higher value of the calculated ohmic current compared to the current corresponding to the diode structure at a low bias/current region is revealed. A detected difference increases with increasing temperature. This fact led us to conclude that the current in the linear part of the I-V characteristics in the low bias region does not correspond to the ohmic transport, being linear; that is, in contradiction with the more generally considered view. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Current voltage characteristics; Electron transport properties; Schottky barrier diodes; Semiconducting gallium arsenide; Ultraviolet radiation; Quasi-neutral bulk region; Specific resistance; Theoretical simulation; Photodetectors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547237901

As a basis for the prediction of wetland methane emissions at regional scales, we coupled the variable infiltration capacity macroscale hydrological model (VIC) with the biosphere-energy-transfer-hydrology terrestrial ecosystem model (BETHY) and a wetland methane emissions model to make large-scale estimates of methane emissions as a function of soil temperature, water table depth, and net primary productivity (NPP), with a parameterization of the sub-grid heterogeneity of the water table depth based on TOPMODEL. We simulated the methane emissions from a 100km × 100km region of western Siberia surrounding the Bakchar Bog, for a retrospective baseline period of 1980-1999 and have evaluated their sensitivity to increases in temperature of 0-5 °C and increases in precipitation of 0-15%. The interactions of temperature and precipitation, through their effects on the water table depth, played an important role in determining methane emissions from these wetlands. The balance between these effects varied spatially, and their net effect depended in part on sub-grid topographic heterogeneity. Higher temperatures alone increased methane production in saturated areas, but caused those saturated areas to shrink in extent, resulting in a net reduction in methane emissions. Higher precipitation alone raised water tables and expanded the saturated area, resulting in a net increase in methane emissions. Combining a temperature increase of 3 °C and an increase of 10% in precipitation to represent climate conditions that may pertain in western Siberia at the end of this century resulted in roughly a doubling in annual emissions. © IOP Publishing Ltd.","Bakchar; BETHY; Bog; Climate; Heterogeneity; Hydrology; Methane; Model; Peatland; Sensitivity; Siberia; Spatial distribution; TOPMODEL; Topographic wetness index; Vasyugan; VIC; Wetland","Climate change; Climate models; Ecosystems; Groundwater; Hydrology; Models; Solute transport; Spatial distribution; Wetlands; Bakchar; BETHY; Bog; Climate; Heterogeneity; Peatland; Sensitivity; SIBERIA; TOPMODEL; Topographic wetness index; Vasyugan; VIC; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37649022439

The EU ETS will be linked to a Kyoto emissions market where greenhouse gas emission allowances of signatory Kyoto countries can be traded. In this paper we investigate the implications of Russian market power for environmental effectiveness and regional compliance costs to the Kyoto Protocol taking into account potential linkages between the Kyoto emissions market and the EU ETS. We find that Russia may have incentives to join the EU ETS as long as the latter remains relatively separated from the Kyoto international emissions market. In this case, Russia can exert monopolistic price discrimination between two separated markets thereby maximizing revenues from hot air sales. The EU will be able to substantially reduce compliance costs if it does not restrain itself to EU-internal emission regulation schemes. However, part of the gains from extra-EU emissions trading will come at the expense of environmental effectiveness as (more) hot air will be drawn in. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Climate policy; Hot air; Market power","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Marketing; Public policy; Regulatory compliance; Climate policy; Hot air; Internal emission regulation; Market power; Climate change; assessment method; emissions trading; environmental policy; European Union; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; quantitative analysis; Eurasia; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36248953735

The goal is to mitigate the severe interference effects that arise at interfaces or free boundaries when using standard nonequilibrium MD shock wave approaches. The essence of the method is to capture between two fixed pistons the material state at the precise instant in time when the shock front, initiated by a piston with velocity up at one end of the target sample, traverses the contiguous boundary between the target and a second, stationary piston located at the opposite end of the sample, at which point the second piston is also assigned velocity up and the simulation is continued. Thus, the target material is captured in the energy-volume Hugoniot state resulting from the initial shock wave, and can be propagated forward in time to monitor any subsequent chemistry, plastic deformation, or other time-dependent phenomena compatible with the spatial scale of the simulation. For demonstration purposes, we apply the method to shock-induced chemistry in methane based on the adaptive intermolecular reactive empirical bond order force field. © 2007 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37249004330

Although there have been repeated suggestions that reduction of black carbon could be a viable part of decreasing global warming, it has not yet been considered when choosing actions to reduce climatic impact. In this paper, I examine four conceptual barriers to the consideration of aerosols in global agreements. I conclude that some of the major objections to considering aerosols under hemispheric or global agreements are illusory because: (1)a few major sources will be addressed by local regulations, but the remainder may not be addressed by traditional air quality management; (2)climate forcing by carbon particles is not limited to 'hot spots' - about 90% of it occurs at relatively low concentrations; (3)while aerosol science is complex, the most salient characteristics of aerosol behavior can be condensed into tractable metrics including, but not limited to, the global warming potential; (4)despite scientific uncertainties, reducing all aerosols from major sources of black carbon will reduce direct climate warming with a very high probability.

This study aims to characterize these carbonate ores by means of their mineralogy and geochemistry, which has also been extended to the host rocks of mineralization and other local carbonate rock types, including the prominent travertines in the Angouran district, as well as to the local spring waters. Petrographical, chemical, and stable isotope (O, H, C, Sr) data indicate that the genesis of the Zn carbonate ores at Angouran is fairly distinct from that of other ""classical"" nonsulfide Zn deposits that formed entirely by supergene processes. Mineralization occurred during two successive stages, with the zinc being derived from a preexisting sulfide ore body. A first, main stage of Zn carbonates (stage I carbonate ore) is associated with both preexisting and subordinate newly formed sulfides, whereas a second stage is characterized by supergene carbonates (Zn and minor Pb) coexisting with oxides and hydroxides (stage II carbonate ore). The coprecipitation of smithsonite with galena, pyrite and arsenopyrite, as well as the absence of Fe- and Mn-oxides/hydroxides and of any discernible oxidation or dissolution of the sphalerite-rich primary sulfide ore, shows that the fluids responsible for the main, stage I carbonate ores were relatively reduced and close to neutral to slightly basic pH with high fCO2. Smithsonite δ18OVSMOW values from stage I carbonate ore range from 18.3 to 23.6‰, while those of stage II carbonate ore show a much smaller range between 24.3 and 24.9‰. The δ13C values are fairly constant in smithsonite of stage I carbonate ore (3.2-6.0‰) but show a considerable spread towards lower δ13CVPDB values (4.6 to -11.2‰) in stage II carbonate ore. This suggests a hypogene formation of stage I carbonate ore at Angouran from low-temperature hydrothermal fluids, probably mobilized during the waning stages of Tertiary-Quaternary volcanic activity in an environment characterized by abundant travertine systems throughout the whole region. Conversely, stage II carbonate ore is unambiguously related to supergene weathering, as evidenced by the absence of sulfides, the presence of Fe-Mn-oxides and arsenates, and by high δ18 O values found in smithsonite II. The variable, but still relatively heavy carbon isotope values of supergene smithsonite II, suggests only a very minor contribution by organic soil carbon, as is generally the case in supergene nonsulfide deposits. © Springer-Verlag 2007.","Angouran; Iran; Nonsulfide zinc; Smithsonite; Stable isotopes","carbonate rock; geochemistry; host rock; hydrothermal fluid; mineral deposit; mineralization; mineralogy; ore mineral; petrography; stable isotope; supergene process; travertine; zinc; Asia; Eurasia; Iran; Middle East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35448960799

Rules-of-thumb state that precipitation below 300-400 mm per year or an annual coefficient of variation above 30% makes non-equilibrium dynamics likely. These have not been well tested. Three applications of an integrative model to African ecosystems were modified so that each modeled twenty 50 km2 parcels and a single population, cattle. Precipitation histories were altered so that annual rainfall varied from 100 to 1000 mm and coefficients of variation from 0% to 60%, and simulations run. For populations that did not collapse, density dependence was quantified. In two sites under their average rainfall, the frequency of density independence increased as rainfall variation increased, but in the most forested of the three sites, the pattern was opposite. There, a transition sometimes occurred where tree cover increased, increasing competition for grasses and density dependence in cattle. Overall, results were heterogeneous, with dynamics sensitive to traits in parcels and subtle climate changes. The rules-of-thumb should not be applied indiscriminately. Simulations suggest annual precipitation and its variability cannot be directly linked to likely dynamics of ungulates within arid and semi-arid African systems. © 2007.","Coefficient of variation; Density dependence; Ecosystem modeling; Non-equilibrium; Precipitation; Savanna","cattle; climate change; competition (ecology); density dependence; ecological modeling; grazing; population dynamics; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; rangeland; ungulate; Africa; Bos; Poaceae; Ungulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248146444

Brazil remains challenged in regard to a number of social issues, notably poverty reduction in isolated areas, where access to electricity is as poor as their population. In the Amazonian region, most people have no access to electricity, or else have only a precarious supply. Due to several economic and technical reasons, many cities have old, inefficient diesel generators. In such a scenario, CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) can be an instrument both to mitigate climate change and to promote sustainable development in these remote areas, thereby contributing to the achievement of the MDGs in Brazil. However, CDM implementation in Brazil is still restricted to a few types of projects (such as sugar cane bagasse cogeneration and landfill gas use), mostly proposed by big companies and hardly ever directed to the Amazon region. The main objectives of this article are to assess the potential of CDM as a possible tool to promote electricity access to the poor rural population in the Amazonian region, and to discuss the main reasons why it has not become a reality so far. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climate change; Economic and social effects; Population dynamics; Project management; Sustainable development; Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); Electricity access; Energy services; UN Millennium Development Goals (MDG); Energy policy; clean development mechanism; climate change; environmental economics; Millenium Development Goal; poverty alleviation; rural area; sustainable development; Amazonia; Brazil; South America; Saccharum",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547590298

The analysis of the atmospheric flow within the discharging berth was carried out in the Wind Tunnel Laboratory of the Department of Environment and Planning, at the University of Aveiro (Portugal). Laser sheet and hot wire anemometry techniques were applied. Two possible solutions were proposed, consisting in the use of windbreaks located upwind of the scrap-metal piles and a barrier of containers positioned downwind. Both flow visualisation and velocity-measuring techniques confirm a higher efficiency in the reduction of suspended particulate matter by using the containers plus the windbreaks. This combined solution is responsible for an important reduction on the emissions from the scrap-metal piles under typical meteorological conditions for this area, offering a good compromise between cost, time needed for implementation and efficiency. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Indoor air pollution can consist of chemical, biological, and particulate irritants. Vinyl products have been shown to be well suited with respect to indoor air criteria as defined in current standards and ""green"" building guidelines. People spend more that 80% of their time indoors. Measurements have shown that levels of some indoor air contaminants can be many times higher than those outdoors. Known sources and factors for poor indoor air quality include tobacco smoke, radon, microbial contamination, dust, pet dander, fibers, and particulates. But they seem to be secondary to public concern for chemical emissions from products. Concerns of health effects from certain chemical air pollutants at even very low concentrations (parts per billion) in the workplace and the home have driven suppliers to test their products for emissions in order to assess the impact of those products on indoor air quality. Technology and methods to evaluate the indoor air performance of products have advanced over the past decade. State, federal, and green building rating guidelines with health-based exposure limits have evolved both domestically and globally. At the same time, the use of vinyl as a replacement for traditional materials and products in the building and construction sector continues to grow. New uses such as vinyl decking and rail, vinyl moldings and trims, along with new flooring and wall covering designs, have increased the use of vinyl in both exteriors and interiors of buildings. Product manufacturers' attention to impacts of products on indoor air quality has resulted in the development of new innovative vinyl compounds and new installation methods. Taken together, these improvements allow vinyl products to meet and exceed even the evolving target for product performance from an indoor air quality perspective. Many of these products require less maintenance and cleaning, thus resulting in lowering of indoor pollutants. Although technical successes have evolved, commercial success will depend on a conscientious consumer. © 2007 Society of Plastics Engineers.",,"Air quality; Building materials; Dust; Impurities; Particulate emissions; Smoke; Vinyl resins; Installation methods; Particulate irritants; Product manufacturer; Vinyl compounds; Indoor air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748853187

This paper takes advantage of concepts first presented in a paper by Meng et al. (2003; Mitigation Adaptation Strategies Global Change 8:371-403) by integrating C-sequestration objective functions in existing wood supply models. Carbon-stock calculations performed in Woodstock™ (RemSoft Inc.) are based on C yields generated from volume table data obtained from local Forest Development Survey plots and a series of wood volume-to-C content conversion factors specified in von Mirbach (2000). The approach is used to investigate the impact of three demonstration forest-management scenarios on the C budget in a 110,000 ha forest in south-central New Brunswick, Canada. Explicit demonstration scenarios addressed include (1) maximizing timber extraction either by clearcut or selection harvesting for greatest revenue generation, (2) maximizing total C storage in the forest landscape and in wood products generated from harvesting, and (3) maximizing C storage together with revenue generation. The level of clearcut harvesting was greatest for scenario 1 (≥15 × 104 m3 of wood and ≥943 ha of land per harvesting period), and least for scenario 2 (=0 m3 per harvesting period) where selection harvesting dominated. Because softwood saw logs were worth more than pulpwood ($60 m-3 vs. $40 m-3) and were strategic to the long-term storage of C, the production of softwood saw logs exceeded the production of pulpwood in all scenarios. Selection harvesting was generally the preferred harvesting method across scenarios. Only in scenario 1 did levels of clearcut harvesting occasionally exceed those of selection harvesting, mainly in the removal of old, dilapidated stands early in the simulation (i.e., during periods 1 through 3). Scenario 2 provided the greatest total C-storage increase over 80 years (i.e., 14 × 106 Mg C, or roughly 264 Mg ha -1) at a cost of $111 per Mg C due to lost revenues. Scenarios 3 and 1 produced reduced storage rates of roughly 9 × 106 Mg C and 3 × 106 Mg C, respectively; about 64% and 22% of the total, 80-year C storage calculated in scenario 2. The bulk of the C in scenario 2 was stored in the forest, amounting to about 76% of the total C sequestered. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Forest management planning; Goal programming; Growth and yield; Harvesting; Linear programming; Operational emissions; Optimization; Silviculture; Wood products","carbon sequestration; forest management; harvesting; linear programing; optimization; silviculture; wood; yield; Canada; New Brunswick; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447617840

Carbon finance has emerged as a potential policy option to tackling global climate change, degradation of forests, and social development in poor countries. This paper focuses on evaluating the socioeconomic impacts of a set of forest based mitigation pilot projects that emerged under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The paper reviews research conducted in 2001-2002, drawing from empirical data from four pilot projects, derived from qualitative stakeholder interviews, and complemented by policy documents and literature. Of the four projects studied three are located in frontier areas, where there are considerable pressures for conversion of standing forest to agriculture. In this sense, forest mitigation projects have a substantial role to play in the region. Findings suggest however, that all four projects have experienced cumbersome implementation processes specifically, due to weak social objectives, poor communication, as well as time constraints. In three out of four cases, stakeholders highlighted limited local acceptance at the implementation stages. In the light of these findings, we discuss opportunities for implementation of future forest based mitigation projects in the land use sector. © 2007.","Forest based mitigation; Stakeholders; Sustainable development","carbon; agriculture; agroforestry; article; Bolivia; Brazil; climate change; conservation biology; deforestation; environmental change; forest management; global climate; interview; land use; pilot study; policy; priority journal; qualitative analysis; reforestation; research; social evolution; socioeconomics; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447558462

However, over time, the United States has refused to join concerted international efforts - such as the Kyoto Protocol - to curb human activities contributing to climate change. US newspaper and television media constitute key influences among a set of complex dynamics shaping information dissemination in this politicized environment. Mass-media coverage of climate change is not simply a random amalgam of newspaper articles and television segments; rather, it is a social relationship between scientists, policy actors and the public that is mediated by such news packages. This paper demonstrates that consistent adherence to interacting journalistic norms has contributed to impediments in the coverage of anthropogenic climate change science. Through analysis of US newspaper and television coverage of human contributions to climate change from 1988 through 2004, this paper finds that adherence to first-order journalistic norms - personalization, dramatization, and novelty - significantly influence the employment of second-order norms - authority-order and balance - and that this has led to informationally deficient mass-media coverage of this crucial issue. By critically scrutinizing US print and television media as a 'public arena,' we improve understanding of how journalistic activities have shaped interactions at the interface with climate science, policy and the public. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A number of climate-related threats to both capture fisheries and aquaculture are identified, but we have low confidence in predictions of future fisheries production because of uncertainty over future global aquatic net primary production and the transfer of this production through the food chain to human consumption. Recent changes in the distribution and productivity of a number of fish species can be ascribed with high confidence to regional climate variability, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Future production may increase in some high-latitude regions because of warming and decreased ice cover, but the dynamics in low-latitude regions are governed by different processes, and production may decline as a result of reduced vertical mixing of the water column and, hence, reduced recycling of nutrients. There are strong interactions between the effects of fishing and the effects of climate because fishing reduces the age, size, and geographic diversity of populations and the biodiversity of marine ecosystems, making both more sensitive to additional stresses such as climate change. Inland fisheries are additionally threatened by changes in precipitation and water management. The frequency and intensity of extreme climate events is likely to have a major impact on future fisheries production in both inland and marine systems. Reducing fishing mortality in the majority of fisheries, which are currently fully exploited or overexploited, is the principal feasible means of reducing the impacts of climate change. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Fisheries; Net primary production","aquaculture; biodiversity; climate change; Crustacea; ecosystem; environmental impact; fish; fishery; fishery management; food chain; geographic distribution; global climate; marine environment; mollusc; mortality; nonhuman; plankton; precipitation; priority journal; review; salmon; seasonal variation; water management; Animals; Aquaculture; Climate; Fisheries; Fishes; Forecasting; Greenhouse Effect; Humans",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38049129050

In ""real world"" scenarios, coal mining worldwide, at 4.3 bt in 2000, is expected to double by 2030 due mainly to demand from electricity generators. Investments would allow the industry to replicate productivity gains of 10% to 15% per year also in the future, thereby strengthening coal's traditional price competitiveness. Beyond 2030, mining growth would continue, pulled by ever increasing demand for power, particularly in developing countries. Most interestingly, a coal-based synfuels market is likely to develop. Dedicated mines would be integrated part of conglomerates active in chemical processing and synfuels trading. There are safety problems and inadequate environmental legislation and enforcement in a number of developing and transition economies. However, the main issue is less sustainable coal mining, but sustainable coal use. Raising combustion efficiencies from present world average to present state of the art would already reduce emissions by 22%, - an achievement attained by no other CO 2 mitigation technology. Subsequently carbon ought and could be captured and stored, with the potential of another 30% reduction of CO2 emissions by 2050. Modern mining and combustion technologies should be deployed in emerging coal nations, if necessary on a preferential basis. Nothing would occur by itself: Governmental coal policies would have to be market-oriented, acknowledge the role of coal in socio-economic development and support its RD&amp;D effort to achieve sustainability. The coal mining and coal-based power industries would have to become more pro-active in adopting modern management practices and technologies, particularly in developing countries.

Valence band (VB) and band gap photoemission spectra were monitored under separate oxygen, water and carbon monoxide exposures (100 L) at different activation temperatures within the range utilized for chemiresistive gas sensors (160-450 °C). Large changes in photoemission response within the whole VB were observed for all gases. Regular shifts of the valence band edge relative to the Fermi energy were found under gas exposures on two kinds of surface (partially reduced or partially oxidized), and are interpreted as changes of surface potential. Treatments in oxygen resulted in upward band bending (∼0.5 eV at T = 320 °C). Regardless of activation temperature, treatments in water resulted in downward band bending, but with small changes (&lt;0.1 eV). Reduction properties of carbon monoxide were observed only at high temperatures of T ≥ 370 °C. At temperatures of 160 and 250 °C unusual ""oxidizing"" behavior of CO was observed with upward band bending of ∼0.7 eV (160 °C). Oxidizing and reducing effects of the gas interactions with the (1 1 1) In2O3 surface in all cases were accompanied by a corresponding behavior, i.e., a decrease or increase in photoemission response from so-called defect states in the band gap near the top of the valence band. The increases of photoemission within a band gap with maxima at binding energies (BE) of 0.4 (O2-induced peak) and 1.0 eV (CO-induced peak) were, respectively, found for interactions with O2 and CO for low temperatures (T = 160 and 250 °C). These responses were ascribed to acceptor-like electronic levels of O2 and CO chemisorption states, respectively. A definite split of the top VB peak (BE ∼ 4.0 eV) was found under CO dosing at 160 °C. Established knowledge of the CO interaction with the (1 1 1) In2O3 surface explains earlier revealed acceptor-like behavior of In2O3 film conductivity during CO detection at operational temperatures lower than 250 °C through the formation of acceptor-like electronic levels of adsorbed CO molecules. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

So far, the debate has focused on creating a security 'hook', illustrated by anecdote, to invest climate negotiations with a greater sense of urgency. Political momentum behind the idea of climate change as a security threat has progressed quickly, even reaching the United Nations Security Council. This article reviews the linkages between climate change and security in Africa and analyses the role of climate change adaptation policies in future conflict prevention. Africa, with its history of ethnic, resource and interstate conflict, is seen by many as particularly vulnerable to this new type of security threat, despite being the continent least responsible for global greenhouse gas emissions. Projected climatic changes for Africa suggest a future of increasingly scarce water, collapsing agricultural yields, encroaching desert and damaged coastal infrastructure. Such impacts, should they occur, would undermine the 'carrying capacity' of large parts of Africa, causing destabilizing population movements and raising tensions over dwindling strategic resources. In such cases, climate change could be a factor that tips fragile states into socio-economic and political collapse. Climate change is only one of many security, environmental and developmental challenges facing Africa. Its impacts will be magnified or moderated by underlying conditions of governance, poverty and resource management, as well as the nature of climate change impacts at local and regional levels. Adaptation policies and programmes, if implemented quickly and at multiple scales, could help avert climate change and other environmental stresses becoming triggers for conflict. But, adaptation must take into account existing social, political and economic tensions and avoid exacerbating them. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/The Royal Institute of International Affairs.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35548977147

A discussion based on the available literature is supplemented by a survey assessing concerns about water and the quality and usability of climate and hydrologic information available to water managers and communities. The surveys indicate that the central concern for urban residents is the lack of reliable potable water due to frequent service breakdowns-with climate change and variability, specifically drought and high temperatures, as contributing factors. Water managers desire appropriate meteorological and hydrologic information to improve planning strategies, but access to this information remains limited. Considerable disagreement exists about who should pay for previously free or low-cost water and wastewater treatment. Urban users have little incentive to conserve because of the present flat, low rate and frustration with service.

We evaluate methods used in the first randomized exposure study of pollution indoors and respiratory effects (RESPIRE): a controlled trial testing the impact of reduced indoor air pollution on ALRI, conducted among children ≤ 18 months in rural Guatemala. Methods: Case-finding used weekly home visits by fieldworkers trained in integrated management of childhood illness methods to detect ALRI signs such as fast breathing. Blindness was maintained by referring cases to study physicians working from community centres. Investigations included oxygen saturation (SaO2), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antigen test and chest X-ray (CXR). Findings: Fieldworkers referred &gt; 90% of children meeting ALRI criteria, of whom about 70% attended a physician. Referrals for cough without respiratory signs and self-referrals contributed 19.0% and 17.9% of physician-diagnosed ALRI cases respectively. Intervention group attendance following ALRI referral was 7% higher than controls, a trend also seen in compliance with RSV tests and CXR. There was no evidence of bias by intervention status in fieldworker classification or physician diagnosis. Incidence of fieldworker ALRI (1.12 episodes/child/year) is consistent with high sensitivity and low specificity; incidence of physician-diagnosed ALRI (0.44 episodes/child/year) is consistent with comparable studies. Conclusion: The combination of case-finding methods achieved good sensitivity and specificity, but intervention cases had greater likelihood of reaching the physician and being investigated. There was no evidence of bias in fieldworkers' classifications despite lack of concealment at home visits.

We studied water relations, plant development, and carbon isotope composition of bigtooth maples indigenous to New Mexico, Texas, and Utah that were field-grown in New Mexico using a pot-in-pot nursery production system. Plants were maintained as well-irrigated controls or irrigated after the weight of pots decreased by 35% due to evapotranspiration. Bigtooth maples subjected to drought had more negative predawn leaf water potentials (0.76 MPa) than the plants in the control treatment (-0.64 MPa). Drought did not affect midday leaf water potential of seed sources. Trees native to the Lost Maples State Natural Area in Vanderpool, TX (designated LMP5), had the greatest leaf area (1236 cm2) among plants from all sources, while those native to Logan Canyon in Cache County, UT (designated UW2), had among the smallest leaf area (216 cm2). Leaf area ratio (LAR) was highest in plants from LMP5 (24.23 cm2·g-1), which suggests that they have potential for more carbon assimilation than the other plants tested. Plants from LMP5 had the highest leaf area/xylem diameter ratio (135 cm -2·mm-1). This ratio was 5.8 times higher than that of UW2, which had among the lowest leaf area/xylem diameter ratios. The high leaf area/xylem diameter ratio of LMP5 plants relative to UW2 plants indicates that LMP5 plants had a larger surface area of tissues that transpire relative to those that transport water. Treatment did not affect stomatal conductance (gs) or transpiration, but gs and transpiration were positively correlated for both drought-stressed (r2 = 0.801) and well-irrigated plants (r2 = 0.759). Plants from New Mexico (designated DS) had the lowest transpiration rate (2.32 mmol·m -2·s-1), lowest gs (52.1 mmol·m-2·s-1), largest xylem diameter (11 mm), and had among the largest shoot dry weight (DW) and plant height. Plants did not differ either among sources or between treatments in the ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence (mean = 0.64), relative water content (averaged 57%), specific leaf weight, stem DW, root DW, and plant DW. Carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) averaged 26.53‰ and did not differ among plant sources or irrigation treatments. This suggests that Δ might not be effective in screening bigtooth maples for drought tolerance. Low transpiration rate, gs, and high shoot dry weight in DS plants and traits, such as a high LAR in plants from LMP5, suggest that plants selected from these provenances might effectively endure deficit irrigation.","Acer grandidentatum; Carbon isotope discrimination; Water relations; Woody ornamentals","Carbon; Growth kinetics; Isotopes; Plants (botany); Water content; Acer grandidentatum; Carbon isotope discrimination; Water relations; Woody ornamentals; Hardwoods; Acer; Carbon; Isotopes; Moisture Content; Plants; Acer; Acer grandidentatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447644408

Most of the studies found are restricted to particular species or claim to present community attributes. Therefore they often lack information for the evaluation of evolutionary evidence and historical contingency of the local fire regime and other abiotic conditions, which may act as selective pressure for plant regeneration strategies. Indeed, knowledge about the success of regeneration mechanisms and their interrelation with ecological factors is essential for the interpretation of the high spatio-temporal variability found in post-fire species performance. Such knowledge would be necessary to assess the potential of different regeneration mechanisms to cope with ongoing land-use and climate change-a crucial scientific challenge. A summary is given of the knowledge about the limits and potential of plant regeneration mechanisms after fire in the Mediterranean Basin, along with corresponding studies conducted in other parts of the world with similar climatic conditions in order to present the fullest possible picture. Moreover, the positive or negative impacts of particular parameters of a fire regime on different regeneration strategies (post-fire seeders, resprouters, and facultative resprouters) are explained and discussed in the light of published literature.

Annex VI of the international Marpol-convention, regulating the emissions of CFCs, Halons, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from cargoes, emissions from incinerators and exhaust gas emissions from engines (NOx and SOx) entered into force in May 2005. The International Maritime Organization is currently discussing an upgrade of the air pollution issues covered by Annex VI and some that are not in Annex VI, such as greenhouse gas emissions. CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas emitted by ship. Fuel consumption by the world merchant fleet is expected to grow to between 250-300 million tons per year with corresponding CO2 emissions of 800-960 million tons per year. In Western Europe land based measures have reduced sulphur emissions substantially, leaving shipping as an important remaining source of these emissions. Average sulphur content of heavy fuel oils is 3%, with a limit of 4.5% imposed by Annex VI. Both the Baltic- and the North Sea have the status of SOx emission control area, limiting sulphur content to 1.5%. A significant reduction of the emissions of sulphur oxides from ships is technically possible. One way is to reduce the sulphur content in heavy fuels, but there are several drawbacks. The first is that many refineries do not have the facility to produce low sulphur fuels in large quantities. They may have to invest in new installations, which takes time. The second is that desulphurization costs a lot of energy. There is a penalty in the form of additional CO2 emissions from the refineries. The third is that investing in desulphurization may be less attractive than in investing to produce more light products. Other ways to reduce SOx emissions are the use of low sulphur distillates or exhaust gas cleaning. As to NOx emissions it is believed that new technologies allow a further stepwise reduction of these emissions. Regulations may follow what is feasible. For VOCs, so far Annex VI provides for the possibility to address these emissions (cargo vapours) from ships. There is a tendency to use the possibility and actually reduce these emissions. New elements may enter Annex VI in due course. Addressing particulate matter and PAH's may be among these. Local air quality in some ports provokes looking at all kinds of possibilities to reduce local air pollution. Again ships' emissions are becoming relatively more important as land based emissions are diminishing. In growing economies, more shipping also means more ship based pollution in absolute figures. ""Cold ironing"", i.e. electric power from shore based plants to ships (instead of power supply by the ships' diesel generators) is among the possibilities that have been discussed during the last 10 years. It remains to be seen if this issue will at the stage of practical application on a large scale. © 2007 World Maritime University.","Exhaust gas Emissions; International Maritime Organization (IMO); MARPOL Annex VI; Shipping Emissions; Sulphur in Heavy Fuel Oil",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880964670

Changes in the magnitude and intensity of precipitation and the timing of runoff will increase riverine flooding, including the occurrence of midwinter ice-jam floods in northern rivers. Higher sea levels will increase the likelihood of coastal flooding and problems with urban infrastructure draining to tidal estuaries. Unless action is taken to lessen the vulnerability of human settlements, flood damages will increase. Adaptation strategies are needed that identify and direct development away from flood-prone areas, and incorporate infrastructure design criteria that take a changing climate into account. In this paper, a methodological approach to developing strategies for flood management is presented. After considering the occurrence and potential consequences of floods, and the importance and means of flood management, the impacts of climate change on flood mitigation are considered. Key elements of a generic adaptive strategy for floodplain management are then proposed, and, finally, the implementation of a flood management program is discussed. © 2007 International Water Resources Association.","Adaptation; Climate change; Flooding; Strategy",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41949129123

At first blush, the two appear to be mere flip sides of the same federal power: The choice of a floor reflects a goal of minimizing risk, while ceilings reflect concern with excessively stringent regulation. This Article argues, however, that these two regulatory choices are fundamentally different in their institutional implications. Floors embrace additional and more stringent state and common law action, while ceilings are better labeled a ""unitary federal choice"" due to how they preclude any other regulatory choice by state regulators and also eliminate the possibility of the different actors, incentives, and modalities of information elicitation and proof that common law settings provide. Advocates of free markets respond that this is precisely the idea - regulatory certainty is enhanced with a unitary federal choice, allowing manufacturers to plan with confident knowledge of the regulatory terrain, unbuffeted by an array of uncoordinated actors. Debate over floors versus ceilings was, until recently, largely hypothetical, due to the rarity of federal imposition of ceilings. During the past year, however, in settings ranging from product approvals to regulation of risks posed by chemical plants to possible climate change legislation regarding greenhouse gases, legislators and regulators have embraced the broad, preemptive impact of unitary federal choice preemption. The federal action regarding such risks would be the final regulatory choice. But under what theory of regulation and legislation can one be confident that placing all decisionmaking power in one institution at one time will lead to appropriate standard setting? In fact, advocates of risk regulation, ""experimentalist regulation"" scholars, and skeptics about the likelihood of public-regarding regulation all call for attention to pervasive risks of regulatory failure. Agency and legislative inertia, information uncertainties and asymmetries, outdated information and actions, regulatory capture, and a host of other common regulatory risks create a substantial chance of poor or outdated regulatory choice. Considering these pervasive risks of regulatory failure, the principled distinctions between floor and ceiling preemption become apparent. Vesting all decisionmaking power in one institution can freeze regulatory developments. Unitary federal choice preemption is an institutional arrangement that threatens to produce poorly tailored regulation and public choice distortions of the political process, whether it is before the legislature or a federal agency. Floor preemption, in contrast, constitutes a partial displacement of state choice in setting a minimum level of protection, but leaves room for other actors and additional regulatory action. Floors anticipate and benefit from the institutional diversity they permit. This Article closes by showing how the institutional diversity engendered by retaining multiple layers of law and regulatory actors creates conditions conducive to reassessment and adjustment of rigid or outdated regulation.

To address this challenge, industrialized nations have ratified the Kyoto Protocol and undertaken commitments to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, the primary agents linked to anthropogenic alteration of earth's climate. By contrast, the US government, led by the Bush Administration, has rejected mandatory targets for curbing emissions under the Protocol, and has instead pursued voluntary mitigation measures amid a larger push for clean coal and ""next generation"" nuclear technologies. These actions in total have fueled global perceptions that the US is not acting in substantial ways to address climate change. Nevertheless, action within the US is indeed moving forward, with states, cities and regional partnerships filling the federal leadership vacuum.

The DGGE band patterns and sequencing analysis of characteristic DGGE bands revealed that the bacterial communities in Mn nodules were markedly different from those in the plow layer and subsoils. Three out of four common bands found in Mn nodules from two sites corresponded to Deltaproteobacteria and were characterized as sulfate-reducing and iron-reducing bacteria. The other DGGE bands of Mn nodules corresponded to sulfate and iron reducers (Deltaproteobacteria), methane-oxidizing bacteria (Gamma and Alphaproteobacteria), nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospirae) and Actinobacteria. In addition, some DGGE bands of Mn nodules showed no clear affiliation to any known bacteria.

With this, analyses on sector-based emissions reduction and mitigation options will provide the necessary information to form the debate. In order to assess the CO2 emissions reduction potential of China's electricity sector, this research employs three scenarios based on the ""long-range energy alternative planning system"" (LEAP) model to simulate the different development paths in this sector. The baseline scenario, the current policy scenario, and the new policy scenario seek to gradually increase the extent of industrial restructuring and technical advancement. Results imply that energy consumption and CO2 emission in China's electricity sector will rise rapidly in all scenarios until 2030-triple or quadruple the 2000 level; however, through structural adjustment in China's electricity sector, and through implementing technical mitigation measures, various degrees of abatement can be achieved. These reductions range from 85 to 350 million tons CO2 per year-figures that correspond to different degrees of cost and investment. Demand side management and circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) (ranked in order) are employed prior to use to realize emissions reduction, followed by supercritical plants and the renovation of conventional thermal power plants. In the long term, nuclear and hydropower will play the dominant role in contributing to emissions reduction. It is also suggested that a ""self-restraint"" reduction commitment should be employed to help contribute to the reduction of emission intensity, an avenue that is more practical for China in light of its current development phase. Setting the year 2000 as the base year, the intensity reduction target could possibly range from 4.2% to 19.4%, dependent on the implementation effectiveness of various mitigation options. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is applied to three large basins with aggregated climatic and agricultural conditions, and to five counties in Texas and California. The modeled results and assessed values in these study areas are compared. While the dependability of model outputs relies on empirical knowledge and judicious parameter estimation, the model remains reliable even for the significant level of uncertainty produced by subjectively predetermined major parameters. The model can be applied to retriving historical data for irrigated and rainfed crops; it can also be used for irrigated and rainfed agriculture planning based on climatic and technological projections.

The IA model consists of five sub-models for carbon sequestration, crop income, timber income, Grain for Green, and carbon credits. It also includes a complementary qualitative module for assessing program impacts by gender and ethnicity. Using four scenarios with various assumptions about types of trees planted, crop incomes by township, CO2 credit prices, state subsidies, methods for estimating carbon sequestered, and harvesting of trees, we find great variation in the impact of the Grain for Green program on incomes and on carbon sequestered over a 48 year period at both the county and township levels. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

So, the effect of different types of modifications of the chemical structure of PDIs in their spectral, electrochemical, and laser properties in both solution and PDI-doped polystyrene films at various concentrations has been investigated. In particular, we focused on controlling the wavelength of emission in order to tune the laser wavelength as well as in increasing the amount of PDI in the films in order to decrease the laser thresholds, while keeping a good photostability. Three types of modifications of the chemical structure were investigated: (a) symmetrical substitution at the imide nitrogen positions (PDI 1); (b) substitution at the bay positions in the PDI core (PDI 4); and (c) modification in the dicarboximide group (PDI 5). All three derivatives were soluble and showed good n-type acceptor ability. Routes b and c led to red shifts in the absorption and photoluminescence (PL) emission, although the PL quantum yield decreased considerably. Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) was observed in films doped with PDI 1 (A = 579 nm) and PDI 4 (A = 599 nm). The best performance, with an ASE threshold of 15 kW/cm2 and a photostability halflife of 31 × 103 pump pulses, was obtained for films doped with 0.75 wt % of PDI 1 (route 1). PDI 1-based materials are among the most photostable reported in the literature and show very-reasonable thresholds. Moreover, these materials are particularly interesting in the field of data communications based on polymer optical fibers because they emit at wavelengths close to 570 nm, which constitutes the second low-loss transmission window in poly(methyl methacrylate). © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Amplifiers (electronic); Derivatives; Electrochemical properties; Energy absorption; Optical fibers; Photoluminescence; Structure (composition); Wavelength; Imide nitrogen positions; Laser properties; Perylenediimide derivatives; Structural modifications; Solid state lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748906035

The system exploits a supersonic jet of oxygen to inject carbon particles into the slag. A precise characterization of the injection process by experimental analysis is extremely difficult and costly because of the complex chemico-physical mechanisms controlling transport, burn-out and devolatilization of carbon particles inside the oxidizing, high temperature environment of the electric arc furnace. In this work, we use numerical simulations to test and characterize injector performances for conditions corresponding to a 120 ton capacity electric furnace. We exploit the best available, state of the art numerical techniques to characterize the fluid-dynamics and chemico-thermal environment seen by carbon particles, which we couple to ad hoc research tools (Lagrangian tracking routines and complex chemistry schemes) to reproduce carbon consumption due to thermally and chemically controlled kinetics. These data are used to analyse the factors controlling injector performances, to identify a most critical configuration of the injector in the furnace and to obtain a conservative estimate of the injection yield of carbon particles. The performances of the injection device are evaluated in two different geometries and for three different types of carbon particles. Numerical results confirm that the supersonic injection promotes high injection yields: (i) by decreasing drastically the residence time of carbon particles inside the furnace and (ii) by modifying the hot reacting environment seen by carbon particles. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The models were developed for the period July 1998-June 2005 using appropriate meteorological and road traffic covariates. For all models, the complex and localised wind-flow patterns resulting from the street canyon location of the monitoring site, which can be difficult to model deterministically, have a large influence on the model predictions. It is shown that GAMs built using simple covariates explain a large amount of the daily variation for these pollutants (mean r2=0.86). It is found that concentrations of benzene and 1,3-butadiene have declined in line with detailed calculations of emissions trends, with some evidence to suggest that reductions in benzene have been greater than estimated reductions in emissions. Although measured concentrations of NOX have declined from 1998 to 2005, much of the decline appears to be associated with reductions in overall traffic and meteorological factors rather than reduced emissions of NOX. Unadjusted NOX trends show a 28.6% reduction (95% confidence interval from 21.2% to 35.8%) from 1998 to 2005, whereas meteorologically adjusted trends show a 19.3% decline (95% confidence interval from 14.8% to 23.5%) over this period. Analysis shows that there were a higher number of occasions in the early part of the time series that led to strong recirculation of exhaust emissions and higher NOX concentrations at this location, thus affecting observed trends in concentration. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Our objectives were to calibrate the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model, and evaluate its performance for simulating SOC fractions as affected by soil landscape and management. An automated parameter optimization procedure was used to calibrate the model for a site-specific experiment in the Coastal Plain of central Alabama. The ability of EPIC to predict corn (Zea mays L.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) yields and SOC dynamics on different soil landscape positions (summit, sideslope, and drainageway) during the initial period of conservation tillage adoption (5 yr) was evaluated using regression and mean squared deviations. Simulated yield explained 88% of measured yield variation, with the greatest disagreement on the sideslope position and the greatest agreement in the drainageway. Simulations explained approximately 1, 34, and 40% of the total variation in microbial biomass C (MBC), particulate organic C (POC), and total organic C (TOC), respectively. The lowest errors in TOC simulations (0-20 cm) were found on the sideslope and summit. We conclude that the automated parameterization was generally successful, although further work is needed to refine the MBC and POC fractions, and to improve EPIC predictions of SOC dynamics with depth. Overall, EPIC was sensitive to spatial differences in C fractions that resulted from differing soil landscape positions. The model needs additional refinement for accurate simulations of field-scale SOC dynamics affected by short-term management decisions. © Soil Science Society of America.",,"Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC); Greatest disagreement; Biomass; Calibration; Computer simulation; Drainage; Regression analysis; Soils; Organic carbon; Biomass; Calibration; Computer simulation; Drainage; Organic carbon; Regression analysis; Soils; cotton; environmental policy; maize; particulate organic carbon; soil carbon; soil management; Alabama; North America; United States; Gossypium hirsutum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447509588

The identity of active methanotrophs in Roscommon landfill cover soil, a slightly acidic peat soil, was assessed by DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP). Landfill cover soil slurries were incubated with 13C-labelled methane and under either nutrient-rich nitrate mineral salt medium or water. The identity of active methanotrophs was revealed by analysis of 13C-labelled DNA fractions. The diversity of functional genes (pmoA and mmoX) and 16S rRNA genes was analyzed using clone libraries, microarrays and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that the cover soil was mainly dominated by Type II methanotrophs closely related to the genera Methylocella and Methylocapsa and to Methylocystis species. These results were supported by analysis of mmoX genes in 13C-DNA. Analysis of pmoA gene diversity indicated that a significant proportion of active bacteria were also closely related to the Type I methanotrophs, Methylobacter and Methylomonas species.

Methods: Using geocoded school and residence locations of 151 709 children enrolled in the public school system, distribution functions of proximity to the nearest source are generated for each type of air pollution source in order to compare the exposure potential of white, Hispanic, and black children. Discrete buffer distances are utilised to provide quantitative comparisons for statistical testing. Main results: At any given distance from each type of pollution source, the cumulative proportion of Hispanic or black children significantly exceeds the corresponding proportion of white children, for both school and home locations. Regardless of race, however, a larger proportion of children are potentially exposed to air pollution at home than at school. Conclusions: This study addresses the growing need to consider both daytime and nighttime activity patterns in the assessment of children's exposure to environmental hazards and related health risks.

Striatal dopaminergic activity decreases with normal aging. Objective: To investigate the relationship between regional striatal dopaminergic denervation and sensory information integration important for balance in middle-aged and older adults. Methods: Community-dwelling subjects (N = 35; age 41-83) with no clinical diagnoses of conditions affecting balance underwent dynamic posturography testing (Sensory Organization Test/SOT) and C-11-beta-CFT dopamine transporter positron emission tomography. Results: Reduced ventral striatal dopamine was significantly correlated with increased anterior-posterior sway in three SOT conditions. Specifically, during quiet standing (SOT Conditions #1, 2) and when repeatedly to sway-referenced visual environments (SOT Condition #3, Trial #3), pre-synaptic dopaminergic denervation in the anteroventral striatum explained over 20-25% of the variability in sway magnitude above and beyond that explained by age (p ≤ 0.01). Striatal dopaminergic denervation did not impact balance in sway-referenced floor conditions. Conclusions: The SOT Condition #3 findings suggest that, in normal aging, the central ability to inhibit balance destabilizing vision-related postural control processes depends at least partially on striatal dopaminergic pathways. In contrast, striatal dopaminergic denervation does not appear to impair the ability to disengage destabilizing proprioceptive inputs and to trigger the vestibular control system during challenging sensory perturbations (SOT Conditions #4-6). Finally, quiet standing results (SOT Conditions #1, 2) justify the need to further investigate the impact of striatal dopaminergic denervation on the ability to tune muscle tone in healthy adults. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

It is difficult to comprehend operational knowledge without thorough study and long-term on site experiments. Fortunately, many sensors are installed in incineration plants and tremendous amounts of raw data about daily practices and system states are recorded to assist operations. Without proper analysis, however, these data are not beneficial to operators. An integrated approach is adopted in the current study using feature selection and data mining techniques. Feature selection was initially applied to cope with the heavy computation burden due to the huge data set. Data dimension can be reduced by discarding redundant information and leaving only relevant features for further analysis. Data mining analysis is then utilized to build two decision tree models based on steam production and NOx emission target attributes. Implicit incinerator system relations, represented by production rules and predicting accuracies, can be acquired from the decision tree models.

To probe the proton transfer during the enzyme reaction, we used mutagenesis, chemical rescue, and kinetic isotope effects to investigate the release of protons. The kinetic isotope effects of DV and D2OV for wild-type enzyme are 1 and 2.1 at pL 10.4 (where L represents H, 2H), respectively, and suggest a rate-limiting step in the intramolecular proton transfer. Substitution of alanine for Lys 159 changes the rate-limiting step to the hydride transfer, evidenced by an equal deuterium isotope effect of 1.8 on Vmax and V/K androsterone and no solvent kinetic isotope effect at saturating 3-(cyclohexylamino) propanesulfonic acid (CAPS). However, a value of 4.4 on Vmax is observed at 10 mM CAPS at pL 10.4, indicating a rate-limiting proton transfer. The rate of the proton transfer is blocked in the K159A and K159M mutants but can be rescued using exogenous proton acceptors, such as buffers, small primary amines, and azide. The Brønsted relationship between the log(V/Kd-baseEt) of the external amine (corrected for molecular size effects) and pKa is linear for the K159A mutant-catalyzed reaction at pH 10.4 (β = 0.85 ± 0.09) at 5 mM CAPS. These results show that proton transfer to the external base with a late transition state occurred in a rate-limiting step. Furthermore, a proton inventory on V/Et is bowl-shaped for both the wild-type and K159A mutant enzymes and indicates a two-proton transfer in the transition state from Tyr 155 to Lys159 via 2′-OH of ribose. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Catalyst activity; Enzymes; Mutagenesis; Oxidation; Proton transfer; Carbonyl reductase; Comamonas testosteroni; Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; Kinetic isotope; Bacteria; 3alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; alanine; ammonia; androstanedione; androsterone; azide; carbonyl reductase; ethanolamine; ethylamine; ethylenediamine; methylamine; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; propylamine; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; amino acid substitution; article; catalysis; chemical structure; Comamonas testosteroni; enzyme mechanism; Escherichia coli; mathematical computing; mutagenesis; pH; priority journal; proton transport; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Amino Acid Substitution; Androsterone; Bacterial Proteins; Catalysis; Comamonas testosteroni; Cyclohexylamines; Etiocholanolone; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; Kinetics; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutation, Missense; NAD; Protons; Comamonas testosteroni",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36349020969

It uses ATP or pyrophosphate for the phosphorylation of serine 46 of HPr and inorganic phosphate for the dephosphorylation of Ser(P)-46-HPr via a phosphorolysis reaction. HPrK/P is a hexameric protein kinase of a new type with a catalytic core belonging to the family of nucleotide-binding protein with Walker A motif. It exhibits no structural similarity to eukaryotic protein kinases. So far, HPrK/P structures have shown the enzyme in its phosphorylase conformation. They permitted a detailed characterization of the phosphorolysis mechanism. In the absence of a structure with bound nucleotide, we used the V267F mutant enzyme to assess the kinase conformation. Indeed, the V267F replacement was found to cause an almost entire loss of the phosphorylase activity of Lactobacillus casei HPrK/P. In contrast, the kinase activity remained conserved. To elucidate the structural alterations leading to this drastic change of activity, the x-ray structure of the catalytic domain of L. casei HPrK/P-V267F was determined at 2.6 Å resolution. A comparison with the structure of the wild type enzyme showed that the mutation induces conformation changes compatible with the switch from phosphorylase to kinase function. Together with nucleotide binding fluorescence measurements, these results allowed us to decipher the cooperative behavior of the protein and to gain new insights into the allosteric regulation mechanism of HPrK/P. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Bacteria; Carbon; Catalyst activity; Conformations; Phosphorylation; Allosteric regulation; Bifunctional enzymes; Dephosphorylation; Enzyme kinetics; bacterial enzyme; phosphorylase; phosphotransferase; allosterism; article; bacterial strain; bacterium mutant; carboxy terminal sequence; crystal structure; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; enzyme binding; enzyme conformation; enzyme degradation; enzyme mechanism; enzyme phosphorylation; enzyme regulation; enzyme structure; Lactobacillus casei; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein dephosphorylation; protein expression; protein purification; structure analysis; Adenosine Triphosphate; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; Carbon; Catalytic Domain; Crystallography, X-Ray; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Kinetics; Lactobacillus casei; Mutagenesis; Mutation; Phosphates; Phosphorylases; Phosphorylation; Protein Conformation; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Bacteria (microorganisms); Eukaryota; Lactobacillus casei; Posibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36848999708

The computation results are compared with the analogous calculated data on the heme dimers (heme) 2 0,+ . Computations show that for the (MC34H 32N4O4) 2 0,+ dimers, high-spin states are preferable. In these dimers, the rings are linked with each other by a pair of M-carbonyl bridges M⋯Ob=C(OH) and a pair of hydrogen bridges OHb⋯N. The calculated energies of dissociation D of the dimers into monomers point to a rather high stability of the dimers at the beginning of the 3d series (D 2.3-3.6 eV for M = Ti, V), which decreases rapidly as the atomic number of M increases (D 0.5 eV for M = Cr and 0.4 eV for (heme)2).

The trends in the behavior of the energetic and structural characteristics of the dimers (distances R(M-N), displacements of M atoms from the porphyrin ring plane, parameters of the carbonyl and hydrogen bridges, character of ring distortions, etc.), as well as in the spin density distribution between the metal atoms and the rings in the monomers MC34H32N4O 4 and dimers (MC34H32N4O 4)2 caused by their ionization and going along the 3d series, are examined. In the mixed dimer (FeC34H32N 4O4)(VC34H32N4O 4), the rings are linked by only one strong carbonyl bridge V⋯Ob=C(OH), with some contribution made by the neighboring hydrogen bridge.

An attempt was made to monitor CO2 levels in ambient air of Nagpur city at industrial, commercial and residential sites. In addition to this a remote sensing studies and biotic survey for floral biodiversity were carried out to study the green cover at respective sampling locations. The observations showed that the largest amount of CO2 occurred at night due to absence of photosynthesis and lowest concentration of CO2 was observed in the afternoon due to photosynthesis at its maximum level. The most pollution tolerant species found in Nagpur city are having higher Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI) value, which acts as a natural sink for CO2 sequestration. In case of commercial site the CO2 level is highest (366 ppm) because of lowest vegetation and vehicular pollution. The generation of database of CO2 concentration and floral biodiversity along with percentage of green cover helps to formulate the strategy for prevention of global worming phenomenon. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","CO2 sequestration; Greenhouse; Remote sensing; Vegetation","Air pollution; Biodiversity; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Air pollution tolerance index (APTI); Carbon dioxide sequestration; Environmental parameters; Environmental impact assessments; carbon dioxide; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; biodiversity; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); environmental monitoring; flora; urban area; vegetation cover; air analysis; air pollution; ambient air; article; biodiversity; controlled study; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; greenhouse; greenhouse effect; India; industrial area; night; photosynthesis; plant ecology; species difference; vegetation; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; India; Time Factors; Asia; Eurasia; India; Maharashtra; Nagpur; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36248994595

Sustainable development benefits could include reductions in air and water pollution through reduced fossil fuel use, especially coal, but also extend to improved water availabitity, reduced soil erosion and protected biodiversity. For social benefits, many projects would create employment opportunities in target regions or income groups and promote local energy self-sufficiency. Therefore, carbon abatement and sustainable development goals can be simultaneously pursued. Many options under the CDM could create significant co-benefits in developing countries, addressing local and regional environmental problems and advancing social goals.

A comparison with two other membrane biofilms using T-RFLP fingerprinting also revealed the dominance of Rhizobiales organisms. When pure culture RO biofilm isolates were cultivated aerobically in BIOLOG microplates, most Rhizobiales were metabolically versatile in their choice of carbon substrates. Nitrate reduction was observed in five RO isolates related to Castellaniella, Ochrobactrum, Stenotrophomonas, and Xanthobacter. Many of the key Rhizobiales genera including Bosea, Uchrobactrum, Shinella, and Rhodopseudomonas were detected by PCR to contain the nirK gene responsible for nitrite reductase activity. These findings suggest that Rhizobiales organisms are ecologically significant in membrane biofilm communities under both aerobic and anoxic conditions and may be responsible for biofouling in membrane separation systems. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Anoxic conditions; Membrane biofilms; Bacteria; Biofilms; Biofouling; Metabolism; Reverse osmosis; nitrate reductase; Bacteria; Biofilms; Biofouling; Metabolism; Reverse osmosis; anoxic conditions; biofilm; biofouling; community structure; membrane; nitrite; oxic conditions; polymerase chain reaction; rhizobacterium; article; bacterial gene; bacterium; bacterium culture; bacterium isolate; biofilm; biofouling; Bosea; Castellaniella; community structure; comparative study; enzyme activity; nirK gene; nonhuman; Ochrobactrum; polymerase chain reaction; restriction fragment length polymorphism; reverse osmosis; Rhizobiales; Rhodopseudomonas; Shinella; Stenotrophomonas; Xanthobacter; Biofilms; Carbon; Membranes, Artificial; Osmosis; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Rhizobiaceae; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Bosea (bacteria); Ochrobactrum; Rhizobiales; Rhodopseudomonas; Stenotrophomonas; Xanthobacter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447286415

METHODS: The rat convulsive model was induced by penicillin localized injected in rat cortex. The effects of SEE-CO2PP on the latency of seizure and changes of convulsive behaviors were investigated. The latency of epileptiform discharge, and frequency and amplitude of highest wave in cortex and hippocampus were recorded by using RM6240C multichannel physiological signal collection and analysis recorder. At the same time, the contents of glutamic acid (Glu), aspartic acid (Asp), glycine (Gly) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in hippocampus were determined with high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: SEE-CO2PP 15 and 30 g·kg-1, ig, prolonged the latent period of seizure and weakened the extent. SEE-CO2PP also prolonged the latent period of epileptiform discharge, reduced the frequency and decreased amplitude of the highest wave in both cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, SEE-CO2PP increased the content of GABA in hippocampus, but the levels of Gly, Asp and Glu had no obvious changes. CONCLUSION: SEE-CO2PP inhibits the epileptiform discharge and convulsive behaviors of convulsive model rats, which suggests SEE-CO2PP has anticonvulsive action.","Convulsions; Penicillin; Pinellia pedatisecta Schott","4 aminobutyric acid; anticonvulsive agent; aspartic acid; glutamic acid; glycine; Pinellia pedatisecta schott extract; plant extract; unclassified drug; animal model; anticonvulsant activity; Araceae; article; brain cortex; controlled study; convulsion; drug effect; electroencephalogram; epileptic discharge; high performance liquid chromatography; hippocampus; nonhuman; Penillia pedatisecta schott; rat; seizure; supercritical fluid extraction; Pinellia pedatisecta; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37549024974

Cyclic voltammogram of the poly(malachite green) film shows a redox couple with well-defined peaks. The redox response of the modified electrode was found to be depending on the pH of the contacting solution. The peak potentials were shifted to a less positive region with increasing pH and the dependence of the peak potential was found to be 56 mV per pH unit.

Using complementary MALDI- and ESI-based mass spectrometry, 57 unique proteins comprising tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, and other signaling proteins were detected to undergo differential phosphorylation during disease progression. Seven of these proteins (SPAG9, Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP), WBP2, NSFL1C, SLC4A7, CYFIP1, and RPS2) were validated to be novel tyrosine kinase substrates. SPAG9, TOLLIP, WBP2, and NSFL1C were further proven to be authentic targets of epidermal growth factor signaling and Iressa (gefitinib). A closer examination revealed that the expression of SLC4A7, a bicarbonate transporter, was down-regulated in 64% of the 25 matched normal and tumor clinical samples. The expression of TOLLIP in clinical breast cancers was heterogeneous with 25% showing higher expression in tumor compared with normal tissues and 35% showing the reverse trend. Preliminary studies on SPAG9, on the other hand, did not show differential expression between normal and diseased states. This is the first time SLC4A7 and TOLLIP have been discovered as novel tyrosine kinase substrates that are also associated with human cancer development. Future molecular and functional studies will provide novel insights into the roles of TOLLIP and SLC4A7 in the molecular etiology of breast cancer. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"cell protein; epidermal growth factor; gefitinib; protein tyrosine kinase; protein tyrosine phosphatase; toll interacting protein; unclassified drug; article; breast cancer; breast carcinogenesis; cancer growth; disease course; down regulation; drug targeting; human; human cell; human tissue; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; protein targeting; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Chromatography, Liquid; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Phosphorylation; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization; Substrate Specificity; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349062653

The reference oxide V2O5 has also been studied for comparison purposes. It is shown that the analysis of molecular ion emission yields valuable information on the surface elemental and phase composition. Increasing pH values while precipitating from aqueous precursor solutions are found to result in a monotonic variation of the surface composition, in a progressive hydroxylation of aluminium and vanadium and in an increasing dispersion of vanadium oxide species. SIMS data evaluated on the basis of Plog's valence model of molecular ion emission reveal reduced V 4+ states, the fraction of which is dependent on the pH value. The SIMS results are supported by XPS data. The enhancement of the catalytic activity in oxidative propane dehydrogenation over V-Al-O prepared at high precipitation pH is in good correlation with the measured surface characteristics.

In the present study, 6 N HCl hydrolysis and stable-carbon isotopic analysis (δ13C) were used to investigate labile and recalcitrant soil carbon pools and the translocation among these pools of sorghum residues isotopically labeled in the 1998-1999 Arizona Maricopa free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment, in which elevated CO2 (FACE: 560 μmol mol-1) and ambient CO2 (Control: 360 μmol mol-1) interact with water-adequate (wet) and water-deficient (dry) treatments. We found that on average 53% of the final soil organic carbon (SOC) in the FACE plot was in the recalcitrant carbon pool and 47% in the labile pool, whereas in the Control plot 46% and 54% of carbon were in recalcitrant and labile pools, respectively, indicating that elevated CO2 transferred more SOC into the slow-decay carbon pool. Also, isotopic mixing models revealed that increased new sorghum residue input to the recalcitrant pool mainly accounts for this change, especially for the upper soil horizon (0-30 cm) where new carbon in recalcitrant soil pools of FACE wet and dry treatments was 1.7 and 2.8 times as large as that in respective Control recalcitrant pools. Similarly, old C in the recalcitrant pool under elevated CO2 was higher than that under ambient CO2, indicating that elevated CO2 reduces the decay of the old C in recalcitrant pool. Mean residence time (MRT) of bulk soil carbon at the depth of 0-30 cm was significantly longer in FACE plot than Control plot by the averages of 12 and 13 yr under the dry and wet conditions, respectively. The MRT was positively correlated to the ratio of carbon content in the recalcitrant pool to total SOC and negatively correlated to the ratio of carbon content in the labile pool to total SOC. Influence of water alone on the bulk SOC or the labile and recalcitrant pools was not significant. However, water stress interacting with CO2 enhanced the shift of the carbon from labile pool to recalcitrant pool. Our results imply that terrestrial agroecosystems may play a critical role in sequestrating atmospheric CO2 and mitigating harmful CO2 under future atmospheric conditions.","δ13C; Elevated CO2; Mean residence time; SOC dynamics; Soil recalcitrant and labile carbon pools; Sorghum FACE","Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Hydrochloric acid; Hydrolysis; Organic carbon; Plants (botany); Mean residence time (MRT); Soil carbon; Sorghum; Translocation; Soils; agricultural ecosystem; ambient air; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon isotope; carbon sequestration; hydrochloric acid; hydrolysis; isotopic analysis; mitigation; residence time; soil carbon; soil horizon; sorghum; stable isotope; translocation; water stress; Arizona; Maricopa County; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250342677

A three-level nested simulation domain was established for facilitating the modeling study, and a GIS-based atmospheric pollutant emission database was constructed to provide important emission information for the Models-3/CMAQ model. After verification, the coupled modeling system was implemented to predict the hourly contribution ratios of various PM10 emission sources to Beijing's air quality during four representative months of January, April, August and October in the base year of 2002. It was found from the modeling results that three major sources (including fugitive industrial emissions, construction sites, and road dusts) presented a relatively high contribution to the PM10 pollution in Beijing, with the contribution ratios of 28.67%, 42.88%, 42.46% and 35.67% for spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. In addition, the impacts of emissions from two major industrial zones within Beijing on its air quality were quantified. Moreover, the coupled modeling system was applied to explore possible future PM10 concentration distributions in 2008 through two proposed emission sources reduction strategies. It was found that Beijing needs to take continual emission control efforts to comprehensively improve its air quality to the Class II level by 2008. The modeling results could provide sound decision making basis for developing effective air quality management strategies in the planning region. © 2006.","Air pollution; ARPS; Emission source contribution ratio; Modeling; Models-3/CMAQ; PM10","Air quality; Computer simulation; Database systems; Emission control; Quality management; Emission source contribution ratio; Modeling; Air pollution; air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; database; emission control; GIS; human activity; metropolitan area; modeling; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; Asia; Beijing [China]; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250752795

The stability of the perovskite structure under different treatments and the location of Pd were addressed by calcination at 600 and 800 °C and successive reduction in 10% H2/He to 300 and 600 °C. The as-prepared PdLCO exhibited a high surface area (ca. 100 m2/g). Palladium appeared to be finely dispersed on the FP material and was partially incorporated in the perovskite lattice. Calcination at 800 °C caused sintering and substantial incorporation of Pd at the B-site of the ABO3 framework. EXAFS revealed that the Pd{single bond}O distance was shorter than in PdO and further decreased with increasing calcination temperature, simultaneously with the appearance of a Pd-La contribution. The reduction process involved both Pd and Co. In the 100-300 °C range, the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ (from LaCoO3 to La2Co2O5) and the segregation of Pd in the form of metal particles occurred. The reduction of Co was already reversible at 120 °C, and the perovskite structure was restored after exposure to oxygen. In contrast, Pd remained in the metallic state. Therefore, the final structure of PdLCO after mild reoxidation consisted of Pd and Co particles supported on LaCoO3. In contrast, reduction at 600 °C led to the formation of a Pd-Co alloy. The composition of PdLCO reduced at different temperatures is likely to strongly influence the catalytic processes involved in combustion exhaust after treatment. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Here we report the enhancement of photosynthesis and growth of plants by introducing the gene of an algal cytochrome c6, which has been evolutionarily eliminated from higher plant chloroplasts, into the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. At 60 d after planting, the plant height, leaf length and root length of the transformants were 1.3-, 1.1- and 1.3-fold those in the wild-type plants, respectively. At the same time, in the transgenic plants, the amounts of chlorophyll, protein, ATP, NADPH and starch were 1.2-, 1.1-, 1.9-, 1.4- and 1.2-fold those in the wild-type plants, respectively. The CO2 assimilation capacity of the transgenic plants was 1.3-fold that of the wild type. Moreover, in transgenic Arabidopsis expressing algal cytochrome c6, the 1 - qP, which reflects the reduced state of the plastoquinone pool, is 30% decreased compared with the wild type. These results show that the electron transfer of photosynthesis of Arabidopsis would be accelerated by the expression of algal cytochrome c6. Our results demonstrate that the growth and photosynthesis of Arabidopsis plants could be enhanced by the expression of the algal cytochrome c6 gene. © The Author 2007.

Many people use public transportation systems for their daily commute, while others use different transportation modes (e.g. cars, taxis, carpools, etc.). Inexpensive fares with good transit service encourages ridership, and the resulting revenue may be used to provide better service. Optimization of transit service frequency and its associated fare structure is desirable in order to increase revenue at reasonable transit operating expenditure. The objective of the study reported here is to maximize profit subject to service capacity constraint, while elastic demand is considered. The solution methodology is developed and applied to solve the profit maximization problem in a case study based on Newark, NJ, USA. Numerical results, including optimal solutions and sensitivity analyses, are presented. It is found that an optimal temporal headway and differential fare structure that maximizes total profit for the studied subway system can be efficiently solved.","Fare; Optimization; Profit; Public transportation; Revenue; Transit","Earnings; Optimization; Profitability; Sensitivity analysis; Fare structure; Public transportation; Service frequency; Transit systems; Transportation charges; optimization; profitability; public transport; road pricing; sensitivity analysis; transportation planning; New Jersey; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548386289

After computational comparison of the two libraries, we identified dicarbonyl/L-xylulose reductase (DCXR), an enzyme that catalyzes A-dicarbonyl and L-xylulose, as being significantly up-regulated in prostate cancer cells. The specificity of DCXR up-regulation for prostate cancer tissues was confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR, virtual Northern blot, and Western blot analyses. Furthermore, DCXR expression at the protein level was assessed using fresh-frozen tissues and a tissue microarray consisting of 46 cases of organ-confined early-stage prostate cancer and 29 cases of chemohormonally treated prostate cancer. In most normal prostate epithelial cells, DCXR was expressed at low levels and was localized predominantly in the cytoplasmic membrane. In contrast, in virtually all grades of early-stage prostate cancer and in all chemohormonally treated cases, DCXR was strikingly overexpressed and was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In all samples, the stromal cells were completely devoid of DCXR expression. Based on these findings, we suggest that DCXR overexpression has the potential to be an additional useful biomarker for prostate cancer.

Also, when compared with normal skin, a virtual northern blot shows increased expression of DCXR in melanomas. Methods: We investigated DCXR expression in a tissue microarray, with 20 benign and 33 malignant melanocytic lesions and possible colocalization of DCXR with cell adhesion molecules using double immunofluorescence/confocal microscopy in normal human skin. Results: Most nevi expressed DCXR in the cytoplasmic membrane, but some melanomas (20-30%) showed loss of membranous expression with inappropriate cytoplasmic or nuclear expression. Perinuclear Golgi expression was found in primary (14%) and metastatic (32%) melanomas showing dishesive growth pattern. Overall, the intensity of expression was stronger in nevi compared with melanomas (p < 0.005). In normal skin, DCXR was colocalized with E-cadherin and β-catenin at the intercellular membranes of keratinocytes and with CD31 at the intercellular junctions of endothelial cells. DCXR was localized in the cytoplasmic membrane of normal melanocytes. Conclusions: These findings indicate that decreased membranous expression of DCXR with altered subcellular localization appears to be associated with malignant progression of melanocytic lesions. We show for the first time the expression of DCXR in normal keratinocytes, melanocytes and endothelial cells. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2006.",,"beta catenin; CD31 antigen; dicarbonyl levo xylulose reductase; oxidoreductase; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; adolescent; adult; aged; article; cancer growth; cell adhesion; cell membrane; cell nucleus; cellular distribution; confocal microscopy; controlled study; dysplastic nevus; female; Golgi complex; human; human tissue; immunofluorescence microscopy; lymph node metastasis; male; melanoma; metastasis; nevus; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; school child; tissue microarray; visceral metastasis; beta Catenin; Cadherins; Cell Adhesion; Endothelium; Female; Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect; Humans; Intracellular Membranes; Keratinocytes; Male; Melanoma; Microscopy, Confocal; Nevus; Skin; Skin Neoplasms; Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases; Tissue Array Analysis; Tumor Markers, Biological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250334709

Carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) was extracted and measured for δ34SCAS using the same samples analyzed for δ13Ccarbonate. This integrated proxy approach is a step towards a more comprehensive picture of secular variation in the composition of Proterozoic seawater. We specifically sampled marine carbonate intervals from the lower section of the Chuanlinggou Formation, Changcheng Group (ca. 1700 Ma) to the top of the Jingeryu Formation, Qingbaikou Group (ca. 800 Ma). δ13Ccarbonate values are mostly negative in the upper Paleoproterozoic Changcheng Group, with an ascending trend from -3‰ to 0‰. We observed variation of approximately 0 ± 1‰ in the Mesoproterozoic Jixian Group, and positive values of +2 ± 2‰ characterize the lower Neoproterozoic Qingbaikou Group. Stratigraphic variations in δ34SCAS are more remarkable in their ranges and magnitudes, including conspicuously high values exceeding +30‰ in the three intervals at ca. 1700 Ma, 1300-1100 Ma, and 1000-900 Ma. In the Changcheng Group, δ34SCAS values are typically higher than +25‰, with only a few values of less than +15‰. In contrast, most of the data spanning from the Mesoproterozoic Tieling Formation of the Jixian Group to the lower Neoproterozoic Jingeryu Formation of the Qingbaikou Group are highly variable between +10‰ and +25‰, with some values exceeding +25‰. In the late Paleoproterozoic (1700-1600 Ma), a &gt;10‰ decrease in δ34SCAS and ∼3‰ increase in δ13Ccarbonate are coincident with, and likely related to, the breakup of Columbia, a supercontinent that predated Rodinia. Carbon and sulfur isotope data from the Mesoproterozoic, when global tectonic activity was comparatively weaker, fall mostly in the ranges of +15 ± 10‰ and 0 ± 1‰, respectively, but fluctuations of &gt;20‰ for δ34SCAS and &gt;3‰ for the δ13Ccarbonate at ca. 1450-1400 Ma may reflect subduction and large-scale magmatic activity in island arcs marking the end of Columbia breakup. From the late Mesoproterozoic (ca. 1300-1100 Ma) to the early Neoproterozoic (ca. 800 Ma), the δ13C and δ34S of seawater increased gradually with increasing variability. Most impressive areδ34SCAS values that exceed +30‰ in two intervals at ca. 1300-1100 Ma and ca. 1000-900 Ma, which may reflect the assembly and early breakup of Rodinia. Although gaps in the record remain, and studies of even higher resolution are warranted, our results suggest that changes in paleoceanographic conditions linked to global tectonics strongly influenced the biogeochemical cycles of C and S. Furthermore, periods of the Proterozoic previously noted for their isotopic invariability show clear isotopic expressions of this tectonic activity. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The data are examined in relation to different climatic (temperature, precipitation) and topographic factors that control glacial retreat both at the general and local scales. The evolution observed in the massif is characterized by the remarkable surface and volumetric shrinkage registered in all the glaciers: (1) glacial ice decreased in extent 35.7%, reducing from 240.9 ha to 155.0 ha; (2) losses in total ice volume reached 0.0137 km3 (75.6 m w.e.); (3) mean altitude of the studied glaciers increased 43.5 m. These changes seem to have been forced by climatic change (reduction in the snowfall contributions and increase in the maximum temperatures) during the past few decades in this Pyrenean region.

This decrease is nonuniform with the fastest, decrease observed over the United States and Europe. The observed rate of decreasing aerosol optical depth produces the top of the atmosphere radiative forcing that is comparable to forcing due to the current rate of increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Consequently, both increasing atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases and decreasing loading of atmospheric aerosols are major contributors to the top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing. We find that the climate sensitivity is reduced by at least a factorof 2 when direct and indirect effects of decreasing aerosols are included, compared to the case where the radiative forcing is ascribed only to increases in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. We find the empirical climate sensitivity to be between 0.29 and 0.48 K/Wm-2 when aerosol direct and indirect radiative forcing is included.

Sacco in the 19th century. The fauna is characterised by rich assemblages of terrestrial and aquatic taxa showing a high degree of species diversity and the dominance of archaic land prosobranchs and pulmonates. A high rate of extinct taxa (at least 50%) and a good percentage of endemics are recognised. Many species are restricted to the Middle Pliocene and for some species, a Mio-Pliocene central-western European origin is noticed. The palaeoecological features of two distinct assemblages show dominant hygrophilous and thermophilous forest elements in the first one and prevailing freshwater taxa, testifying an environment of swamps or small water bodies, in the latter. A direct record of ancient vegetation has been provided by fruit and seed assemblages recovered from an organic layer and from two leaf assemblages sampled in the overlaying laminated muds. The fruit and seed assemblages clearly represent the record of a few azonal plant communities growing very close to the deposition site. On the ground of the ecological preferences of the modern plant analogues, both leaf and fruit assemblages indicate swamp communities poor in arboreal species. The percentage of extinct plant species is surely higher than 29% (nine species out of 31), and most probably close to 48% (15 species out of 31). The plant assemblages provide limited climatic indications, whereas warm-temperate and humid climate conditions are pointed out on the basis of modern preferences of several mollusc taxa. These climatic indications agree with those obtained from rich plant assemblages of neighbouring Pliocene sites.

Previous studies have shown that climate forcing can impact the species composition and the food webs in each of these ecosystems. However, food webs and species interactions can mediate the relative impact of climatic perturbation on community. For example, a relatively small increase in SST over the western GOA region during the mid-1970s led to a spectacular change in the local species community, but a reverse in climatic conditions that occurred during the late 1980s did not result in similar biological changes. This chapter reviews the food webs of the GOA, EBS, and BS, and relates them to prevailing large-scale climatic phases. The comparative approach adopted in this review is aimed at increasing the understanding of the mechanisms linking climate change and food web dynamics in marine ecosystems. © Oxford University Press, 2005.

Life cycle assessment models typically use product-specific, plant-level or national aggregate data. However, many decisions by regional policy makers would be better informed by local or regional aggregate data. This research is intended to construct and apply a regional US economic input-output analysis-based life cycle assessment (REIO-LCA) model based upon publicly available datasets. The model uses Gross State Product (GSP) estimates to calculate regional economic multipliers and then link them to regional electricity and fuel use, and air emission factors. Target audiences are governmental decision makers, industry experts and researchers concerned with the regional economic and environmental effects of public and private decisions. Methods. A regional version of the existing US EIO-LCA model was developed using regional economic multipliers and state environmental data. The national model is based on the US 491 by 491economic input-output model, and uses sectoral energy consumption and emission factors to approximate the environmental effects of production and services. The proportion of the regional value added (Gross State Product) to the national value added for each sector was used to develop economic multipliers to allocate the output of industries to individual states and multi-state regions. Inter-sectoral transaction matrices were constructed for eight regions. Regional environmental emission and resource use factors were formed based upon publicly available data of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Energy. The Toxics Release Inventory include facility location parameters, enabling the estimation of sectoral toxic emissions for the regions. The national electricity and fuel use, air pollutants (CO, NOx, PM 10, SO2 and VOC) and greenhouse gas emissions used by the EIO-LCA model were proportioned based upon state totals for each sector. Results. A regional economic input-output model was created for US regions, and sectoral energy use and environmental emission factors were estimated for Pennsylvania, the Far West (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon and Washington) and the Mideast (Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania) economic areas. The use of the framework for regional IO-LCA model is demonstrated through two case studies. Discussion. As a validation exercise, the regional outputs of petroleum refineries were calculated using the regional input-output matrices and the outcomes were compared to the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Petroleum State Profile data. The model results show that approximately 70% of the total national sectoral production takes place in three regions, i.e., South West, South East and Far West, which corresponds with the EIA statistics. The REIO-LCA model constructed for the Far West is used to conduct a second case study estimating the annual toxic air emissions of power plants in the region in 2003. The results are evaluated by comparison to data provided by the US EPA. The estimated pollutions do not differ significantly from those presented in the Toxics Release Inventory reports. Conclusions. The usefulness of IO LCA models can be improved through the incorporation of local economic and environmental characteristics. Wiht the lack of US regional sectoral data, the allocation of national industrial production to regions can provide a framework to create smaller scale IO models. The results of case studies support the assumption that the GSP multipliers may be used to allocate the sectoral production to the regions, and show that the framework IO LCA model provides a reasonable approximation of supply chain economic activities and environmental effects caused by production and services. Recommendations and Perspectives. The quality of data, e.g., age and level of aggregation, and the assumed linearity between sectoral outputs and environmental emissions represent the main sources of uncertainty in the model. The results show that the GSP estimates are appropriate to construct a framework for a regional economic input-output and environmental assessment model. However, further research is recommended to construct more specific state-level input-output matrices incorporating interstate commodity flows, and state environmental factors in order to mitigate the parameter uncertainties. Further, the model might be improved by updating it regularly, as more recent data become available. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Electricity production; Environmental emissions; Gross state product; Input-output LCA; Refineries; Regional economic input-output model","carbon monoxide; fuel; nitrogen oxide; sulfide; volatile organic compound; article; atmospheric dispersion; calculation; decision making; electricity; energy consumption; evaluation; government; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment; mathematical analysis; model; parameter; policy; priority journal; United States; validation process",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35748960836

Traditional uses for agriculture, forestry, as a source of fuel and other products, and for pastoral farming, among others, have recently been supplemented by identifying its potential for mitigating the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Through the Kyoto Protocol, carbon has become a commodity and the CO2-absorbing capability of the vegetation and soils an economically valuable asset. The multi-facetted roles of the C cycle and its sensitivity to human activities present a demand for techniques that permit accurate, timely and affordable characterization of the various components of this cycle, especially on land where most human activities take place. Such techniques must satisfy a range of demands in terms of purpose, clients for the information, and biosphere properties. However, if successful, they offer the potential to support monitoring, reporting, policy setting, and management of terrestrial biospheric resources. The context for these requirements and possibilities is illustrated with reference to the China Carbon Sequestration Project and its findings.

Previous studies show considerable variation across terrestrial herbaceous ecosystems in the magnitude of species loss following nitrogen (N) enrichment. What controls this variation remains unknown. We present results from 23 N-addition experiments across North America, representing a range of climatic, soil and plant community properties, to determine conditions that lead to greater diversity decline. Species loss in these communities ranged from 0 to 65% of control richness. Using hierarchical structural equation modelling, we found greater species loss in communities with a lower soil cation exchange capacity, colder regional temperature, and larger production increase following N addition, independent of initial species richness, plant productivity, and the relative abundance of most plant functional groups. Our results indicate sensitivity to N addition is co-determined by environmental conditions and production responsiveness, which overwhelm the effects of initial community structure and composition. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Biogeochemistry; Functional traits; Meta-analysis; Nitrogen; SEM; Species loss","fertilizer; nitrogen; biogeochemistry; community structure; experimental study; meta-analysis; nitrogen; nutrient enrichment; plant community; scanning electron microscopy; species richness; article; biodiversity; biological model; comparative study; growth, development and aging; North America; plant; soil; species difference; temperature; Biodiversity; Fertilizers; Models, Biological; Nitrogen; North America; Plants; Soil; Species Specificity; Temperature; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249827618

We developed two scenarios to constrain the possible range of future emissions. As a baseline, we investigated the future emission levels that would result from the implementation of the already adopted emission control legislation in each country, based on the current national expectations of economic development. Alternatively, we explored the lowest emission levels that could be achieved with the most advanced emission control technologies that are on the market today. This paper describes data sources and our assumptions on activity data, emission factors and the penetration of pollution control measures. We estimate that, with current expectations on future economic development and with the present air quality legislation, global anthropogenic emissions of SO2 and NOx would slightly decrease between 2000 and 2030. For carbonaceous particles and CO, reductions between 20% and 35% are computed, while for CH4 an increase of about 50% is calculated. Full application of currently available emission control technologies, however, could achieve substantially lower emissions levels, with decreases up to 30% for CH4, 40% for CO and BC, and nearly 80% for SO2. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional approaches to attainment planning face important limitations that are magnified in the multipollutant context. Recognizing those limitations, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division has adopted an integrated framework to address ozone, fine particulate matter, and regional haze in the state. Rather than applying atmospheric modeling merely as a final check of an overall strategy, photochemical sensitivity analysis is conducted upfront to compare the effectiveness of controlling various precursor emission species and source regions. Emerging software enables the modeling of health benefits and associated economic valuations resulting from air pollution control. Photochemical sensitivity and health benefits analyses, applied together with traditional cost and feasibility assessments, provide a more comprehensive characterization of the implications of various control options. The fuller characterization both informs the selection of control options and facilitates the communication of impacts to affected stakeholders and the public.

We report the complete kinetic mechanism of a mammalian HSD using rat 3α-HSD of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily (AKR1C9) with the substrate pairs androstane-3,17-dione and NADPH (reduction) and androsterone and NADP+ (oxidation). Steady-state, transient state kinetics, and kinetic isotope effects reconciled the ordered bi-bi mechanism, which contained 9 enzyme forms and permitted the estimation of 16 kinetic constants. In both reactions, loose association of the NADP(H) was followed by two conformational changes, which increased cofactor affinity by &gt;86-fold. For androstane-3,17-dione reduction, the release of NADP + controlled kcat, whereas the chemical event also contributed to this term. kcat was insensitive to [ 2H]NADPH, whereas Dkcat/Km and the Dklim (ratio of the maximum rates of single turnover) were 1.06 and 2.06, respectively. Under multiple turnover conditions partial burst kinetics were observed. For androsterone oxidation, the rate of NADPH release dominated kcat, whereas the rates of the chemical event and the release of androstane-3,17-dione were 50-fold greater. Under multiple turnover conditions full burst kinetics were observed. Although the internal equilibrium constant favored oxidation, the overall Keq favored reduction. The kinetic Haldane and free energy diagram confirmed that Keq was governed by ligand binding terms that favored the reduction reactants. Thus, HSDs in the aldo-keto reductase superfamily thermodynamically favor ketosteroid reduction. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Aldo-keto reductase; Steroid; Animal cell culture; Biosynthesis; Hormones; Isotopes; Enzyme kinetics; androstanedione; androsterone; carbonyl reductase; hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; oxidoreductase; protein AKR1C9; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; steroid hormone; unclassified drug; animal experiment; article; binding affinity; chemical reaction; controlled study; crystal structure; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; hormone action; hormone synthesis; kinetics; ligand binding; liver; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; protein structure; rat; steady state; 3-alpha-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase (B-Specific); Animals; Crystallography, X-Ray; Kinetics; Liver; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Molecular Conformation; NADP; Oxygen; Protein Conformation; Rats; Testosterone; Thermodynamics; Time Factors; Mammalia; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36349001861

These studies have found that different LSSs can produce very different simulations even when supplied with identical atmospheric forcing. As well, LSSs that produce similar surface results from present-day or control climates often diverge when forced with climatic change data. Furthermore, no single LSS has been identified that produces an adequate simulation of all of temperature, moisture, evapotranspiration and runoff. AGCM LSSs must resolve the surface energy balance (SEB) in order to compute realistic heat fluxes between with the atmospheric model. LSSs have been used with AGCMs in both on-line (fully coupled) and off-line modes. In off-line climatic change experiments, AGCM predictions of atmospheric temperature and precipitation have been used, along with model downward radiative fluxes at the surface, to drive their own uncoupled LSS. However, there are simple non-energy-balance methods for estimating evapotranspiration that have been traditionally used in agricultural and meteorological applications. These schemes compute a potential evapotranspiration (PE) based on temperature and/or net radiation inputs, with the PE modified based on the availability of soil moisture. Operational PE approaches have also been used with AGCM data in off-line climate change experiments. The advantages of this approach are that it is simpler and requires less information, although (like the off-line SEB approach) it leaves out the simulation of feedbacks between the surface and the atmosphere.Although the SEB approach is essential for LSSs that must be coupled to AGCMs, this does not necessarily make it superior to an off-line operational PE LSS when it comes to quantities such as soil moisture. The quality of current observational data is insufficient to demonstrate that either approach is better than the other. Both approaches should continue to be used and intercompared when predicting the impacts of climatic change on soil moisture. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climate change; Computer simulation; Evapotranspiration; Moisture; Land surface schemes (LSS); Soil moisture change; Soils; atmospheric forcing; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate effect; comparative study; energy balance; evapotranspiration; land surface; radiative transfer; soil moisture; surface energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148966918

Combustion technology can facilitate volume reduction of up to 90%, with the inorganic contaminants being captured in furnace bottom ash, and fly ash/APC residues. The disposal or reuse of these residues is however governed by the potential release of constituent contaminants into the environment. Accelerated carbonation has been shown to have a potential for improving the chemical stability and leaching behaviour of both bottom ash and fly ash/APC residues. However, the efficacy of carbonation depends on whether the method of gas application is direct or indirect. Also important are the mineralogy, chemistry and physical properties of the fresh ash, the carbonation reaction conditions such as temperature, contact time, CO2 partial pressure and relative humidity. This paper reviews the main issues pertaining to the application of accelerated carbonation to municipal waste combustion residues to elucidate the potential benefits on the stabilization of such residues and for reducing CO2 emissions. In particular, the modification of ash properties that occur upon carbonation and the CO2 sequestration potential possible under different conditions are discussed. Although accelerated carbonation is a developing technology, it could be introduced in new incinerator facilities as a ""finishing step"" for both ash treatment and reduction of CO2 emissions. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Air pollution control (APC) residues; Bottom ashes (BA); Carbonation; CO2; Incineration; Leaching","Air pollution control; Carbonation; Environmental impact assessments; Leaching; Solid wastes; Waste incineration; Combustion technology; Municipal solid waste; Waste management; carbon dioxide; atmospheric pollution; bottom ash; combustion; environmental impact; incineration; leaching; municipal solid waste; pollution control; air pollution control; ash; chemical reaction; combustion; environmental impact; gas; incineration; leaching; municipal solid waste; physical chemistry; review; solid waste management; technology; Air Movements; Air Pollutants; Calcium Compounds; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Humidity; Incineration; Particulate Matter; Refuse Disposal; Risk Assessment; Silicon Compounds; Time Factors; Waste Management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36248951013

Heterozygous (Pp) and homozygous (pp) forms of a PEPC-deficient mutant of the C4 dicot Amaranthus edulis were used to study the effect of reduced PEPC activity on CO2 assimilation rates, stomatal conductance, and 13CO2 (Δ13C) and C18OO (Δ18O) isotope discrimination during leaf gas exchange. PEPC activity was reduced to 42% and 3% and the rates of CO2 assimilation in air dropped to 78% and 10% of the wild-type values in the Pp and pp mutants, respectively. Stomatal conductance in air (531 μbar CO2) was similar in the wild-type and Pp mutant but the pp mutant had only 41% of the wild-type steady-state conductance under white light and the stomata opened more slowly in response to increased light or reduced CO2 partial pressure, suggesting that the C4 PEPC isoform plays an essential role in stomatal opening. There was little difference in Δ13C between the Pp mutant (3.0‰ ± 0.4‰) and wild type (3.3‰ ± 0.4‰), indicating that leakiness (φ), the ratio of CO2 leak rate out of the bundle sheath to the rate of CO2 supply by the C4 cycle, a measure of the coordination of C4 photosynthesis, was not affected by a 60% reduction in PEPC activity. In the pp mutant Δ13C was 16‰ ± 3.2‰, indicative of direct CO2 fixation by Rubisco in the bundle sheath at ambient CO2 partial pressure. Δ18O measurements indicated that the extent of isotopic equilibrium between leaf water and the CO 2 at the site of oxygen exchange (φ) was low (0.6) in the wild-type and Pp mutant but increased to 0.9 in the pp mutant. We conclude that in vitro carbonic anhydrase activity overestimated φ as compared to values determined from Δ18O in wild-type plants. © 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Carbon dioxide; Isotopes; pH effects; Photosynthesis; Reduction; Assimilation rates; Isotope exchange; Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; Stomatal conductance; Enzyme activity; Amaranthus; Amaranthus caudatus; Dicotyledoneae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36248991256

Simulations indicate that despite lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations and increased aridity during the LGM, Amazonia remains mostly forested, and that the cooler climate of the Younger Dryas-like period in fact causes a trend towards increased above-ground carbon balance relative to today. The vegetation feedbacks responsible for maintaining forest integrity in past climates (i.e. decreased evapotranspiration and reduced photorespiration) cannot be maintained in the future. Although elevated atmospheric CO2 contributes to a positive enhancement of plant carbon and water balance, decreased stomatal conductance and increased plant and soil respiration cause a positive feedback that amplifies localised drying and climate warming. The Amazonian forest appears to be presently near its critical resiliency threshold, and even minor climate warming may be sufficient to promote deleterious feedbacks on forest integrity. © The Royal Society 2005.

To determine trends in solar energy across the agricultural region of the Canadian Prairie, we analyzed incoming solar radiation, sunshine, and climate data gathered between 1951 and 2005 from 7 locations on the prairies. From the 1950s, there was a decreasing trend in annual average daily incoming solar radiation, no trend in annual average daily sunshine hours, and increasing trends in annual average daily temperature and in the annual number of precipitation/rain events. As well, we found the annual average daily incoming solar radiation decreased as the annual number of precipitation/rain events increased, but increased as the annual average precipitation intensity increased. We found the annual average daily sunshine hours decreased as the annual precipitation amount increased and as the annual average precipitation intensity increased. Thus, incoming solar radiation and sunshine responded differently to precipitation amount/events. Nevertheless, climate trends coupled with the relationship of solar radiation/sunshine to precipitation amount/events suggested that increased cloudiness played a key role in the extinction of solar radiation by the atmosphere over the past 50-60 years on the Canadian Prairie. Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations act to reduce cloudiness, whereas increasing aerosol concentrations often increase cloudiness. Specific to the Canadian Prairie, further research is needed to determine the influence of changing greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations on cloudiness and cloud characteristics and the impact these changes would have on solar energy measured at the earth's surface.

The CFC in the form of a monoblock in the vertical target is the most loaded part of the plasma-facing surfaces, and hence it is subjected to high erosion and has a significant risk of failure. A program has been developed with the aim of understanding the impact on the erosion lifetime due to a combination of two main effects: the material property variations (particularly pronounced in CFC) and the presence of joining defects. The software allows the evolution of the surface profile of the armour to be predicted and the margin on critical heat flux at the heat-sink-to-coolant interface to be estimated for a range of postulated defects, from start-of-life through to end-of-life of the component. In assessing erosion, the code takes account of geometry and sublimation, and physical and chemical erosion of the CFC armour. The incident angle (a glancing angle of a few degrees) of the particle and heat flux onto the target is taken into account.

Electrons are shuttled from photosystem I by means of ferredoxin (Fdx) to ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase (FTR), which catalyses the two-electron-reduction of chloroplast thioredoxins (Trxs). These modify target enzyme activities by reduction, regulating carbon flow. FTR is unique in its use of a [4Fe-4S] cluster and a proximal disulphide bridge in the conversion of a light signal into a thiol signal. We determined the structures of FTR in both its one- and its two-electron-reduced intermediate states and of four complexes in the pathway, including the ternary Fdx-FTR-Trx complex. Here we show that, in the first complex (Fdx-FTR) of the pathway, the Fdx [2Fe-2S] cluster is positioned suitably for electron transfer to the FTR [4Fe-4S] centre. After the transfer of one electron, an intermediate is formed in which one sulphur atom of the FTR active site is free to attack a disulphide bridge in Trx and the other sulphur atom forms a fifth ligand for an iron atom in the FTR [4Fe-4S] centre - a unique structure in biology. Fdx then delivers a second electron that cleaves the FTR-Trx heterodisulphide bond, which occurs in the Fdx-FTR-Trx complex. In this structure, the redox centres of the three proteins are aligned to maximize the efficiency of electron transfer from the Fdx [2Fe-2S] cluster to the active-site disulphide of Trxs. These results provide a structural framework for understanding the mechanism of disulphide reduction by an iron-sulphur enzyme and describe previously unknown interaction networks for both Fdx and Trx (refs 4-6). ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.",,"ferredoxin; ternary complex factor; thioredoxin reductase; carbon flux; electron; enzyme activity; iron; ligand; oxygen; photosynthesis; protein; sulfur; article; cluster analysis; crystal structure; electron transport; enzyme activity; priority journal; protein structure; protein transport; reaction analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447120818

We tested the effects on vascular reactivity of exposure to fine particulates matter mass (PM2.5), number of particles ≤1 μm/m3 (PM1.0) and nitrogen dioxide concentration (NO2). Method: About 39 healthy volunteers sat outside for 2 h at two different Ottawa bus stops. Flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery was then measured by ultrasound and expressed as: (maximum artery diameter after release of a blood pressure cuff inflated above systolic pressure - baseline resting diameter)/baseline resting diameter. Results: A 30 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure corresponded to a 0.48% reduction in FMD, P = 0.05 representing a 5% relative change in the maximum ability to dilate. Results were consistent between the two bus stops and not sensitive to type of analysis. No significant association was found between FMD and NO2, PM1.0 or traffic density. Conclusion: PM2.5 may reduce the capacity to vasodilate, a potential explanation for the documented association with cardiovascular morbidity. © Springer-Verlag 2007.","Arteries; Endothelin; Epidemiology; Pollution; Vasodilation","nitrogen dioxide; adult; air pollution; article; blood vessel reactivity; brachial artery; Canada; cardiovascular disease; correlation analysis; echography; environmental exposure; female; human; human experiment; male; morbidity; motor vehicle; normal human; particulate matter; traffic; vasodilatation; Adolescent; Adult; Blood Vessels; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Vehicles; Ontario; Particulate Matter; Urban Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35448977590

Spectra are calculated for the detector located inside the cavity (case A), outside the cavity end mirror (case B - end emission), or placed for emission out the side of the cavity (case C). The spectra for case A and case B are found to be essentially the same. In all the cases the predicted lineshapes are free of instrumental effects and only due to cavity decay. Spectra are presented for intermediate and strong coupling regime situations (where both atomic transitions are resonant with the cavity frequency), for cases of non-zero cavity detuning, and for cases where the two atomic transition frequencies differ. The spectral features for cases B(A) and C are qualitatively similar, with six spectral peaks for resonance cases and eight for detuned cases.

On the basis of data collected during the period 1987-2005, we estimated trends in the atmospheric pollen levels for the 16 different taxa, each of whose contribution to the total atmospheric pollen concentration was at least 0.5%. We also tested for trends towards earlier, longer or more highly peaked pollen seasons. The salient feature of these data is that the levels of pollen have been increasing; this is true for the majority of the individual taxa examined (12 out of 16) and for their aggregate. On average, the atmospheric pollen concentration is doubling every decade, but for some species the rate is much higher, with doubling times less than 5 years. Among the taxa with the highest rate of long-term trend in atmospheric pollen concentration, four belong to the group of woody plants (Cupressaceae, Quercus, Platanus, Pinaceae) and only one to that of herbs (Urticaceae). For the pollen-season-related attributes (onset, peak, end and duration), there was no systematic tendency and the changes were more nuanced. The observed increase in pollen abundance coincides with a rise in air temperature, which is the only meteorological factor to have experienced a sustained and significant change over the same period in Thessaloniki. Our results suggest that changes in pollen distributions are dominated by increases in pollen production rather than changes in flowering phenology and that several species showing strong trends might serve as bio-indicators of expected climate change. Given that the pollen-producing reservoir around the city has not increased, these results provide further evidence of the impact of climate change on plant biota. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Increased electricity costs in recent years have awakened an interest to invest in new electricity generation. Since renewable alternatives are favoured by green certificates, bio-fuelled CHP is most profitable at low electricity prices. Since heat demand in the district heating network sets the limit for possible electricity generation, a CHP alternative with a high electricity to heat ratio will be more profitable at when electricity prices are high.

Though a number of sizeable coalfields are located within the basin, it is essentially unexplored from hydrocarbon point of view. Hydrocarbon source-rock analyses carried out on samples from outcrops and shallow bore-holes (60 m - 500 m depths) show low to moderate maturity. In order to investigate the hydrocarbon potential of the basin, a reconnaissance surface geochemical survey was carried out over an approximately 5000 sq km area covering most of the Godavari sub-basin, which is the largest of the three. The results of the study indicate that the basin (within the area of the survey) is actively leaking measurable quantities of light hydrocarbons to the surface and that all the anomalies are full spectrum anomalies of petrogenic origin.

Two species, Coprinus radians and C. verticillatus, were found to produce peroxidases, which oxidized aryl alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes at pH 7 (a reaction that is typical for heme-thiolate haloperoxidases). The peroxidase of Coprinus radians was purified to homogeneity and characterized. Three fractions of the enzyme, CrP I, CrP II, and CrP III, with molecular masses of 43 to 45 kDa as well as isoelectric points between 3.8 and 4.2, were identified after purification by anion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography. The optimum pH of the major fraction (CrP II) for the oxidation of aryl alcohols was around 7, and an H2O2 concentration of 0.7 mM was most suitable regarding enzyme activity and stability. The apparent Km values for ABTS [2,2′-azinobis(3- ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid)], 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, benzyl alcohol, veratryl alcohol, and H2O2 were 49, 342, 635, 88, and 1,201 μM, respectively. The N terminus of CrP II showed 29% and 19% sequence identity to Agrocybe aegerita peroxidase (AaP) and chloroperoxidase, respectively. The UV-visible spectrum of CrP II was highly similar to that of resting-state cytochrome P450 enzymes, with the Soret band at 422 nm and additional maxima at 359, 542, and 571 nm. The reduced carbon monoxide complex showed an absorption maximum at 446 nm, which is characteristic of heme-thiolate proteins. CrP brominated phenol to 2- and 4-bromophenols and selectively hydroxylated naphthalene to 1-naphthol. Hence, after AaP, CrP is the second extracellular haloperoxidase-peroxygenase described so far. The ability to extracellularly hydroxylate aromatic compounds seems to be the key catalytic property of CrP and may be of general significance for the biotransformation of poorly available aromatic substances, such as lignin, humus, and organopollutants in soil litter and dung environments. Furthermore, aromatic peroxygenation is a promising target of biotechnological studies. Copyright © 2007, American Society for Microbiology.

Yet, because of the lack of consistent multisite and multitaxon surveys, few studies have addressed general rules about how climate change impacts on structure and diversity of animal communities. Especially, the relative influence of nonclimatic anthropogenic disturbances on this impact is fairly unknown. Here, we present for the first time a meta-analysis assessing the effect of global warming on stream organisms. Fish communities of large rivers in France undergoing various anthropogenic pressures showed significant increase in proportions of warm-water species and of specific richness during the last 15-25 years. Conversely, the equitability decreased, indicating a gradual decrease of the number of dominant species. Finally, the total abundance increased, coupled with rejuvenation and changes in size-structure of the communities. Interestingly, most of these effects were not depressed by the strength of nonclimatic anthropogenic disturbances. Conversely, geographical location of communities and especially closeness of natural barriers to migration could influence their response to climate change. Indeed, increase in the proportion of southern species seemed hindered at sites located close to the southern limit of the European species' geographical ranges. This work provides new evidence that climate change have deep impacts on communities which, by overtaking the effects of nonclimatic anthropogenic disturbances, could be more substantial than previously thought. Overall, our results stress the importance of considering climate change impacts in studies addressing community dynamics, even in disturbed sites. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Anthropogenic disturbances; Climate change; Community; Diversity; Fish; France; Large rivers; Long-term studies; Meta-analysis; Time series","anthropogenic effect; assessment method; climate change; climate effect; community dynamics; community structure; environmental disturbance; fish; global warming; meta-analysis; river; species diversity; time series analysis; Eurasia; Europe; France; Western Europe; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36348997579

The expansion of textile production and consumption has contributed to increasing pollution, water shortages, fossil fuel and raw material depletion, and climate change. Production of polyester fibre, the most widely used man-made fibre, Consumes non-renewable resources and high energy levels, and generates atmospheric emissions. Modern automated textile plants consume large amounts of energy. Textile finishing consumes large amounts of water and energy and often produces harmful effluent. Apparel production is more environmentally, friendly, but sourcing from low cost countries consumes more fuel for transportation. Among consumers, the trend towards fast fashion and cheaper clothing has led to a throw-away mentality. Environmental issues are being addressed, however. Although recycling activity remains at a low level - for economic and quality reasons - Marks & Spencer and others are promoting recycling schemes. Some retailers are also voluntarily attaching ""eco-labels"" to garments to provide environmental information. Although these have met with varying levels of success in the marketplace, they can encourage ""best practice"" in manufacturing. Some labelling schemes, such as the EU Ecolabel Scheme and its associated flower logo, adopt a full life cycle or ""cradle to grave"" approach while others, such as Öko-Tex, focus on a single aspect of an item such as its environmental attributes, social attributes, or individual phases of its life cycle. Other initiatives include REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) legislation which aims to encourage safe and eco-friendly chemical production. In the USA the Toxic Substances Control Act (TCSA) enables the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to track industrial chemicals produced in or imported into the country. Some man-made fibres, such as Lenzing's lyocell fibre Tencel, have a minimal impact on the environment. Also, organic cotton production is growing rapidly but still accounts for only a small fraction of global cotton output. Nonetheless, organic cotton is being adopted by high prafile companies such as C&A, Coop, Nike, Wal-Mart, and Woolworths. And a growing number of brand and manufacturing companies are pursuing environmentally friendly strategies. Such companies include American Apparel, Gap, Interface, Patagonia, and Wal-Mart in the USA as well as Rohner Textil in Switzerland, and a small knitwear company in India, MaHan, which was founded by an ex-teacher from the Netherlands. © Textiles Intelligence Limited 2007.",,"clothing industry; ecolabeling; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental issue; environmental protection; European Union; industrial production; manufacturing; strategic approach; textile industry; trade-environment relations; Eurasia; Europe; North America; United States; Gossypium hirsutum; manufactured fiber; production; supply chain; textile-clothing industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40249092014

This approach is comparable to other calibration-free methods based on LTE assumption. In order to apply this method to very different laser pulse durations, the partial-local thermodynamic equilibrium (p-LTE) has been considered within the energy range of 30,000-50,000 cm -1 . In order to obtain the neutral species densities, the detected plasma species emission lines intensities have been treated together with the experimental evaluated background black-body Planck-like emission distribution. For validating the followed method, three certified copper-based-alloys standards were employed and their minor components (Ni, Pb and Sn) amounts were determined. As a result, it arises, that this standardless method, independently from the laser source pulse durations, provides good quantitative analysis, and, consequently, that the composition of the plasma plume emitting species induced is not affected by the laser pulse time width. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Here we pose hypotheses for and quantify leakage of the Scolel Té project in Chiapas, Mexico. In this project small-scale farmers are implementing forestry, agroforestry, and forest conservation activities, with carbon sequestration as one of the goals. The main leakage monitoring domain is defined as the area owned by the participating farmers or communities outside the area where the specific project activities take place. The null-hypothesis (no leakage) is that non-project land owned by the farmer or community will experience the same carbon stock changes as predicted by the regional baseline, specifically developed for the project. First we assessed the most likely causes and sources of leakage that may occur in the project. From this analysis, one type of leakage seems to be important, i.e., activity shifting. Second we estimated the leakage of a sample of participating farmers and communities. Actual land use was then compared with expected land use derived from the baseline. The Plan Vivo of each participant, complemented with readily available tools to identify the main sources and drivers of leakage are used to develop simple leakage assessment procedures, as demonstrated in this paper. Negative leakage was estimated to be negligible in this study. Incorporating these procedures already in the project planning stage will reduce the uncertainties related to the actual carbon mitigation potential of any forestry project. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Leakage assessment; Plan Vivo; Regional baseline","carbon sequestration; emission; greenhouse gas; land use; leakage; mitigation; pollution monitoring; Chiapas; Mexico [North America]; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347372009

Acetate is undesirable because it retards growth and inhibits protein formation. Most process designs or genetic modifications to minimize acetate formation aim at balancing growth rate and oxygen consumption. In this research, three genetic approaches to reduce acetate formation were investigated: (1) direct reduction of the carbon flow to acetate (ackA-pta, poxB knock-out); (2) anticipation on the underlying metabolic and regulatory mechanisms that lead to acetate (constitutive ppc expression mutant); and (3) both (1) and (2). Initially, these mutants were compared to the wild-type E. coli via batch cultures under aerobic conditions. Subsequently, these mutants were further characterized using metabolic flux analysis on continuous cultures. It is concluded that a combination of directly reducing the carbon flow to acetate and anticipating on the underlying metabolic and regulatory mechanism that lead to acetate, is the most promising approach to overcome acetate formation and improve recombinant protein production. These genetic modifications have no significant influence on the metabolism when growing the microorganisms under steady state at relatively low dilution rates (less than 0.4 h-1). © 2007 American Chemical Society and American Institute of Chemical Engineers.",,"Esters; Genetic engineering; Growth kinetics; Metabolism; Acetate formation; Aerobic cultures; Genetic modifications; Escherichia coli; acetic acid derivative; carbon; Escherichia coli protein; glucose; article; biological model; comparative study; computer simulation; Escherichia coli; genetic enhancement; genetics; metabolism; methodology; mutation; Acetates; Carbon; Computer Simulation; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Genetic Enhancement; Glucose; Models, Biological; Mutation; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348869758

We isolated the microalgae Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella kessleri from the waste treatment ponds of the Presidente Médici coal fired thermoelectric power plant in the Southernmost Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul and investigated their growth characteristics when exposed to different concentrations of CO2. When cultivated with 6% and 12% CO2, C. kessleri showed a high maximum specific growth rate (μmax) of 0.267/day, with a maximum biomass productivity (Pmax) of 0.087 g/L/day at 6% CO2. For S. obliquus, the highest maximum dry weight biomass value was 1.14 g/L with 12% CO2.

In particular, labyrinthine-shaped nanoparticles of tunable dimensions are reproducibly synthesized based on a heterogeneous reaction between cadmium acetate in a solution in hexadecylamine and trioctylphosphine with Se as a solid precursor at a relatively low temperature (110 °C). The resulting highly branched CdSe structures resemble labyrinthine patterns observed in magnetic fluids and superconductors films in magnetic fields, and in lipid films and other materials where strong dipolar interactions ""direct"" large-scale pattern formation. Surprisingly, these novel maze-like structures emit light within a narrow bandwidth (full-width at half-maximum ≈33- 42 nm) of the visible spectrum (508 nm< λ<563 nm), so the regular dimensions of the core regions of these branched structures govern their emission characteristics rather than overall nanoparticle size. This property should make these materials attractive for applications where luminescent materials having tunable emission characteristics and a narrow emission frequency range are required, along with the insensitivity of the particles' luminescent properties to environmental conditions. © 2007 by the American Chemical Society.","CdSe; Confinement; Exciton localization; Labrynthine solidification patterns; Luminescence; Potential directed pattern formation; Quantum dots","CdSe; Exciton localization; Labrynthine solidification patterns; Pattern formation; Quantum Dot; Cadmium; Cadmium alloys; Cadmium compounds; Emission spectroscopy; Films; Growth (materials); Magnetic fields; Magnetic fluids; Nanocrystals; Nanoparticles; Optical properties; Polycrystalline materials; Semiconducting selenium compounds; X ray diffraction; Zinc sulfide; Luminescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955927941

The petitioners had asked EPA to regulate the emissions of certain greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. In ruling on the EPA's denial of the petition, the Supreme Court addressed three issues. First, the Court held that the lead petitioner, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, had standing to sue for redress of injuries caused by global warming. The Court also ruled that a state acting to protect its quasi-sovereign interests was entitled to ""special solicitude"" in standing analysis. Second, the Court held that the EPA had the statutory authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. Finally, the Court held that the EPA had not adequately justified its denial of the petition in accordance with the statute.

Correct evaluation of the exceedance of critical loads is fundamental for the long-term protection of ecosystems by limiting emissions of potential acidifying and eutrophying pollutants. For forest ecosystems, the exceedance of critical loads is often calculated using deposition data measured in the forest interior. However, several studies report forest edges acting as 'hotspots' of acidifying and nitrogen deposition, showing up to fourfold increases in atmospheric deposition compared to the forest interior. This paper estimates the relevance of considering the higher deposition load in forest edges for calculating exceedance of critical loads for nitrogen and potential acidifying deposition. If measures to control and reduce atmospheric deposition are based on mean deposition fluxes within forest stands, deposition reductions will not be enough for preventing adverse effects. In fact, emission reductions should be adjusted to deposition values at the forest edge, since these zones are most threatened. We thus conclude that there is an urgent need to reconsider the calculation of exceedance of critical loads, taking into account edge enhancement of deposition. This is an issue of high relevance, particularly in highly fragmented regions, such as Flanders (Belgium). © IAVS; Opulus Press Uppsala.","Air pollution; Atmospheric deposition; Forest landscape; Landscape fragmentation; Nitrogen; Sulphur",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41949125607

Climate change datasets for Sri Lanka were derived using outputs from the UK Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research Model (HadCM3) for selected scenarios for the 2050s, chosen from the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change Special Emission Scenarios Report. Water balance modelling and a geographical information system were used to model and map the impacts on irrigation requirements for wet season paddy. We examined two scenarios. The A2 scenario represents a heterogeneous, regionalised, market-led world, with high population growth, leading to a rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. The B2 scenario follows a similar regionalised future but with more moderate population growth and more concern for the environment and local sustainability, and a slower rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Results suggests that, during the wet season, average rainfall decreases by 17% (A2) and 9% (B2), with rains ending earlier, and potential evapotranspiration increasing by 3.5% (A2) and 3% (B2). Consequently, the average paddy irrigation water requirement increases by 23% (A2) and 13% (B2). Mapping with GIS highlights the importance of considering spatial variation. Climate change impacts on wet season paddy production are positive in the extreme south, confirming results of a previous study. However, the impacts are negative across most of Sri Lanka. The adaptations needed are different in the two regions. Furthermore, spatial variation points to a further adaptation; the transfer of some paddy production to positively affected areas, which would not have been so clear if only point modelling had been used. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The individual contribution of electrons, positive, and negative ions to the total measurable current in the pulsed discharge is calculated by solving the corresponding set of coupled continuity equations for each species, for which boundary and initial conditions are set adequately. This simulation code is also capable of considering a more realistic scheme of photoelectron emission, such as that produced using a pulsed ultraviolet laser. In addition, the processes of ion and electron drift and longitudinal diffusion, electron detachment, negative-ion stabilization, and ion conversion have been calculated successfully. Some of these effects are extremely difficult to model analytically, and the simultaneous inclusion of two or more of them proves practically impossible.

Lluís Companys 23, 08010 Barcelona, Spain","The kinetics of the N2O reduction by CO as well as the direct N2O decomposition have been investigated over steam-activated FeZSM-5. To this end, steady-state experiments at different temperatures, partial reactant pressures, molar feed N2O/CO ratios, and space times were carried out in an integral fixed-bed micro-reactor. Different empirical and microkinetic models were evaluated in order to describe the experimental data and derive quantitative kinetic information. Depending on the molar feed CO/N2O ratio and temperature, the reduction occurs alone in the catalyst bed or simultaneously with direct N2O decomposition. The orders for N2O and CO in the N2O + CO reaction are 0.51 and 0.72, respectively, in contrast with the characteristic first-order behaviour of the direct N2O decomposition. The latter can be properly described by a two-step oxygen transfer mechanism. The scavenging mechanism (Eley-Rideal type), where gas-phase CO effectively eliminates adsorbed atomic oxygen properly describes the N2O + CO reaction. The removal of O* by CO is two orders of magnitude faster than by N2O, but the elimination of O* remains as the rate-determining step. The N2O activation generating adsorbed oxygen is 2-8 times faster than the O* elimination by CO. Elimination of O* by CO is more sensitive to temperature than N2O activation. The elementary step mechanism has been used to predict the fraction of free/oxidised sites. The inlet concentration of CO and temperature determines the degree of reduction of the catalyst surface. The obtained activation energies in direct N2O decomposition (141 kJ mol-1) and N2O reduction by CO (62 kJ mol-1) were in excellent agreement with values reported in the literature. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The article is based on a project funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, using qualitative case studies of six English, Welsh and Scottish HEIs. The project data suggest that equality policies for staff and students are in tension with each other, that staff policies may clash with other institutional policies, for example on research excellence or enhancing the student experience, and that the rhetoric of equality policies is not always matched by the day-to-day experience of staff.

The anthropogenic control of mosquito populations is often carried out at a local administrative scale, and it is applied based on the relevant agency's experiential knowledge rather than systematic analysis of spatial and temporal data. To address this shortcoming, a spatial and temporal analysis of landscape and climatic parameters in relation to mosquito populations in Black Hawk County, IA, USA, has been carried out. Adult mosquito sampling took place using CDC light traps from May to August 2003 in representative landscapes. Mosquitoes were identified to species level with Aedes trivittatus (Coquillet) and Aedes vexons (Meigen) dominating the collection totals. The best publicly available spatial data on landscape and demographic attributes were collated and included land cover, human census, soils, floodplain, elevation, wetlands, hydrography, roads, and vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery. Spatial processing was carried out to organize landscape attributes for statistical comparison with abundance data from the potentially important West Nile virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, WNV) vector species Ae. vexans and Ae. trivittatus. Landscape parameters shown to be significantly correlated with mosquito counts included soil hydrological properties, presence in floodplain, wetland areas, and deciduous and bottomland forest cover. Data on temperature and precipitation were used to investigate the climatic influence on the temporal occurrence of mosquito population abundances. Late spring rain provided ample moisture for mosquito development, but low temperatures delayed widespread emergence of Ae. trivittatus and Ae. vexans until June 2003. Landscape and climatic impacts on adult mosquito population distributions were demonstrated, and these results could form the basis for the development of a spatiotemporal modeling framework that would inform anthropogenic mosquito control and vector-borne disease surveillance.

We show that a simple estimate of the vertical velocity of convective updrafts in a global climate model reproduces observed land-ocean differences in convective intensity. Changes in convective intensity in a doubled CO2 simulation are small because the tropical lapse rate tends to follow a moist adiabatic profile. However, updrafts strengthen by ∼11 m s-1 with warming in the lightning-producing regions of continental convective storms, primarily due to an upward shift in the freezing level. For the western United States, drying in the warmer climate reduces the frequency of lightning-producing storms that initiate forest fires, but the strongest storms occur 26% more often. For the central-eastern United States, stronger updrafts combined with weaker wind shear suggest little change in severe storm occurrence with warming, but the most severe storms occur more often.

However, in spite of these advantages, a wide array of barriers prevents the realisation of these projects. They compete with other CDM options which lead to cheaper GHG emissions reductions but which do not provide as much opportunities for sustainable development in developing countries. Taking into account that, in contrast to GHG benefits, sustainability benefits are not valued in the market place and that article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol envisages two objectives for the CDM (cost-effective emissions reductions and contribution to sustainability), this market mechanism might be leading to a ""market failure"" in RE-CDM projects. This paper explores the different barriers affecting the implementation of RE-CDM projects and proposes and analyses several policies and measures that could be implemented to encourage their deployment by tackling those obstacles. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Ethanol and fatty acid (m)ethylester (biodiesel) as well as diesel produced from biomass by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis are modern biomass-based transportation fuels. Currently crops generating starch, sugar or oil are the basis for transport fuel production. Modern biomass can be used for the generation of electricity and heat. Brief summaries of the basic concepts involved in the thermochemical conversions of biomass fuels are presented. The percentage share of biomass was 62.1% of total renewable energy sources in 1995. The reduction of greenhouse gases pollution is the main advantage of utilizing biomass energy.","Conversion; Modern biomass; Modernization","Combustion; Energy conversion; Ethanol; Fatty acids; Modernization; Photosynthesis; Animal waste material; Energy conversion facilities; Transportation fuels; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548437010

Rural bioenergy is still the predominant form of energy used by people in the less developed countries, and bioenergy from biomass accounts for about 15% of the world's primary energy consumption and about 38% of the primary energy consumption in developing countries. Furthermore, bioenergy often accounts for more than 90% of the total rural energy supplies in some developing countries. Earth life in rural areas of the world has changed dramatically over time. Industrial development in developing countries, coming at a time of low cost plentiful oil supplies, has resulted in greater reliance on the source of rural bioenergy than is true in the developed countries. In developed countries, there is a growing trend towards employing modern technologies and efficient bioenergy conversion using a range of biofuels, which are becoming cost wise competitive with fossil fuels. Currently, much attention has been a major focus on renewable alternatives in the developing countries. Renewable energy can be particularly appropriate for developing countries. In rural areas, particularly in remote locations, transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative. Renewable energy can facilitate economic and social development in communities but only if the projects are intelligently designed and carefully planned with local input and cooperation. Particularly in poor rural areas, the costs of renewable energy projects will absorb a significant part of participants' small incomes. Bio-fuels are important because they replace petroleum fuels. Biomass and biofuels can be used as a substitute for fossil fuels to generate heat, power and/or chemicals. Generally speaking, biofuels are generally considered as offering many benefits, including sustainability, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, regional development, social structure and agriculture and security of supply. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Warming and drying will likely reduce soil moisture, and this effect may be exacerbated when these factors are combined. However, elevated [CO2] may increase soil moisture contents and when combined with warming and drying may partially compensate for their effects. The response of LAI to elevated [CO2] and warming will be closely tied to soil moisture status and may mitigate or exacerbate the effects of global change on soil moisture. Using open-top chambers (4-m diameter), the interactive effects of elevated [CO2], warming, and differential irrigation on soil moisture availability were examined in the OCCAM (Old-Field Community Climate and Atmospheric Manipulation) experiment at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in eastern Tennessee. Warming consistently reduced soil moisture contents and this effect was exacerbated by reduced irrigation. However, elevated [CO2] mitigated the effects of warming and drying on soil moisture. LAI was determined using an AccuPAR ceptometer and both the leaf area duration (LAD) and canopy size were increased by irrigation and elevated [CO2]. Changes in LAI were closely linked to soil moisture status. The climate of the southeastern United States is predicted to be warmer and drier in the future, and this research suggests that although elevated [CO2] will ameliorate the effects of warming and drying, losses of soil moisture will cause declines in the LAI of old field ecosystems in the future. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Ecosystems; Interactions; OCCAM (Old-Field Community Climate and Atmospheric Manipulation)","canopy architecture; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; experimental study; leaf area index; old field; soil moisture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349096529

On the contrary, using organic lanthanide complexes it is possible to populate the excited state levels of the emitting ion through an efficient intramolecular energy transfer from the optically excited ligands, which act as light-harvesting antennae. With the aim of studying and maximizing the transfer to lanthanide metals, we have synthesized oligothiophene and thiophenefluorene ligands bearing carboxylate clamps able to complex erbium and other lanthanide 3+ ions. The complexes of {4′-(hydroxycarbonyl)methyl-[2,2′;5′,2″]terthiophen-3′-yl}acetic acid and 9-(hydroxycarbonyl)-methyl-2,7-dithien-2-yl-[fluoren-9-yl-]acetic acid with Er3+ and different ancillary ligands have been prepared and their optical properties were carefully studied. Moreover, relaxation dynamics measurements have been carried out on all complexes in order to determine emission lifetimes, which result to be of the order of magnitude 2 μs. Quantum chemical calculations have been performed to explain optical absorption data in terms of different coordination types. The complexes containing phenanthroline/pyridine are modelled by adding to the dianion of the ligand one univalent/divalent counterion. The absorption spectra computed in this way are in close agreement with experiment, and the univalent→divalent theoretical wavelength shift goes in the right direction. The addition of a counterion has an even bigger effect on the triplet states, and hence on their matching with the emitting states of the ion. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To capture the distinct susceptibilities associated with lack of infrastructure, potential property loss, and gross human exposure, we develop an integration of climate change projections and poverty, wealth, and population metrics. Our analysis shows that most nations of the world are threatened by the interaction of regional climatic changes with one or more relevant socioeconomic factors. Nations that have the highest levels of poverty, wealth, and population face greater relative exposure in those dimensions. However, for each of those socioeconomic indicators, spatial heterogeneity in projected climate change determines the overall international pattern of socioclimatic exposure.

Jackson Street, Louisville, KY 40202, United States","The interaction of daunomycin with sodium dodecyl sulfate and Triton X-100 micelles was investigated as a model for the hydrophobic contribution to the free energy of DNA intercalation reactions. Measurements of visible absorbance, fluorescence lifetime, steady-state fluorescence emission intensity, and fluorescence anisotropy indicate that the anthraquinone ring partitions into the hydrophobic micelle interior. Fluorescence quenching experiments using both steady-state and lifetime measurements demonstrate reduced accessibility of daunomycin in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles to the anionic quencher iodide and to the neutral quencher acrylamide. Quenching of daunomycin fluorescence by iodide in Triton X-100 micelles was similar to that seen with free daunomycin. Studies of the energetics of the interaction of daunomycin with micelles by fluorescence and absorbance titration methods and by isothermal titration calorimetry in the presence of excess micelles revealed that association with sodium dodecyl sulfate and Triton X-100 micelles is driven by a large negative enthalpy. Association of the drug with both types of micelles also has a favorable entropic contribution, which is larger in magnitude for Triton X-100 micelles than for sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles. The thermodynamic profile for the interaction of daunomycin with both types of micelles is characteristic of the ""nonclassical"" hydrophobic effect. The enthalpy for the interaction of daunomycin with sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles increases nonlinearly with temperature, indicating a positive (and temperature dependent) heat capacity change. The binding isotherm for daunomycin association with sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles was cooperative, with a Hill coefficient of 1.6. The cooperative behavior and the positive heat capacity change suggest that the drug alters micelle size or imposes order on the hydrocarbon interior of the micelle. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Detergents; DNA; Fluorescence; Hydrophobicity; Micelles; Quenching; Fluorescence emission intensity; Sodium dodecyl sulfate; Triton X-100 micelles; Molecular interactions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348960392

However, the same conclusion may not apply to 'indirect' and 'economy-wide' rebound effects. Here, several authors suggest that improved energy efficiency may increase energy consumption in the medium to long term, a view that undermines the rationale for energy efficiency as an instrument of climate-related energy policy and has been ardently debated. One of the main reasons behind the debate is the lack of a rigorous theoretical framework that can describe the mechanisms and consequences of the rebound effect at the macro-economic level. Proponents of the rebound effect point to 'suggestive' evidence from a variety of areas including economic history, econometric measurements of productivity and macro-economic modelling. This evidence base is relatively small, highly technical, lacks transparency, rests upon contested theoretical assumptions and is inconclusive. This paper provides an accessible summary of the state of knowledge on this issue and shows how separate areas of research can provide relevant insights: namely neoclassical models of economic growth, computable general equilibrium (CGE) modelling and alternative models for policy evaluation. The paper provides a synopsis of how each approach may be used to explain, model and estimate the macro-economic rebound effect, criticisms that have been suggested against each, and explanations for diversity in quantitative estimates. Conclusions suggest that the importance of the macro-economic rebound effect should not be underestimated. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

These stages are still widely used across Europe for stratigraphic correlations and palaeoclimatic studies. Despite their extensive use, the validity of this continental correlation scheme for the Plio- and Pleistocene has never been tested in the area where they were originally proposed: the Roer Valley Graben (RVG). The fluvial and deltaic depositional setting in this area is controlled by a complex pattern of tectonic and climatic processes, which strongly complicates the definition of stages and sub-stages of regional or supra-regional significance. Here, the original palynological data used to define the Praetiglian, Reuverian, Brunssumian, Susterian, and 'Linne' (sub-)stages are assessed and compared to new borehole data. With a multivariate (Correspondence Analysis) approach we show that most of these stages cannot be distinguished by numerical analysis of the pollen assemblages. A tripartition of pollen assemblages is possible, which results in a cooler Pleistocene cluster, warm-temperate to sub-tropical Pliocene cluster, and a warm and relatively dry Late Miocene to Early Pliocene cluster. However, no further stages, sub-stages or clear climatic phases can be consistently recognized in these data. A detailed lithostratigraphic framework of the study area allows a correlation of the sections independent of the pollen data. Results confirm the numerical analyses and furthermore point to a strong lithological (depositional) bias on the pollen assemblages. Variations in the abundance of Sequoia and Taxodium, originally used to define the Brunssumian/Reuverian transition and Brunssumian A-C sub-stages, are shown to represent mostly local changes. The number and absolute percentage of the fluctuations in Sequoia and Taxodium abundances depend largely on the sample resolution and the site location within the RVG. Our data assessment indicates that long-distance chronostratigraphic correlations based on the original continental Neogene stages likely are invalid. Furthermore, the palaeoclimatic reconstructions that have been based on the RVG successions are largely over-interpreted. The present palaeoclimate reconstructions from the RVG reflect variations in the highly-dynamic fluvial depositional setting, taphonomic effects and environmental conditions, including climate. A sequence-stratigraphic approach combined with the analysis of interfingering marine sediments is potentially better suited to establish absolute ages and associated climatic conditions of the Neogene deposits within the RVG. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Atmospheric inputs of dissociation products of strong acids (HNO 3 and H2SO4) and bases (NH3) alter surface seawater alkalinity, pH, and inorganic carbon storage. We quantify the biogeochemical impacts by using atmosphere and ocean models. The direct acid/base flux to the ocean is predominately acidic (reducing total alkalinity) in the temperate Northern Hemisphere and alkaline in the tropics because of ammonia inputs. However, because most of the excess ammonia is nitrified to nitrate (NO3-) in the upper ocean, the effective net atmospheric input is acidic almost everywhere. The decrease in surface alkalinity drives a net air-sea efflux of CO2, reducing surface dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); the alkalinity and DIC changes mostly offset each other, and the decline in surface pH is small. Additional impacts arise from nitrogen fertilization, leading to elevated primary production and biological DIC drawdown that reverses in some places the sign of the surface pH and air-sea CO2 flux perturbations. On a global scale, the alterations in surface water chemistry from anthropogenic nitrogen and sulfur deposition are a few percent of the acidification and DIC increases due to the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2. However, the impacts are more substantial in coastal waters, where the ecosystem responses to ocean acidification could have the most severe implications for mankind. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Alkalinity; Biogeochemistry; Global change; Nutrient eutrophication; Ocean chemistry","carbon; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; inorganic carbon; nitric acid; nitrogen; sulfur; sulfuric acid; unclassified drug; acid base balance; acidification; agriculture; alkalinity; article; atmospheric deposition; biogeochemical cycling; coastal waters; combustion; ecosystem; Europe; human; nitrogen deposition; North America; pH measurement; priority journal; sea; Southeast Asia; tropics; Acid Rain; Air Pollutants; Algae; Animals; Atmosphere; Carbon Compounds, Inorganic; Ecosystem; Eutrophication; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Models, Biological; Nitrogen; Oceans and Seas; Phytoplankton; Sulfur; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35548936098

Plant species affect ecosystem carbon uptake via biomass production and carbon release via decomposition processes. Differences in their responses to climate change and effects on ecosystem carbon cycling processes may thus feedback to the atmospheric carbon balance and the climate at a global scale. Hierarchical species classifications based on plant growth forms are widely used in cold, northern biomes to generalize and predict these differences. This review investigates the usefulness of broad (vascular, non-vascular), intermediate (woody, non-woody) and narrow (evergreen shrubs, deciduous shrubs, graminoids, forbs) plant growth-form-based groups in these biomes for predicting plant responses to climate change and effects on the main processes of the full carbon cycle by looking at the similarity of species within growth-form groups and the consistency of differences among groups under changing environmental conditions. 2. Production responses to climate change differ between broad growth-form groups, but their opposite responses do not imply that the responses of non-vascular plants are consistently negative. Within vascular growth forms, production responses to climate change are not always similar among species under identical conditions, and average differences among narrow vascular growth forms are usually small. Moreover, differences in production responses among growth forms strongly depend upon the duration of the study, the region and the ecosystem type. 3. Species within narrow growth forms show a high similarity for a range of leaf litter chemistry variables and differences among narrow growth forms are often large and consistent. However, differences in leaf litter decomposability are large between broad growth-form groups, but small and environment-dependent among important narrow vascular growth forms. Litter feedback effects to plant production vary among narrow vascular growth forms, but the differences strongly depend on the study duration. Data on the climate dependence of growth-form differences regarding this aspect of the carbon cycle are currently lacking. 4. Synthesis: Overall, the usefulness of growth-form-based groups clearly differs between carbon cycling processes. Different aggregation levels are therefore needed for different processes. For most processes there is evidence that the differences among growth forms depend on environmental conditions, which hampers their use for generalizations and modelling. Future studies should therefore explicitly test for differences among growth-form groups and aim to unravel the dependence of growth-form differences on environmental conditions. © 2007 The Author.","Cold biomes; Cryptogams; Hierarchical classification; Litter decomposition; Litter effects; Peatlands; Plant functional types; Plant production; Plant traits; Tundra","carbon balance; climate change; growth rate; leaf litter; lichen; peatland; tundra; Tracheophyta",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35448964310

Consumption of contaminated fish is the primary route of methylmercury exposure in humans and is detrimental to health.

However, factors other than mercury deposition are important for mercury bioaccumulation in fish. In the lakes of Isle Royale, U.S.A., reduced rates of sulfate deposition since the Clean Air Act of 1970 have caused mercury concentrations in fish to decline to levels that are safe for human consumption, even without a discernible decrease in mercury deposition.

To assess the effects of increased atmospheric CO2 on bacterial, fungal and nematode communities in the rhizosphere, Carex arenaria (a nonmycorrhizal plant species) and Festuca rubra (a mycorrhizal plant species) were grown in three dune soils under controlled soil temperature and moisture conditions, while subjecting the aboveground compartment to defined atmospheric conditions differing in CO2 concentrations (350 and 700 μL L-1). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis methods were used to examine effects on the size and structure of rhizosphere communities. Multivariate analysis of community profiles showed that bacteria were most affected by elevated CO2, and fungi and nematodes to a lesser extent. The influence of elevated CO2 was plant dependent, with the mycorrhizal plant (F. rubra) exerting a greater influence on bacterial and fungal communities. Biomarker data indicated that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) may play an important role in the observed soil community responses. Effects of elevated CO2 were also soil dependent, with greater influence observed in the more organic-rich soils, which also supported higher levels of AMF colonization. These results indicate that responses of soil-borne communities to elevated CO2 are different for bacteria, fungi and nematodes and dependent on the plant type and soil nutrient availability. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bacterial communities; Carex arenaria; Climate change; Elevated CO2; Festuca rubra; Fungal communities; Nematode communities; PCR-DGGE; Real-time PCR; Rhizosphere","arbuscular mycorrhiza; carbon dioxide; carbon fixation; climate change; community response; polymerase chain reaction; rhizosphere; Arbuscular; Arenaria (Caryophyllaceae); Bacteria (microorganisms); Carex arenaria; Festuca rubra; Fungi; Nematoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348853416

This paper summarizes the findings of 5 years of research on the sea breeze in southern France and related mesoscale transport and dilution of pollutants within the Field Experiment to Constraint Models of Atmospheric Pollution and Emissions Transport (ESCOMPTE) program held in June and July 2001. This paper provides an overview of the experimental and numerical challenges identified before the ESCOMPTE field experiment and summarizes the key findings made in observation, simulation, and theory. We specifically address the role of large-scale atmospheric circulation to local ozone vertical distribution and the mesoscale processes driving horizontal advection of pollutants and vertical transport and mixing via entrainment at the top of the sea breeze or at the front and venting along the sloped terrain. The crucial importance of the interactions between processes of various spatial and temporal scales is thus highlighted. The advances in numerical modeling and forecasting of sea breeze events and ozone pollution episodes in southern France are also underlined. Finally, we conclude and point out some open research questions needing further investigation.

For this, a free-base porphyrin was covalently linked to a fullerene entity bearing a pyridine ligand, and was subsequently utilized to coordinate ferric porphyrins bearing different peripheral substituents. The newly formed triads were characterized by spectral methods and the structures were deduced from DFT B3LYP/3-21G(*) methods. Free-energy calculations performed with use of the redox potential and emission data suggested the occurrence of sequential electron transfer from singlet excited freebase porphyrin to the covalently linked fullerene, followed by an electron transfer from fullerene anion radical to ferric porphyrin, ultimately generating free-base porphyrin cation radical and ferrous porphyrin as the electron-transfer products, anticipating the generation of long-lived charge-separated species as a consequence of distant separation between the oxidized and reduced species. Time-resolved emission and nanosecond transient absorption techniques were used to obtain kinetic and spectral evidence of electron transfer. Attempts were made to obtain the lifetime of the final charge separated species by monitoring the decay of H 2P .+ at 620 nm. Lifetimes of the order of 20 μs were obtained; however, they were found to be overlapped with the long-living triplet states of porphyrin of similar lifetimes at the monitoring wavelength. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Binding strategy; Charge stabilization; Ferric porphyrins; Spectral methods; Covalent bonds; Density functional theory; Fullerenes; Supramolecular chemistry; Porphyrins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547686305

In this study, a large number of data on the speed-time trace of motorcycles were sampled from various kinds of roads in 5 cities in China. Based on a series of criterion numbers defined, the driving character of motorcycles in the real-road conditions of China was obtained. With the aid of a specially designed program, an emission testing cycle that can indicate the driving characteristics of motorcycle in the real-road conditions was synthesized, and the exhaust emission tests of 20 motorcycles under the synchronized cycle and WMTC were carried out based on a CVS system and a motorcycle chassis dynamometer. The results show that although there do exist differences in some criterion numbers between the real-road condition and WMTC, such as proportion of idling mode, mean speed, mean running speed and the average acceleration and deceleration rates, the driving behaviors are similar. The results of exhaust emission tests indicate that the emission values of motorcycles under the synchronized cycle and WMTC have a relatively strong correlation. This means that WMTC can be introduced as a standard motorcycle emission test regulation into China.","Driving character of motorcycles; Emission performance in real-road condition; Synthesized emission testing cycle; WMTC","Dynamometers; Environmental testing; Exhaust gases; Gas emissions; China; Exhaust emission; Real road conditions; Synchronized cycle; Worldwide motorcycle testing cycle; Motorcycles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949127010

ABA application resulted in significantly lower CO2 assimilation rates (A) under water deficit in plants from the wet climate population, whereas there were no significant changes in this parameter in the dry climate population. On the other hand, ABA application significantly decreased the dry shoot biomass, stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration rate (E), and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and it significantly increased the leaf mass per area (LMA), root/shoot ratio (Rs), fine root/total root ratio (Ft), WUE, ABA content, and the superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and catalase (CAT) activities under water-deficit conditions in the dry climate population, whereas ABA application did not significantly affect these parameters in the wet climate population. The results clearly demonstrated that sensitivity to an exogenous ABA application is population-dependent in P. asperata. Direct evidence is presented that variation in physiological mechanisms rather than different rates of ABA absorption explain the population differentiation in the sensitivity to exogenous ABA, and that the physiological basis for the amplified response to water deficit caused by exogenous ABA, present mainly in the dry climate population, is related to internal ABA accumulation. These results provide evidence for adaptive differentiation between populations of P. asperata, and they support the expected relationship between environmental heterogeneity and the magnitude of plastic responses in plant populations. © The Author [2007].

The vertical motion of fluid particles, especially the induced vertical mixing in these currents, is partially responsible for the ocean thermohaline circulation, and thus plays a role in the global climate dynamics. First, a reduced dynamic system for slow variables is derived for a nonautonomous multiscale system. The reduced system, still nonautonomous, is the original system restricted to a centre-like nonautonomous invariant manifold (so-called slow manifold) which holds slow motions of the system. An algorithm is also presented to obtain an approximation of the nonautonomous slow manifold. A novelty here is that the reduction principle applies to nonautonomous multiscale systems which satisfy conditions that are true only locally in space (as in many physical cases). This makes the reduction principle applicable to real physical systems. Then, this invariant manifold reduction principle is applied to an approximate conceptual Lagrangian model of gravity currents and a reduced nonautonomous system for slow vertical motion is obtained. This reduced system may be useful as a conceptual tractable tool for understanding some features of vertical mixing in unsteady gravity currents. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The agreement between the PEMS and the FRM varied depending on the pollutant and the particular PEMS tested for both the BUG and chassis dynamometer testing. The best performing PEMS for both the BUG and chassis testing was within ∼12% for NOx of the FRM. For the BUG testing, several PEMS showed agreement with the FRM within ∼5% for CO2. For the chassis dynamometer testing, the best PEMS showed agreement typically within ∼5% for CO2. PM measurements for the BUG testing were low compared to the FRM, with the best measurements ∼20% lower. For the chassis testing, two PM PEMS showed a good correlation but a high bias, while the correlation was worse for the other two PEMS.

Historically, transport and electrical power have been treated as independent sectors, but, in the case where hydrogen fuel cells are extensively used in motive applications, complex inter-dependencies arise between the two (e.g., production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water, alternative use of hydrogen for electricity storage and subsequent regeneration). The THESIS model characterises a country's (or region's) primary energy flows, energy distribution system, secondary energy production processes (e.g., electricity generation), and end-use consumption, including a major sub-model of the transport sector which keeps track of the size of vehicle fleets and the penetration rate of alternative fuels. The model enables the comparison of varying strategies for hydrogen introduction against the metrics of overall energy consumption, demands for primary fuel, and carbon dioxide emissions reductions.

In this paper, we highlight concepts and strategies aimed at controlling major biotic constraints affecting wheat in intensive production systems and present emerging challenges, with a special attention to the developing world. Disease epidemics result from the combination of inoculum, favorable environment, and host susceptibility. Changes in cropping systems as a result of adoption of conservation agriculture may have serious implications. Necrotrophic pathogens such as those responsible for tan spot or septorias are likely to emerge, and Fusarium head blight may increase. However, resistance breeding combined with rotations, timely sowing, and irrigation or even fungicide utilization, if affordable, are part of integrated crop management practices that can minimize losses. In South Asia, the effect of spot blotch, a devastating foliar disease caused by Cochliobolus sativus, can be minimized by reducing physiological stress through timely sowing and adequate use of fertilizers, which demonstrates the complex relationships among crop physiology, disease resistance, and yield. Although some root rots that induce premature death of tillers in cooler high-yielding humid environments can be important, the dryland crown rot (Fusarium spp.), common root rot (C. sativus), and the cereal nematode (Heterodera spp. and Pratylenchus spp.) should not be ignored. These are all known to be much more damaging under suboptimal moisture (rainfed or supplementary irrigation), particularly where plant growth is stressed. Climate change is likely to modify the wheat disease spectrum in some regions, and pathogens or pests considered unimportant today may turn out to be potential new threats in future. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Foliar blights; Fusarium; Root rots; Rusts; Yield","Cochliobolus; Cochliobolus sativus; Fusarium; Heterodera; Pratylenchus; Triticum aestivum; Uredinales",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548566964

We reviewed published information of the likely health consequences of climate change in mountain regions, especially the findings of a workshop for countries in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region, organized by the World Health Organization, World Meteorological Organization, United Nations Environment Programme, and United Nations Development Programme. The main climate-related risks in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region include the expansion of vector-borne diseases as pathogens take advantage of new habitats in altitudes that were formerly unsuitable. Diarrheal diseases could become more prevalent with changes in freshwater quality and availability. More extreme rainfall events are likely to increase the number of floods and landslides with consequent death and injuries. A unique risk is sudden floods from high glacier lakes, which cause substantial destruction and loss of life. Because glaciers are the main source of freshwater for upland regions and downstream countries, the long-term reduction in annual glacier snowmelt is expected to heighten existing water insecurity in these areas. Climate change also is bringing some benefits to mountain populations, including milder winters and longer growing seasons. Populations in mountain regions have unique combinations of vulnerabilities to climate change. The extent of the health impacts experienced will depend on the effectiveness of public health efforts to identify and implement low-cost preparedness and response measures, and on the speed at which emissions of greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced. © 2007 Ecohealth Journal Consortium.","Climate change; Hindu Kush-Himalayas; Human health; Mountains","fresh water; rain; altitude; climate change; diarrhea; flood tide; food availability; glacier; greenhouse gas; growing season; habitat; health hazard; human; nonhuman; pathogenesis; population; priority journal; public health; review; water availability; water quality; winter; world health organization",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35048896034

For tropical reef corals, the contribution of juveniles to population dynamics is strongly determined by their growth rates, which are inversely proportional to the duration of this life stage and the risks of mortality, yet empirical estimates of this important trait are surprisingly rare. Based largely on results published before 1990, it is often assumed that juvenile corals ≤50 mm diameter grow ∼10 to 34 mm yr-1, and therefore are ∼1.5 to 5.0 yr old. In contrast, results presented here show that juvenile corals (≤40 mm diameter) in St. John, US Virgin Islands, have grown at much slower rates on shallow reefs (&lt;9 m depth) where annual censuses have been completed for 9 yr (1996 to 2005). For nearly a decade, juvenile corals in this location have maintained overall mean growth rates of only 3 mm yr-1, or 6 mm yr-1 for the subset of colonies that grew ≥ 0 mm yr-1. Therefore, most of these juvenile corals have grown at rates consistent with an upper age estimate of 7 to 13 yr, which is 1.4 to 8.7 times older than estimates derived from often-cited growth rates. This discrepancy has important implications, because it suggests that the recruitment dynamics of coral populations may function over time scales longer than are usually considered.

The installations tested included plants used for: combustion (brown coal, heavy fuel oil, wood), cement production, glass production, asphalt mixing, and processing plants for natural stones and sand, ceramics, metallurgy, chemical production, spray painting, wood processing/chip drying, poultry farming and waste treatment. In addition waste gas samples were taken from small-scale combustion units, like domestic stoves, firing lignite briquettes or wood. In total 303 individual measurement results were obtained during 106 different measurement campaigns. In the study it was found that in more than 70% of the individual emission measurement results from industrial plants and domestic stoves the PM10 portion amounted to more than 90% and the PM2.5 portion between 50% and 90% of the total PM (particulate matter) emission. For thermal industrial processes the PM1.0 portion constituted between 20% and 60% of the total PM emission. Typical particle size distributions for different processes were presented as cumulative frequency distributions and as frequency distributions. The particle size distributions determined for the different plant types show interesting similarities and differences depending on whether the processes are thermal, mechanical, chemical or mixed. Consequently, for the groups of plant investigated, a major finding of this study has been that the particle size distribution is a characteristic of the industrial process. Attempts to correlate particle size distributions of different plants to different gas cleaning technologies did not lead to usable results. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper deals with the complex interaction between agricultural trade, production, land-use change and environmental consequences on the basis of four different scenarios. In these scenarios, major uncertainties from trade liberalization to maintained regional trade blocks are considered. Although economic growth is apparent in liberalizing scenarios, we also found that environmental threats of climate and nutrients to the sustainability of the global agricultural practices pose new challenges to future food production. Since most of the environmental threats will be experienced in tropical regions where most of the increase in population and food and feed demand is expected, an indirect pressure on the European agricultural market is likely. For the coming decades European agriculture is expected to decrease slightly, especially in liberalizing worlds. New demand for land for biofuels, carbon plantations and the global food market, will prevent the European agricultural sector from being eliminated. Moreover, current EU policies already result in less vulnerable farmers to additional liberalizing policies. Therefore, we conclude the global context is important for future European land use, especially in futures where environmental policies are ignored. Therefore, we conclude that environmental and trade agreements must be sufficiently integrated or coordinated, to assure they work together to improve the environment and attain the benefits of free trade. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

That is, it examines the extent to which rare isotopes (D, 13C, 15N, 18O, etc.) bond with or near each other rather than with the sea of light isotopes in which they swim. Abundances of isotopic 'clumps' in natural materials are influenced by a wide variety of factors. In most cases, their concentrations approach (within ca. 1%, relative) the amount expected for a random distribution of isotopes. Deviations from this stochastic distribution result from: enhanced thermodynamic stability of heavy-isotope 'clumps'; slower kinetics of reactions requiring the breakage of bonds between heavy isotopes; the mass dependence of diffusive and thermo-gravitational fractionations; mixing between components that differ from one another in bulk isotopic composition; biochemical and photochemical fractionations that may reflect combinations of these simpler physical mechanisms; and, in some cases, other processes we do not yet understand. Although clumped isotope geochemistry is a young field, several seemingly promising applications have already emerged. Most importantly, it appears that proportions of 13C-18O bonds in carbonate minerals are sensitive to their growth temperatures, independent of bulk isotopic composition. Thus, 'clumped isotope' analysis of ancient carbonates can be used as a quantitative paleothermometer that requires no assumptions about the δ18O of waters from which carbonates grew. This approach has been used to reconstruct marine temperatures across the Phanerozoic (reaching back to the Silurian), terrestrial ground temperatures across the Cenozoic, thermal histories of aqueously altered meteorites, among other applications. Clumped isotope geochemistry is also placing new constraints on the atmospheric budget and stratospheric photochemistry of CO2, and should be capable of placing analogous new constraints on the budgets of other atmospheric gases. Finally, this field could be extended to encompass sulfates, volatile hydrocarbons, organic moieties and other materials. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The overall decomposition measured as carbon mineralization, decomposition of different carbon constituents, and the dynamics of nitrogen mineralization and the microbial community, are reported. Ammonia emissions at 67°C were more than double those at lower temperatures, and they were lowest at 40°C. The decomposition rate, measured as CO 2 emission, was highest at 55°C. Decomposition of crude fat was slower at 40°C than at 55 and 67°C. The peak in microbial biomass was largest in the run at 40°C, where substantial differences were seen in the microbial community structure and succession compared to thermophilic temperatures. Biowaste composting can be optimized to obtain both a high decomposition rate and low ammonia emissions by controlling the process at about 55°C in the initial, high-rate stage. To reduce ammonia emissions it seems worthwhile to reduce the temperature after an initial high-temperature stage.

The construction of large digesters to provide such extended residence times is capital-intensive and thus the implementation of anaerobic digestion has remained economically prohibitive. A review of the literature suggests that recent developments in sludge preconditioning technologies have substantially reduced the sludge residence time requirement to the order of 7 days. Also, the preconditioned sludges have been reported to hold potential for higher methane recovery with reduced excess sludge production requiring disposal. Such advantages, coupled with escalating fuel prices and the introduction of carbon credits under the Kyoto Accord, have significantly improved the economics of anaerobic digestion. As the cost of sludge management varies from one mill to another, mill-specific economic assessment of anaerobic digestion could identify cost-saving opportunities. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A small area study was performed across electoral wards in Great Britain of mean annual black smoke (BS) and SO2 concentrations (from 1966) and subsequent all-cause and cause-specific mortality using random effect models within a Bayesian framework adjusted for social deprivation and urban/rural classification. Different latencies and changes in associations over time were assessed. Results: Significant associations were found between BS and SO2 concentrations and mortality. The effects were stronger for respiratory illness than other causes of mortality for the most recent exposure periods (shorter latency times) and most recent mortality period (lower pollutant concentrations). In pooled analysis across four sequential 4 year mortality periods (1982-98), adjusted excess relative risk for respiratory mortality was 3.6% (95% CI 2.6% to 4.5%) per 10 μg/m3 BS and 13.2% (95% CI 11.5% to 14.9%) per 10 ppb SO2, and in the most recent period (1994-8) it was 19.3% (95% CI 5.1% to 35.7%) and 21.7% (95% CI 2.9% to 38.5%), respectively.

We hypothesized that in addition to, but independently of, those mechanisms, the parenchyma tissue responds to hypercapnia and hypocapnia by relaxing and contracting, respectively, thereby improving local matching of ventilation (V̇A) to perfusion (Q̇). Twenty adult rats were slowly ventilated with modified Krebs solution (rate = 3 min-1, 37°C, open chest) to produce unperfused living lung preparations free of intra-airway surface forces. The solution was gassed with 21% O2, balance N 2, and CO2 varied to produce alveolar hypocapnia (PCO 2 = 26.1 ± 2.4 mmHg, pH = 7.56 ± 0.04) or hypercapnia (PCO2 = 55.0 ± 2.3 mmHg, pH = 7.23 ± 0.02). The results show that lung recoil, as indicated from airway pressure measured during a breathhold following a large volume inspiration, is reduced ∼30% when exposed to hypercapnia vs. hypocapnia (P &lt; 0.0001, paired t-test), but stress relaxation and flow-dependent airway resistance were unaltered. Increasing CO2 from hypo- to hypercapnic levels caused a substantial, significant decrease in the quasi-static pressure-volume relationship, as measured after inspiration and expiration of several tidal volumes, but hysteresis was unaltered. Furthermore, addition of the glycolytic inhibitor NaF abolished CO2 effects on lung recoil. The results suggest that lung parenchyma tissue relaxation, arising from active elements in response to increasing alveolar CO2, is independent of (and apparently in parallel with) passive tissue elements and may actively contribute to V̇A/Q̇ matching.","Alveolar; Pulmonary mechanics; Ventilation-to-perfusion matching","carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; fluoride sodium; airway pressure; airway resistance; alveolar bone; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; female; hypercapnia; hypocapnia; liquid; lung parenchyma; lung ventilation; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; animal; breathing mechanics; drug effect; inhalation; liquid ventilation; lung; lung compliance; pathophysiology; perfusion; pH; physiology; Airway Resistance; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Female; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hypercapnia; Hypocapnia; Inhalation; Liquid Ventilation; Lung; Lung Compliance; Male; Perfusion; Rats; Respiratory Mechanics; Sodium Fluoride",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547621242

In particular, energy is extracted from a material when its absorption of a photon is followed by emission of a photon of higher energy. This up-conversion requires some of the solid's electrons to garner energy from atomic vibrations. Here, two schemes for laser cooling via localized electronic states are addressed. The first scheme utilizes the ground state and an excited state of a localized center. In this two-level scheme, the cooling process is initiated with photon absorption in the extreme low-energy tail of a localized state's vibrationally broadened absorption spectrum. The subsequent atomic relaxation transfers energy of especially large vibratory atomic strains into electrical energy that is then extracted via photon emission. The second scheme involves the ground state and two excited states of a localized center. Cooling is facilitated when (i) the photoexcitation of an electron from its ground state to the lower excited level is followed by (ii) electron-phonon-induced promotion to the uppermost level and the subsequent (iii) return of the electron to its ground state with emission of a photon of higher energy than that of the absorbed photon. However, competing relaxation processes contribute to heating. The net cooling power per unit volume is maximized for both schemes, thereby determining characteristics of localized electronic systems that foster optical cooling. The cooling power per unit volume is greatest at high temperatures and falls rapidly as the thermal energy is reduced below each system's luminescence Stokes shift. Moreover, cooling via the three-level scheme is most effective when (i) the energy separation between excited states is smaller than the thermal energy and (ii) the degeneracy of the highest-lying excited state is much larger than that of the center's middle level. These restrictive conditions appear to be satisfied for the three-level systems that to date exhibit laser cooling at or somewhat below room temperature: severely localized crystal-field-split f -electron states of rare-earth ions. © 2007 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447120223

The results of the analysis show that a hydrogen FCV would not be cost competitive until 2050 without a more severe carbon tax than the government's planned 2400 JPY/t-C carbon tax. However, as the carbon tax rate increases, instead of conventional vehicles including the gasoline hybrid electric vehicle, hydrogen FCVs gain market penetration earlier and more. By assuming a more severe carbon tax rate, such as 10 000 JPY/t-C, the market share of hydrogen FCVs approaches the governmental goal. This suggests that cheaper vehicle cost and hydrogen cost than those targeted in the roadmap should be attained or subsidies to hydrogen FCV and hydrogen refueling station will be necessary for achieving the goal of earlier market penetration. © 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Carbon tax; Energy systems analysis; Fuel cell vehicle; MARKAL; Market penetration","Carbon; Fuel cells; Gasoline; Regional planning; Storage battery vehicles; Carbon tax; Energy systems analysis; Fuel cell vehicle; MARKAL; Market penetration; Marketing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249887120

Especially, all-trans-retinal, α-diketones and lipid-derived aldehydes including 4-hydroxynonenal were excellent substrates showing low Km values (0.3-5.5 μM). Immunohistochemical and reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed that AKR1C15 is highly expressed in rat bronchiolar Clara cells, type II alveolar cells, gastric parietal cells, the epithelial cells of the stomach and colon, and the brown adipocytes. The enzyme was not detected in cells of other rat tissues, but is consistently expressed in the vascular endothelial cells.

The 24-hr standard was lowered to 35 μg/m3 in 2006 in an effort to further reduce overall ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Identifying and quantifying sources of particulate matter affecting a particular location through source apportionment methods is now an important component of the information available to decision makers when evaluating the new standards. This literature compilation summarizes a subset of the source apportionment research and general findings on fine particulate matter in the eastern half of the United States using Positive Matrix Factorization. The results between studies are generally comparable when comparable datasets are used; however, methodologies vary considerably. Commonly identified source categories include: secondary sulfate/coal burning (sometimes over 50% of total mass), secondary organic carbon/mobile sources, crustal sources, biomass burning, nitrate, various industrial processes, and sea salt. The source apportionment tools and methodologies have passed the proof-of-concept stage and are now being used to understand the ambient composition of particulate matter for sites across the United States and the spatial relationship of sources to the receptor. Recommendations are made for further and standardized method development for source apportionment studies, and specific research areas of interest for the eastern United States are proposed.

One means of replacing coal with biomass is to co-fire biofuels in an existing coal-fired boiler. This paper presents an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of co-firing biofuels in Poland with respect to technical, environmental, economical and strategic considerations. This analysis shows that co-firing is technically and economically the most realistic option for using biofuels in the large pulverized fuel (PF) boilers in Poland. However, from an environmental perspective, co-firing of biofuels in large combined heat and power (CHP) plants and power plants provides only a small reduction in sulphur dioxide (SO2) emission per unit biofuel, since these plants usually apply some form of desulphurization technology. In order to maximize the SO2 emission reduction, biofuels should be used in district heating plants. However, co-fired combustion plants can handle disruptions in biofuel supply and are insensitive to moderate changes in fuel prices, which makes them suitable utilizers of biofuels from perennial energy crops. Co-firing could therefore play an important role in stimulating perennial crop production. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we have tested the hypothesis that changes in agricultural practices in Poland have changed the riverine nitrogen export from the rivers Oder and Vistula to the Baltic Sea. We calculated agricultural long-term nitrogen budgets (1960-2000) for the catchments of the Oder and the Vistula rivers. Poland went through severe economical changes in the early 1990s, which led to a drastic decrease in fertilizer consumption. The role of the calculated nitrogen surplus as an eutrophication capacitor and the potential to reduce this important capacitor to improve the environmental state of the Baltic Sea is discussed. N surplus for the entire country showed a maximum in 1980 (58 kg ha-1 sown area-1) and it dropped to 39 kg ha-1 sown area -1 in 2000. The surplus was, however, up to two times lower than that in other transitional countries, and much lower than in Western Europe with intensive agriculture. An observed decrease in nitrogen concentrations in both Polish rivers is not ascribed to drop in fertilizer use, but it results from nutrient removal in municipal wastewater treatment plants with tertiary treatment facilities. Comparison of trends in nitrogen concentrations in different transition countries indicates that factors other than reduced fertilizer application influenced the inertia of the water quality response.

It highlights the large gap between the scientific community and the general public in terms of their understanding, awareness and perception of risks associated with climate change. Awareness is driven both by environmental values or political and economic agendas; particularly important are worldviews and 'myths of nature', which have a great impact on risk perception. Attitudes are further complicated because the problem of climate change comprises a form of 'post-normal science': it needs to be viewed holistically, with consideration of the feedbacks between the climate system, the human system and ecosystems; there is large uncertainty and a plurality of legitimate perspectives; and the issue is complex and difficult or impossible to fit into a traditional linear problem-solving model. It is therefore not a rational decision for most individuals to take actions to reduce risk from climate change in the absence of collective action, yet collective action is extraordinarily difficult to achieve. The benefits of risk reduction also fall primarily upon future generations, while uncertainties mean that differences in perspective, and problems of poor communication, misinformation and unstated assumptions tend to cloud the social discourse.","Climate change; Myths of nature; Risk discourse; Risk perception; Uncertainty","Linear problems; Myths of nature; Risk discourse; Scientific community; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Feedback; Problem solving; Risk perception; Uncertainty analysis; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547514174

Here, we simulate snow cover-climate feedbacks (i.e. changes in snow cover on atmospheric heating) across the Pan-arctic over two distinct warming periods during the 20th century, 1910-1940 and 1970-2000. We offer evidence that increases in snow cover-climate feedbacks during 1970-2000 were nearly three times larger than during 1910-1940 because the recent snow-cover change occurred in spring, when radiation load is highest, rather than in autumn. Based on linear regression analysis, we also detected a greater sensitivity of snow cover-climate feedbacks to temperature trends during the more recent time period. Pan-arctic vegetation types differed substantially in snow cover-climate feedbacks. Those with a high seasonal contrast in albedo, such as tundra, showed much larger changes in atmospheric heating than did those with a low seasonal contrast in albedo, such as forests, even if the changes in snow-cover duration were similar across the vegetation types. These changes in energy exchange warrant careful consideration in studies of climate change, particularly with respect to associated shifts in vegetation between forests, grasslands, and tundra. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Albedo; Climate change; Pan-arctic; Snow melt; Snow return","albedo; climate change; global warming; snow cover; snowmelt; twentieth century; vegetation type",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348895226

All life-cycle phases of vehicles, infrastructure, and fuels are accounted for in a hybrid life-cycle assessment (LCA). It includes not only fuel combustion, but also emissions from vehicle manufacturing, maintenance, and end of life, infrastructure construction, operation, maintenance, and end of life, and petroleum exploration, refining, and fuel distribution. Results indicate that total life-cycle emissions of freight transportation modes are underestimated if only tailpipe emissions are accounted for. In the case of CO2 and NOx, tailpipe emissions underestimate total emissions by up to 38%, depending on the mode. Total life-cycle emissions of CO and SO2 are up to seven times higher than tailpipe emissions/Sensitivity analysis considers the effects of vehicle type, geography, and mode efficiency on the final results. Policy implications of this analysis are also discussed. For example, while it is widely assumed that currently proposed regulations will result in substantial reductions in emissions, we find that this is true for NO x emissions, because fuel combustion is the main cause, and to a lesser extent for SO2, but not for PM10 emissions, which are significantly affected by the other life-cycle phases. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Life cycle assessment; Petroleum exploration; Tailpipe emissions; Freight transportation; Life cycle; Maintenance; Refining; Sensitivity analysis; Vehicles; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; nitric oxide; petroleum; Freight transportation; Gas emissions; Life cycle; Maintenance; Refining; Sensitivity analysis; Vehicles; combustion; emission; freight transport; fuel; life cycle analysis; petroleum; air monitoring; article; combustion; exhaust gas; life cycle assessment; sensitivity analysis; traffic and transport; United States; Air Pollutants; Geography; Sensitivity and Specificity; Transportation; Vehicle Emissions; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348909120

Thus a better understanding of interactions between land use change, climate change and the terrestrial biosphere is crucial in planning future land management options. Climate change has the potential to alter terrestrial C storage since changes in temperature, precipitation and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations could affect net primary production (NPP), C inputs to soil, and soil C decomposition rates. Climate change could also act as a driver for land use change, thus further altering terrestrial C fluxes. The net balance of these different effects varies considerably between regions and hence the case studies presented in this paper (the GEFSOC project countries Kenya, Jordan, Brazil, and India) provide a unique opportunity to study climate impacts on terrestrial C storage. This paper first presents predicted changes in climate for the four case study countries from a coupled climate-C cycle Global Circulation Model (HadCM3LC), followed by predicted changes in vegetation type, NPP and soil C storage. These very coarse assessments provide an initial estimate of large-scale effects. A more detailed study of climate impacts on soil C storage in the Brazilian Amazon is provided as an example application of the GEFSOC system. Interestingly in the four cases studied here precipitation seems to control the sign of the soil C changes under climate change with wetter conditions resulting in higher soil C stocks and drier conditions in lower soil C stocks, presumably because increased NPP in wetter conditions here will override any increase in respiration. In contrast, globally, it seems to be temperature that controls changes in C stocks under climate change. Even if there is a slight increase in precipitation globally, a decrease in C stocks is predicted-in other words, the regional response to precipitation differs from the global response. The reason for this may be that whilst temperature increases under climate change were predicted everywhere, the nature of precipitation changes varies greatly between regions.

An increased use of fuels derived from biomass could relieve some demand for nonrenewable sources of energy while providing environmental benefits in terms of cleaner air and reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. In 2003, China generated about 25.9 × 10 8 metric tons of industrial waste (liquid + solid), 14.7 × 10 8 metric tons/year (t/y) of manure (livestock + human), 7.1 × 10 8 t/y of crop residues and food-processing byproducts, 2 × 10 8 t/y of fuelwood and wood manufacturing residues, and 1.5 × 10 8 t/y of municipal waste. Biofuels derived from these materials could potentially displace the use of about 4.12 × 10 8 t/y of coal and 3.75 × 10 6 t/y of petroleum. An increased bioenergy use of this magnitude would help to reduce the emissions of key air pollutants: SO 2 by 11.6 × 10 6 t/y, NO X by 1.48 × 10 6 t/y, CO 2 by 1.07 × 10 9 t/y, and CH 4 by 50 × 10 6 t/y. The reduced SO 2 emissions would be equivalent to 54% of the national emissions in 2003, whereas those for CO 2 are 30%. It is important to recognize, however, that large increases in the use of biomass fuels also could result in socioeconomic and environmental problems such as less production of food and damage caused to natural habitats. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Air pollutants; Bioenergy; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; China; Greenhouse gases; People's Republic of China; Renewable energy","Air pollutants; Bioenergy; Nonrenewable sources; Air pollution; Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Industrial economics; Population dynamics; Biomass; biofuel; carbon dioxide; coal; fuel; methane; nitric oxide; petroleum; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; bioenergy; biomass; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; industrial waste; population growth; renewable resource; air pollutant; air pollution control; bioenergy; biomass; China; economic development; energy resource; environmental factor; environmental management; field emission; food industry; food processing; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; habitat; industrial waste; manure; municipal solid waste; population density; review; socioeconomics; Air Pollution; Biomass; China; Conservation of Energy Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Energy-Generating Resources; Environment; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Vehicle Emissions; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548065518

Experimental treatments applied in a split-plot design included four planting densities (1111, 833, 625 and 500 stems ha-1) and three poplar clones (NL-80351, I-69 and I-72). Based on the model of total biomass production developed, total plantation biomass production was significantly different in the plantations. The ranking of the plantation biomass production by planting density was 1111&gt;833≫625&gt;500 stems ha-1, and by components was stem&gt;root≥branch&gt;leaf for all plantations. At 10 years, the highest total biomass in the plantation of 1111 stems ha-1 reached about 146 t ha-1, which was 5.3%, 11.6% and 24.2% higher than the plantations of 833, 625 and 500 stems ha-1, respectively. The annual increment of biomass production over10 years differed significantly among initial planting densities and stand ages (p&lt;0.01), but no significant difference was observed from age 7 to 10. Mean carbon concentration among all biomass components ranged from 42-50%, with the highest carbon concentrations in stems and the lowest in leaves. Over the study period, the dynamic pattern of total plantation carbon storage by planting density was similar to that of total biomass production. At age 10, the highest total plantation carbon storage in the plantation of 1111 stems ha-1 reached about 72.0 t ha-1, which was 5.4%, 11.9% and 24.8% higher than in the plantations of 833, 625 and 500 stems ha-1, respectively. The annual carbon storage increment over 10 years differed significantly among initial planting densities and stand ages (p&lt;0.01), and it showed a pattern similar to the annual biomass production increment of the plantations. The results suggest that biomass production and carbon storage potential were highest for planting densities of 1111 and 833 stems ha-1 grown over 5- and 6-year cutting cycles, respectively. If 3- or 4-year cutting cycles are used, the planting density should be higher than 1111 stems ha-1 (e.g., 1667 or 2500 stems ha-1). Based on the mean annual carbon storage for the plantation of 625 stems ha-1, as an estimation, the mean carbon storage in the biomass of poplar plantations (excluding leaves) amounts to 3.75×107 t ha-1 yr-1 in China. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

JP-8 has become the standard jet fuel utilized in the United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries for military use and it is closely related to Jet A fuel, which is used in U.S. domestic aviation. Rats received JP-8 fuel (1000 mg/m3) by nose-only inhalation for 4 h and half of them were immediately subjected to an octave band of noise ranging between 97 and 105 dB in different experiments. The noise by itself produces a small, but permanent auditory impairment. The current permissible exposure level for JP-8 is 350 mg/m3. Additionally, a positive control group received only noise exposure, and a fourth group consisted of untreated control subjects. Exposures occurred either on 1 day or repeatedly on 5 successive days. Impairments in auditory function were assessed using distortion product otoacoustic emissions and compound action potential testing. In other rats, tissues were harvested following JP-8 exposure for assessment of hydrocarbon levels or glutathione (GSH) levels. A single JP-8 exposure by itself at 1000 mg/m3 did not disrupt auditory function. However, exposure to JP-8 and noise produced an additive disruption in outer hair cell function. Repeated 5-day JP-8 exposure at 1000 mg/m3 for 4 h produced impairment of outer hair cell function that was most evident at the first postexposure assessment time. Partial though not complete recovery was observed over a 4-week postexposure period. The adverse effects of repeated JP-8 exposures on auditory function were inconsistent, but combined treatment with JP-8 + noise yielded greater impairment of auditory function, and hair cell loss than did noise by itself. Qualitative comparison of outer hair cell loss suggests an increase in outer hair cell death among rats treated with JP-8 + noise for 5 days as compared to noise alone. In most instances, hydrocarbon constituents of the fuel were largely eliminated in all tissues by 1-h postexposure with the exception of fat. Finally, JP-8 exposure did result in a significant depletion of total GSH that was observable in liver with a nonsignificant trend toward depletion in the brain and lung raising the possibility that the promotion of noise-induced hearing loss by JP-8 might have resulted from oxidative stress. © The Author 2007.

However, because of the potential adverse effects of toxic emissions, waste incinerators are still an important cause for concern for the public. In spite of that, compliance with current EU emissions has vastly reduced the probability of adverse health effects (Glorennec et al., 2005). With respect to metals, a number of studies have shown that these elements are emitted by industrial, medical and municipal waste incinerators (Schumacher et al., 1997; Rimmer et al., 2006). Filter ash is an especially problematic residue because it contains high metal concentrations (Lisk et al., 1989). After combustion in modern HW incinerators (HWIs), metals contained in HW are mainly collected in bottom and fly ash, with only small quantity of metals being discharged from the stack as particulate matter or vapor (Jung et al., 2004).

This reality of increasing demand in the face of diminishing fossil supplies is spurring interest in renewable energy sources. An array of biomass-for-bioenergy resources has been proposed, with perennial, lignocellulosic feedstocks showing the greatest potential. Assessment of potential biomass energy resources is difficult, however, as uncertainties over available land and crop yields swing reported estimates from 35 to 1135 EJ/year. In the USA, it has been suggested that more than 1 billion tonnes (910 million Mg) of biomass could be sustainably harvested, but these estimates are dependent on continued gains in plant productivity, nutrient use efficiency and soil and water conservation. Variables of population growth and increased standards of living will also affect the availability of land for these energy-producing endeavours. Several biofuel sources have been identified to include waste streams, microalgae and woody biomass plantations. With herbaceous-based systems, much effort is currently being given to corn and other starch or grain crops that can be readily converted to ethanol. While these crops may serve to jumpstart the biofuel industry, they have much less potential to meet demand and much greater potential for negative environmental impacts. Long-term, high-yielding perennial species will be better suited to meet the requirements for sustainability, but they are currently plagued by limitations in pretreatment and processing technologies. Further upstream of the conversion facility loom the questions of logistics, e.g. how does one handle and move a bulky, distributed resource in a cost-effective manner? In addition, there are important interactions between each component of the supply chain - agronomy, logistics and processing - that are best not studied in isolation. Important social issues also stand to influence farmer decisions regarding market entry which will affect in turn the function and profitability of a biorefining industry. Once at the facility, several possible biomass conversion technologies may be employed, including (but not limited to) pyrolysis to syn-gas and bio-oils or sugar hydrolysis and fermentation to ethanol. Both have drawbacks, and the limitation for cellulosic feedstocks remains an economical method of conversion. It is widely believed that this challenge will be met, but the question of 'when?' remains. Other, larger questions about the development of bioenergy resources reside outside the system, with policy being one of the biggest. For example, bioenergy systems may be more cost-competitive if policy allows them to benefit from the potential ecosystem services they provide, e.g. sequestering carbon. However, such policies may also encourage farmers to convert food crop land to energy crop land, with concomitant ripple effects throughout the economy. These and other policy-related risks increase uncertainty; this uncertainty will limit investments, especially large-scale investments, in such industries. Bioenergy systems may also face social hurdles from those who view them as inimical to the interests of local and global producer communities and citizenry. A successful bioenergy system will accommodate all of these concerns and more. © CAB International 2007.","(Herbaceous) energy crops; (Social) costs and benefits; Biofuels; Biorefineries; Lignocellulosics; Logistics",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349084530

Old plantations (65-72 years) of four different species, namely Araucaria cunninghamii, Agathis robusta, Toona ciliata and Flindersia brayleyana, as well as natural secondary forest were examined at Wongabel State Forest, in the wet tropics region of Queensland, Australia. Two young plantations (23 years) of Araucaria cunninghamii and Pinus caribaea were also examined. The close proximity of the older plantations and natural forests meant they had similar edaphic and climatic conditions. All plantations had been established as monocultures, but had been colonised by a range of native woody plants from the nearby rainforest. The extent to which this had occurred varied with the identity of the plantation species (from 2 to 17 species in 0.1 ha blocks). In many cases these additional species had grown up and joined the forest canopy. This study is one of the few to find a negative relationship between overstorey plant diversity and productivity. The conversion of natural forest with highly productive, low-diversity gymnosperm-dominated plantations (young and old Araucaria cunninghamii and Pinus caribaea) was found to be associated with lower soil nutrient availability (approximately five times less phosphorus and 2.5 times less nitrogen) and lower soil pH (mean = 6.28) compared to the other, less productive plantations. The dominant effects of two species, Araucaria cunninghamii and Hodgkinsonia frutescens, indicate that ecosystem functions such as production and nutrient availability are not determined solely by the number of species, but are more likely to be determined by the characteristics of the species present. This suggests that monoculture plantations can be used to successfully restore some functions (e.g. nutrient cycling and production), but that the level to which such functions can be restored will depend upon the species chosen and site conditions. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Biodiversity; Ecosystem function; Forest restoration; Species richness","biological production; climate conditions; ecosystem function; forest canopy; nutrient availability; nutrient cycling; plantation; secondary forest; soil nutrient; species diversity; species richness; tropical environment; agriculture; article; Australia; biodiversity; pH; physiology; principal component analysis; soil; species difference; tree; tropic climate; Agriculture; Australia; Biodiversity; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Principal Component Analysis; Soil; Species Specificity; Trees; Tropical Climate; Australasia; Australia; Queensland; Agathis robusta; Araucaria cunninghamii; Ciliophora; Flindersia brayleyana; Gymnospermae; Pinus caribaea; Toona ciliata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36448934883

Water deficits of crops were developed with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-IIASA Agro-ecological Zone model, based on daily water balances at 0.5° latitude × 0.5° longitude and then aggregated to regions and the globe. Future regional and global irrigation water requirements were computed as a function of both projected irrigated land and climate change and simulations were performed from 1990 to 2080. Future trends for extents of irrigated land, irrigation water use, and withdrawals were computed, with specific attention given to the implications of climate change mitigation. Renewable water-resource availability was estimated under current and future climate conditions. Results suggest that mitigation of climate change may have significant positive effects compared with unmitigated climate change. Specifically, mitigation reduced the impacts of climate change on agricultural water requirements by about 40%, or 125-160 billion m3 (Gm3) compared with unmitigated climate. Simple estimates of future changes in irrigation efficiency and water costs suggest that by 2080 mitigation may translate into annual cost reductions of about 10 billion US$. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

That threshold corresponds to small floods with recurrence intervals of ∼2-3 years. Statistical analysis illustrates that levee breaks and peak discharges cycle (broadly) on a 12-15 year time scale, in time with warm-wet storm patterns in California, but more slowly or more quickly than ENSO and PDO climate phenomena, respectively.

The use of biofuels is one of the main actions promoted by the European Union and member states in an effort to tackle global warming, enhance energy security and contribute to regional development. Here, the possibility to blend cottonseed oil directly with fossil diesel as a fuel for diesel engines is examined. This option has lower cost and larger well-to-wheel greenhouse gas benefits than fatty acid methylesters. The paper presents measurements of important fuel properties, density, viscosity, cetane number and cold flow characteristics. In addition, a common rail Euro 3 compliant diesel car is tested using 10% v/v cottonseed oil-diesel blends in order to examine the effects on performance and emissions of regulated pollutants and CO2. Furthermore, particle emission characteristics are studied, including total and solid particle number concentrations and particle size distributions over driving cycles and steady state modes. The results indicate that the test fuel presents good operating characteristics and limited effects on regulated emissions and vehicle performance. These results would justify further research on the direct use of vegetable oils as automotive fuels. © 2007 Institution of Chemical Engineers.","Biofuels; Cottonseed oil; Exhaust emissions; Greenhouse gas emissions","Cost effectiveness; Cottonseed oil; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Retrofitting; Exhaust emissions; Fossil diesel; Greenhouse gas emissions; Biofuels; Gossypium hirsutum; Micropus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748912351

New data and analysis on the effects that China and India are likely to have on the global energy economy have come as a shock. Economic growth in both countries has exceeded the expectations of organizations such as the IMF, the World Bank, and the IEA, that previous projections of how the global energy economy might develop now look over-optimistic. The high price of oil, and the consequent high price of gas in regions where prices are oil-indexed, has led electricity generators increasingly to favor coal as a fuel. In regions where gas prices are determined by traded markets - mainly North America and the UK - the now-commonplace volatility of gas prices means natural gas, which has lower CO2 emissions per unit of energy consumed than coal or oil, is no longer seen as the automatic fuel of choice for power generation. Energy-related CO2 emissions in the reference case of the 2006 WEO were projected to rise by 55% between 2004 and 2030, or 1.7%/yr, taking them to 40.4 billion ton/yr. Following the pattern of previous years, the IEA also makes projections using an ""alternative"" case. In building the alternative policy case, the IEA took account of numerous proposed policies from both OECD and non-OECD countries. The IEA predicts that to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in this range would require energy-related CO2 emissions to be reduced to around 23 billion ton in 2030, some 19 billion ton less than in the reference case and some 11 billion ton less than in the alternative case.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53549106982

It draws on discussions about ‘citizen-consumer subjectivities’ and the model of the ‘political economic person’, which link sustainability and consumption through asserting people’s capacities as reflecting citizens. Printed advertisements by local and national government agencies about air pollution, fuel dependency and energy consumption are analysed to see whether advertising campaigns can operate on multiple levels for a range of audiences – desirable for broadening understanding of sustainable consumption and dealing with the complexity and experiential aspects of ‘doing’ sustainability. The advertisements analysed have an authoritative dimension that downplays this complexity and variability. The paper concludes that these advertisements do not go far enough to involve individuals in processes of co-producing knowledge about sustainability, and to vest them with expertise in exercising sustainability in their daily lives. The implications are that advertising campaigns that engage with the complexity surrounding consumption in people’s modern lives, and with variability in meanings of sustainability, have the possibility of inciting citizen-consumer political subjectivities. © 2017 Wiley.

Little is yet known about the impact on ultrafine particle emissions of combining exhaust aftertreatment with such increasingly common fuels. This paper reports ultrafine particle size distribution measurements for a study in which the impact of such fuels on emissions from a heavy duty diesel engine employing different aftertreatment configurations was evaluated. Eight different fuels were tested: Canadian No. 1 and No. 2 diesel; low sulfur diesel fuel; two different ultra low sulfur diesel fuels (&lt; 30 ppm S); Fischer-Tropsch diesel fuel; 20% biodiesel blended with ultra low sulfur diesel fuel; and PuriNOx™. The fuels were tested in combination with four exhaust configurations: engine out, diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), continuously regenerating diesel particle filter (CRDPF), and engine gas recirculation with CRDPF (EGR-DPF). In general, aftertreatment configuration was found to have a greater impact on ultrafine particle size distributions than fuel composition, and the effects of aftertreatment tended to be uniform across the entire particle size distribution. Steady state tests revealed complex behavior based on fuel type, particularly for PuriNOx. This behavior included bimodal particle size distributions with modes as low as 8–10 nm for some fuels.

XRD patterns of all specimens show high orientation and indicate the presence of some impurities such as rosasite and hydrozincite. However, the diffraction patterns for all samples are well correlated to the standard reference patterns. SEM images show highly crystalline and ordered structures in the form of micron long fibres and plates. EDAX analyses indicate variations in chemical composition of Cu/Zn ratios ranging from 1/1.06 to 1/2.87. The symmetry of the carbonate anion in aurichalcite is Cs and is composition dependent. This symmetry reduction results in multiple bands in both the symmetric stretching and bending regions. The intense band at 1072 cm-1 is assigned to the ν1(CO3)2- symmetric stretching mode. Three Raman bands assigned to the ν3(CO3)2- antisymmetric stretching modes are observed for aurichalcite at 1506, 1485 and 1337 cm-1. Multiple Raman bands are observed in 800-850 cm-1 and 720-750 cm-1 regions and are attributed to ν2 and ν4 bending modes confirming the reduction of the carbonate anion symmetry in the aurichalcite structure.

Previous crystallographic studies concluded that the structure of dawsonite was a simple one; however, both Raman and infrared spectroscopy show that this conclusion is incorrect. Multiple bands are observed in both the Raman and infrared spectra in the antisymmetric stretching and bending regions, showing that the symmetry of the carbonate anion is reduced and in all probability the carbonate anions are not equivalent in the dawsonite structure. Multiple OH deformation vibrations centred around 950 cm-1 in both Raman and infrared spectra show that the OH units in the dawsonite structure are non-equivalent. Calculations using the position of the Raman and infrared OH stretching vibrations enabled estimates of the hydrogen-bond distances of 0.2735 and 0.27219 pm at 298 K, and 0.27315 and 0.2713 pm at 77 K to be made.

The additive is obtainable from bio-ethanol by means of an acid-catalysed process. Several acid ion-exchanged polymers with acidic strength comparable with that of ""concentrated"" sulphuric acid were used to prepare silica-heterogenized perfluorosulfonic (PFS) acid catalysts by incipient wetness impregnation of commercial silica samples. The acid catalysts were used in the synthesis of acetal at 4 °C and 3 atm in a stirred batch reactor. A systematic comparison of reaction path and catalysts acid-strength points to a direct relationship between acidic capacity and catalytic activity. The product has good characteristics for diesel blending, but it is characterized by a low flash point. The evaluation of the additive performance in a diesel fuel blend was carried out in a passenger car light-duty diesel engine in two steady-state operation points. The chosen testing points are considered partially representative of the engine behaviour during the NEDC test procedure. Engine tests showed an insensitive effect of 1,1-diethoxyethane on gaseous pollutant emissions (HC, CO and NOx), on the contrary a marked reduction of exhaust smoke was verified. Fuel consumption was slightly increased because of the total oxygen content of the blend. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Band ratios of ASTER VNIR and SWIR data to detect red bed bleaching and secondary carbonate formation induced by hydrocarbon seepage are proposed through analysis of the spectral properties of rock samples. Results show that ASTER band ratios of 2/1 and 4/8 can discriminate bleached red beds and secondary carbonate minerals due to hydrocarbon seepage in the northern Tian Shan.

It focuses on the correction of ocean-atmosphere exchanged fluxes. On the basis of numerical experiments and analysis, the method can be described as follows: first, driving the ocean model with heat and momentum flux computed from a long-term observation data set; the produced SST is then applied to force the AGCM as its boundary condition; after that the AGCM's simulation and the corresponding observation can be correlated by a linear regressive formula. Thus the regressive correction coefficients for the simulation with spatial and temporal variation could be obtained by linear fitting. Finally the coefficients are applied to redressing the variables used for the calculation of the exchanged air-sea flux in the coupled model when it starts integration. This method together with the anomaly coupling method is tested in a regional coupled model, which is composed of a global grid-point atmospheric general circulation model and a high-resolution tropical Pacific Ocean model. The comparison of the results shows that it is superior to the anomaly coupling both in reducing the coupled model 'climate drift' and in improving the ENSO simulation in the tropical Pacific Ocean. © Science in China Press 2007.","Anomaly coupling; ENSO simulation; Regional coupled model; Regressive correction method","Atmospheric general circulation model; High-resolution tropical Pacific ocean model; Regional coupled model; Regressive correction method; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric temperature; Boundary conditions; Heat flux; Linear regression; Mathematical models; Momentum transfer; Oceanography; Climatology; air-sea interaction; atmosphere-ocean coupling; atmospheric general circulation model; boundary condition; computer simulation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; gas exchange; oceanic general circulation model; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447326667

Applied in the high-pressure-turbine sections of two steam turbines for combined-cycle power generators hitherto used for 50-Hz generation, these blades significantly improve the efficiency of the high-pressure turbines.

Anaerobically purified A. cycloclastes recombinant N2OR (AcN2OR) has on average 4.5 Cu and 1.2 S per monomer. Upon reduction by methyl viologen, AcN2OR displays a high specific activity: 124 U/mg at 25 °C. Anaerobically purified AcN2OR displays a unique absorption spectrum. UV-visible and EPR spectra, combined with kinetics studies, indicate that the as-purified form of the enzyme is predominately a mixture of the fully-reduced CuZ = [4Cu(I)] state and the CuZ = [3Cu(I) · Cu(II)] state, with the latter readily reducible by reduced forms of viologens. CD spectra of the as-purified AcN2OR over a range of pH values reveal perturbations of the protein conformation induced by pH variations, although the principal secondary structure elements are largely unaltered. Further, the activity of AcN2OR in D2O is significantly decreased compared with that in H2O, indicative of a significant solvent isotope effect on N2O reduction. These data are in good agreement with conclusions reached in recent studies on the effect of pH on catalysis by N2OR [K. Fujita, D.M. Dooley, Inorg.

A magnetic suspension balance (MSB) was used for the density measurement under the high pressure CO2: A thin disc-shaped platinum plate was submerged in the considered polymer/CO2 single-phase solution in the MSB high-pressure cell. The weight of the plate was measured while keeping CO2 pressure and temperature in the sorption cell at a specified level. Since the buoyancy force exerted on the plate by the polymer/CO2 solution reduced the apparent weight of the plate, the density of the polymer/CO2 solution could be calculated by subtracting the true weight of the plate from its measured weight. Experimental results showed that the density of PE/CO2 solution increased with the increase of CO2 pressure and the density of PEG/CO2 solution decreased with the increase of CO2 pressure. To differentiate the effect of CO2 dissolution in polymer from that of mechanical pressure, the density of polymer/CO2 solution was compared with the density of neat polymer under the given mechanical pressure, which was calculated using the Sanchez-Lacombe equation of state and Pressure-Volume- Temperature data of the polymer. The comparison could elucidate that the dissolution of CO2 in polymer reduced density of both PEG/CO 2 and PE/CO2 systems but the degree of CO2 induced-density reduction was different between two polymer/CO2 systems. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Buoyancy effect; CO2; Density; Magnetic suspension balance; Solubility; Swelling","Density measurement (specific gravity); Gravimetric analysis; High temperature operations; Melting point; Polyethylene glycols; Buoyancy effects; Magnetic suspension balance; Platinum plates; Single phase solution; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; density; dissolution; polyethylene glycol; polymer property; polymer solution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547476512

The model cinnamates are easily prepared in one step by coupling commercial or readily available synthons. They exhibit a large one-photon absorption that can be tuned in the near-UV range. Uncaging after one-photon excitation was investigated by 1H NMR, UV-vis absorption, and steady-state fluorescence emission. In the whole investigated series, the caged substrate is quantitatively released upon photolysis. At the same time, uncaging releases a strongly fluorescent coproduct that can be used as a reporter for quantitative substrate delivery. The quantum yield of double bond photoisomerization leading to uncaging after one-photon absorption mostly lies in the 10% range. Taking advantage of the favorable photophysical properties of the uncaging coproduct, we use a series of techniques based on fluorescence emission to measure the action uncaging cross sections with two-photon excitation of the present cinnamates. Exhibiting values in the 1-10 GM range at 750 nm, they satisfactorily compare with the most efficient caging groups reported to date. Noticeably, the uncaging behavior with two-photon excitation is retained in vivo as suggested by the results observed in living zebrafish embryos. Reliable structure property relationships were extracted from analysis of the present collected data. In particular, the careful kinetic analysis allows us to discuss the relevance of the ohydroxycinnamic platform for diverse caging applications with one- and two-photon excitation. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption; Fluorescence; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Photolysis; Photons; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Caging groups; Designing efficient; Ohydroxycinnamic platform; Quantitative substrate; Organic acids; coumaric acid; ortho coumaric acid; unclassified drug; article; fluorescence; isomerization; photolysis; photon absorptiometry; quantitative analysis; reliability; steady state; structure activity relation; ultraviolet radiation; zebra fish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547870514

In this paper, we revised and applied a simulation model to analyze responses of ecosystem processes in the crop-pasture belt region of northern China to impacts of soil erosion and climate shift. The revised model includes a new module that calculates runoff-induced soil erosion and soil carbon and nutrient losses. The model was validated against long-term field observations on plant productivity at several sites, and sediment yields of experiments with various vegetation covers and slopes. Simulation with historical climate data without considering erosion showed that the average net primary productivity (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (RHE), agricultural harvest (HAV), and net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) were 210.1 ± 26.9, 169.8 ± 7.7, 35.9 ± 4.1, and 4.4 ± 22.5 gC m-2 a-1, respectively. In contrast, simulation with soil erosion gave an average erosion-induced loss of soil organic carbon (ECL) of 11.0 ± 2.8 gC m-2 a-1, and decreased average NPP, RHE, and HAV by 3.3 ± 0.7, 14.5 ± 0.3, and 0.2 ± 0.0 gC m-2 a-1, respectively. Given NPP maintained by crop fertilization and irrigation for crop fields, the erosion-induced soil carbon loss is thus counterbalanced by the decrease in heterotrophic respiration, resulting in an invariant NECB with respect to soil erosion.

The impact of a change in land use was evaluated for a multifunctional, a production and a non-conversion scenario. First, the carbon balance was modelled with GORCAM and was expressed as (1) C sequestration in tC ha-1 year-1 in soil, litter, and living biomass according to the rules of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, and (2) CO2 emission reductions in tC ha-1 year-1, which includes carbon sequestered in the above-mentioned pools and additionally in wood products, as well as emission reductions due to fossil fuel substitution. To estimate forest growth, three data sources were used: (1) inventory data, (2) growth simulation with a process-based model, and (3) yield tables. Second, the effects of land use change were assessed for different project scenarios using a method related to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The method uses 17 quantitative indicators to describe the impact of project activities on water, soil, vegetation cover and biodiversity. Indicator scores were calculated by comparing indicator values with reference values, estimated for the climax vegetation. The climax vegetation is the site-specific ecosystem phase with the highest exergy content and the highest exergy flow dissipation capacity. Third, the land use impact per functional unit of 1 tC sequestered was calculated by combining the results of step 1 and step 2. The average baselines to obtain carbon additionality are 476 tC ha-1 for indigenous forest and 32 tC ha -1 for fynbos. Results show that the influence of the growth assessment method on the magnitude of C sequestration and hence on the environmental impact per functional unit is large. When growth rate is assessed with the mechanistic model and with the yield table, it is overestimated in the early years and underestimated in the long term. The main conclusion of the scenario analysis is that the production forest scenario causes higher impacts per functional unit than the multifunctional scenario, but with the latter being less efficient in avoiding CO2 emissions. The proposed method to assess impacts on diverse components of the ecosystem is able to estimate the general tendency of the adverse and positive effects of each scenario. However, some indicators, more specifically about biodiversity and water balance, could be improved or reinterpreted in light of specific local data about threat to biodiversity and water status. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",,"Carbon; Environmental impact; Environmental regulations; Carbon sequestration; Functional units; Kyoto Protocol; Water status; Forestry; afforestation; biodiversity; biomass; carbon balance; carbon sequestration; coniferous tree; data set; emission; environmental effect; environmental impact; fossil fuel; growth rate; Kyoto Protocol; land use change; plantation; water budget; Biodiversity; Carbon; Chelation; Ecosystems; Forestation; Pinus Radiata; Africa; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Western Cape; Pinus radiata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447106531

A potential advantage of this process is that the carbon dioxide rich exhaust stream should be able to be captured and stored thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Results are presented for the performance of the anode of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrochemical cell for the separation of hydrogen from a H2-CO2 gas mixture and from a H2-CO2-CO gas mixture. Experiments were carried out using a single cell state-of-the-art PEM fuel cell. The anode was fed with either a H2-CO2 gas mixture or a H2-CO2-CO gas mixture and hydrogen was evolved at the cathode. All experiments were performed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. With the H2-CO2 gas mixture the hydrogen extraction efficiency is quite high. When the gas mixture included CO, however, the hydrogen extraction efficiency is relatively poor. To improve the efficiency for the separation of the gas mixture containing CO, the effect of periodic pulsing on the anode potential was examined. Results show that pulsing can substantially reduce the anode potential thereby improving the overall efficiency of the separation process although the anode potential of the CO poisoned and pulsed cell still lies above that of an unpoisoned cell. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas the upstream basin is strongly influenced by intensive agriculture, leading to high nitrate concentrations, the lower Seine River and estuary are densely populated. Paris and its suburbs represent alone up to 60% of the population in the basin (10.106 inhabitants), causing large amounts of ammonium to be released by domestic effluents discharged downstream from Paris (of which the Achères wastewater treatment plant -WWTP- treated up to 80%). The ammonium loading is completely nitrified in the upstream fluvial estuary (300 km farther the effluent outlet), which leads to a strong oxygen deficit in summer. A conceptual representation of nitrification was constructed in which microbial compartments were taken explicitly into account, and the intermediate production of N2O included. On this basis a physiological analysis of the two stages of the nitrification by nitrifying bacteria (ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria) was carried out, as a function of the controlling factors (O2, NH 4 + , NO 2 - ; Brion, N. &amp; G.

A mathematical formulation of the kinetics and the parameters values were incorporated into the general model of ecological functioning of the fluvial sector and freshwater estuary of the Seine River. N2O emissions due to denitrification were also considered. Results from summer field studies between 1998 and 2003 were used to validate the model which is able to reproduce the main spatial and temporal patterns of the activities of the microbial nitrifying communities as well as the levels of oxygen and nitrogen forms (NH 4 + , NO 2 - , NO 3 - N2O). Once validated, the model is used to examine the planned installation of a tertiary treatment at the Achères WWTP, scheduled for 2007 (a 90% reduction by nitrification of the presently discharged ammonium, and a 30% reduction of the nitrate by denitrification). The model shows that a nitrification treatment leads to a significant improvement in the oxygenation and a reduction of N2O emission. However, only further denitrification of urban effluents, expected in 2015, would significantly reduce the nitrogen delivery to the coastal zone. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Human impact; Modeling; Nitrogen transformations; Seine river; Wastewater treatment scenarios","Estuaries; Phase transitions; Phytoplankton; Rivers; Wastewater disposal; Human impacts; Nitrogen transformations; Seine river; Wastewater treatment scenarios; Nitrogen; ammonium; anthropogenic effect; denitrification; domestic waste; ecological modeling; human activity; microbial activity; model validation; nitrate; nitrous oxide; nutrient cycling; oxygenation; reaction kinetics; waste treatment; wastewater; Eurasia; Europe; France; Ile-de-France; Paris; Seine Estuary; Seine River; Ville-de-Paris; Western Europe; Bacillariophyta; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chlorophyceae",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547595125

While increases in NO2 and ozone are calculated when using the CLE scenario, reductions are seen for the MFR scenario. In the SRES A2 case, increases in NO2 are largest, locally leading to ozone reductions at the surface resulting from titration effects.

Our objectives were to describe the seasonal dynamics of physiology, growth, and resin defense of southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. & C. Laws.) which undergoes regular seasonal drought. We measured leaf-level net photosynthetic rate, leaf water potential, resin flow after phloem wounding, and growth in 24 consecutive months in 2002 and 2003. Precipitation was below average in both years, and 2002 was an extreme drought. In both years, the highest resin flow occurred when tree water stress was highest and photosynthesis was low. Belowground growth was highest in August in both years. Aboveground growth occurred primarily between May and August and was greater in 2003 than in 2002. Temporal variation in resin flow was positively related to temporal variation in needle and radial growth but was not related to temporal variation in root nor shoot growth. Thus, trade-offs in carbon allocation between resin and growth were weak.

The quality of proxy data, methodology of reconstruction, and uncertainties in reconstruction were emphasized in comparing different temperature and precipitation reconstruction and clarifying temporal and spatial patterns of temperature and precipitation during the Holocene. The Holocene climate was generally warm and wet. The warmest period occurred in 9.6-6.2 cal ka BP, whereas a period of maximum monsoon precipitation started at about 11.0 cal ka BP and lasted until about 8.0-5.0 cal ka BP. There were a series of millennial-scale cold or dry events superimposed on the general trend of climate changes. During past two millennia, a warming trend in the 20th century was clearly detected, but the warming magnitude was smaller than the maximum level of the Medieval Warm Period and the Middle Holocene. Cold conditions occurred over the whole of China during the Little Ice Age (AD 1400-AD 1900), but the warming of the Medieval Warm Period (AD 900-AD 1300) was not distinct in China, especially west China. The spatial pattern of precipitation showed significant regional differences in China, especially east China. The modern warm period has lasted 20 years from 1987 to 2006.

At high concentrations, ground-level ozone has been shown to be harmful to human health and to the environment. It has been recognized that ozone is a regional-scale problem and that regionwide control strategies would be needed to improve ozone air quality in the eastern United States. To mitigate interstate transport of ozone and its precursors, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a regional rule in 1998 known as the ""NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call,"" requiring 21 states in the eastern United States to reduce their summertime NOx emissions by 30 May 2004. In this paper, the effectiveness of the new emission control measures mandated by the NOx SIP Call is assessed by quantifying the changes that occurred in the daily maximum 8-h ozone concentrations measured at nearly 50 locations, most of which are rural (33 sites of the Clean Air Status and Trend Network and 16 sites of the Air Quality System), over the eastern United States. Given the strong dependence of ozone formation and accumulation on meteorological conditions, the incidence of the latter is first mitigated, and meteorologically adjusted ozone concentrations are extracted using a multiple regression technique. By examining the differences between the cumulative distribution functions of the meteorologically adjusted ozone concentrations, it is shown that ozone concentrations in the eastern United States are now on average 13% less than those prior to the NOx SIP Call. Using back-trajectory analyses, it is also shown that emission controls on the electricity-generating units located in the Ohio River Valley have contributed toward the improvement of ozone air quality in downwind regions, especially east and northeast of the Ohio River Valley. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Ozone layer; Particulate emissions; Regression analysis; Cumulative distribution functions; Nitrogen oxides emissions; Ozone air quality; Air quality; air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; concentration (composition); emission control; environmental planning; mitigation; nitrogen oxides; ozone; volatile organic compound; North America; Ohio River; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548240803

The main focus is on paint application activities, considering in particular the consequences of new environmentally friendly products and technologies which can be used by SMEs. Four different scenarios representing possible future states of the sector are evaluated, taking into account environmental, technical and socio-economic aspects along the associated supply chain and life cycle. The scenarios allow the formulation of recommendations and guidelines for policy makers and industries.

The later Khitan and Mongol objects had greatly reduced carbon content in the range of ultrahigh carbon steel rather than cast iron, and contained more than 0.5 mass % silicon as an alloying element. Inclusions high in sulfur, phosphorus or silicon are also present. These differences suggest that Mongolia experienced a technical transition a few centuries before the establishment of the Mongolian empire, which is in agreement with some written accounts.

In Europe, the application of BATs is prescribed by Directive 96/61/EC, which, however, leaves the selection of specific BATs to plant operators. In making their choices, installations have to consider not only the environmental benefits of BATs, but also all relevant cost components. In assessing the economic attractiveness of potential BATs and their combinations, as well as incentives and disincentives to be instituted, the cost of environmental externalities, usually not reflected in market prices, should be taken into account. In this paper, a decision-aid framework combining an assessment of environmental externalities and the utilization of multicriteria methods and, more specifically, Multiobjective Mathematical Programming, capable of addressing all these issues in a comprehensive and coherent manner, is presented. This is illustrated by its application for the region of Attica in Greece, where over 50% of the industrial basis and Athens, with its 4 million inhabitants, are located. The implementation of the framework and its associated tools to 800 installations led to the identification of the specific BATs, alone or in combination, that provide the most cost-effective reductions of four air pollutants (PM10, SO 2, NO x, VOC) and CO 2. The results also clearly demonstrate the increased pollution reductions that would result from the adoption of BATs made economically attractive by the inclusion of externalities.

Consequently, there is a need to represent these influences in global climate models, and models have begun to include representations of these influences. However, the present treatment of aerosols in global climate models is highly simplified, omitting many processes and feedbacks that are thought to be climatically important. Thus, there is need for substantial improvement. Here we describe the strategy of the U.S. Department of Energy for improving representation of the properties, processes, and effects of tropospheric aerosols in global climate models. The strategy begins with a foundation of field and laboratory measurements that provide the basis for modules describing specific aerosol properties and processes. These modules are then integrated into regional aerosol models, which are evaluated by comparison with field measurements. Issues of scale are then addressed so that the modules can be applied to global aerosol models, which are evaluated by comparison with satellite retrievals and other observations.

To achieve this, we use a life-cycle, consumption-based approach to measure the environmental impacts embodied in US trade activities for global warming potential (GWP), energy, toxics, and the criteria air pollutants. We use these values to determine the amount of environmental impact ""leaked"" from current, production-based approaches to analyzing national environmental trends for the years 1998-2004. We find that in 2004, with reasonable assumptions about the environmental intensity of imports and exports, this leakage exceeds 10% for all studied impacts, exceeds 20% for GWP, energy, and most criteria air pollutants, and exceeds 80% for lead emissions and toxics. By including the environmental impacts embodied in trade activities into national environmental accounts, we provide consumption-based, US per capita, environmental impacts, which we use to evaluate the relationship between income and environmental impact. We find evidence for rising per capita environmental impacts over time in the US, contra the Environmental Kuznets Curve.

The proposed approach is based on the correlation factor between time-evolution of system marginal emissions and wind power generation. Results show that average displaced emissions by wind generation can be estimated once typical power system dispatch data and regional wind generation is available, thus circumventing the use of proprietary power dispatch models.

Carbonate rocks record the inorganic carbon isotope composition of the oceanic reservoir through geological time, along with the sulfate sulfur isotope composition preserved as carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS). An inverse relationship exists between the first-order carbon and sulfur records of the Paleozoic; however, the isotope curves also reveal higher-frequency variations superimposed on the first-order (107-108 yr) trend. Because of links between carbon and sulfur cycling, high-resolution, CAS-based S isotope data have the potential to shed essential light on the mechanisms behind carbon isotope excursions observed in the geologic record. Results from the Late Cambrian SPICE event at Shingle Pass, Nevada, show parallel positive C (5‰) and S (25‰) isotope excursions, likely recording a large-scale marine organic carbon burial event with sympathetic pyrite burial. Carbon and sulfur records from other events throughout the Paleozoic reveal different and evolving relationships. A Silurian-Devonian boundary section at Strait Creek, West Virginia, reveals a positive C excursion of 6‰ but with an enigmatic, apparently negative S excursion (15‰) antithetic to the C shift. By contrast, a Kinderhookian-Osagean (Early Mississippian) section in the Confusion Range, Utah, shows invariant S isotope ratios across a C isotope excursion of 6‰. The coupling of the high-resolution C-S isotope records may have weakened in the mid-to-late Paleozoic with decreasing sensitivity of the seawater S isotope reservoir to flux changes as the marine sulfate concentrations increased through the Paleozoic. The progressively decreasing isotopic variability of CAS across three positive carbon excursions suggests that the Paleozoic was transitional between a Proterozoic ocean with rapid isotopic variability and thus low sulfate concentration and the comparatively more stable isotopic properties of a relatively more sulfate-rich Mesozoic and Cenozoic ocean. Furthermore, the emergence of the terrestrial ecosystems during the late middle and late Paleozoic yielded new loci of organic burial that also likely played a central role in the decoupling carbon and sulfur isotope records. Organic carbon burial in these sulfate-limited environments occurred in the absence of significant pyrite burial. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This study assessed the possible presence of abnormalities in myocardial uptake of 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a marker of sympathetic activity, in HTs with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Methods: Eleven HTs with LVH and 10 matched normotensive controls underwent clinical and laboratory examination, as well as LVH determination by echocardiography. The presence of myocardial ischemia was ruled out by exercise stress testing. Global and regional myocardial uptake of 123I-MIBG was determined in both groups using planar and single proton emission tomography scintigraphy. In addition, thallium-201 (Tl-201) myocardial scintigraphy was performed in HTs. The heart/mediastinum (H/M) ratio on planar 123I-MIBG images at different time points was compared between HTs and controls. Moreover, regional cardiac uptake of 123I-MIBG was compared between groups and, within the HTs group, with regional Tl-201 uptake. Results: At all study times, the H/M ratio was lower in HTs than in controls (all p &lt;0.05). A significant reduction in 123I-MIBG uptake in the mid-inferolateral and mid-inferior segments was observed in HTs compared to controls. Also, a significant reduction in 123I-MIBG uptake compared to Tl-210 uptake was observed in non-septal segments of HTs. Conclusions: Cardiac abnormalities in global and regional uptake of 123I-MIBG, as well as impaired 123I-MIBG compared to Tl-201 uptake, are present in HTs with LVH. Given the effect of sympathetic nervous system on the heart, these abnormalities might play a role in hypertension-related cardiac damage. © 2007 IMSS.","Essential hypertension; Left ventricular hypertrophy; Metaiodobenzylguanidine; Scintigraphy","(3 iodobenzyl)guanidine i 123; calcium antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; thallium 201; adrenergic system; adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; drug uptake; echocardiography; essential hypertension; female; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart scintiscanning; human; male; single photon emission computer tomography; sympathetic tone; 3-Iodobenzylguanidine; Echocardiography; Female; Heart; Humans; Hypertension; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular; Iodine Radioisotopes; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Ischemia; Sympathetic Nervous System; Thallium Radioisotopes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250017450

This paper first briefly reviews modelling tools and methodologies used to study regional climate-change impacts on air quality. Patterns of regional precipitation, temperature, and sea-level changes emerging from the latest set of general circulation model projections are then discussed. Finally, the specific case of climate-change effects on summer ozone concentrations over Europe is presented to illustrate the potential impacts of climate change on pollutant amounts.

Because a large portion of the atmosphere is cycled in and out of the seasonal caps during the year, the frost deposits play a significant role in regional and global atmospheric circulation. Understanding the nature of the seasonal polar caps is imperative if we are to understand the current Martian climate. In this study, we track the seasonal cap edges as a function of season and longitude for the fall and winter seasons (MY27), using data from the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) onboard the Mars Express (MEX) ESA mission. Making use of the rapid rise (decrease) in surface temperature that occurs when CO2 ice is removed (deposited), in a first approach, we defined the advancing cap edge to be where the surface temperature drops below 150 K, and the retreating cap edge where the surface temperature rises above 160 K. In this case, starting from Ls∼50°, the edge progression speed start to be longitude dependent. In the hemisphere that extends form the eastern limit of the Hellas basin to the western limit of the Argyrae basin (and containing the two) the edges progression speed is about a half than that of the other hemisphere; the cap is thus asymmetric and, unexpectedly, no CO2 ice seems to be present inside the basins. This is because the above mentioned surface temperatures used in this approach to detect the cap edges are not adequate (too low) for the high-pressure regions inside the basins where, following the Clausius-Clapeyron's law, the CO2 condensation temperature can be several degrees higher than that of the adjacent lower-pressure regions. In the second, final approach, special attention has been given to this aspect and the advancing and retreating cap edges are defined where, respectively, the surface temperatures drop below and rise above the CO2 condensation temperature for the actual surface pressure values. Now, the results show an opposite situation than the previous one, with the progression speed being higher and the cap more extended (up to -30° latitude) in the hemisphere containing the two major Martian basins. During the fall season, up to Ls∼50° the South Martian polar cap consists of CO2 frost deposits that advance towards lower latitudes at a constant speed of 10° of latitude per 15 degrees of Ls. The maximum extension (-40° latitude) of the South polar cap occurs somewhere in the 80°-90° Ls range. At the winter solstice, when the edges of the polar night start moving poleward, the cap recession has already started, in response to seasonal changes in insolation. The CO2 ice South polar cap will recede with a constant speed of ∼5° of latitude every 25° degrees of Ls during the whole winter. The longitudinal asymmetries reduce during the cap retreat and completely disappear around Ls=145°. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J.; Jackson, G.; Bias, F. J.; Martin del Rio, E.; de Miguel, E. J. Chem. Phys. 2004, 121, 12740] is used to describe the vapor-liquid interface of nonassociating and associating molecules ranging in size from small molecules to long chains. The functional, which is based on the statistical associating fluid theory for attractive potentials of variable range (SAFTVR) description of the homogeneous fluid [Gil-Villegas, A.; Galindo, A.; Whitehead, P. J.; Mills, S. J.; Jackson, G.; Burgess, A. N. J. Chem. Phys. 1997, 706, 4168], is constructed by partitioning the free energy density into a reference term (which incorporates all of the short-range interactions and is treated locally) and an attractive perturbation (which incorporates the long-range dispersion interactions). This functional accounts explicitly for the correlations between the segments using a density-averaged correlation function incorporated into the perturbative term in a similar way to that proposed by Toxvaerd. The SAFT-VR DFT formalism is used to examine the vapor-liquid interfacial tension of a number of pure components, including: n-alkanes; small associating molecules, such as water; linear alkan-1-ols; and some selected replacement refrigerants. In the case of the hydrocarbons and other weakly polar substances, the surface tension can be predicted from intermolecular parameters derived in the usual way from the bulk fluid phase equilibria (vapor-pressure and saturated liquid density). By contrast, when one describes the interfacial properties of associating compounds, it is important to include the surface tension data as well as the bulk vapor-liquid phase equilibria in developing the intermolecular potential model. This provides a means of determining the balance between the dispersive and associative (hydrogen bonding) contributions to the intermolecular potential. The use of interfacial data in the refinement of the potential model allows one to obtain a reliable set of parameters, which can be used to predict the bulk and interfacial properties of mixtures for a broad range of thermodynamic conditions. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Density functional theory; Free energy; Phase equilibria; Surface tension; Fluid theory; Intermolecular potential; Saturated liquid density; Molecular physics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36048941035

Main noteworthy observational constraints are (1) a well-known steep N-S gradient at the surface confined to an ≈40° wide latitude band in the tropics; (2) a fairly uniform N-S gradient in the upper troposphere; (3) an increase in the temporal variation in upper troposphere Northern Hemisphere records with increasing latitude; (4) a negative SF6 gradient in Northern Hemisphere vertical profiles from the surface to 8 km height, but a positive gradient in the Southern Hemisphere; and (5) a clear reflection in surface records of large-scale seasonal atmosphere movements like the undulations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Comparison of observations with simulations reveal excellent modeling skills with regards to (1) large-scale annual mean latitudinal gradients at remote surface sites (relative bias of N-S hemisphere difference ≤ 5%) and aloft (≈10 km, relative bias ≤ 25%); (2) seasonality in signals at remote sites caused by large-scale movements of the atmosphere; (3) time variation in upper troposphere records; (4) ""faithfulness"" of advective transport on timescales up to ≈1 week; and (5) the general shapes and seasonal variation of vertical profiles. The model (1) underestimates the variation in the vertical of profiles, particularly those from locations close to high emissions regions, and (2) overestimates the difference in SF6 between the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and free troposphere over North America, and thus likely Eurasia, during winter by approximately a factor of 2 (STD ≈ 100%). The comparisons permit estimating lower bounds on representation errors which are large for sites close to continental outflow regions. Given the magnitude of the signals and signal variance, SF6 provides a strong constraint on interhemispheric transport, PBL ventilation, dispersion pathways of northern midlatitude surface emissions through the upper troposphere, and large-scale movements of the atmosphere.

This study measured δ18O and δ13C values of biogenic carbonate and δ18OWATER to investigate the timing of growth line formation and to examine the utility of Lampsilis cardium as an environmental archive. We tested the hypotheses that: (1) L. cardium precipitates its shell in isotopic equilibrium with the environment during biomineralization; and (2) growth lines form seasonally during winter months. These questions were addressed by monitoring water chemistry, by tagging L. cardium to record growth, and by combining sclerochronology and stable isotope geochemistry. Temperature and δ18OWATER were measured fortnightly from September 2002 to July 2004 with a break in sampling from December 2003 to February 2004 in two Iowa rivers, Boone River and Buffalo Creek. These data were used to calculate expected δ18O values to compare to measured shell values. One hundred fifty-four individuals were marked at the postero-dorsal margin in September 2002 and June 2003 to monitor growth. Seven recaptured shells collected in July 2004 were analyzed for shell δ18O and δ13C across three growth lines (including growth lines prior to the initial marking period) from the growing edge toward the umbo. Comparison of shell δ18O with expected values revealed precipitation of δ18O in equilibrium with the ambient environment from early spring to early fall. Winter values were not recorded due to winter growth cessation. Change in temperature or reaching a threshold temperature appeared to control the onset and cessation of growth. Moreover, the locations of seasonal growth lines corresponded to winter growth cessation allowing the assignment of calendar years to growth lines. Seasonal growth lines were distinguished from non-seasonal disturbance lines by their seasonal location inferred from the δ18O time series recorded in shell growth. Thus, we can faithfully reconstruct ontogeny through time and environmental and climate conditions from mid to high latitudes using L. cardium. Variation in δ13CSHELL followed a more or less sinusoidal trend similar to the seasonal profiles of δ18OSHELL, suggesting that seasonal processes influenced the variation in carbon isotopes. Reduced amplitudes and more negative δ13CSHELL values with increasing age suggest that kinetic and/or metabolic isotope effects become important through ontogeny as observed in other bivalves. The profiles of δ13CSHELL potentially record local differences in landscape vegetation. However, specific factors influencing δ13CSHELL are unknown, and further study of water quality are required to fully assess the variation of δ13CSHELL as an environmental proxy. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The vehicles that queue up at traffic intersections spend a longer amount of time in idle driving mode generating more pollutant emissions per unit time. Other driving patterns (i.e., acceleration, deceleration and cruising) are also observed at intersections, affecting the emission pattern and therefore the resulting pollutant concentrations. The emission rate is not only affected by the increase in the vehicular population but also by the constantly changing traffic flow patterns and vehicles' driving modes. The nature of the vehicle flows also affects the rate and nature of the dispersion of pollutants in the vicinity of the road, influencing the pollutant concentration. It is, therefore, too complex to simulate the effect of such dynamics on the resulting emission rates using conventional deterministic causal models. In view of this, a simple semi-empirical box model based on the 'traffic flow rate', is demonstrated in the present study for estimating the hourly average carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations on a 1-week data at one of the busiest traffic intersections in Delhi. The index of agreement for a whole week, was found to be 0.84, suggesting that the semi-empirical model is 84% error free. A value of 0.87 was found for weekdays and 0.75 for weekend days. The correlation coefficient for the whole week was found to be 0.75, with 0.78 for the weekdays and 0.62 for the weekend days.

The advanced steam methane reforming technology incorporates a convectively heated reformer integrated with a gas turbine, leading to co-generation of hydrogen and electrical power that can be combined with carbon dioxide capture. The RedOx technology has three process variants that use metal oxide particles for oxygen transfer. One involves chemical looping with autothermal reforming, the second involves chemical looping with steam methane reforming, and the third involves direct hydrogen production with carbon dioxide capture. The hydrogen membrane reactors use palladium or palladium alloy membrane technology to capture carbon dioxide from synthesis gas in a water gas shift reactor or directly from an integrated natural gas reformer. The resulting hydrogen-rich gas stream can be used directly in a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant.

M1C 1A4, Canada","How long does it take for organic contaminant concentrations to decline in the Arctic after regulatory measures have succeeded in reducing emissions globally? This question is explored by using a zonally averaged global distribution model to estimate the lag-time between the period when emissions begin to decrease and when a decline in a chemical's Arctic Contamination Potential is observed. A long lag is problematic, as contaminant concentrations can continue to increase well after a potential hazard is recognized. Using three different emission scenarios, the chemical property combinations that are most likely to experience a lag on the order of decades were identifed among 96 hypothetical chemicals with different partitioning and reactivity properties. Thefirstsuch property combination comprises the persistent ""swimmers"" that reach the Arctic by slow long-range oceanic transport. They require a half-life (t1/2) in water of more than 10 years for a significant lag to occur. The second group of compounds experiencing a long lag includes semivolatile chemicals that are in dynamic exchange between atmosphere and ocean. These ""multihoppers"", with air-water partition coefficients, KAW of approximately 0.01, need to be highly persistent in air (t1/2 &gt; 3 years) and surface media (t1/2 &gt; 10 years). Their lag depends both on the oceans' large storage capacity and relatively low stickiness, i.e., a high likelihood of return to the atmosphere. Notably, no lag is predicted for less water soluble multihoppers (KAW &gt; 1), which are more likely to distribute into soils and foliage, because the terrestrial environment is ""stickier"" than the oceans, greatly reducing the number of hops these chemical will experience. The oceans thus play a crucial role in facilitating delayed Arctic contamination, either by transporting dissolved contaminants slowly to higher latitudes, or by providing a relatively nonsticky temporary storage reservoir which is in constant exchange with the atmosphere. Precaution advises a swift regulatory response to increasing concentrations in remote marine organisms of substances that have property combinations that are predicted to result in a significant delay between emission reductions and concentration declines. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Approximation theory; Chemicals; Concentration (process); Impurities; Particulate emissions; Arctic contamination; Chemical persistence; Partitioning properties; Semivolatile chemicals; Environmental engineering; volatile agent; Approximation theory; Chemicals; Concentration (process); Environmental engineering; Impurities; Particulate emissions; air-sea interaction; arctic environment; concentration (composition); marine ecosystem; organic pollutant; pollutant transport; air pollution; Arctic; article; ecotoxicity; field emission; soil pollution; water contamination; water pollution; Air; Arctic Regions; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Half-Life; Oceans and Seas; Risk Assessment; Time Factors; Volatilization; Water; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Humulus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548558907

Site selection, with the objective of minimizing adverse environmental impacts based on environmental criteria is a vital prerequisite, particularly for air polluting industries. In order to locate any air polluting industry, the assimilative capacity of the region needs to be assessed carefully and planned accordingly, so that the receiving environment is not adversely affected. Assimilative capacity of a region/airshed, widely represented through the ventilation coefficient by many researchers in the past, does not give a clear picture about the amount of emission load that can be assimilated in a given region. The ventilation coefficient, at best, can only present a broad picture about the air pollution dispersion potential (low, medium or high) of the region. A modified approach, which utilizes air quality modelling as a tool to estimate the maximum allowable emission load that a region can assimilate without violating the stipulated standards, has been used for estimating the assimilative capacity of the air environment. Details of this approach have been presented in this paper through a case study carried out for the Kochi region, located in the Kerala State of India. A variety of emission and meteorological scenarios have been considered and critical emission loads have been estimated.

Particular attention has been paid toward the influence of ceria on the catalytic performances of noble metals. A bifunctional mechanism is proposed involving the redox properties of ceria which correctly explains the beneficial effect of ceria on the reduction of N2O by CO in the absence of NO. However, subsequent comparisons with previous optimized kinetic and thermodynamic constants for the CO + NO reaction on the same catalyst suggest that the promotional effect of ceria is suppressed. When N2O and NO coexist in the gas phase, only noble metals are active near the light-off temperature, and the subsequent CO + N2O reaction is inhibited by the strong adsorption of NO. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon monoxide; Exhaust systems (engine); Nitrogen compounds; Precious metals; Redox reactions; Reduction; Automotive exhaust catalysts; Catalytic performances; Redox properties; Thermodynamic constants; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547353650

We propose that these reductions can accurately be modeled from a combination of stomatal effects on gaseous CO2 diffusion and nonstomatal effects on biochemical CO2 fixation. These effects can be combined through a solution for the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) at which rates of diffusion and fixation are equal for each leaf surface in the canopy. In this model, both stomatal and nonstomatal effects are driven by a common indicator of plant water status calculated in a hydraulically-driven scheme of soil-plant-atmosphere water transfer. As part of the ecosystem model ecosys, this combined model simulated concurrent declines in latent heat effluxes and CO2 influxes measured by eddy covariance during soil drying in a drought-affected semiarid grassland. At the same time, the model simulated the declines in Ci at which CO2 fixation occurred during soil drying as calculated from seasonal measurements of phytomass δ13C. Alternative model formulations based on stomatal or nonstomatal effects alone simulated these declines in CO2 influxes and in Ci less accurately than did the formulation in which these effects were combined. We conclude that modeling water deficit effects on CO2 fixation requires the concurrent simulation of stomatal and nonstomatal effects. As part of a larger ecosystem model, this combined model can be used to assess climate effects on grassland productivity.

Accurate streamflow forecasts are key to the water resources planning and decision-making process. There is growing evidence that variability in western streamflow is modulated by large-scale ocean-atmospheric features. Traditional forecasting techniques, however, do not systematically utilize large-scale climate information. In this study we present a framework for incorporating climate information into water resources decision-making and demonstrate the method on the semiarid Truckee-Carson Basin in Nevada where environmental, agricultural, and municipal demands compete for a limited supply of water. In this basin, water managers must plan carefully to meet the demands of timing and required flowrates. The framework presented in this paper consists of a streamflow forecast system that is based on large-scale climate information. The forecasts are then incorporated in a decision-support tool to aid in water resources planning and decision making. Previous work on the Truckee-Carson Basin has demonstrated that incorporating climate information into the forecast can increase the accuracy (or skill) and lead time of forecasts. This paper focuses on the decision-support system that is used to evaluate decision strategies and demonstrates possible water management improvements. The performance of the framework and the improved forecasts are evaluated on the Truckee-Carson system by using a suite of years from the historical record. © 2007 ASCE.","Climatology; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Streamflow; Water management","Climate change; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Hydrology; Rivers; Water supply; Climate variability; Streamflow; Water demand; Water management; Climate change; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Hydrology; Rivers; Water management; Water supply; climatology; decision support system; forecasting method; river basin; streamflow; water demand; water management; water planning; water supply; Carson River; Nevada; North America; Truckee River; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347359681

To determine the performance and efficiency of the Lagrangian particle modelling system used for this purpose a study was made where a general purpose modelling system designed for local-scale areas was used. The main goal of the study was to evaluate a modelling system of this kind using an operational configuration of both input data and model parameters, choosing a testing period with very complex dispersion conditions. This severe check could help to better understand the general quality that a model can achieve in these conditions giving some idea on how to better evaluate and use some results that seem to be very negative simply looking at some statistical parameter. Data from a three-week experimental campaign performed around the Šoštanj thermal power plant during the spring of 1991 was used (analyzed) for evaluation. The database covers very high ambient concentrations (due to the absence of desulphurisation plants) over complex terrain. The simulation was performed for the full duration of the campaign and a particular situation during the 1st and the 2nd of April 1991 was used as an example to outline the model behaviour in complex conditions. During this selected sub-period measurements revealed that (measured) wind speeds were very low, wind changed course in all directions rapidly and consequently the plume spread in all directions. A comparison between measured and reconstructed SO2 concentrations was made at the positions of several automatic air quality measuring stations located around the thermal power plant. Standard statistical indexes to evaluate model performances are instead computed at the same positions for the entire period of the experimental campaign. Overall the reconstructed SO2 concentrations were underestimated relative to the measured ones, but all direct air pollution events were reconstructed. Some weaknesses of the model in the correct reconstruction of peak events are explained and a way to better describe them and to enhance statistical indexes is proposed. © Società Italiana di Fisica.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49949108168

This approach may bias health estimates or miss important intra-urban variability for primary air pollutants. In this study, we estimate primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5) intake fractions (iF; the fraction of a pollutant emitted from a source that is inhaled by the population) for each of 23 398 road segments in the Boston Metro Core area to evaluate the potential for intra-urban variability in the emissions-to-exposure relationship. We estimate iFs using the CAL3QHCR line source model combined with residential populations within 5000 m of each road segment. The annual average values for the road segments range from 0.8 to 53 per million, with a mean of 12 per million. On average, 46% of the total exposure is realized within 200 m of the road segment, though this varies from 0 to 93% largely due to variable population patterns.

This is particularly significant with respect to gradually developing anomalies such as droughts. The impact of the 1995-1996 drought on the Oklahoma wheat crop, and the possibility that predictive information might have reduced some of the losses, is examined through a combined modeling approach using climatological data and a crop growth model that takes into account an extensive range of soil, climatic, and plant variables. The results show potential outcomes and also illustrate the point at which all possible climatic outcomes were predicting a significantly low wheat yield. Based on anecdotal evidence of the 1995-1996 drought, which suggested that farmers who planted at different times experienced different yields, the model was run assuming a variety of different planting dates. Results indicate that there is indeed a noticeable difference in the modeled wheat yields given different planting dates. The information regarding effectiveness of planting date can be used in conjunction with current long-range forecasts to develop improved predictions for the current growing season. This approach produces information regarding the likelihood of extreme precipitation events and the impact on crop yield, which can provide a powerful tool to farmers and others during periods of drought or other climatic extremes. © 2007 ISB.","Climatic impacts on agriculture; Drought; Wheat yield forecast","acclimatization; article; biological model; computer simulation; environment; growth, development and aging; physiology; season; United States; wheat; Acclimatization; Computer Simulation; Environment; Models, Biological; Oklahoma; Seasons; Triticum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36448991943

This paper shows how charges based upon consumption could facilitate trading among metered consumers and provide incentives to non-metered customers to switch to a metered tariff. To develop a household domestic water trading scheme, various environmental trading schemes were examined including the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) and tradable energy quotas (TEQs). The derived scheme encourages domestic consumers to trade and reduce their water use. Although a degree of trading would be possible on an occasional basis for unmetered properties (by the substitution of appliances with water-conserving models) and conventionally metered properties (based upon sustained reductions in consumption, but on an annual basis), frequent full trading would only be possible if smart water meters were installed. It is concluded that, while water trading schemes are feasible, they present a number of challenges. However, due to the availability of a number of existing potential elements, Implementation - at least on a regional basis - could be achievable relatively quickly. Once an initial scheme is running it could be refined and expanded to other regions, and nationally or internationally, if appropriate.","Business; Conservation; Hydrology & water resource","Domestic consumers; United Kingdom; Water conserving models; Water trading schemes; Hydrology; Water conservation; Water meters; Water resources; Water distribution systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37349040145

Most of the annual precipitation to this region arrives during the wet season, but the importance of orographic precipitation during the dry and transitional seasons should not be underestimated. Development associated with ecotourism has put significant stress on water resources, and recent work has shown evidence that changes in regional land-cover and global climate may lead to reduced precipitation and cloud cover and a subsequent decline in endemic species. Precipitation samples collected from 2003 to 2005 reveal a seasonal signal in stable isotope composition, as measured by δ18O and δ2H, that is heaviest during the dry and transitional seasons. Attenuated versions of this signal propagate through to stream samples and provide a means of determining the importance of precipitation delivered by the trade winds during the dry and transitional seasons to water resources for the region. Results from six catchments on the leeward slope indicate that topography exerts a strong control on the importance of orographic precipitation to stream baseflow.

Previous crystallographic studies concluded that the structure of hydrozincite was a simple one. However both Raman and infrared spectroscopy show that this conclusion is questionable. Multiple bands are observed in both the Raman and infrared spectra in the (CO3)2- antisymmetric stretching and bending regions of hydrozincite showing that the symmetry of the carbonate anion is reduced and in all probability the carbonate anions are not equivalent in the hydrozincite structure. Multiple OH stretching vibrations centred in both the Raman and infrared spectra show that the OH units in the hydrozincite structure are non-equivalent. The Raman spectrum of synthetic smithsonite is a simple spectrum characteristic of carbonate with Raman bands observed at 1408, 1092 and 730 cm-1. The symmetry of the carbonate anion in hydrozincite is C2v or Cs. This symmetry reduction results in multiple bands in both the symmetric stretching and bending regions. The intense band of hydrozincite at 1062 cm-1 is assigned to the ν1 (CO3)2- symmetric stretching mode. Three Raman bands assigned to the ν3 (CO3)2- antisymmetric stretching modes are observed for hydrozincite at 1545, 1532 and 1380 cm-1. Multiple infrared or Raman bands are observed in 800-850 cm-1 and 720-750 cm-1 regions and are attributed to ν2 and ν4 bending modes confirming the reduction of the carbonate anion symmetry in the hydrozincite structure.

The present - ecologically unsustainable - trajectory of human development fails to provide for the basic needs of a substantial fraction of the global population, while diminishing the prospects for future generations. Human-caused climate change has already begun to affect weather patterns, physical and biological phenomena, and vulnerable human communities. Because the social processes of production and consumption have their own momentum, and because carbon dioxide has a long atmospheric lifetime, further climate change is inevitable over the coming century, even allowing for the adoption of mitigation measures. This situation implies that we should also try to reduce, and where possible to prevent, the adverse effects of climate changes by planned adaptation. Will human settlements be able to provide a healthy living environment and shelter from extreme climate events, such as cyclones and heat waves? In this paper, we review the nexus between human health, climate change, and the planning of housing and human settlements.

In order to understand how rising temperatures and nutrient loading affect the biogeochemistry of whole lake ecosystems, it is essential to understand the interactive effects that temperature and resources have on the metabolism of natural bacterioplankton communities. To address this question we sampled bacterial communities from 1 mesotrophic and 1 oligotrophic lake in Clearwater County, Minnesota, USA, in winter and summer. Each community was exposed to a combination of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus additions at 4 different levels (ambient, 2x, 5x, and 10x ambient) and 4 temperatures (4, 14, 24 and 34°C). Community metabolic response to temperature depended on the resource treatment, and the season when the community was sampled. Bacterial respiration increased more with temperature than bacterial growth, resulting in decreased bacterial growth efficiencies at higher temperatures. This result was most pronounced in the high resource treatments, while at lower resource levels the results were more ambiguous. In addition, differences between seasons and lakes suggested that the bacterial communities had adapted or acclimated to in situ temperature such that communities sampled from cold temperature environments had higher respiration at high temperatures than those sampled from warmer environments. These results suggest that the effect of temperature on carbon cycling mediated by the bacterial community depends on both the in situ resource pool and the extent to which the bacterial community is acclimated to a specific temperature regime. © Inter-Research 2007.","Bacterial growth efficiency; Bacterioplankton; BGE; Carbon cycling; Multiple stressors; Temperature and nutrient interactions","Bacteria (microorganisms); Prokaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149103801

In particular, most terrestrial systems show smaller cascades than most aquatic ones. Ecologists still remain challenged to explain this variation. Here, we examine a food quality hypothesis which states that higher quality plants should promote stronger trophic cascades. Food quality involves two components: digestion resistance of plants and magnitude of stoichiometric imbalance between plants and herbivores (where stoichiometry involves ratios of nutrient:carbon ratio of tissues). Both factors vary among ecosystems and could mediate conversion efficiency of plants into new herbivores (and hence control of plants by herbivores). We explored the food quality hypothesis using two models, one assuming that plant stoichiometry is a fixed trait, the other one allowing this trait to vary dynamically (but with a minimal nutrient:carbon ratio of structural mass). Both models produce the same suite of results. First, as expected, systems with more easily digested plants promote stronger cascades. Second, contrary to expectations, higher (fixed or minimal) nutrient:carbon ratio of plants do not promote stronger cascades, largely because of the net result of ecosystem feedbacks. Still, the model with dynamic stoichiometry permits positive correlations of realized plant nutrient:carbon ratio and cascade strength (as predicted), mediated through digestion resistance. Third, lower nutrient:carbon ratio of herbivores promotes stronger cascades. However, this result likely cannot explain variation in cascade strength because nutrient:carbon stoichiometry of herbivores does not vary greatly between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Finally, we found that predation promotes nutrient limitation of herbivores. This finding highlights that food web processes, such as predation, can influence stoichiometry-mediated interactions of plants and herbivores. © Oikos.",,"biomass; carbon isotope ratio; food quality; nutrient limitation; plant-herbivore interaction; secondary production; stoichiometry; trophic cascade",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250704769

An alternative strategy is to use a hurricane model to produce large sets of synthetic hurricane tracks. This method provides, for 11 regions of the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the annual landfall probabilities of hurricanes from each category of the Saffir-Simpson scale. This model can be used to investigate the future of hurricane risks. As a first step, the model is run with a 10% increase in potential intensity. Annual landfall probabilities increase in all regions, especially for the strongest hurricanes. The vulnerability of each U.S. coastal county is then calibrated using data on past hurricanes and their normalized economic losses. Annual hurricane damages increase by +54% in response to a 10% increase in potential intensity, meaning that the average normalized losses caused by hurricanes would increase from approximately $8 billion to about $12 billion per year. These results suggest that hurricane losses are very sensitive to changes in potential intensity and may rise significantly in response to climate change. This paper calls, therefore, for taking into account hurricane damages in the analysis of climate policies, even though other factors like population evolution, economic growth, and preparedness may remain the main drivers of hurricane damages. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate change; Mathematical models; Probability; Risk analysis; Risk management; Climate policies; Hurricane tracks; Saffir-Simpson scale; Hurricane effects; climate change; disaster management; environmental policy; hurricane; probability; risk assessment; storm damage; tracking; Gulf Coast [United States]; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35548959310

Such a concentration of houses can have adverse effects on the micro-climate due to the presence of a large number of roofs which have a tendency to warm the surrounding air, leading to heat island effects. The use of insulated roof slabs provides an alternative that may enable the creation of green cover at roof level. In this research, the performance of different insulation thicknesses has been evaluated, indicating that a minimum thickness of 25 mm would be desirable in tropical climatic conditions. The effect of creating green cover was determined with actual models. It is proved with comparative studies that shading screens can be used to simulate the presence of green cover with computer simulations.

Hence, what happens in cities is profoundly important for sustainability, both for the welfare of the people who live there and for the demands that humankind makes on the earth's resources. The modern city draws those resources from across the world and requires a huge notional land area to assimilate its waste products; it has a very large ecological footprint. However, because this is where people and material transformations are concentrated, innovation in cities to improve the effectiveness of resource use can make an important contribution towards sustainable development. One approach is through shaping the city and there has been much debate about the extent to which urban form and function can contribute to sustainability. The debate gains contemporary relevance in the UK as societal change pushes up the rate of household formation, especially in South East England. The policy consensus favours urban containment and polycentric development with an implied increase in housing densities. However, even the most committed urbanists recognise the importance of providing a richly vegetated and biodiverse urban environment to sustain quality of life. Despite this, in Britain, there has been a significant decline in the quality of public open space. One way to redeem the potential of these important assets is to recognise properly the contribution that they can make to economic, social and environmental welfare - the three pillars of sustainability. The proper context for this is to develop a landscape planning and management strategy based around multi-functional green networks of corridors and spaces - what is coming to be known as 'green infrastructure'. This chapter discusses new research which emphasises that the green infrastructure may have an even greater importance in a changing climate. Natural processes do not stop at the city limits, rather they are intensified by urbanisation and these effects, such as the urban heat island and accelerated runoff, are multiplied by climate change. A comprehensive approach to planning and designing the green infrastructure of all areas, including town centres and residential areas, may be the most effective way to realise some of the benefits, whilst moderating the impacts of climate change. © 2000, 2007 John F.

High climatic sensitivity and lack of significant human impact make alpine river basins important environments for examining hydrological and ecological response to global change. 2. This paper is based upon previous and ongoing research within a glacierized, alpine river system (Taillon- Gabiétous basin, French Pyrenees), which adopts an interdisciplinary approach to investigate the climate-hydrology-ecology cascade. Data are used to advance hypotheses concerning impacts of climate change/variability upon alpine river system hydrology and ecology. 3. The snowpacks and glaciers that are the source of Pyrenean streams are climatically sensitive, with glaciers in retreat for most of the historical period. Given anticipated changes in summer air-mass frequencies, the volume of meltwater may decrease, the nature and rate of glacier drainage may alter, and the timing of peak snow- and ice-melt may shift. However, rainfall-runoff and groundwater may increase their relative contributions to stream flow. 4. The influence of changing water source contributions on physico-chemical habitat and, in turn, on benthic communities is assessed using an alternative alpine stream classification. This model predicts more rapid downstream change in benthic communities in the future as meltwater contributions decline and, at the basin-scale, biodiversity may be reduced owing to less spatiotemporal heterogeneity in water sources contributions and, thus, physico-chemical habitat. However, predictions are complicated by potential changes in biotic interactions with altered species' distributions. 5. Integrated, long-term research into the climate-hydrology- ecology cascade in other alpine river basins is vital because interdisciplinary science is fundamental to predicting stream hydrology and ecology under scenarios of future climate/variability, to assessing the utility of alpine river systems as indicators of global change, and to developing conservation strategies for these fragile ecosystems.

Their clear advantage lies in being able to provide heating using 25 to 30% of the energy consumed by even the most efficient conventional alternatives. Their drawback has been high capital costs and uncertainty about whether the emissions associated with the electric power used to energise the system has higher system-wide emissions than the highest-efficiency furnaces. This study delineates circumstances under which GSHP systems achieve net emission reductions, for different electricity generation methods, heat pump efficiencies, and heating loads. We illustrate the effect of relative fuel prices on annual operating savings using fuel prices in multiple countries. Annual operating savings determine how rapidly the technology achieves payback and then generates return on the initial capital investment. Finally, we highlight the least cost supply curve for using GSHP to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Positive feedbacks predominate. This allows the entire planet to be whipsawed between climate states. One feedback, the 'albedo flip' property of ice/water, provides a powerful trigger mechanism. A climate forcing that 'flips' the albedo of a sufficient portion of an ice sheet can spark a cataclysm. Inertia of ice sheet and ocean provides only moderate delay to ice sheet disintegration and a burst of added global warming. Recent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions place the Earth perilously close to dramatic climate change that could run out of our control, with great dangers for humans and other creatures. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the largest human-made climate forcing, but other trace constituents are also important. Only intense simultaneous efforts to slow CO2 emissions and reduce non-CO 2 forcings can keep climate within or near the range of the past million years. The most important of the non-CO2 forcings is methane (CH4), as it causes the second largest human-made GHG climate forcing and is the principal cause of increased tropospheric ozone (O3), which is the third largest GHG forcing. Nitrous oxide (N2O) should also be a focus of climate mitigation efforts. Black carbon ('black soot') has a high global warming potential (approx. 2000, 500 and 200 for 20, 100 and 500 years, respectively) and deserves greater attention. Some forcings are especially effective at high latitudes, so concerted efforts to reduce their emissions could preserve Arctic ice, while also having major benefits for human health, agricultural productivity and the global environment. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Arctic; Black carbon; Climate change; Climate feedbacks; Sea level; Trace gases",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547263398

Most of these plants started up less than 15 years ago. The drivers, processes, systems, scale-up methods and partner collaborations for this rapid invasion of a new process intensified technique are explained in this paper. The business drivers are (a) economical (prosperity): variable cost, capital expenditure and energy requirement reduction. In all cases these are reduced by 20% or more, when compared to the classic set-up of a reactor followed by distillation. (b) Environmental (planet): lower emissions to the environment. In all cases carbon dioxide and diffusive emissions are reduced and (c) social (people): improvements on safely, health and society impact are obtained by lower reactive content, lower run away sensitivity and lower space occupation. These industrial reactive distillation systems comprise homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysed, irreversible and reversible reactions, covering large ranges of reactions, notably hydrogenations, hydrodesulfurisation, esterifications and etherification. Various commercial methods for packing heterogeneous catalyst in columns are now available. The systems comprise amongst others: multiple catalyst systems, gas and liquid internal recycle traffic over these catalyst systems, separation, mass flow, and enthalpy exchange. These are integrated optimally in a single vessel, a characteristic feature of process intensification. The scale-up methods applied from pilot plants to commercial scale are brute force and modelling. Technology providers CDTECH and Sulzer Chemtech have used these scale-up methods successfully. Barriers perceived and real have also been removed by these companies. Chemical manufacturing companies have also developed their own specific reactive distillations by their own research and development. These companies, both on their own and in consortia, also developed heuristic process synthesis rules and expert software to identify the attractiveness and technical feasibility of reactive distillation. Heuristic rules and expert software will be presented and supported by examples. Academic research also produced design methods to identify the feasibility of reactive distillation, to determine the feed locations, to select packing types, to sequence columns optimally and also produced methods to design, optimise and control the columns with steady state and dynamic simulation models. The rapid commercial scale implementation of reactive distillation by co-operation of partners in research, scale-up, design and reliable operation can also be seen as a model for rapid implementation of other process intensification techniques in the chemical industry. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The response of fish methylmercury concentrations to changes in mercury deposition has been difficult to establish because sediments/soils contain large pools of historical contamination, and many factors in addition to deposition affect fish mercury. To test directly the response of fish contamination to changing mercury deposition, we conducted a whole-ecosystem experiment, increasing the mercury load to a lake and its watershed by the addition of enriched stable mercury isotopes. The isotopes allowed us to distinguish between experimentally applied mercury and mercury already present in the ecosystem and to examine bioaccumulation of mercury deposited to different parts of the watershed. Fish methylmercury concentrations responded rapidly to changes in mercury deposition over the first 3 years of study. Essentially all of the increase in fish methylmercury concentrations came from mercury deposited directly to the lake surface. In contrast, <1% of the mercury isotope deposited to the watershed was exported to the lake. Steady state was not reached within 3 years. Lake mercury isotope concentrations were still rising in lake biota, and watershed mercury isotope exports to the lake were increasing slowly. Therefore, we predict that mercury emissions reductions will yield rapid (years) reductions in fish methylmercury concentrations and will yield concomitant reductions in risk. However, a full response will be delayed by the gradual export of mercury stored in watersheds. The rate of response will vary among lakes depending on the relative surface areas of water and watershed. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Bioaccumulation; Mercury methylation; Methylmercury; Stable isotopes; Whole-ecosystem experimentation","mercury; methylmercury; anaerobic bacterium; article; bioaccumulation; biota; contamination; ecosystem; fish; nonhuman; priority journal; sediment; watershed management; Animals; Ecosystem; Fishes; Fresh Water; Geologic Sediments; Mercury Isotopes; Methylmercury Compounds; Water Pollution, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36748999970

For example, the exchange can reduce disposal costs and provide a cheaper input for the receiving company. The environmental benefits can include reduced collective resource consumption and waste generation, whilst the social benefits may include new employment opportunities and reduction of emission (e.g. water or traffic) to the local community.

The magnitude of these effects may be limited by climate and by limited plasticity in tissue chemistry within a given photosynthetic pathway. We tested the hypotheses that (1) fire reduces rates of C and N cycling, while grazing increases them, and (2) these changes are due to intraspecific changes in plant tissue chemistry rather than competitive replacements by species with differing tissue chemistry. Plant and soil C and N content and isotopic ratios, soil microbial biomass C, and potential C mineralization were measured in areas of the southern Caldenal region of central Argentina with known histories of fire and grazing. Results support the hypothesis that fire reduces rates of N cycling via intraspecific increases in plant tissue C/N. Contrary to our first hypothesis, grazing also reduced plant tissue N. Fire and grazing effects on plant tissue chemistry resulted primarily from changes in dynamics of soil inorganic N. These changes were due to intraspecific changes in plant tissue chemistry, which was in agreement with our second hypothesis. Potential C mineralization experiments revealed little difference between treatments in pool sizes and mean residence times of labile soil organic carbon. Livestock grazing and fire have significant influences on soil N dynamics, particularly as mediated by soil microbes, in managed grasslands of the southern Caldenal in Argentina. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Historical data reveal that this period was also characterized by the worst known famines on record. Exploratory comparisons of variations in Nile flood discharge with high-resolution data on sea surface temperature of the North Atlantic climate from three case studies suggest that rainfall at the source of the Nile was influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation. However, there are apparently flip-flop reversals from periods when variations in Nile flood discharge are positively related to North Atlantic warming to periods where the opposite takes place. The key transitions occur at∼AD 900, 1010, 1070, 1180, 1350 and 1400. The putative flip-flop junctures, which require further confirmation, appear to be quite rapid and some seem to have had dramatic effects on Nile flood discharge, especially if they recurred at short intervals, characteristic of the period from the 9th to the 14th century, coincident with the so-called Medieval Warm Period. The transition from one state to the other was characterized by incidents of low, high or a succession of both low and high extreme floods. The cluster of extreme floods was detrimental causing famines and economic disasters that are unmatched over the last 2000 years. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"climate effect; discharge; famine; flood; Medieval Warm Period; North Atlantic Oscillation; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; rainfall; sea surface temperature; Africa; East Africa; Nile; Sub-Saharan Africa; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548415464

To produce accurate predictions requires characterizing both the source of hazardous material and the local meteorological conditions. Decision makers use information on contaminant source location and transport prediction to decide on the best methods to mitigate and prevent effects. The problem has both observational and computational aspects. Field monitors are likely to be used to detect the release and measure concentrations of the toxic material. Algorithms are then required to invert the problem in order to infer the characteristics of the source and the local meteorology. Here, a genetic algorithm is coupled with transport and dispersion models to assimilate sensor data in order to characterize emission sources and the wind vector. The parameters computed include two dimensional source location, amount of the release, and wind direction. This methodology is demonstrated for a basic Gaussian plume dispersion model and verified in the context of an identical twin numerical experiment, in which synthetic dispersion data is created with the same dispersion model. Error bounds are set using Monte Carlo techniques and robustness assessed by adding white noise. Algorithm speed is tuned by optimizing the parameters of the genetic algorithm.

G1K 7P4, Canada","This study represents a step towards developing seasonal climate inferences by using high-resolution modern data sets. The importance of seasonal climate changes is highlighted by the instrumental record of a meteorological station close to our study site (lac du Sommet in the Laurentian Mountains, Québec, Canada): Between 1966 and 2001, May temperatures increased significantly by 3.1°C (r = 0.41, n = 35, p < 0.01) but annual mean temperatures only by 0.6°C (r = 0.21, n = 35, p > 0.05). Comparison of this instrumental record with fossil diatom assemblages in a sediment core from lac du Sommet showed that axis one of a principal component analysis (PCA) of the fossil diatoms was best correlated with wind velocity in June (r = 0.62, n = 19, p < 0.005) and that past diatom production was significantly enhanced in periods with colder July temperatures (r = -0.77, n = 19, p < 0.0005) and higher wind velocity in June (r = 77, n = 19, p < 0.0005). The strong impact of the spring and summer conditions on overall diatom composition and productivity suggests that seasonal lake responses to climate are more important than annual mean temperatures. However, the seasonal dynamics of diatom communities are not well understood, and seasonality is rarely inferred effectively from lake sediment studies. Our research presents a pilot study to answer a twofold question: Is it possible to identify diatom communities which are typical for warmer or colder seasonal climate using sediment traps, and if it is, can this knowledge be used to infer seasonal climate conditions from fossil diatom assemblages? To address these questions, the seasonal dynamics of diatom communities and water chemistry were studied using sediment traps and water samples at biweekly intervals in four lakes distributed along an altitudinal gradient in the Laurentian Mountains from May through October 2002. Date of ice break-up was significantly related to the diatom assemblages taken in spring and uncorrelated to other significant environmental variables. Summer water temperature, circulation of the water column and pH explained a significant part of the biological variance in summer, and total nitrogen (TN) explained most of the biological variance in autumn. To infer these variables, weighted averaging partial least squares models were applied to the seasonal data sets. Inferred ice break-up dates were significantly correlated with number of days below 0°C in April (r = 0.52, n = 19, p < 0.025), inferred circulation of the water column was significantly related to measured wind velocity in June (r = 0.64, n = 19, p < 0.005), inferred summer water temperature and inferred pH was significantly related to measured July air temperature (r = 0.50, r = -53, n = 19, p < 0.025) and inferred TN autumn concentrations had an inverse relationship to August temperatures (r = -0.53, n = 19, p < 0.01). This comparison of the historical record with diatom-inferred seasonal climate signals, based on the comparison of fossil diatom assemblages with modern sediment trap data of high temporal resolution, provides a promising new approach for the reconstruction of seasonal climate aspects in paleolimnological studies. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Boreal lakes; Climate; Diatoms; Limnology; Multivariate statistics; Paleolimnology; Seasonality; Sediment traps; Shallow lakes","climate change; diatom; fossil assemblage; fossil record; lacustrine environment; paleolimnology; principal component analysis; resolution; seasonal variation; seasonality; sediment trap; wind velocity; Canada; Laurentian Mountains; North America; Quebec [Canada]; Bacillariophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249902501

The aquatic ecology of these wetlands is partly controlled by the salinity of the wetland pond water, which affects the vegetation and invertebrate communities. The objective of this study was to identify the key geochemical processes affecting water chemistry in prairie wetlands. We used the combined water and solute mass balance approach to quantify the rates of geochemical reactions in a typical prairie recharge wetland in Saskatchewan, Canada. Sulfate reduction, carbonate mineral dissolution, and processes adding carbon dioxide to the pond were identified as the key geochemical reactions. Sulfate reduction removed more sulfate from the pond than infiltration in each of the four years examined. The average rate of sulfate reduction, 0.07 g m-2 d-1, was greatest in spring and decreased during the year. Reduced sulfate remains in the sediments but is re-oxidized when the pond dries out and is dissolved into the pond water and sediment pore water when the pond re-floods. X-ray diffraction analyses of wetland soil and mass balance calculations indicate magnesium-calcite is dissolved into the pond water in the spring and precipitates out of solution later in the year, and dissolves into the pond the following year. © 2007, The Society of Wetland Scientists.","Carbonate; Chloride; Mg-calcite; Prairie wetland; Sulfate reduction; Water balance","aquatic ecosystem; carbonate; chloride; dissolution; geochemistry; mass balance; recharge; solute; water budget; wetland; Canada; North America; Saskatchewan; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55949124462

Observational data consisted of 1200 UT sea level pressure fields obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Final Analysis and O3 measurements from 474 Environmental Protection Agency and five AIRMAP monitoring sites. The five most common circulation patterns, or map types (I-V), were identified with a correlation-based synoptic categorization technique, which persisted on 65% of the days during the study period. Map type I, characterized by stagnant warm conditions throughout the northeast, occurred most frequently (21%) with associated episodes of high O3. Interannual variability in O3 varied regionally from a seasonally averaged daily maximum value of 64 ppbv in 2002 to a minimum of 52 ppbv in 2004. By considering both the sea level pressure system intensity and frequency of each map type, 46% of the interannual variability in summertime O3 was reproduced with intensity being the dominant factor. The remaining interannual variability was possibly due to nonlinear relationships between climate and biogenic emissions and/or recent reductions of power plant emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) over the eastern United States. The storm track of cyclones in the eastern United States was a key determinate of the intensity of circulation patterns.

(0.3E6 MeVatom) through carbon, aluminum, and silicon thin foils has been calculated. We have considered that the carbon atomic ions resulting from the dissociation of these clusters feel Coulomb explosion, stopping, and wake forces due to the target polarization, as well as nuclear scattering with the target nuclei; the three former interactions depend on the ion charge state, which can change during its travel through the foil, due to electron-capture and -loss processes. Our calculation predicts an enhancement of the average energy loss of each dissociated atomic ion in comparison with the case of the same, but isolated, carbon atomic ion, which is small for velocities v∼1 a.u. and becomes more important for higher velocities (v∼4 a.u.). The energy loss of the dissociated atomic ions generally increases with the size and packing level of the cluster, although in some cases it tends to a saturation value (when the number of constituents of the cluster increases) or it could even decrease with cluster size for certain situations (for projectiles with 1v2 a.u. in aluminum or silicon targets). The vicinage effects in the energy loss also depend on the target nature, being more important for silicon and aluminum foils than for amorphous carbon foils. Our results show that in most cases the highest enhancement in energy loss should be expected for large clusters with high projectile velocities in aluminum or silicon targets.

Under some conditions, however, biodiesel produced from certain feedstocks has been shown to cause an increase in nitrogen oxides (NOx). This is of special concern in urban areas that are subject to strict environmental regulations. Although soy-based biodiesel may increase the emission of nitrogen oxides, it is the most easily accessible in North America. We investigated two routes to reformulate soy-based biodiesel in an effort to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. In one of these, soy-oil methyl esters were modified by conversion of a proportion of the cis bonds in the fatty acid chains of its methyl esters to their trans isomers. In the other approach, polyol derivatives of soybean oil were transesterified to form soy methyl polyol fatty acid esters. The NOx emissions of these modified biodiesels were then examined, using a Yanmar L100 single cylinder, four stroke, naturally aspirated, air cooled, direct injection diesel engine. Using either isomerized methyl oleate or isomerized soy biodiesel, at 20% blend level in petroleum diesel ('B20'), nitrogen oxide emissions were elevated by between 1.5 and 3 percentage points relative to the combustion of a B20 blend of commercial biodiesel. Nitrogen oxide emissions were reduced in proportion to blend level during the combustion of polyol biodiesel, with a 20% blend in petrodiesel resulting in a reduction of about 4.5 percentage points relative to the emissions of a comparable blend of commercial soy biodiesel. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The study follows a backcasting study approach, developing a business as usual baseline for transport emissions, and two alternative scenarios to 2030. Different policy measures are assessed and assembled into mutually supporting policy packages (PP). Although 2030 seems a long way ahead, action must be taken now if the targets for CO2 reduction are to be met.

I witnessed the following three major obstacles to legislation intended to protect the climate system: 1) there is a persistent gap in understanding between policy makers and the research community, 2) there is a small group of powerful interests that will experience the costs of climate policy acutely while many of the benefits of climate policy will be distributed diffusely among members of society, and 3) there is concern - legitimate and misplaced - over the economic consequences of unilateral U.S. action and the genuine need for international cooperation. The scientific community can help solve these problems. The Congressional Science Fellowship program, for example, provides a valuable opportunity for scientists to actively engage in the policy process and to help reduce the gap in understanding between the research and policy communities. During my year, I focused on developing powerful incentives to encourage international cooperation and provisions to ease acute distributional impacts that could arise from reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Based on my time in Congress and despite remaining political and technological hurdles, I conclude that we have the capacity to enact legislation that begins reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate change; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Laws and legislation; Public policy; Climate problem; Climate system; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climatology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548645070

More environmentally friendly waste management options shall be promoted under the framework of the Community Waste Strategy ([96] 399 Final). In this context, the production and thermal use of solid recovered fuels (SRFs), derived from nonhazardous bioresidues and mixed- and mono-waste streams, could be a key element in a future waste management system. Within the scope of the European Demonstration Project, RECOFUEL, SRF cocombustion was demonstrated in two large-scale lignite-fired coal boilers at RWE power station in Weisweiler, Germany. As a consequence of the high biogenic share of the cocombusted material, this approach can be considered beneficial following European Directive 2001/77/EC on electricity from renewable energy sources (directive). During the experimental campaign, the share of SRF in the overall thermal input was adjusted to approximately 2%, resulting into a feeding rate of approximately 25 t/hr. The measurement campaign included boiler measurements in different locations, fuel and ash sampling, and its characterization. The corrosion rates were monitored by dedicated corrosion probes. The overall results showed no significant influence of SRF cocombustion on boiler operation, emissions behavior, and residues quality for the thermal shares applied. Also, no effect of the increased chlorine concentration of the recovered fuel was observed in the flue gas path after the desulfurization unit.

So it's very important to have a view to the hazards witch can be caused by the different technologies. This publication wants to give an overview to the different kinds of emissions their sources the effects and what can be done to reduce them. With regard to the numerous welding and cutting applications this article will be concentrated to gas shielded arc welding and its variations and especially to gas metal arc welding of mild steel. These variations are taking effect to the fumes gases and particles, their amounts and sizes. The hazards caused by these emissions reach from harmful to toxic to cancerous. European communities arrogate regulations for a human arrangement for workplaces. In the past that meant upper, lower, critical or average values for the different emissions. And collateral to our technical development the requirements to a cleaner workspace increase. Today we have a simpler situation. We have only three limits, the breathable fraction, the alveolar fraction and the guide component of each application. Modern shielding gases are an instrument to take influence to the welding process and finally to the emissions. In this case we are talking about the reduction of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. This can be reached by reducing carbon dioxide or changing it against oxygen.","Alveolar dust fraction; Breathable dust fraction; Emissions; Filler material; Gas metal arc welding; Guide components; Maximum allowable concentration; Particulate matter; Shielding gases; Sources","Carbon dioxide; Metal cutting; Particulate emissions; Toxic materials; Alveolar dust fraction; Breathable dust fraction; Filler materials; Guide components; Maximum allowable concentration; Particulate matters; Shielding gases; Gas metal arc welding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547664995

The country's economic crisis was accompanied by regime collapse, resulting in the departure of then President Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian rule. This paper examines the country's socioeconomic development in the decade since the crisis, in the context of the earlier growth, and the very different institutions of economic governance operating under the new democratic regime of weakened central authority and many more economic policy actors. The main conclusions are that growth and macroeconomic stability have been restored surprisingly quickly, but that microeconomic policy and the investment climate are less predictable. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","Crisis; Economic development; Indonesia; Recovery","economic development; economic growth; economic history; economic instability; governance approach; macroeconomics; market transition; microeconomics; political economy; socioeconomic conditions; Asia; Eurasia; Indonesia; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547420711

The main hydrothermal activity occurred in a craterlike basin (depth, ∼23 m) on the coral reef seafloor. The vent fluid (maximum temperature, &gt;52°C) contained 175 μM H2S and gas bubbles mainly composed of CH4 (69%) and N2 (29%). A liquid serial dilution cultivation technique targeting a variety of metabolism types quantified each population in the vent fluid and in a white microbial mat located near the vent. The most abundant microorganisms cultivated from both the fluid and the mat were autotrophic sulfur oxidizers, including mesophilic Thiomicrospira spp. and thermophilic Sulfurivirga caldicuralii. Methane oxidizers were the second most abundant organisms in the fluid; one novel type I methanotroph exhibited optimum growth at 37°C, and another novel type I methanotroph exhibited optimum growth at 45°C. The number of hydrogen oxidizers cultivated only from the mat was less than the number of sulfur and methane oxidizers, although a novel mesophilic hydrogen-oxidizing member of the Epsilonproteobacteria was isolated. Various mesophilic to hyperthermophilic heterotrophs, including sulfate-reducing Desulfovibrio spp., iron-reducing Deferribacter sp., and sulfur-reducing Thermococcus spp., were also cultivated. Culture-independent 16S rRNA gene clone analysis of the vent fluid and mat revealed highly diverse archaeal communities. In the bacterial community, S. caldicuralii was identified as the predominant phylotype in the fluid (clonal frequency, 25%). Both bacterial clone libraries indicated that there were bacterial communities involved in sulfur, hydrogen, and methane oxidation and sulfate reduction. Our results indicate that there are unique microbial communities that are sustained by active chemosynthetic primary production rather than by photosynthetic production in a shallow hydrothermal system where sunlight is abundant.

The size-fractionated plankton were effectively and gently separated by gravity through a novel trace-metal-clean filtration device, equipped with 150-, 60-, and 10-μm aperture nets in sequence to concentrate the plankton. P-normalized metal quotas in the largest fraction, mostly composed of copepods, were close to or slightly lower than the average metal quotas obtained from previous field studies. However, the total metal quotas in the two smaller fractions were 8- to 40-fold higher than the largest one, and they increased with decreasing sizes. The striking correlation between some essential metals and chlorophyll (Chl) in the SPM at the offshore site indicates that the majority of the metals were associated with algae. Nevertheless, the P-normalized metal quotas also showed positive correlations with abiogenic Al and Mn, indicating that most of the metals associated with phytoplankton were from extracellular inorganic particles. Preliminary evidence suggests that the extracellular metals were originally derived from anthropogenic aerosols, which contain abundant dissolvable trace metals. The metal quotas of the zooplankton assemblages have a fairly consistent value as compared to observations from other regions, but algae larger than 10 μm carry overwhelming amounts of extracellular metals even in offshore areas.

In particular we aimed to increase our understanding of ecosystem dynamics and function, species redundancy, invasion biology, and other related topics. We studied the dynamics of serpentine annual grassland in northern California over the period 1983-2002 in a replicated series of experimental plots comprising controls, gopher exclosures, and aboveground herbivore exclosures. Annual rainfall amount varied greatly during the study period, which included two major El Niño events and a period of prolonged below-average rainfall. Gopher disturbance was highly variable both spatially and temporally but was positively correlated with soil depth. Disturbance was reduced but not eliminated from the gopher exclosures and was significantly increased in the aboveground herbivore exclosures. Grassland dynamics were driven by rainfall amounts and distributions that had the most pronounced effects on the dominant plant species, while gopher disturbance had additional effects on the rarer species. Effects of excluding aboveground herbivores were swamped by a large increase in gopher disturbance within aboveground exclosures. Overall species numbers were reduced during a period of below-average rainfall but recovered in subsequent years. There was a large array of different responses of individual plant species to both rainfall and disturbance. Our results provide support for the ""insurance"" hypothesis, which suggests that biodiversity buffers ecosystem processes against environmental changes because different species (or phenotypes) respond differently to these changes, leading to functional compensations among species. Here, a species that was at very low abundance levels at the start of the study (Microseris douglasii) temporarily increased in abundance to become one of the dominant species in the grassland following a period of prolonged below-average rainfall. We also observed the repeated invasion of the serpentine grassland by the nonnative grass Bromus hordeaceus, which increased greatly in abundance following both of the major El Niño events. The results emphasize the importance of long-term observations in providing a context for shorter-term studies and allowing analysis of plant community responses to climate variation and disturbance, particularly in the face of ongoing global change. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","""Insurance"" hypothesis; Annual grassland; California; Gopher disturbance; Long-term experiment; Patchiness; Rainfall; Serpentine; Temporal dynamics; Weed invasion","abundance; annual plant; biological invasion; climate change; dominance; ecosystem dynamics; ecosystem response; El Nino; environmental disturbance; experimental study; global change; grassland; herbivore; patchiness; precipitation intensity; serpentine; soil depth; spatiotemporal analysis; weed; California; North America; United States; Bromus; Bromus hordeaceus; Microseris douglasii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40349108573

Glutamine synthetase (GS) and assimilatory nitrate reductase (ANR) were used to investigate N bioavailability, alkaline phosphatase (AP) to assess phosphorous (P) bioavailability and β-glucosidase (β-Glu) to detect shifts in the use of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Conditions regulating activity of each enzyme were tested using incubations of < 0.6 mm size-fractionated seawater amended with different combinations of N, P, and DOC as glucose. Overall, N-deficiency was indicated by pronounced growth stimulation and repression of GS and ANR activity in incubations amended with dissolved free amino acid and ammonium. Phosphate and glucose amendments produced little or no growth stimulation, but did influence activity of all enzymes measured. Enzyme activities of bacterioplankton in mesocosms of whole plankton indicated enhanced N-deficiency and glucoside hydrolysis when the plankton community was released from any P-deficiency. Spatially, enzyme activity of bacterioplankton during two diel studies (at one slope and one open-ocean station) suggested greater N-deficiency at surface depths than within the chlorophyll maximum where activity of AP and b-Glu was often greatest. There was also greater GS and ANR activity at the open-ocean station, which had lower concentrations of dissolved inorganic N (DIN) relative to soluble reactive P (SRP), than along the continental slope of Mexico.

Under conditions expected in the 21st century, global warming and ocean acidification will compromise carbonate accretion, with corals becoming increasingly rare on reef systems. The result will be less diverse reef communities and carbonate reef structures that fail to be maintained. Climate change also exacerbates local stresses from declining water quality and overexploitation of key species, driving reefs increasingly toward the tipping point for functional collapse. This review presents future scenarios for coral reefs that predict increasingly serious consequences for reef-associated fisheries, tourism, coastal protection, and people.

Because elevated atmospheric CO2 does not increase nitrogen (N) use efficiency in many forest tree species, additional N inputs will be required to sustain increased net primary productivity (NPP) under elevated atmospheric CO2. We investigated the importance of free amino acids (AAs) as a source for forest N uptake at the Duke Forest Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) site, comparing its importance with that of better-studied inorganic N sources. Potential proteolytic enzyme activity was monitored seasonally, and individual AA concentrations were measured in organic horizon extracts. Potential free AA production in soils ranged from 190 to 690 nmol Ng-1 h-1 and was greater than potential rates of soil NH4+ production. Because of this high potential rate of organic N production, we determined (1) whether intact AA uptake occurs by Pinus taeda L., the dominant tree species at the FACE site, (2) if the rate of cycling of AAs is comparable with that of ammonium (NH4+), and (3) if atmospheric CO2 concentration alters the aforementioned N cycling processes. A field experiment using universally labeled ammonium (15NH4 +) and alanine (13C3 H7 15NO2) demonstrated that 15N is more readily taken up by plants and heterotrophic microorganisms as NH4+. Pine roots and microbes take up on average 2.4 and two times as much NH4+ 15N compared with alanine 15N 1 week after tracer application. N cycling through soil pools was similar for alanine and NH4+, with the greatest 15N tracer recovery in soil organic matter, followed by microbial biomass, dissolved organic N, extractable NH4+, and fine roots. Stoichiometric analyses of 13C and 15N uptake demonstrated that both plants and soil microorganisms take up alanine directly, with a 13C: 15N ratio of 3.3:1 in fine roots and 1.5:1 in microbial biomass. Our results suggest that intact AA (alanine) uptake contributes substantially to plant N uptake in loblolly pine forests. However, we found no evidence supporting increased recovery of free AAs in fine roots under elevated CO2, suggesting plants will need to acquire additional N via other mechanisms, such as increased root exploration or increased N use efficiency. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","13C and 15N; Alanine; Aminoacid; Ammonium; CO2; FACE; Microbial biomass N; Organic nitrogen uptake","amino acid; ammonia; biomass; carbon dioxide; enzyme activity; forest ecosystem; net primary production; nitrogen cycle; nutrient cycling; nutrient use efficiency; soil organic matter; stoichiometry; Duke Forest; North America; North Carolina; United States; Pinus taeda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548448563

Although leakage from monitored CO2 injection sites has been minimal to non-existent, experience from the natural gas storage industry suggests that, if it becomes a widely deployed technology, leaks may be expected from some storage sites. Natural occurrences of CO2 in the geosphere, some of which have been exploited, provide insights into the types of emissions that might be expected from anthropogenic CO2 storage sites. CO2 emission sites are commonly found in clusters in CO2-prone geological provinces: the most common natural emissions sites in sedimentary basins consist of carbonated springs and mofettes. These represent at worst only a local hazard. In volcanic and hydrothermal provinces, more energetic emissions may occur due to active supply from degassing magma. These include rare, sudden emissions from fissures and craters that have caused fatalities. It is unlikely that such provinces would be considered for CO2 storage Major lake overturn events such as occurred at Lake Nyos in 1986 are considered highly unlikely to occur as a result of CO2 storage, not least because CO2 levels in lake waters can be monitored and remediated. Natural CO2 fields indicate that under favourable conditions CO2 can be retained in the subsurface for millions of years. The main risk from man-made CO2 storage sites that does not have any close analogy in nature is considered to be a well blowout. A blowout that took place at a natural CO2 field provides some indication of the likely hazard. © 2006 NERC.","Carbon dioxide; Geological storage; Natural CO2 emissions","Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Natural gas; Geological storage; Natural emissions; Particulate emissions; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Natural gas; Particulate emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; fossil fuel; underground storage; Africa; Cameroon; Lake Nyos; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947384095

Therefore, to understand the ecology of Geobacter species in subsurface environments, it is important to know which species predominate. Clone libraries were assembled with 16S rRNA genes and transcripts amplified from three subsurface environments in which Geobacter species are known to be important members of the microbial community: (1) a uranium-contaminated aquifer located in Rifle, CO, USA undergoing in situ bioremediation; (2) an acetate-impacted aquifer that serves as an analog for the long-term acetate amendments proposed for in situ uranium bioremediation and (3) a petroleum-contaminated aquifer in which Geobacter species play a role in the oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons coupled with the reduction of Fe(III). The majority of Geobacteraceae 16S rRNA sequences found in these environments clustered in a phylogenetically coherent subsurface clade, which also contains a number of Geobacter species isolated from subsurface environments. Concatamers constructed with 43 Geobacter genes amplified from these sites also clustered within this subsurface clade. 16S rRNA transcript and gene sequences in the sediments and groundwater at the Rifle site were highly similar, suggesting that sampling groundwater via monitoring wells can recover the most active Geobacter species. These results suggest that further study of Geobacter species in the subsurface clade is necessary to accurately model the behavior of Geobacter species during subsurface bioremediation of metal and organic contaminants. © 2007 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.","Fe(III) reduction; Geobacter; Subsurface sediments; Uranium bioremediation","aromatic hydrocarbon; ferric ion; petroleum; RNA 16S; uranium; article; bioremediation; classification; DNA sequence; ecosystem; genetics; Geobacter; metabolism; molecular genetics; oxidation reduction reaction; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; Biodegradation, Environmental; Ecosystem; Ferric Compounds; Geobacter; Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Molecular Sequence Data; Oxidation-Reduction; Petroleum; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Uranium; Geobacter; Geobacter sp.; Geobacteraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36849085899

New insights are also provided into Holocene sea-level change in the Galway Bay region. Particular emphasis has been placed on the ostracod fauna, both past and present. Salinity and lake-level changes were reconstructed from the fossil ostracod assemblages, based on the known tolerances of individual species and on the assemblages as a whole. Additional evidence was provided by other proxies including strontium-isotope ratios derived from ostracod shells and other carbonates, plant macrofossil and pollen analyses, and sedimentological changes. The early Holocene (pre-Boreal, i.e. 11.5-10 ka) was characterised by low lake levels and slightly elevated salinity values, probably the result of high evapotranspiration and low precipitation rather than elevated sea levels. Early Holocene plant and animal migration to the island does not seem to have been impeded but relative sea levels were not necessarily so low (below -40 m a.s.l.) that landbridges were present to the mainland. Between ca 10 and 8.5 ka, relatively high lake levels prevailed. At 8.3 and 7.5 ka, minor fluctuations (lowering) of the lake level occurred that are assumed to relate to early Holocene abrupt events. Beginning at 7.05 ka, lake levels declined sharply. A general trend towards rising lake levels started at ca 6.4 ka and accelerated at ca 5.6 ka as runoff increased as a result of Neolithic clearances. At ca 4.8 ka, lake levels began to rise once again, probably in response to changes in rainfall and/or evapotranspiration and runoff. Lower lake levels during the first half of the 1st millennium AD were probably a response to decreased runoff as a result of a drier climate coupled with regeneration of woody vegetation.

This paper systematically approaches the process of establishing carbon (C) stocks for baseline (BSL) and mitigation scenario (MSL) for two case studies i.e., community and farm forestry projects in Uttaranchal, India. The analysis of various interventions shows that both projects present high carbon mitigation potential. However, the C reversibility risk is lower in long-rotation pine and mixed species plantation on community lands. The project is financially viable though not highly lucrative but the carbon mitigation potential in this 'restoration of degraded lands' type of project is immense provided challenges in the initial phase are adequately overcome. C revenue is an essential driver for investors in community projects. The short-rotation timber species such as Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus), Poplar (Populus) have high internal rates of return (IRR) and high carbon benefit reversibility potential due to fluctuations in market prices of commodities produced. The land holdings are small and bundling is desired for projects to achieve economies of scale. The methodological concerns such as sampling intensities, monitoring methodologies, sharing of benefits with communities and bundling arrangements for projects need further research to make these projects viable. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Additionality; Baseline; Carbon; Community forestry; Farm forestry; Financial feasibility; Mitigation","carbon sequestration; climate; environmental restoration; forestry; mitigation; mixed forest; price dynamics; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia; Uttaranchal; Eucalyptus; Populus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347403874

The plant occupies 4300 acres in Polk County, about 40 mi southeast of Tampa. One-fifth of the integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) project's $600 million capital cost was paid for by the DOE as part of its Clean Coal Technology Program. Now called Unit 1, the plant was commissioned and placed into commercial service in late 1996. The coal gasification portion of Unit 1 uses entrained-flow, oxygen-blown technology that was developed by Texaco and later purchased by General Electric Co. Power is generated by a 315-Mw 1 × 1 combined-cycle plant whose GE 7FA combustion turbine fires either the output of the gasifier or distillate oil. The turbine is rated at 192 Mw when firing the synthesis gas (syngas), with diluent nitrogen for NO x control. Complementing the 7FA are a 123-Mw GE D11 steam turbine-generator and a triple-pressure heat-recovery steam generator from Vogt Power International. The oxygen plant consumes 55 Mw, and other auxiliaries require 10 Mw, so the net power delivered to the grid is 250 Mw.

The promoting effect is more pronounced when the reductants are short-chain alkanes, such that the steady-state NOx conversion at low temperature follows the order: n-C8H18 &gt; n-C10H22 &gt; n-C12H26 &gt; GTL-fuel &gt; ultra-low sulphur diesel fuel. This reactivity pattern is almost the reverse of that observed in the absence of H2, where the initial activity is higher for the longer, more reactive alkanes. It has become clear that silver can initially achieve very high NOx conversion irrespective of the reductant speciation when H2 is present, but the beneficial effect can be negated (when diesel fuels are used as reductants) by deposition of carbon-rich surface species. By optimising the fuel injection strategy (i.e., the hydrocarbon:NOx ratio), the promoting effect can be made to dominate, even at relatively low concentrations of H2 (300-600 ppm), which could be produced in an exhaust gas by re-calibrating the engine. When diesel fuel is the reductant, we suggest that a key function of H2 is to enhance the formation of NO2, which is very effective at oxidising the carbon-rich species at low temperatures, so allowing the good initial activity to be maintained. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

HCl is electrochemically removed from the ocean and neutralized through reaction with silicate rocks. The increase in ocean alkalinity resulting from the removal of HCl causes atmospheric CO2 to dissolve into the ocean where it will be stored primarily as HCO3- without further acidifying the ocean. On timescales of hundreds of years or longer, some of the additional alkalinity will likely lead to precipitation or enhanced preservation of CaCO3, resulting in the permanent storage of the associated carbon, and the return of an equal amount of carbon to the atmosphere. Whereas the natural silicate weathering process is effected primarily by carbonic acid, the engineered process accelerates the weathering kinetics to industrial rates by replacing this weak acid with HCl. In the thermodynamic limit - and with the appropriate silicate rocks-the overall reaction is spontaneous. A range of efficiency scenarios indicates that the process should require 100-400 kJ of work per mol of CO2 captured and stored for relevant timescales. The process can be powered from stranded energy sources too remote to be useful for the direct needs of population centers. It may also be useful on a regional scale for protection of coral reefs from further ocean acidification. Application of this technology may involve neutralizing the alkaline solution that is coproduced with HCl with CO2 from a point source or from the atmosphere prior to being returned to the ocean. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Climate change; Electrochemistry; Hydrochloric acid; Precipitation (chemical); Population centers; Weathering reaction; Carbon dioxide; bicarbonate; calcium carbonate; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbonic acid; chloride; hydrochloric acid; silicate; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Electrochemistry; Hydrochloric acid; Precipitation (chemical); acceleration; acidification; air-sea interaction; atmospheric gas; carbon dioxide; chemical weathering; climate change; coral reef; electrochemical method; environmental protection; human activity; mitigation; point source pollution; pollution control; acidification; alkalinity; article; atmosphere; chemical reaction; climate change; coral reef; electrochemical analysis; energy resource; precipitation; sea; thermodynamics; weathering; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Electrochemistry; Feasibility Studies; Anthozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37249009187

Embedded in a broad precipitation maximum extending eastward from 70°E to the northwest tropical Pacific Ocean are strong local maxima to the west of the Western Ghats mountain range of India, in Cambodia extending into the eastern China Sea, and over the eastern tropical Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal (BoB), where the strongest large-scale global maximum in precipitation is located. In general, the maximum precipitation occurs over the oceans and not over the land regions. Distinct temporal variability also exists with time scales ranging from days to decades. Neither the spatial nor temporal variability of the monsoon can be explained simply as the response to the cross-equatorial pressure gradient force between the continental regions of Asia and the oceans of the Southern Hemisphere, as suggested in classical descriptions of the monsoon. Monthly (1979-2005) and daily (1997-present) rainfall estimates from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), 3-hourly (1998-present) rainfall estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) microwave imager (TMI) estimates of sea surface temperature (SST), reanalysis products, and satellite-determined outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data were used as the basis of a detailed diagnostic study to explore the physical basis of the spatial and temporal nature of monsoon precipitation. Propagation characteristics of the monsoon intraseasonal oscillations (MISOs) and biweekly signals from the South China Sea, coupled with local and regional effects of orography and land-atmosphere feedbacks are found to modulate and determine the locations of the mean precipitation patterns. Long-term variability is found to be associated with remote climate forcing from phenomena such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), but with an impact that changes interdecadally, producing incoherent responses of regional rainfall. A proportion of the interannual modulation of monsoon rainfall is found to be the direct result of the cumulative effect of rainfall variability on intraseasonal (25-80 day) time scales over the Indian Ocean. MISOs are shown to be the main modulator of weather events and encompass most synoptic activity. Composite analysis shows that the cyclonic system associated with the northward propagation of a MISO event from the equatorial Indian Ocean tends to drive moist air toward the Burma mountain range and, in so doing, enhances rainfall considerably in the northeast corner of the bay, explaining much of the observed summer maximum oriented parallel to the mountains. Similar interplay occurs to the west of the Ghats. While orography does not seem to play a defining role in MISO evolution in any part of the basin, it directly influences the cumulative MISO-associated rainfall, thus defining the observed mean seasonal pattern. This is an important conclusion since it suggests that in order for the climate models to reproduce the observed seasonal monsoon rainfall structure, MISO activity needs to be well simulated and sharp mountain ranges well represented. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Imaging systems; Wind; El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO); Monsoon intraseasonal oscillations; Orography; Outgoing longwave radiation; Precipitation (meteorology); climate forcing; monsoon; orography; precipitation (climatology); seasonal variation; Southern Hemisphere; temporal variation; Asia; Eurasia; India; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical); South Asia; South China Sea; Western Ghats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34648813594

The extended r min technique is utilized such that each incremental step size is determined not only by the yielding of an element Gaussian point, but also the change of the boundary condition along the tool-metal interface. The frictional force in the contact region between the sheet and the tools is computed by the application of Coulomb's friction law. Low-carbon (BA-DDQ) sheet plates were used throughout the experiments, which were later performed using a hemispherical punch head. Experimental tests were performed to demonstrate formulation of the theory and development of the computer code. The experimental load shows good agreement with the value of the punch load predicted by the finite-element method. When performing numerical calculation, the entire loading process history, the deformed geometry, the nodal velocity, and the distributions of strain and stress are also obtained by considering carefully the moving boundary condition.

We examined the effects of water and N amendments and forest thinning and burning on soil N pools and fluxes in ponderosa pine forests near Flagstaff, Arizona (USA). Using a 15N-depleted fertilizer, we also documented the distribution of added N into soil N pools. Because thinning and burning can increase soil water content and N availability, we hypothesized that these changes would alleviate water and N limitation of soil processes, causing smaller responses to added N and water in the restored stand. We found little support for this hypothesis. Responses of fine root biomass, potential net N mineralization, and the soil microbial N to water and N amendments were mostly unaffected by stand management. Most of the soil processes we examined were limited by N and water, and the increased N and soil water availability caused by forest restoration was insufficient to alleviate these limitations. For example, N addition caused a larger increase in potential net nitrification in the restored stand, and at a given level of soil N availability, N addition had a larger effect on soil microbial N in the restored stand. Possibly, forest restoration increased the availability of some other limiting resource, amplifying responses to added N and water. Tracer N recoveries in roots and in the forest floor were lower in the restored stand. Natural abundance δ15N of labile soil N pools were higher in the restored stand, consistent with a more open N cycle. We conclude that thinning and burning open up the N cycle, at least in the short term, and that these changes are amplified by enhanced precipitation and N additions. Our results suggest that thinning and burning in ponderosa pine forests will not increase their resistance to changes in soil N dynamics resulting from increased atmospheric N deposition or increased precipitation due to climatic change. Restoration plans should consider the potential impact on long-term forest productivity of greater Nlosses from a more open N cycle, especially during the period immediately after thinning and burning. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","δ15 N; Climatic change; Forest restoration; Microbial biomass; N isotope tracer; Nitrification; Nitrogen fertilization; Nitrogen mineralization; Precipitation","atmospheric deposition; burning; climate change; coniferous forest; fertilizer application; forest management; mineralization; nitrification; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen isotope; precipitation (climatology); restoration ecology; soil nitrogen; soil water; thinning; tracer; Arizona; Flagstaff; North America; United States; nitrite; nitrogen; water; article; chemistry; climate; ecosystem; fire; growth, development and aging; metabolism; ponderosa pine; precipitation; soil; time; United States; Arizona; Climate; Ecosystem; Fires; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Pinus ponderosa; Precipitation; Soil; Time Factors; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34848816031

High SO2 levels can be established in an efficient way by a process-integrated SO2 cycle, with only the SO2 generated by the combustion process being used. The S-recycling process can be supported by reducing the transfer rates of CaO particles to the flue gas by a low primary air supply. No additional source of sulfur is needed.

We measure or place upper limits on nebular fine-structure lines, molecular lines from warm H2, and various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features in order to probe the hardness of the stellar radiation field, the electron density of the nebulae, and the physical environment in which PAHs are being heated. The nebulae have similar excitations, corresponding to a midtype O star, and electron densities are low in most regions. PAHs were detected in all but two nebulae, and PAH emission relative to stars or Ha emission tends to be higher in galaxies with higher oxygen abundances. The population of PAHs appears to be different in Im galaxies than it is in spirals. We model emission from warm H2 in one nebula to obtain a temperature of 800-340+440 K, a neutral gas density ≥105 cm-3, and a far-UVradiation field of Go ≥ 1033. Variations in excitation across the nebulae are small, but the PAH 11.2 μm emission varies by factors of 3-4 across the maps. Differences in the local H i or H n environment of star-forming regions result in only mild differences in mid-IR ratios of nebular fine-structure line emission among Im galaxies.

The aim of this article is to present the costs and benefits of interventions to reduce indoor air pollution by halving the global population currently lacking access to (1) cleaner fuels (liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)) and (2) cleaner-burning and more efficient stoves. Results are presented for 11 world subregions. Annual costs and benefits of the two interventions are modelled from 2005 until 2015. Intervention costs include fuel, stove, and programme costs, from which monetary fuel cost savings are subtracted to estimate net costs. Economic benefits include less expenditure on health care, health-related productivity gains, fuel collection and cooking time savings, and environmental impacts. Globally, annual economic benefits of halving the population without access to LPG amount to (US) $91 billion at a net cost of $13 billion. The improved stove intervention generates $105 billion in economic benefits at a negative net cost of $34 billion. The resulting benefit-cost ratios (BCR) for both interventions are favourable. The BCR for LPG ranges from 1.5 to 21.2 in rural areas, and from 2.6 to negative in urban areas. The BCR for improved stoves is negative in all sub-regions, as fuel cost savings exceed intervention costs, thus giving net negative costs.

On the other hand, an extremely hot summer may reduce production because of heat stress during the flowering period in a post-global warming climate. Reliable impact projections are required to grasp the hazards of production variability. However, accuracy limitations of the General Circulation Model (GCM) products obstruct impact projections in a particularly extreme year. A new dynamic downscaling method is suggested by the current study, which contributes to estimating a higher-resolution climate from GCM products while reducing the GCM bias. The bias means the difference between the simulated value and observations, and is the most serious factor in decreasing the reliability of impact projections. This study aims to show the difference in (1) the region-scale climate change and (2) the influence on rice production between a cool summer year and a hot summer year after global warming. A Regional Climate Model (RCM) downscales the change in climate over Japan based on GCM products under the Special Report for Emission Scenario-A2 scenario. Simulated changes in daily maximum/minimum temperatures, daily total solar radiation and monthly total precipitation vary depending on the target month and the area. Crop model simulations show that climate changes reduce the damage caused by a cool summer throughout Japan. On the other hand, climate changes enhance the damage caused by heat stress in central to southwestern Japan, but the damage is not found in northern Japan even in a hot summer year. As the result of global warming, the damage to yield from a cool summer is mitigated; however, damage from heat stress is enlarged in a post-global warming climate. © 2007, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

The mother and nested domain cover the East Asian region at 60 km grid spacing and the Korean Peninsula at 20 km grid spacing, respectively. The mean climate state as well as the frequency and intensity of daily extreme events are investigated at various temporal and spatial scales, with a focus on surface air temperature and precipitation. Our analysis is primarily centered on the comparison of two 30-year climate periods between 2021-2050 and 2051-2080, in order to assess climatic changes at different time periods in response to anthropogenic forcings under the IPCC B2 emission scenario. Regarding the interdecadal variation of projected temperature and precipitation over the whole integration period, we find that the temperature change gradually increases by 3.2 K for the 2070s, with a persistently increasing trend. The projected precipitation in the future shows generally greater amounts than in the reference run despite significant interdecadal variation. A substantial increase (decrease) of hot (frost) spells is projected along with increasing of maximum and minimum temperature. Wet spells of long periods tend to be more frequent, accompanying the increase of precipitation amounts. The temperature changes are statistically significant at the 90% confidence level in all seasons and regions, indicating robustness of the projected change while the precipitation changes show low statistical confidence, especially summer season, due to the large natural variability. Based on the spatial distribution, although the general pattern between the mother and nested domain simulations shows similarity, more detailed structure over Korea is found in the nested domain simulation. By comparison of the change between 2021-2050 and 2051-2080 periods, the climate change signal of both temperature and precipitation becomes more pronounced in the late 21st century as the greenhouse gas concentration is increased. © 2007, Meteorological Society of Japan.",,"air temperature; climate change; climate forcing; climate modeling; decadal variation; extreme event; greenhouse gas; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; spatial distribution; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39849092263

In particular, we give evidence, by means of ab initio calculations, that by properly controlling the doping with either one or two atomic species, a significant modification of both the absorption and the emission of light can be achieved. We have considered impurities, either boron or phosphorous (doping) or both (codoping), located at different substitutional sites of silicon nanocrystals with size ranging from 1.1 to 1.8 nm in diameter. We have found that the codoped nanocrystals have the lowest impurity formation energies when the two impurities occupy nearest neighbor sites near the surface. In addition, such systems present band-edge states localized on the impurities, giving rise to a redshift of the absorption thresholds with respect to that of undoped nanocrystals. Our detailed theoretical analysis shows that the creation of an electron-hole pair due to light absorption determines a geometry distortion that, in turn, results in a Stokes shift between adsorption and emission spectra. In order to give a deeper insight into this effect, in one case we have calculated the absorption and emission spectra beyond the single-particle approach, showing the important role played by many-body effects. The entire set of results we have collected in this work give a strong indication that with the doping it is possible to tune the optical properties of silicon nanocrystals. © 2007 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547564818

The P. methanolica PEX5 (PmPEX5) gene contains a open reading frame corresponding to a gene product of 646 amino acid residues, and its deduced amino acid sequence shows a high similarity to those of Pex5ps from other methylotrophic yeasts. Like other Pex5ps, the PmPex5p possesses seven repeats of the TPR motif in the C-terminal region and three WXXXF/Y motifs. A strain with the disrupted PEX5 gene (pex5Δ) lost its ability to grow on peroxisome-inducible carbon sources, methanol and oleate, but grew normally on glucose and glycerol. Disruption of PmPEX5 caused a drastic decrease in peroxisomal enzyme activities and mislocalization of GFP-PTS1 and some peroxisomal methanol-metabolizing enzymes in the cytosol. Expression of the PmPEX5 gene was regulated by carbon sources, and it was strongly expressed by peroxisome-inducible carbon sources, especially methanol. Taken together, these findings show that PmPex5p has an essential physiological role in peroxisomal metabolism of P. methanolica, including methanol metabolism, and in peroxisomal localization and activation of methanol-metabolizing enzymes, e.g. AOD isozymes, DHAS and CTA.

Our synthesis involves fabrication of cubic-singony CdS core particles that are subsequently overcoated with a layer of ZnSe in the presence of surfactant-ligands in a noncoordinating solvent. Studies of different growth regime of the ZnSe shell indicate that one approach to obtaining high emission efficiencies is through alloying the CdS/ZnSe interface with CdSe, which leads to the formation of an intermediate ZnCdSe layer with a graded composition. We perform theoretical modeling of these core/shell nanocrystals using effective mass approximation and applying first-order perturbation theory for treating both direct electron-hole coupling and the core/shell interface-polarization effects. Using this model we determine the range of geometrical parameters of the core/shell structures that result in a type-ll localization regime. We further applied this model to evaluate the degree of electron-hole spatial separation (quantified in terms of the electron-hole overlap integral) based on measured emission wavelengths.

We implemented a manipulative experiment to test pasture management effects on several agroecosystem variables at a university research farm in southcentral Wisconsin. In concert, we established a mensurative experiment across eight grass-based farms in the same region where we measured the same variables under existing land uses. Here we describe how total and relative variation in greenhouse gas fluxes, ground cover, soil arthropods, and soil inorganic N were distributed across nested spatial scales, management treatments, and unexplained realms of these systems. This approach seeks to improve our understanding of pasture management effects on agroecosystem stocks and fluxes, while expanding our inferential space to a wider geographical area. Greenhouse gas fluxes (CH4 and N2O) were an order-of-magnitude more variable than soil N pools, ground cover, or arthropod abundances. Most of the variance in these fluxes was at the subsample level, indicating the need for either more sampling chambers per management treatment or an efficient stratification scheme or both. Methane was more variable farm-to-farm than among management treatments within farms, while N2O showed the opposite pattern indicating that farmers are likely to have more influence on N2O fluxes via management than they can have on CH4 fluxes. Variability in arthropod groups and ground cover was rather uniformly distributed across nested spatial scales, with the exception of beetles and harvestmen, which displayed little subsample variability. Soil inorganic N pools were more variable from farm-to-farm than among management treatments, but most variation was at the subsample level. The least variable response was from the greenhouse gas CO2, which is driven by both auto- and hetero-trophic organisms. Calculation of total and relativized coefficients of variation allowed for a standardized comparison of agroecosystem variables possessing disparate units of measure and facilitated conclusions about the generality of results across a broader geographical area than just a single farm. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The goal is to determine the geometric and kinetic conditions that may give rise to the presence of methane under Fe oxide and sulfate reducing conditions. The model includes FeS precipitation, calcite dissolution and precipitation, and an extended partial equilibrium description of the redox processes: Fe oxide reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis/methane oxidation, which takes the microbial energy requirements into account. The model indicates that a separation of redox processes within the pore space is possible, if the stagnant pores are deep and narrow and the rate of organic matter decomposition is fast. However, in most aquifers the organic matter reactivity will be so low that isolated lumps or actual layers of organic matter rather than particles or intragranular coatings of organic matter are required in order to produce methanogenic conditions; otherwise sulfate reduction will take place in the stagnant parts. In the model, the redox processes lead to localized secondary processes occurring at the grain scale; for example, the oxidation of organic matter in a microniche releases CO 2 which dissolves calcite, which is reprecipitated where the Fe oxides are being dissolved and reduced because of the locally increased pH.

The solid-state structures of the complexes were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The basic backbone of all of the complexes was a 16-electron [Rh I(H2bim)(CO)2]+ cation. The reaction conditions (reaction time, sacrificial metal surface) determined the counteranion.

These dinuclear systems, held together by weak metal-metal interactions between two [RhI(H2bim)(CO)2]+ units, were connected to each other via weak interactions between the metal and the π system of the H2bim ligand of the neighboring molecule, or via the π interactions between aromatic ligands. The anion was found to have an essential impact on the crystal packing and separation of the metal centers in the complexes.

CO2 frost in the RSPC is stabilized by its high albedo during southern spring and summer despite the relatively large insolation during that period. The morphology of the RSPC in summer displays a bewildering variety of depressions that are formed in relatively thin layers of CO2. The increase of the size of these depressions between each of the first three years of Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) observations may possibly signal some sort of climate change on the planet. For example, the erosion of the bright plateaus might reduce the RSPC albedo and affect the energy balance. The Mars Orbiter Cameras (MOC) on MGS observed Mars for four consecutive martian years before contact with the spacecraft was lost in late 2006. During this period coverage of the polar regions was particularly dense because MGS flew over them on every orbit. In this paper we report on the four-year behavior of the morphological features in the RSPC and on the large-scale variability in RSPC albedo over the period. The changes in the size of the surface features in the RSPC due to backwasting that were first observed between Mars years (MY) 24 and 25 and subsequently between MY25 and M26 was observed to continue at the same rate through MY 27. The results indicate that on average thicker layers in the RSPC retreat faster than thinner ones, roughly in proportion to their thickness. We argue that a simple difference in porosity between the A and B layers can explain this difference although other factors could be involved. The large-scale albedo of the RSPC decreases as the depressions are uncovered by sublimation of seasonal CO2. However, any interannual differences in albedo due to the backwasting process are masked by interannual differences in the summer dust opacity in the RSPC region. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We decompose the association into orthogonal components, corresponding to distinct spatial and temporal scales of variation. If the model fully controls for confounding, the exposure effect estimates should be equal at the different temporal and spatial scales. We show that the overall exposure effect estimate is a weighted average of the scale-specific exposure effect estimates. We use this approach to estimate the association between monthly averages of fine particles (PM2.5) over the preceding 12 months and monthly mortality rates in 113 US counties from 2000 to 2002. We decompose the association between PM2.5 and mortality into 2 components: (1) the association between ""national trends"" in PM2.5 and mortality; and (2) the association between ""local trends,"" defined as county-specific deviations from national trends. This second component provides evidence as to whether counties having steeper declines in PM2.5 also have steeper declines in mortality relative to their national trends. We find that the exposure effect estimates are different at these 2 spatiotemporal scales, which raises concerns about confounding bias. We believe that the association between trends in PM2.5 and mortality at the national scale is more likely to be confounded than is the association between trends in PM2.5 and mortality at the local scale. If the association at the national scale is set aside, there is little evidence of an association between 12-month exposure to PM2.5 and mortality. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",,"aged; air pollution; article; environmental exposure; female; health; human; male; model; mortality; particulate matter; priority journal; technique; United States; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Confounding Factors (Epidemiology); Environmental Exposure; Female; Geography; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Models, Theoretical; Mortality; Particle Size; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250780091

Enhanced heat flow, unique chemoautotrophic communities, occurrence of massive gas hydrates and large gas plumes are direct evidences of elevated methane concentrations and the dynamic environment of mud volcanoes. Related to the high concentrations and large inventories of CH4 in surface sediments only a fraction of the methane is exported to the bottom water. This is mainly due to chemoautotrophic communities oxidizing methane and proving a ""microbial filter"" reducing CH4 fluxes. Although these processes were studied for several mud volcanoes still little is known about the spatial pattern and the areas covered by chemoautotrophic communities or by present mud flows. For this purposes the Håkon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV), which is located at the continental slope of the Barents Sea, was studied by several dives with the Remotely Operated Vehicle Victor6000. During these dives a high resolution microbathymetric map, with a footprint of 25 × 25 cm and a vertical resolution of better than 10 cm was derived. Furthermore, video streams of the bottom camera were converted into georeferenced mosaics, providing a detailed image about the spatial distribution of seafloor features as bacterial mats, pogonophorans, both indicating methane oxidation, or mud flows. Based on visual inspection of 2310 georeferenced mosaics covering an area of 46,160 m2, different biogeochemical habitats were identified and quantified on a m2-basis. By application of geostatistic techniques as indicator kriging the distribution of different biogeochemical habitats was quantified and mapped for the entire HMMV. Considering the flat and hummocky area of HMMV, approximately 16% (115,165 m2) of the flat centre is nearly void of any benthic communities. This area is considered as a region of high methane discharge into bottom water. An area of 5% (38,244 m2), located in the south-eastern part, is densely inhabited by Beggiatoa. The hummocky outer part is colonised dominantly by pogonophoran tube worms (37.3%; 276,121 m2) and only occasional by Beggiatoa. Source locations and drainage directions for current mud flows were identified by computation of trend surfaces and consideration of temperature data. This suggests that present mud flow ascend close to the northern edge of the flat unit of HMMV, and that the drainage pattern of mud flows shifted from a westward to a south-south-eastern direction. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we explore how the relative risks (RRs) of mortality from air pollution exposure change over time and whether patterns in the RRs can be attributed to air quality improvements. We employed two-stage multilevel Cox models to describe the association between air pollution and mortality for 51 cities with data from the American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort (N = 264,299, deaths = 69,819). New pollution data were computed through models that predict yearly average fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations throughout the follow-up (1982-2000). Average PM2.5 concentrations from 1999 to 2000 and sulfate concentrations from 1980 were also examined. We estimated the RRs of mortality associated with air pollution separately for five time periods (1982-1986, 1987-1990, 1991-1994, 1995-1998, and 1999-2000). Mobility models were implemented with a sub-sample of 100,557 subjects to assist with interpreting the RR estimates. Sulfate RRs exhibit a large decline from the 1980s to the 1990s. In contrast, PM2.5 RRs follow the opposite pattern, with larger RRs later in the 1990s. The reduction in sulfate RR may have resulted from air quality improvements that occurred through the 1980s and 1990s in response to the acid rain control program. PM2.5 concentrations also declined in many places, but toxic mobile sources are now the largest contributors to PM in urban areas. This may account for the heightened RR of mortality associated with PM2.5 in the 1990s. The paper concludes with a three alternative explanations for the temporal pattern of RRs, each emphasizing the uncertainty in ascribing health benefits to air quality improvements. © Springer-Verlag 2007.","Air pollution; Fine particulate matter; Health benefits assessment; Multilevel Cox regression model; Risk assessment","air quality; atmospheric pollution; mortality risk; numerical model; particulate matter; regression analysis; risk assessment; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347396027

The results showed that with slope gradient increasing (from 10° to 30°), the changing trend of soil erosion intensity (A) was A 20°&gt;A 30°&gt;A 15°&gt;A 10°&gt;A 25°, suggesting that slope gradient between 20° and 25° was a critical degree ranger to exist. Soil organic carbon loss was mainly influenced by soil erosion intensity, appearing the same trend as did soil erosion intensity with increasing slope gradient. Soil erosion results in organic carbon enrichment in sediment. Average enrichment ratios of five runoff plots varied from 2.27 to 3.74, and decreased with increasing erosion intensity and slope gradient. The decrease of surface runoff and soil erosion is the key to reduce soil organic carbon loss. © 2007 Wuhan University.","Carbon cycle; Slope gradient; Soil erosion; Soil organic carbon loss",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547655675

To study microbial communities and their roles in carbon cycling, a 4.9-m sediment core was collected from the Qiongdongnan Basin on the continental slope of the South China Sea during our cruise HY4-2005-5 in 2005. Geochemical, mineralogical, and molecular phylogenetic analyses were carried out. Sulfate concentration in pore water decreased with depth. Abundant authigenic carbonates and pyrite were observed in the sediments. The bacterial community was dominated by aerobic and facultative organisms. Bacterial clone sequences belonged to the Gamma-, Alpha-, Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes group, and they were related to Fe(III) and/or Mn(IV) reducers, sulfate reducers, aromatic hydrocarbon degraders, thiosulfate/sulfite oxidizers, and denitrifiers. Archaeal clone sequences exhibited greater overall diversity than the bacterial clones with most sequences related to Deep-Sea Archaeal Group (DSAG), Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group (MCG), and Uncultured Euryarchaeotic Clusters (UECs). Archaeal sequences related to Methanosarcinales, South African Gold Mine Euryarchaeotic Group (SAGMEG), Marine Benthic Group-D (MBG-D) were also present.

In this study, we test whether 18 species-specific variables, related to the climate envelope, ecological envelope and life history, could predict recent population trends (over 17 years) of 71 common breeding bird species in France. Habitat specialists were declining at a much higher rate than generalists, a sign that habitat quality is decreasing globally. The lower the thermal maximum (temperature at the hot edge of the climate envelope), the more negative are the population trends and the less tolerant these species are climate warming, regardless of the thermal range over which these species occur. The life history trait 'the number of broods per year' was positively related to recent trends, suggesting that single-brooded species might be more sensitive to advances in food peak due to climate change, as it increases the risk of mistiming their single-breeding event. Annual fecundity explained long-term declines, as it is a good proxy for most other demographic rates, with shorter-lived species being more sensitive to global change: individuals of species with higher fecundity might have too short a life to learn to adapt to directional changes in their environment. Finally, there was evidence that natal dispersal was a predictor of recent trends, with species with high natal dispersal experiencing smaller population declines than species with low natal dispersal. This is expected if the higher the natal dispersal, the larger the ability to shift spatially when facing changes in local habitat or climate, in order to track optimal conditions and adapt to global change. Identifying decline-promoting factors allow us to infer mechanisms responsible for observed declines in wild bird populations facing global change, and by doing so allow for a more pre-emptive approach to conservation planning. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Annual fecundity; Broad-scale monitoring; Brood number; Climate warming; Habitat specialist; Natal dispersal; Population trend; Thermal maximum","bird; environmental degradation; fecundity; global change; global warming; habitat quality; life history trait; resilience; specialist; Eurasia; Europe; France; Western Europe; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547762774

In order to test this new method for stone consolidation, non-sterilized decayed porous limestone was immersed in sterile nutritional media. Results were compared to those of the runs in which stone sterilized prior to the treatment was used. The effects of the microbial community on stone consolidation were determined by recording the evolution of the culture media chemistry. The treated stone was tested for mechanical resistance and porosity. Results demonstrate that the tested media were able to activate bacteria from the microbial community of the stone. As a consequence of the growth of these bacteria, an alkalinization occurred that resulted in calcium carbonate precipitation. The new precipitate was compatible with the substrate and consolidated the stone without pore plugging. Therefore, a good candidate to in situ consolidate decayed porous limestone is the application of a sterile culture medium with the characteristics specified in the present study. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Between 2005 and 2010, the United Kingdom is conducting a demonstration program, costing ∼40 million (∼$80 million at the time of writing), to evaluate technologies to remove these compounds from wastewater. However, while such advanced treatment techniques will undoubtedly reduce the discharges of micropollutants, they will also inevitably result in large financial costs, as well as environmentally undesirable increases in energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Here we calculate the price of treating urban sewage with two of the major options specifically proposed in the U.K. demonstration program: (i) granular activated carbon and ozone and (ii) membrane filtration and reverse osmosis. Economic analysis indicates that treating wastewater with these advanced technologies may be economically and environmentally undesirable due to the increased energy consumption and associated economic costs and CO2 emissions. Since the costs of advanced treatment of sewage would most likely have to be passed on to customers (both domestic and industrial), we propose that national demonstration programs should not only compare and contrast the most advanced treatment methods but also consider alternative techniques, such as increased sludge ages and hydraulic retention times in conjunction with nutrient removal stages and the varying redox conditions associated with them, which potentially may be almost as effective but with much lower environmental and financial costs. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Discharge (fluid mechanics); Ecosystems; Filtration; Health; Membranes; Nutrients; Ozone; Sewage; Advanced treatment techniques; Hydraulic retention; Organic micropollutants; Wastewater treatment; activated carbon; carbon dioxide; endocrine disruptor; ozone; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Ecosystems; Filtration; Health; Membranes; Nutrients; Ozone; Sewage; Wastewater treatment; adsorption; cost-benefit analysis; endocrine disruptor; filtration; health risk; organic pollutant; osmosis; pollutant removal; sewage treatment; urban drainage; wastewater; article; economic aspect; energy consumption; environmental factor; evaluation; exhaust gas; financial management; hydraulic conductivity; membrane filter; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; reverse osmosis; risk assessment; United Kingdom; waste component removal; waste water management; Organic Chemicals; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547181337

METHODS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducts the School Health Policies and Programs Study every 6 years. In 2006, computer-assisted telephone interviews or self-administered mail questionnaires were completed by state education agency personnel in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia and among a nationally representative sample of school districts (n = 461). Computer-assisted personal interviews were conducted with personnel in a nationally representative sample of elementary, middle, and high schools (n = 1025). RESULTS: Most districts had adopted a policy on the inspection and maintenance of school facilities and equipment, and most schools had inspected and provided appropriate maintenance for each type of school facility and equipment during the 12 months preceding the study. Nearly all districts and schools had a comprehensive crisis preparedness, response, and recovery plan. Nearly all districts and schools prohibited tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drug use; fighting; weapons use; and weapon possession; but when students broke rules related to those behaviors, punitive measures were taken more often than provision of supportive services. Most schools did not reschedule outdoor activities to avoid times when the sun was at peak intensity, nor did they encourage the use of sunscreen before going outside. CONCLUSIONS: To provide students with a truly healthy and safe school environment in which learning can take place, more schools need to promote a positive school climate and reduce violence, injuries, and the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other substances. States and districts need to continue to provide policy and technical assistance in support of school efforts. © 2007, American School Health Association.","Injury prevention; School policy; Schools; Substance use; Surveys","addiction; adolescent; article; child; environmental planning; health care policy; health care quality; human; injury; policy; public health service; questionnaire; safety; school; United States; Adolescent; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Child; Environment Design; Health Policy; Humans; Organizational Policy; Program Evaluation; Questionnaires; Safety; Schools; Substance-Related Disorders; United States; Wounds and Injuries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34848828278

We explored the reasons for this pattern by examining the relationship between seed size and CO2 response in Picea abies and P. rubens using growth analysis. The large seeded species (P. abies) responded more positively to elevated CO2 than the small seeded species (P. rubens). At the intraspecific level, P. abies individuals from large seeds responded more positively to elevated CO2 than individuals from small seeds, however, there was no significant intraspecific variation in CO 2 response in P. rubens. The greater CO2 response of plants from large seeds was not simply the result of a larger starting capital compounded at the same rate as in plants from small seeds. Elevated CO 2 increased relative growth rate to a greater extent in individuals from large seeds. This effect appears to be related to differences in time of establishment, source to sink ratio and nutrient availability with seed size. These results are significant not only in understanding the potential effect of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations on plant populations, but also in understanding the factors affecting plant success at current atmospheric CO2 levels due to the elevation of CO2 within the litter layer that occurs at many germination sites. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.","Elevated CO2; Functional group; Growth analysis; Nitrogen availability; Seed size; Source:sink ratio","carbon dioxide; nitrogen; atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; coniferous tree; functional group; growth rate; growth response; nitrogen; nutrient availability; plant community; seed size; seedling; article; comparative study; drug effect; growth, development and aging; histology; metabolism; plant seed; prenatal development; seedling; species difference; spruce; Carbon Dioxide; Nitrogen; Picea; Seedling; Seeds; Species Specificity; Abies; Picea; Picea abies; Picea rubens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36749066578

Methods and Results: The GR* was chemically synthesized by oxidation of the GR and was incubated with Shewanella putrefaciens cells at a defined [Fe III]/[cell] ratio. Sodium methanoate served as the sole electron donor. The GR* was quickly transformed in GR (iron reducing rate = 8.7 mmol l-1 h-1). Conclusions: Ferric green rust is available for S. putrefaciens respiration as an electron acceptor. The reversibility of the GR redox state can be driven by bacterial activity. Significance and Impact of the Study: This work suggests that GRs would act as an electronic balance in presence of bacteria. It provides also new perspectives for using iron reducing bacterial activity to regenerate the reactive form of GR during soil or water decontamination processes. © 2007 The Authors.","Biomineralization; Green rust; Iron reduction; Shewanella","iron; Bacteria; Biomineralization; Iron oxides; Oxidation; Soils; Synthesis (chemical); bacterium; biomineralization; iron-reducing bacterium; microbial activity; rust disease; article; bacterial cell; microbial activity; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidation reduction state; Shewanella putrefaciens; water contamination; Ferric Compounds; Minerals; Oxidation-Reduction; Shewanella putrefaciens; Bacteria (microorganisms); Shewanella; Shewanella putrefaciens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35448958903

We assess how well intensity targets, where each country's permit allocation is indexed to its future realized GDP, can cope with uncertainties in international greenhouse emissions trading. We present some empirical foundations for intensity targets and derive a simple rule for the optimal degree of indexation to GDP. Using an 18-region simulation model of a cooperative, global cap-and-trade treaty in 2020 under multiple uncertainties and endogenous commitments, we show that optimal intensity targets could reduce the cost of uncertainty and achieve significant increases in global abatement. The optimal degree of indexation to GDP would vary greatly between countries, including super-indexation in some advanced countries, and partial indexation for most developing countries. Standard intensity targets (with one-to-one indexation) would also improve the overall outcome, but to a lesser degree and not in all individual cases. Although target indexation is no magic wand for a future global climate treaty, gains from reduced cost uncertainty and the potential for more stringent environmental commitments could justify the increased complexity and other potential downsides of intensity targets. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Climate policy; Emissions trading; Intensity targets; Optimality; Simulation modelling; Uncertainty","Computer simulation; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; International cooperation; International trade; Public policy; Climate policy; Emissions trading; Intensity targets; Greenhouse gases; abatement cost; emissions trading; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; international agreement; simulation; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548162867

However, the water-table-dependent feedback from soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition to the climate system is less clear. At least three greenhouse gases are produced: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases show emission peaks at different water table positions and have different global warming potentials (GWP), for example a factor of 23 for CH4 and 296 for N2O as compared with the equivalent mass of CO2 on a 100-year time horizon. This review of available annual data on all three gases revealed that the radiative forcing effect of SOM decomposition is principally dictated by CO2 despite its low GWP. Anaerobic SOM decomposition generally has a lower potential feedback to the climatic system than aerobic SOM decomposition. Concrete values are constrained by a lack of data from tropical and subarctic regions. Furthermore, data on N2O and on plant effects are generally rare. However, there is a clear latitudinal differentiation for the GWP of soils under anaerobic conditions compared with aerobic conditions when looking at CO2 and CH4: in the tropical and temperate regions, the anaerobic GWP showed a range of 25-60% of the aerobic value, but values varied between 80% and 110% in the boreal zone. Hence, particularly in the vulnerable boreal zone, the feedback from ecosystems to climate change will highly depend on plant responses to changing water tables at elevated temperatures. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change feedbacks; GHG; Peat land; Soil carbon decomposition; Water saturation","carbon dioxide; climate change; decomposition; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; peatland; soil carbon; soil organic matter; water table",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36348935594

Therefore, an insight into energy consumption and quantification of emissions from urban areas are extremely important for identifying impacts and finding solution to air pollution in urban centers. This paper applies the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) system for modeling the total energy consumption and associated emissions from the household sector of Delhi. Energy consumption under different sets of policy and technology options are analyzed for a time span of 2001-2021 and emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrous oxide (N2O), total suspended particulates (TSP) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are estimated. Different scenarios are generated to examine the level of pollution reduction achievable by application of various options. The business as usual (BAU) scenario is developed considering the time series trends of energy use in Delhi households. The fuel substitution (FS) scenario analyzes policies having potential to impact fuel switching and their implications towards reducing emissions. The energy conservation (EC) scenario focuses on efficiency improvement technologies and policies for energy-intensity reduction. An integrated (INT) scenario is also generated to assess the cumulative impact of the two alternate scenarios on energy consumption and direct emissions from household sectors of Delhi. Maximum reduction in energy consumption in households of Delhi is observed in the EC scenario, whereas, the FS scenario seems to be a viable option if the emission loadings are to be reduced. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Global climate change is an archetypal shared challenge for humanity, and although the threat has inspired a substantial amount of international co-operation, efforts to moderate it have already proven divisive. These divisions go beyond economically-driven haggling over who must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by what amount. Attempts to mitigate human civilisation's effects on the climate raise questions of political principle. Moreover, these questions have the specific potential to mobilise certain states and quasi-states against certain other ones, and this has implications for the field of security studies. Thus, climate change threatens to revive ideological dispute among armed, organised economically-developed societies. Although the idea of a world war over carbon remains far-fetched, the parallels with the international politics of the mid-20th oentury are disturbing. Policymakers would be wise to take the political questions of climate change more seriously than they appear to have done in the past. Scholars may note that disputes over global warming challenge influential models of contemporary global politics. This paper explores the reasons why controversies over climate policy are likely to prove particularly divisive in international politics. The first section discusses the relative ideological consensus that has prevailed among developed societies since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even pessimistic theorists initially took this consensus for granted. As of 2005, however, this consensus is stretched thin on numerous issues. One of these issues is climate policy. A second section of this paper discusses the stakes in the climate debate, suggesting that this dispute is likely to be a particularly important one. The third section notes that attempts to limit global carbon dioxide emissions raise questions about citizens' relationships to each other and to the state. Historically, such questions have raised issues of principle. These issues have had moral and emotional implications that run far beyond the material issues involved. Many nations, notably the US, have resolved these issues by adopting the political system known as republicanism. A fourth section discusses the concept of a republic and the problems it presents for those who wish to develop an international policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The fifth section notes that a broad, if informal, movement in early 21st century politics directly challenges republicanism. Debates over climate policy have already served to deepen this division. A conclusion sums up the paper's findings and reflects on their implications. Future work in the field of security studies will need to address the potential friction between republican and anti-republican political entities, and this paper highlights one of the forms this friction may take.",,"Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International cooperation; Public policy; Social aspects; Climate policy; Ideological conflict; Climate change; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; environmental policy; global change; greenhouse gas; ideology; policy implementation; political discourse; twentieth century; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41949120469

Mine operators usually try to supply maximum ventilation air based on the capacity of the system and the predicted need underground. This approach is neither economical nor safer as ventilation capacity may decrease in time depending on various mining and coalbed parameters. Thus, it is important to develop better engineered approaches to optimize mine ventilation effectiveness and, therefore, to ensure a safer work environment. This study presents an approach using coalbed methane reservoir modeling and an artificial neural network (ANN) design for prediction and optimization of methane inflows and ventilation air requirements to maintain methane concentrations below statutory limits. A coalbed reservoir model of a three-entry development section, which is typical of Pittsburgh Coalbed mines in the Southwestern Pennsylvania section of Northern Appalachian Basin, was developed taking into account the presence and absence of shielding boreholes around the entries against methane inflow. In the model, grids were dynamically controlled to simulate the advance of mining for parametric simulations. Development and application of artificial neural networks as an optimization tool for ventilation requirements are introduced.

Since ventilation alone may not be sufficient to control the methane levels in the longwall mining environment, gob gas ventholes have become a standard supplementary methane control option in many mines. As mines progress into deeper and gassier coalbeds, or as longwall panel size increases, ventilation and gob gas ventholes together may not be sufficient to maintain methane levels within statutory limits. To decrease the risk associated with methane emissions under these circumstances, in-seam horizontal methane drainage is often used to reduce the gas content of the coalbed prior to mining. Horizontal methane drainage borehole completion designs, drilling strategies, and degasification lead times may need to be adjusted for site-specific conditions due to mine design, geology, and the gas content of the coalbed. This study investigates different horizontal methane drainage borehole patterns, borehole lengths, and degasification times prior to and during panel extraction to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing methane emissions using a ""dynamic"" 3D reservoir modeling of a 381-m wide longwall panel operating in the Pittsburgh coalbed. Results of this study showed that dual and tri-lateral boreholes are more effective in decreasing emissions and in shielding the entries compared to fewer shorter, cross-panel, horizontal boreholes parallel to the longwall face. Modeling results showed that after 12 months of pre-mining methane drainage, the average longwall face emission rates can be reduced by as much as 10.3 m3/min and 6.8 m3/min using tri- and dual-lateral boreholes, respectively. It was also shown that if pre-mining methane drainage time is short, it is important to continue methane drainage during the panel extraction to maximize reductions in longwall face emissions since additional face emission reductions achieved during this period can be comparable to pre-mining degasification.","In-seam horizontal boreholes; Longwall mining; Methane drainage; Reservoir simulation","In-seam horizontal boreholes; Methane drainage; Boreholes; Drainage; Gas emissions; Longwall mining; Mathematical models; Methane; Mine ventilation; Three dimensional; Coal mines; borehole; coal mine; coal seam; coalbed methane; longwall mining; numerical model; ventilation; North America; Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547725856

Additional data (30′ measurements of benzene exposure through active sampling to employees dealing with different activities, meteorological and traffic data) were collected. The measurements campaign was performed in both summer and wintertime to determine the seasonal variation of the exposure pattern. In addition, a set of artificial neural networks (ANNs) was developed to predict benzene exposure pattern for the filling station employees based on active sampling data and the parameters related to the employees' exposure. The quantification of the contribution of each parameter to the overall exposure pattern was also attempted. The results showed that although vapour recovery technologies are installed in the refuelling systems and benzene emissions are significantly reduced compared to the past, filling station employees are still highly exposed to benzene (52-15 μg m-3). Benzene exposure is strongly correlated to car refuelling (exposure levels up to 85 μg m-3), while activities like car washing or working in cash machine inside an office contribute to lower exposure levels (up to 44 and 24 μg m-3 respectively). In rural filling station, exposure levels were in general lower compared to the urban ones, due to the smaller amount of gasoline that was traded and the absence of any significant traffic effect or urban background concentration. The developed ANN seemed to be a promising technique in the prediction of the exposure pattern giving very good results, and the quantification of the parameters affirmed the importance of the refueling procedure to the exposure levels. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Single-photon emission computed tomography showed reductions in CBF and CVR to acetazolamide in the right hemisphere. Real-time NIRS monitoring clearly showed a deterioration in the cerebral oxygenation state in the right hemisphere in response to a BP decrease during HD. Superficial temporal artery-MCA anastomosis improved SPECT as well as NIRS findings and resolved ischemic attacks during HD.

We determined that the β-galactosidase activity was due to BgaA, a surface protein in S. pneumoniae, and that the expression of bgaA was regulated. Transcription analyses demonstrated expression of bgaA in the constitutive β-galactosidase (BgaAC) mutant, but not in the parent. β-Galactosidase expression was induced in the parent under specific growth conditions; however, the levels did not reach those of the BgaAC mutant. We localized the mutation resulting in the BgaAC phenotype to a region upstream of bgaA and in the promoter of a phosphoenolpyruvate- dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) operon. The mutation was in a catabolite-responsive element (cre) and affected the binding of CcpA (catabolite control protein A), a key regulator of many carbon metabolism genes. The pts operon and bgaA were cotranscribed, and their transcription was regulated by CcpA. Deletion of ccpA altered β-galactosidase activity, leading to a sevenfold increase in the parent but a fivefold decrease in the BgaAC mutant. The resulting β-galactosidase activities were the same in the two strains, suggesting the presence of a second repressor. The presence of glucose in the growth medium resulted in pts-bgaA repression by both CcpA and the second repressor, with the latter being important in responding to the glucose concentration. Expression of β-galactosidase is important for S. pneumoniae adherence during colonization of the nasopharynx, a site normally devoid of glucose. CcpA and environmental glucose concentrations thus appear to play important roles in the regulation of a niche-specific virulence factor. Copyright © 2007, American Society for Microbiology.

When climate is warm in the North Atlantic region, the Intertropical Convergence Zone has a relatively northward position, and moisture is exported from the tropical Atlantic to the tropical Pacific. At the same time the east Asian summer monsoon is strong, which helps maintain a positive balance of precipitation over evaporation in the subpolar North Pacific. This is thought to account for lower salinity in the North Pacific relative to the North Atlantic, which, in turn, drives northward flow through the Bering Strait to the northern North Atlantic. Freshening in the North Atlantic by water of Pacific origin suppresses the meridional overturning circulation and reduces the heat flux. The opposite situation exists during cold climate.

Progressive release of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as CO2 and CH4 from development of various energy-intensive industries has ultimately caused human civilization to pay its debt. Realizing the urgency of reducing emissions and yet simultaneously catering to needs of industries, researches and scientists conclude that renewable energy is the perfect candidate to fulfill both parties requirement. Renewable energy provides an effective option for the provision of energy services from the technical point of view. In this context, biomass appears as one important renewable source of energy. Biomass has been a major source of energy in the world until before industrialization when fossil fuels become dominant and researches have proven from time to time its viability for large-scale production. Although there has been some successful industrial-scale production of renewable energy from biomass, generally this industry still faces a lot of challenges including the availability of economically viable technology, sophisticated and sustainable natural resources management, and proper market strategies under competitive energy markets. Amidst these challenges, the development and implementation of suitable policies by the local policy-makers is still the single and most important factor that can determine a successful utilization of renewable energy in a particular country. Ultimately, the race to the end line must begin with the proof of biomass ability to sustain in a long run as a sustainable and reliable source of renewable energy. Thus, the aim of this paper is to present the potential availability of oil palm biomass that can be converted to hydrogen (leading candidate positioned as the energy of the millennium) through gasification reaction in supercritical water, as a source of renewable energy to policy-makers. Oil palm topped the ranking as number 1 fruit crops in terms of production for the year 2007 with 36.90 million tonnes produced or 35.90% of the total edible oil in the world. Its potentiality is further enhanced by the fact that oil constitutes only about 10% of the palm production, while the rest 90% is biomass. With a world oil palm biomass production annually of about 184.6 million tons, the maximum theoretical yield of hydrogen potentially produced by oil palm biomass via this method is 2.16×1010 kg H2 year-1 with an energy content of 2.59 EJ year-1, meeting almost 50% of the current worldwide hydrogen demand. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We use the energy-systems optimization model MESSAGE to construct several climate change mitigation scenarios with various levels of regional participation in short-to-mid term. By comparing these with a global scenario that assumes full spatial and temporal flexibility throughout the century, we are able to evaluate how participatory decisions affect the mitigation response as well as the costs and technology choices. We find that short-term postponement of participation from some regions can often lead to a delay of mitigation measures on the global level. However, if the regional delay lasts until mid-century, participants of the regime are likely to increase their efforts in the short term. Mitigation costs are found to substantially increase as a result of delayed participation-the extent of the increase depends on the relative importance of the region that postpones its participation, the stringency of the climate target and the ability to reorganize mitigation measures. Our analysis also shows that a region's decision to delay its participation in an international climate regime can lead to accumulated inertia in its energy system and thus to a delayed 'technological transition' toward a low-carbon future. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This paper compares current available emission factor estimates for PM10 and PM2.5 from emission databases and different emission models, and validates these against eight high quality street pollution measurements in Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Finland and Austria. The data sets show large variation of the PM concentration and emission factors with season and with location. Consistently at all roads the PM10 and PM2.5 emission factors are lower in the summer month than the rest of the year. For example, PM10 emission factors are in average 5-45% lower during the month 6-10 compared to the annual average. The range of observed total emission factors (including non-exhaust emissions) for the different sites during summer conditions are 80-130 mg km-1 for PM10, 30-60 mg km-1 for PM2.5 and 20-50 mg km-1 for the exhaust emissions. We present two different strategies regarding modelling of PM emissions: (1) For Nordic conditions with strong seasonal variations due to studded tyres and the use of sand/salt as anti-skid treatment a time varying emission model is needed. An empirical model accounting for these Nordic conditions was previously developed in Sweden. (2) For other roads with a less pronounced seasonal variation (e.g. in Denmark, Germany, Austria) methods using a constant emission factor maybe appropriate. Two models are presented here. Further, we apply the different emission models to data sets outside the original countries. For example, we apply the ""Swedish"" model for two streets without studded tyre usage and the ""German"" model for Nordic data sets. The ""Swedish"" empirical model performs best for streets with studded tyre use, but was not able to improve the correlation versus measurements in comparison to using constant emission factors for the Danish side. The ""German"" method performed well for the streets without clear seasonal variation and reproduces the summer conditions for streets with pronounced seasonal variation. However, the seasonal variation of PM emission factors can be important even for countries not using studded tyres, e.g. in areas with cold weather and snow events using sand and de-icing materials. Here a constant emission factor probably will under-estimate the 90-percentiles and therefore a time varying emission model need to be used or developed for such areas. All emission factor models consistently indicate that a large part (about 50-85% depending on the location) of the total PM10 emissions originates from non-exhaust emissions. This implies that reduction measures for the exhaust part of the vehicle emissions will only have a limited effect on ambient PM10 levels. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Experiments with a steady state bubbling fluidized bed combustion boiler at a thermal input scale of 1 MWth were carried out. The effect of different operating parameters (fluidization velocity, bed temperature, etc.) and air-staging (secondary air injection) on gaseous emissions (CO and NO) has been studied. The intention is to increase the use of this type of boiler especially for greenhouse heating, making use of the available residues. One of the unique features of this boiler is a moveable internal heat exchanger, which makes it possible to run it at variable thermal outputs. Experimental data was further analyzed and compared with the simulation results carried out with the fluidized bed model especially developed for solid fuel feedings. The model takes into account devolatilization, fragmentation, and attrition of the solid phase together with heterogeneous and homogenous reactions. A particle size distribution model is also included to calculate the elutriation losses of fine char particles.

In order to answer this question, the author shed light on some of the conditions in Northeast Asia that would be necessary for regional cooperation to take place, by examining the factors that shape the environmental foreign policy of sovereign states. The success of Europe's regional cooperation in dealing with acid rain has been investigated, through the lens of interest-based and epistemic community approaches. The interest-based approach provides two factors - ecological vulnerability and economic cost - to show why some countries have taken more active positions than others. In addition, the author argues that one more factor is necessary, the existence of an epistemic community, out of the knowledge-based community perspective, because even self-interested states have difficulties in defining their interests due to high uncertainty and complexity about developing goals and preferences. After applying the two perspectives to the cooperation of Northeast Asian countries, it is found that lack of domestic and regional consensus on ecological vulnerability to transboundary acid deposition and the high economic costs of reducing emission have contributed to slow development of the cooperation of Northeast Asia. In addition, the lack of solid expert communities in Japan, as a leading country, could hinder Northeast Asian countries from speeding up the transition toward regulatory regime formation from the current information sharing cooperation. © Oxford University Press and the Japan Association of International Relations 2007, all rights reserved.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34648825678

SKYEM was developed for consulting user convenience on a basis of emission inventory methodologies developed in the USA, Europe, Australia, and Korea. The inventory was obtained from mobile and area sources resolved to census tract levels (Dong or village levels). SKYEM was used to provide an annual emission inventory for major volatile organic compounds, BTXS (benzene, toluene, xylene, and styrene), PCE, phenol, and MEK, from 13 sources in multimedia (air, water, and soil) for 151 villages in northeastern Seoul.

BTXS were also measured at 10 sites located in the target area. Toluene presented the highest concentration (77%) with Xylene ranked second (15%). The similarity between concentration and emission may be explained by a model which describes scientific phenomena in or inter media.

We worked with a community in Eastern Panama to determine the average above- and below-ground C stocks of three land-use types in their territory: managed forest, agroforests and pasture. We examined evidence for a functional relationship between tree-species diversity and C storage in each land-use type, and also explored how the use of particular tree species by community members could affect C storage. We found that managed forests in this landscape stored an average of 335 Mg C ha-1, traditional agroforests an average of 145 Mg C ha-1, and pastures an average of 46 Mg C ha-1 including all vegetation-based C stocks and soil C to 40 cm depth. We did not detect a relationship between diversity and C storage; however, the relative contributions of species to C storage per hectare in forests and agroforests were highly skewed and often were not proportional to species' relative abundances. We conclude that protecting forests from conversion to pasture would have the greatest positive impact on C stocks, even though the forests are managed by community members for timber and non-timber forest products. However, because several of the tree species that contribute the most to C storage in forests were identified by community members as preferred timber species, we suggest that species-level management will be important to avoiding C-impoverishment through selective logging in these forests. Our data also indicate that expanding agroforests into areas currently under pasture could sequester significant amounts of carbon while providing biodiversity and livelihood benefits that the most common reforestation systems in the region - monoculture teak plantations - do not provide. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We estimated chronosequential changes in the communities' carbon stocks, and established the relationship between the fallow period and fallow-period-average carbon stocks in three carbon pools of bamboo-dominated communities in hilly areas of the Luang Prabang Province, northern Lao People's Democratic Republic. Based on measurements by destructive sampling, we devised a model and root-to-shoot ratios for estimating bamboo biomass. In six secondary plant communities established after slash-and-burn cropping, we estimated community biomass using the above model and others, and measured deadwood and litter stocks. The communities' biomass and deadwood significantly increased with time after the last cropping and the former reached about 100 Mg ha-1 after 15 years, whereas litter stocks did not show significant trends over time. Extending the fallow period from 2 to 5 years would increase fallow-period-average carbon stock from 14.2 to 25.1 Mg C ha-1. The overstory height was significantly correlated with biomass, deadwood, and litter carbon stocks of these communities. Based on our findings, changes in a community's carbon stocks can be estimated using the changes in overstory height, which should be taken into account in future studies to reduce uncertainty in estimating carbon stocks in tropical ecosystems. © 2007 The Japanese Forest Society and Springer.","Belowground biomass; Deadwood; Litter; Overstory height; Root-to-shoot ratio","Bamboo; Biodiversity; Biomass; Crops; Ecosystems; Belowground biomass; Deadwood; Tropical ecosystems; Forestry; Bamboo; Biomass; Dead Wood; Ecosystems; Pachymorpha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34648826772

The results are discussed with respect to age structure of the current production plants, CO2 emissions, natural gas dependency and CO2 capture and storage (CCS) under stringent CO2 emission constraints. The analysis of the information from the power plant database, which includes planned projects, shows large variations in power plant infrastructure between the MS and a clear shift to natural gas-fuelled power plants during the last decade. The data indicates that this shift may continue in the short-term up to 2010 since the majority of planned plants are natural gas fired. The gas plants are, however, geographically concentrated to southern and northwest Europe. The data also shows large activities in the upstream gas sector to accommodate the ongoing shift to gas with pipelines, liquefaction plants and regasification terminals being built and gas fields being prepared for production. At the same time, utilities are integrating upwards in the fuel chain in order to secure supply while oil and gas companies are moving downwards the fuel chain to secure access to markets. However, it is not yet possible to state whether the ongoing shift to natural gas will continue in the medium term, i.e. after 2010, since this will depend on a number of factors as specified below. Recently there have also been announcements for construction of a number of new coal plants. The results of the simulations for the German and British power sector show that combination of a relatively low growth rate in power generation, ambitious national plans on renewables together with a strong expansion in the use of natural gas can meet national reduction targets in CO2 emissions. However, for both countries this will result in a strong dependency on natural gas. Successful application of CO2 capture will reduce this dependency, since this would allow for a significant amount of coal-based generation, which will contribute to security of supply. © 2007.","CO2 storage; Power plants; Security of supply","Computer simulation; Database systems; Energy efficiency; Gas fuels; Natural gas pipelines; Energy infrastructure database; Power plant database; Power plant inrastructure; Security of supply; Petroleum industry; computer simulation; database; natural gas; power generation; power plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34147134519

We investigated patterns of treatment failure in patients treated to a PET-defined radiotherapy target and evaluated the effect of standardized uptake value (SUV) on recurrence after radiotherapy. Methods and Materials: Thirty-five patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who underwent PET/CT simulation for definitive radiotherapy were included. The PET/CT scans were obtained with patients in the treatment position with custom immobilization for use in radiation treatment planning. Nine to 11 regions of interest (ROIs) were identified for each patient, including the primary tumor and regional nodes. Maximum SUV, volume, and mean dose received were recorded for each ROI, and follow-up scans were used to evaluate for recurrence in each ROI. Results: We identified 353 ROIs from 35 patients; 5.7% of patients developed isolated out-of-field recurrences. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to divide ROIs into low, intermediate, and high risk by using volume and SUV. All low-risk ROIs with volumes less than 1.2 cm3 were recurrence free compared with 73% of intermediate-risk ROIs (volume ≥1.2 cm3; SUV ≤13.8) and 29% of high-risk ROIs (SUV &gt; 13.8). Conclusion: Limiting the target volume to predominantly PET-positive disease resulted in a low rate of isolated out-of-field recurrences. The SUV and volume were predictors of recurrence. Recursive partitioning analysis identified SUVs greater than 13.8 as the best identifier of ROIs at the greatest risk of recurrence; control rates for this subgroup did not show a dose-response relationship within the range of doses administered. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, they have facilitated a stakeholder-driven climate change mitigation project in one Pennsylvania county and started an ongoing service-learning project aimed at reducing emissions in another county. These campus and community outreach initiatives demonstrate that university-based mitigation action may simultaneously achieve tangible local benefits and develop solutions to broader challenges facing local climate change mitigation efforts.

The aim of this paper is first to analyse specific institutional networks involved in climate change predominantly at the national level in South Africa and second to determine how different stakeholders perceive their role vis-a-vis climate change adaptation. Within the South African context there is a gap in understanding and evaluating how institutional networks operate and thus the findings of this work may help inform and strengthen such relationships in the future. Results showed that few institutions fully understand the implications of adaptation and their roles and responsibilities have not yet been properly defined. Constraints relating to capacity, lack of awareness and poor information flow need to be addressed. Climate change is perceived as an important issue although problems such as poverty reduction and job creation remain national priorities. Most importantly this research has demonstrated how adaptation challenges the hierarchical manner in which government works and a more collaborative approach to climate change adaptation is needed.

Therefore, three fen sites differing in water balance and plant community, as well as one dry meadow site, were used to study the importance of soil temperature, water table, and plant biomass as controlling factors for net methane emission in the Eastern Alps, Europe, during a period of 24 months. Average methane emissions during snow-free periods in the fen ranged between 19 and 116 mg CH4 m-2 d-1. Mean wintertime emissions were much lower and accounted for 18 to 59% of annual flux. The alpine dry meadow functions as a methane sink during snow-free periods, with mean flux of -2.1 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 (2003) and -1.0 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 (2004). Seasonal methane emissions of the fen were related to soil temperature and groundwater table. During the snow-free periods the water table was the main control for seasonal methane emission. The net methane flux related to water table was much higher for the distinctly drier year 2003 than for the wetter year 2004. Methane emissions differed diurnally at sites where the water table position was high or very low. The influence of total above-ground plant biomass on methane emission was apparent only for those sites with high water table positions.

Here the resulting effects of the freshwater balance of the Arctic Ocean in the 21st century are analyzed using coupled Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change simulations with the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology climate model. For the Arctic region, particularly strong warming and an almost complete removal of sea ice during summer time are predicted. Arctic river runoff and net atmospheric freshwater input (P-E) are strongly enhanced. Most of this additional freshwater input is stored in the Arctic Ocean. While the total freshwater export out of the Arctic remains almost constant, significant changes occur in its distribution. The dominance of sea ice for the Fram Strait export disappears, while the liquid freshwater export is enhanced. The mean export shows therefore almost no changes, but its interannual variability is slightly reduced. In contrast, both the export through the Canadian Archipelago and its variability are increased in the 21st century. Therefore the importance of the Canadian Archipelago for the total Arctic export grows. Enhanced freshwater input into the Labrador Sea leads to a strong decrease in deep convection. Greenland Sea convection is reduced as well but mainly because of strong warming of the upper ocean layers. The meridional overturning circulation responds with a decline of about 6 sverdrups.

The emitter will then get credit for a share equal to the carbon it has been responsible for. Carbon offset projects can help meet the challenge of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 60-80% below current global levels if the world were to limit global temperature rise to less than 2.0°C above pre-industrial levels: a threshold beyond which catastrophic effects on a global scale become much more likely. Carbon offset projects fall into four categories: renewable energy projects; reducing emissions projects; energy efficiency projects; and greenhouse gas capture projects. As more such projects are implemented in poor countries, it is claimed that offset projects can be an effective tool tolower carbon emissions and at the same time alleviate poverty by spurring development in poor countries. Offset projects can have multiple additional benefits: environmental restoration, infrastructure development, education and training and provision of energy services to the poor.

A life cycle inventory and environmental impact assessment is used to document and analyze the similarities and differences in the environmental impacts of the fabrication, transportation, installation, operation, maintenance, and disposal of all three roof systems. This is important because there are additional resources committed to green roofs from which environmentally relevant benefits, such as reduced electrical energy use for building cooling, are derived. The extensive green roof design for the case study presented here is from an actual 1115 m2 (12,000 ft2) green roof project on a retail store in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. The case study includes a conventional ballasted roof, an extensive, or shallow growing medium green roof, and an intensive, or deep growing medium green roof. For the life cycle inventory and the material use, both the types of material used and the transportation distances to the site are with respect to this project. The study found that, for the Pittsburgh, PA climate, the energy use reduction that is realized because of the lower thermal conductivity of the roof due to the green roof growing medium is the critical factor in determining the relative magnitude of the environmental impact of the alternatives compared here.

The methodology adopted to determine the circulation patterns is based on combined analysis of the spatial and temporal variation of rotated principal components of sea-level pressure. A catalogue of characteristic seasonal composites is presented and discussed. It is found that, during winter and spring, large scale features situated in northern Europe affect the atmospheric circulation over the domain of study, whereas the Atlantic (Azores) anticyclone and the Asian Thermal Low define most of the observed circulation types in summer. In autumn, the area exhibits a rapid transition from the warm to cold season showing climatic features from both extreme seasons. Similarities between winter and spring/autumn patterns are detected and correlation analyses are employed between their spatial patterns to reveal that similar circulation patterns occur amongst the three seasons, which usually appear more pronounced during winter. Frequencies and trends of the proposed circulation types are examined for each season. A linear trend analysis for the overall period (1958-2000) exhibits a significant increase in the anticyclonic types particularly in winter. With respect to the cyclonic types, statistically significant negative trends have been found in all seasons especially for types associated with depressional activity in central the Mediterranean.

Plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) has been developed as a fast and efficient surface modification technique of complex shaped three-dimensional objects. The PIII process relies on the acceleration of ions across a high-voltage plasma sheath that develops around the target. Recent studies have shown that the sheath dynamics is significantly affected by an external magnetic field. In this work we describe a two-dimensional computer simulation of magnetic field enhanced plasma immersion implantation system. Negative bias voltage is applied to a cylindrical target located on the axis of a grounded cylindrical vacuum chamber filled with uniform nitrogen plasma. An axial magnetic field is created by a solenoid installed inside the cylindrical target. The computer code employs the Monte Carlo method for collision of electrons and neutrals in the plasma and a particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm for simulating the movement of charged particles in the electromagnetic field. Secondary electron emission from the target subjected to ion bombardment is also included. It is found that a high-density plasma region is formed around the cylindrical target due to the intense background gas ionization by the magnetized electrons drifting in the crossed ExB fields.

Using agricultural land use data and village population data we formulate three prototype villages, each representing about one-third of the rural population. The two configurations of the controlled combustion are an outdated municipal waste incinerator (MWI) and a modern waste-to-energy (WTE) plant equipped with modern air pollution control devices. These configurations actually exist(ed) in Bratislava, Slovakia at the same site, but in different time frames. The CALPUFF model provides direct exposure data and the EMERAM software (developed in this paper) computes indirect exposure. A major source of uncertainty is that of the fraction of waste burned in the open. The analysis presented here assumed 10%. At this level, the cancer risk from open burning ranges from 10 to 80 times the commonly regarded de minimus value of one in a million. This means that under the U.S. contemporary regulatory culture, some regulatory action to control or enforce the burning ban would be expected.

Expression from PMOX is induced by methanol and is partially derepressed in glycerol or xylose medium, whereas in the presence of hexoses, disaccharides or ethanol, it is repressed. The need for methanol for maximal induction of gene expression in large-scale fermentation is a significant drawback, as this compound is toxic, flammable, supports a slow growth rate and requires extensive aeration. We isolated H. polymorpha mutants deficient in glucose repression of P MOX due to an impaired HpGCR1 gene, and other yet unidentified secondary mutations. The mutants exhibited pronounced defects in PMOX regulation only by hexoses and xylose, but not by disaccharides or ethanol. With one of these mutant strains as hosts, we developed a modified two-carbon source mode expression platform that utilizes convenient sugar substrates for growth (sucrose) and induction of recombinant protein expression (glucose or xylose). We demonstrate efficient regulatabie by sugar carbon sources expression of three recombinant proteins: a secreted glucose oxidase from the fungus Aspergillus niger, a secreted mini pro-insulin, and an intracellular hepatitis B virus surface antigen in these mutant hosts. The modified expression platform preserves the favorable regulatabie nature of PMOX without methanol, making a convenient alternative to the traditional system. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Alcohol oxidase gene promoter; Catabolite repression; Hansenula polymorpha; Heterologous proteins; Yeast","Alcohol oxidase gene promoter; Catabolite repression; Hansenula polymorpha; Heterologous proteins; Ethanol; Fermentation; Gene encoding; Growth kinetics; Mutagenesis; Toxic materials; Yeast; Proteins; alcohol; disaccharide; glucose; glucose oxidase; hepatitis B surface antigen; hexose; methanol; oxidoreductase; proinsulin; xylose; article; Aspergillus niger; carbon source; catabolite repression; controlled study; enzyme regulation; fungal gene; fungal strain; fungus growth; fungus mutant; gene mutation; Hansenula polymorpha; nonhuman; protein expression; protein induction; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Disaccharides; Ethanol; Glucose; Mutation; Pichia; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Recombinant Proteins; Aspergillus niger; Fungi; Hepatitis B virus; Pichia angusta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447327221

To this end, it is important to reduce the energy demands of non-domestic buildings. Naturally ventilated buildings can have low energy demands but the strategy is difficult to implement in deep plan, urban locations. The Frederick Lanchester Library at Coventry University, UK, incorporates natural ventilation, daylighting and passive cooling strategies. By using lightwells and perimeter stacks to supply and exhaust air, it can be ventilated by natural means despite its deep plan form and sealed façade. This paper describes the building and presents the energy consumption and the internal temperatures and CO2 levels recorded in 2004/2005. The building's performance is compared to the original design criteria and good practice guidelines. Recommendations for the design of such buildings are made and the likely performance in other UK cities is assessed. It is concluded that the building uses under half the energy of a standard air-conditioned building and yet, in summer, can keep the interior comfortable and up to 5 °C below ambient. The design would perform equally well in the typical weather conditions experienced at 13 other UK cities, but not in London. It is concluded that deep-plan, naturally ventilated buildings with sealed facades, if well designed, could maintain thermal comfort in all but a very few UK locations, whilst consuming much less energy than even good practice standards. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In the minerotrophic fen, the rates of methane production measured throughout the profile did not change significantly with depth and comprised 3-6 ng CH4-C g-1 h-1. In ombrotrophic peat bogs, the rate did not exceed 5 ng CH4-C g -1 h-1 in the upper layer of the profile (up to 1.5 m) and increased to 15-30 ng CH4-C g-1 h-1 in the deep layers of the peat deposits. The distribution of fermentative microorganisms and methanogens in the profiles of peat deposits was uniform in all the studied bogs. In bog water samples, the presence of butyrate (up to 14.1 mg 1-1) and acetate (up to 2.4 mg 1-1) was revealed throughout the whole profile; in the upper 0.5-m layer of the ombrotrophic bogs, formate (up to 8.9 mg 1-1) and propionate (up to 0.3 mg 1 -1) were detected as well. The arrangement of local maxima of the fatty acid content and methanogenic activity in the peat deposits, as well as the decrease in the acetate concentrations during summer, support the hypothesis that the initial substrates for methanogenesis come from the upper peat layers. It was established that the addition of sulfate and nitrate inhibits methane production in peat samples; the changes in the concentrations, recorded in situ, may also influence the methane content in peat layers. © 2007 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Methanogenesis; Peat bogs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36849019512

The main target is to reduce global CO2 emissions to around 10 Gt/a in 2050, thus limiting global average temperature increase to 2 °C and preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. A 10-region energy system model is used for simulating global energy supply strategies. A review of sector and region-specific energy efficiency measures resulted in the specification of a global energy demand scenario incorporating strong energy efficiency measures. The corresponding supply scenario has been developed in an iterative process in close cooperation with stakeholders and regional counterparts from academia, NGOs and the renewable energy industry. The 2 °C scenario shows that renewable energy could provide as much as half of the world's energy needs by 2050.

However, most work has been restricted to solanaceous species and the potential use of MP expression to improve biomass and yield parameters has not been addressed in detail. Here we demonstrate that MP-mediated modification of PD function can substantially alter assimilate allocation, biomass production, and reproductive growth in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). These effects were achieved by constitutive expression of the potato leaf roll virus 17-kD MP (MP17) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in different Arabidopsis ecotypes. The resulting transgenic plants were analyzed for PD localization of the MP17:GFP fusion protein and different lines with low to high expression levels were selected for further analysis. Low-level accumulation of MP17 resulted in enhanced sucrose efflux from source leaves and a considerably increased vegetative biomass production. In contrast, high MP17 levels impaired sucrose export, resulting in source leaf-specific carbohydrate accumulation and a strongly reduced vegetative growth. Surprisingly, later during development the MP17-mediated inhibition of resource allocation was reversed, and final seed yield increased in average up to 30% in different transgenic lines as compared to wild-type plants. This resulted in a strongly improved harvest index. The release of the assimilate export block was paralleled by a reduced PD binding of MP17 in senescing leaves, indicating major structural changes of PD during leaf senescence. © 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Biomass; Carbohydrates; Proteins; Resource allocation; Silver; Sugar (sucrose); Yield stress; Carbon partitioning; Green fluorescent proteins; Leaf senescence; Plasmodesmata (PD); Transgenic plants; Viruses; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Potato leafroll virus; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36248959315

Cell suspension cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana were grown in MS medium containing unlabelled glucose (with 13C at natural abundance), 100% [1-13C]glucose, 100% [U-13C6]glucose or 10% [U-13C6]glucose plus 90% unlabelled glucose. There was no significant difference in the metabolism of [U-14C]glucose between the cultures. Similarly, the pattern of 14CO2 release from specifically labelled [14C]-substrates was unaffected. Principal component analysis of 13C-decoupled 1H NMR metabolite fingerprints of cell extracts was unable to discriminate between the different culture conditions. It is concluded that 13C-enrichment of the growth substrate has no effect on flux through the central pathways of carbon metabolism in higher plants.

On the global scale, disasters are becoming both more frequent and more destructive, annually causing material losses worth tens of billions of Euros, as well as several thousand fatalities. Furthermore, catastrophic weather events have been the subject of a rapid upward trend, with the value of material damage increasing by an order of magnitude over the last four decades, in inflation-adjusted monetary units. There is now an increasing body of evidence of ongoing planetary climate change (global warming), which has brought about considerable changes where extreme hydro-meteorological events are concerned, and is likely to lead to even more marked changes in the future. Typically, changes in extremes are more pronounced and exert more impact than changes in mean values. Among the extremes on the rise are the number of hot days and tropical nights; the duration and intensity of heatwaves; precipitation intensity (and resulting floods, landslides and mudflows); the frequency, length and severity of droughts; glacier and snow melt; tropical cyclone intensity and sea level and storm surges. In turn, a ubiquitous decrease in cold extremes (number of cool days and nights, and frost days) is projected. Increases in climate extremes associated with climate change are likely to cause physical damage and population displacement, as well as having adverse effects on food production and the availability and quality of fresh water. A discussion of hydro-meteorological extremes and their impacts is therefore provided here in relation to a range of scales, and with the context for adaptation and mitigation also being alluded to.","Climate change; Climate change impacts; Climate variability; Extreme events; Hydrometeorology","catastrophic event; climate change; climate variation; drought; heat flux; hydrometeorology; natural disaster; precipitation intensity; trend analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52649115915

The data were analyzed in terms of the two National Weather Service (NWS) criteria for a high-wind watch or warning: sustained winds of at least 18 m s-1 for at least 1 hr or a wind gust of at least 26 m s-1 for any duration. The results indicate a pronounced southwest quadrant directional preference for nonconvective high winds in this region. Between 70% and 76% of all occurrences that satisfied the NWS criteria for NCWEs were associated with wind directions from 180° through 270°. Within the southwest quadrant, the west-southwest direction is preferred, with 14%-35% of all NCWEs coming from this particular compass heading. This directional preference is borne out in five out of six stations with high occurrences of cold-season NCWEs (Buffalo, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Lansing, Michigan; Moline, Illinois; Springfield, Illinois). Given the geographic spread of these stations, a nontopographic cause for the directional preference of cold-season NCWEs is indicated. The connection between NCWEs and low pressure systems found in this climatology and in case studies suggests that midlatitude cyclone dynamics may be a possible cause of the directional preference. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric turbulence; Data reduction; Lakes; Statistics; Storms; Wind; Cyclone dynamics; Nonconvective wind event; Climatology; atmospheric dynamics; cyclone; low pressure system; midlatitude environment; wind direction; Great Lakes [North America]; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349165902

A significant positive correlation was observed between the two methods and the continuous ozone monitors set in three instrumental co-locations. Moreover, results from this air quality network showed that, within a natural pathway of mass airflow, altitude and climate induced variations in plant responsiveness to ozone. Three different ozone diurnal patterns could thus be clearly identified. Biological sensing to determine ozone levels in regional-scale air quality assessment proved to be accurate at low altitudes.

The transcriptional regulation of CBR1 has been largely unexplored. Therefore, we first investigated the promoter activities of progressive gene-reporter constructs encompassing up to 2.4 kilobases upstream of the translation start site of CBR1. Next, we investigated whether CBR1 mRNA levels were altered in cells incubated with prototypical receptor activators (e.g., dexamethasone and rifampicin). CBR1 mRNA levels were significantly induced (5-fold) by the ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) β-naphthoflavone. DNA sequence analysis revealed two xenobiotic response elements (-122XRE and -5783XRE) with potential regulatory functions. CBR1 promoter constructs lacking the -122XRE showed diminished (9-fold) promoter activity in AHR-proficient cells incubated with β-naphthoflavone. Fusion of -5783XRE to the -2485CBR1 reporter construct enhanced its promoter activity after incubations with β-naphthoflavone by 5-fold. Furthermore, we tested whether the potent AHR ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (TCDD) induced Cbr1 expression in Ahr+/- and Ahr -/- mice. TCDD induced hepatic Cbr1 mRNA (TCDD, 2-fold) and Cbr1 protein levels (TCDD, 2-fold) in Ahr+/- mice compared with vehicle-injected controls. In contrast, no significant Cbr1 mRNA and Cbr1 protein induction was detected in livers from Ahr-/- mice treated with TCDD. These studies provide the first insights on the functional characteristics of the human CBR1 gene promoter. Our data indicate that the AHR pathway contributes to the transcriptional regulation of CBR1.

In addition to advancing food security by eliminating hunger and malnutrition, soil resources must be managed regarding numerous other global needs through interdisciplinary collaborations. Some of which are to mitigate global warming; to improve quantity and quality of freshwater resources; to enhance biodiversity; to minimize desertification; serve as a repository of waste; an archive of human and planetary history; meet growing energy demands; develop strategies of sustainable management of urban ecosystems; alleviate poverty of agricultural communities as an engine of economic development; and fulfill aspirations of rapidly urbanizing and industrializing societies. In addition to food and ecosystem services, bio-industries (e.g., plastics, solvents, paints, adhesives, pharmaceuticals and chemicals) through plant-based compounds (carbohydrates, proteins, and oils) and energy plantations (bioethanol and biodiesel) can revolutionize agriculture. These diverse and complex demands on soil resources necessitate a shift in strategic thinking and conceptualizing sustainable management of soil resources in agroecosystems to provide all ecosystem services while also meeting the needs for food, feed, fiber, and fuel by developing multifunctional production systems. There is a strong need to broaden the scope of soil science to effectively address ever changing societal needs. To do this, soil scientists must rally with allied sciences including hydrology, climatology, geology, ecology, biology, physical sciences (chemistry, physics), and engineering. Use of nanotechnology, biotechnology, and information technology can play an important role in addressing emerging global issues. Pursuit of sustainability, being a moral/ethical and political challenge, must be addressed in cooperation with economists and political scientists. Soil scientists must work in cooperation with industrial ecologists and urban planners toward sustainable development and management of soils in urban and industrial ecosystems. More than half of the worlds population (3.3 billion) live in towns and cities, and the number of urban dwellers is expected to increase to 5 billion by 2030. Thus, the study of urban soils for industrial use, human habitation, recreation, infrastructure forestry, and urban agriculture is a high priority. Soil scientists must nurture symbiotic/synergistic relations with numerous stake holders including land managers, energy companies and carbon traders, urban planners, waste disposal organizations, and conservators of natural resources. Trading of C credits in a trillion-dollar market by 2020 must be made accessible to land managers, especially the resource-poor farmers in developing countries. Soil science curricula, at undergraduate and graduate levels, must be revisited to provide the needed background in all basic and applied sciences with focus on globalization. We must raise the profile of soil science profession and position students in the competitive world of ever flattening Earth. © Soil Science Society of America.

A potential way to derive large-scale estimates of N 2O emission is the use of process-based models, such as PnET-N-DNDC or Wetland-DNDC. While PnET-N-DNDC has been effectively applied for various upland forest ecosystems, the Wetland-DNDC model has not yet been validated with regard to N2O emission. We calibrated and validated the Wetland-DNDC model on the basis of a 4-year field data set of two water-logged soils (Humic Gleysol and Histic Gleysol) of a spruce forest ecosystem. Model calibration by means of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm considerably improved the model performance for the period of calibration (2001-2002). The error variance was reduced by up to a factor of two and the modelling efficiency was increased from -1.24 to -0.15 (Humic Gleysol) and from -0.42 to 0.1 (Histic Gleysol).

A first generation of fuels and chemicals is being produced from high-value sugars and oils. Meanwhile, a second generation, based on cheaper and more abundant lignocellulosic feedstock, is being developed. This review addresses the variety of chemistries and technologies that are being explored to valorize lignocellulosic biomass. It shows the need to 'deoxygenate' the biomass and reviews the main chemical routes for it, i.e. • the pyrolysis to char, bio-crude or gas; • the gasification to syngas and its subsequent conversion, e.g. to alkanes or methanol; • the hydrolysis to sugar and their subsequent upgrading to oxygenated intermediates via chemical or fermentation routes. The economics of biomass conversion also needs to be considered: the current production cost of biofuels are typically $60-120/barrel of oil equivalent. Influential factors include the cost of the biomass at the plant gate, the conversion efficiency, the scale of the process and the value of the product (e.g. fuel, electricity or chemicals). © 2007 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Biofuels; Biomass; Biorefineries; Economics; Fermentation; Gasification; Hydrolysis; Lignocellulose; Pyrolysis; Sugar","Barrel of oil equivalents; Biomass conversion; Biorefineries; Chemical routes; Current production; Energy supplies; Influential factors; Lignocellulose; Lignocellulosic biomass; Lignocellulosic feedstocks; Local biomass; Rural economy; Second generation; Syn-gas; Bioconversion; Biofuels; Cellulose; Conversion efficiency; Cracking (chemical); Economics; Fermentation; Gas generators; Gasification; Hydrolysis; Lignin; Methanol; Paraffins; Sugar (sucrose); Biomass",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148939054

In order to examine the effects of airborne emissions, the water quality of 35 small lakes and brooks in Finland, Norway and Russia, 1-50 km from the smelters, was surveyed, and fish of stony shores of these lakes and brooks were sampled by electrofishing in 2004 or 2005. The results demonstrated that in the study area the airborne emissions of the smelters have not caused any widespread damage to fish populations even in the most sensitive small waters. The small waters close to the smelters (roughly within a 10 km radius) are well buffered against the effects of high sulphate deposition. Extremely high concentrations of the heavy metals Ni and Cu, however, are a local threat to biota in small waters there, and a few lakes that have apparently lost their fish populations were found. In the border area of Russia, Norway and Finland, acidification is currently only a problem in some very small and sensitive waters located in the local highland areas, 15-50 km from the smelters. There, lakes with a low buffering capacity (alkalinity &lt; 0.05 mmol 1-1) can be found and some fish populations, mainly minnows, have probably been lost. The SO2 emissions from the smelters have declined to approximately one third of the maximum level in the late 1970s, and this can be seen in a general recovery of the buffering capacity of small lakes such as those in the Finnish border region, 40-50 km west of the smelters.",,"Cyprinidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548316064

The GROWEST model was designed to integrate the major climatic determinants of potential plant growth at broad geographic scales, and GROWEST PLUS allows comparisons of current conditions relative to historical variability. Substantive literature demonstrates the robustness, simplicity and application of GROWEST at regional to national scales. This has led the Bureau of Rural Sciences (BRS) to use this tool as one of a suite of analyses and models in the assessment of Exceptional Circumstances drought applications. The advantage of GROWEST is its simplicity. The model synthesises well established biological responses to seasonal trends in climate. It has the advantage of few dimensions, which significantly reduces computational and processing time. GROWEST performs well with the SGS Pasture Model outputs. In fact, GROWEST's performance is encouraging given the level of simplicity in the model. GROWEST, however, trades off some processes that are important at detailed scales in order to be able to run with readily available input variables for regional scale assessments. Unaccounted processes include detailed simulation of soil moisture, soil fertility and differences between phenological responses at the plant species level. GROWEST PLUS was developed by BRS and the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies at the Australian National University. The most significant feature of GROWEST PLUS is its ability to analyse variability in seasonal growth over time using time-series outputs from the GROWEST model. For this purpose, the GROWEST model was comprehensively upgraded to run on weekly and monthly climate data, in point or grid form, to produce weekly and monthly outputs. This will have benefit in the analyses of specific events such as drought or the characterisation of growing season reliability for natural resource management. This paper demonstrates how users can easily and intuitively run the upgraded GROWEST model through the GROWEST PLUS graphical user interface, utilising 'real time' climate data, in point or grid form, to undertake a range of spatial and temporal analyses. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

All organisms were enumerated from the plankton samples and converted to organic carbon biomass using length-carbon relationships, then aggregated into 19 major taxa. Planktonic copepods dominate the carbon biomass in both SC (59%) and CC (46%), followed by euphausiids (18% and 25% of mean biomass in SC and CC, respectively). Pelagic tunicates, especially salps and doliolids, constituted a higher fraction of the biomass in CC (13%) than in SC (5%). There was no long-term trend detectable in total zooplankton carbon biomass, in marked contrast to a decline in zooplankton displacement volume in both regions. The difference between these biomass metrics is accounted for by a long-term decline in pelagic tunicates (particularly salps), which have a relatively high ratio of biovolume:carbon. The decline in pelagic tunicates was accompanied by a long-term increase in water column density stratification. No other taxa showed a decline over the duration of the study, apart from salps and pyrosomes in SC and doliolids in CC. Some zooplankton taxa showed compensatory increases over the same time period (ostracods, large decapods, and calycophoran siphonophores in both SC and CC; appendicularians and polychaetes in SC). Two tests for ecosystem shifts, a sequential algorithm and the cumulative sum of anomalies (CuSum) approach, failed to detect changes in 1976-1977 in total carbon biomass, displacement volume, or most individual major taxa, suggesting that aggregated biomass is an insensitive indicator of climate forcing. In contrast, both techniques revealed a cluster of step-like changes associated with the La Niña of 1999. The major El Niño's in the past half century have consistently depressed total zooplankton biomass and biomass of many major taxa in both SC and CC, although such effects are transitory. Much, but not all, of the interannual variability in zooplankton is shared between the Southern and Central California sectors of the California Current System. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Since few years, downsizing (reduction of the engine displacement) appears as a major way to achieve those requirements for spark ignition engines. Efficient performance and drivability can be then achieved with a direct injection downsized engine with turbocharging and Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT). One of the major issues of the torque-oriented control is in-cylinder mass observation and control. To have an efficient torque response, the in-cylinder trapped mass, adjusted by the throttle and the waste gate, must be controlled with accuracy according to performance and drivability requirements. Depending on admission and exhaust pressures, the twin VCT will allow to control in-cylinder burned gases rate to reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, and air scavenging to improve transient speed response. Another major issue is in-cylinder trapped mass and air scavenging predictionfor AFR control. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to achieve those engine control issues. The first challenge is to design accurate observers for non-measurable variables (in-cylinder burned gases and trapped air mass). The method is based on a complex high frequency OD engine model, which has been validated on a large range of engine operating points and transient operations based on test bed results. Then, this model permits to design and learn open-loop nonlinear static observers of in-cylinder masses (based on neural network). The static and dynamic behavior of high frequency OD engine model allows to achieve design of dynamic and closed-loop in-cylinder mass observation and prediction, multivariable and non-linear control of air path according to in-cylinder mass trajectory (trapped air mass & recirculated gases rate). Then, the complete engine control can be developed and validated on simulation and on a real time Software-In-the-Loop platform based on high frequency OD engine model, before a complete validation and calibration on test bed. Finally, the complete torque-oriented engine control has been integrated on vehicle. From OD engine model, a complete vehicle model has been set on real-time platform in order to validate engine control integration and design vehicle layout. The major issue is then supervision of engine control set points (torque, AFR, efficiency) according to engine states (start, idle, driver request, cut-off) and warm-up strategies.

In this study, SCCI combustion and emissions characteristics were investigated in a single-cylinder gasoline engine with a direct-injection system. From the experimental results, we elucidated the effects of air - fuel ratio, intake temperature, and injection timing including early and late injection on the attainable SCCI combustion region. Injection timing during the intake process was found to be an important parameter that affects the extension of the SM operating region. The effects of stratified mixture formation can be utilized to extend the operating range for suitable SCCI combustion under different engine speeds and compression ratio conditions. In this study, we found that the higher intake temperature is very effective to evaporate the injected fuel, and this effect helps to enhance SCCI combustion. The intake temperature can be controlled by the compression ratio. Finally, the injection timing and stratified mixture formation played an important role in achieving stable combustion and extending the operating range. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Fuel economy; Fuel injection; Ignition; Temperature; Single-cylinder gasoline engine; Stratified charge compression ignition; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547783159

Ellingson et al. have developed the multispectral algorithm that largely improved the accuracy of the narrowband-estimated OLR as well as eliminated the problems in AVHRR. NOAA has been generating High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) OLR operationally since September 1998. In recognition of the need for a continuous and long OLR data record that would be consistent with the earth radiation budget broadband measurements in the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) era, and to provide a climate data record for global change studies, a vigorous reprocessing of the HIRS radiance for OLR derivation is necessary. This paper describes the development of the new HIRS OLR climate dataset. The HIRS level 1b data from the entire Television and Infrared Observation Satellite N-series (TIROS-N) satellites have been assembled. A new radiance calibration procedure was applied to obtain more accurate and consistent HIRS radiance measurements. The regression coefficients of the HIRS OLR algorithm for all satellites were rederived from calculations using an improved radiative transfer model. Intersatellite calibrations were performed to remove possible discontinuity in the HIRS OLR product from different satellites. A set of global monthly diurnal models was constructed consistent with the HIRS OLR retrievals to reduce the temporal sampling errors and to alleviate an orbital-drift-induced artificial trend. These steps significantly improved the accuracy, continuity, and uniformity of the HIRS monthly mean OLR time series. As a result, the HIRS OLR shows a comparable stability as in the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) nonscanner OLR measurements. HIRS OLR has superb agreement with the broadband observations from Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) in the ENSO-monitoring regions. It shows compatible ENSO-monitoring capability with the AVHRR OLR. Globally, HIRS OLR agrees with CERES with an accuracy to within 2 W m-2 and a precision of about 4 W m-2. The correlation coefficient between HIRS and CERES global monthly mean is 0.997. Regionally, HIRS OLR agrees with CERES to within 3 W m-2 with precisions better than 3 W m-2 in most places. HIRS OLR could be used for constructing climatology for applications that plan to use NPOESS ERBS and previously used AVHRR OLR observations. The HIRS monthly mean OLR data have high accuracy and precision with respect to the broadband observations of ERBE and CERES. It can be used as an independent validation data source. The uniformity and continuity of HIRS OLR time series suggest that it could be used as at reliable transfer reference for the discontinuous broadband measurements from ERBE, CERES, and ERBS. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Advanced very high resolution radiometers (AVHRR); Calibration; Climatology; Computer simulation; Radiative transfer; Regression analysis; High resolution infrared radiation sounder; Outgoing longwave radiation; Radiative transfer model; Regression coefficient; Atmospheric radiation; Advanced very high resolution radiometers (AVHRR); Atmospheric radiation; Calibration; Climatology; Computer simulation; Radiative transfer; Regression analysis; algorithm; AVHRR; calibration; correlation; data set; longwave radiation; NOAA satellite; numerical model; radiative transfer; regression analysis; spectral analysis; temporal analysis; time series analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38549181922

A new mechanism of formation of hydrothermal authigenic carbonates is suggested; it implies their microbial sulfate reduction over the hydrogen of the fluid in the subsurface zone (biosphere) of mixing between the hydrothermal solution and the adjacent seawater. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc. 2007.",,"authigenic mineral; carbonate; fracture zone; geochemistry; hydrogen; hydrothermal system; methane; mineralogy; seawater; serpentinite; Black Sea; Dnieper Canyon; Eurasia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548790711

Global-scale leaf trait data were compiled from the literature for 75 native and 90 exotic invasive coexisting species. • At the community level, specific leaf area (SLA), foliar nitrogen and phosphorus (Nmass and Pmass) and N:P ratio were significantly higher for exotics at disturbed sites compared with natives at undisturbed sites, with natives at disturbed sites being intermediate. SLA, Nmass and P mass were positively correlated, with significant shifts in group means along a common standardized major axis (SMA) slope. At the global scale, invasives had significantly higher Nmass, Pmass, assimilation rate (Amass and Aarea) and leaf area ratio (LAR) than natives. All traits showed positive correlations, with significant shifts in group means along a common slope. For a given SLA, invasives had higher Amass (7.7%) and Nmass (28%). • Thus, exotic invasives do not have fundamentally different carbon capture strategies from natives but are positioned further along the leaf economics spectrum towards faster growth strategies. Species with leaf traits enabling rapid growth will be successful invaders when introduced to novel environments where resources are not limited. © The Authors (2007).","Carbon capture strategy; Exotic plants; Foliar nitrogen; Foliar phosphorus; Photosynthetic capacity; Plant ecological strategies; Specific leaf area","carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; bushland; coexistence; community composition; comparative study; invasive species; leaf area; native species; vascular plant; article; Australia; comparative study; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; regression analysis; soil; Carbon; Ecosystem; New South Wales; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Regression Analysis; Soil; Australasia; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35448967885

The fallow land of these systems is populated by small trees and bushes. Since the 1960s the government of Vietnam has tried to limit or stop swiddening and replace it with permanent upland agricultural fields, paddy, fruit trees and animal husbandry. Discussion in the policy debate and literature focuses on the impacts these changes have on local people's livelihoods. There have been no attempts to evaluate the impact of these changes on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper examines the realities of current farming system changes taking place at the hamlet level and other changes that could take place due to government land use policies and extension programs. The paper answers the following questions: How could farming system changes influence net GHGs? Which farming system changes in the NMR, the trajectories of changes that are currently observed or those that would be followed if farmers adhere strictly to government policies and programs, will have a greater affect on the GHG contributions from agriculture in the region? Could 'clean development mechanism' (CDM) projects make a difference in the profitability of the pathways mentioned? Results show: (1) if farming systems in the NMR continue along currently observed change trajectories there will be increases in GHG emissions; (2) if the NMR farming systems change according to government policies and programs there will be a net sequestration of carbon in regrowing vegetation during the initial 20 years; (3) over the longer term, in areas where systems change to fit government policies, increased GHG emissions from other changes in the farming systems (e.g. increased paddy and increased pig raising in sties) will overtake the amounts of carbon sequestered in vegetation; (4) CMD projects only make a difference if (a) maximum biomass potential of regrowing fallow can be reached; (b) a favourable baseline is chosen; (c) timing and length of the accounting period is correct; and (d) farmers do not take compensatory action in response to government policies. Given these conditions it does not appear that currently envisioned clean development mechanisms would be beneficial to farmers in the NMR. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Carbon sequestration; Farming system change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Vietnam","Animalia; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36549070801

Non-white, near-infrared-reflective architectural coatings can be applied in situ to pitched concrete or clay tile roofs to reduce tile temperature, building heat gain, and cooling power demand, while simultaneously improving the roof's appearance. Scale-model measurements of building temperature and heat-flux were combined with solar and cooling energy use data to estimate the effects of such cool-roof coatings in various California climates. Under typical conditions-e.g., 1 kW m- 2 summer afternoon insolation, R-11 attic insulation, no radiant barrier, and a 0.3 reduction in solar absorptance-absolute reductions in roof surface temperature, attic air temperature, and ceiling heat-flux are about 12, 6.2 K, and 3.7 W m- 2, respectively. For a typical 1500 ft2(139 m2) house with R-11 attic insulation and no radiant barrier, reducing roof absorptance by 0.3 yields whole-house peak power savings of 230 W in Fresno, 210 W in San Bernardino, and 210 W in San Diego. The corresponding absolute and fractional cooling energy savings are 92 kWh yr- 1 (5%), 67 kWh yr- 1 (6%), and 8 kWh yr- 1 (1%), respectively. These savings are about half those previously reported for houses with non-tile roofs. With these assumptions, the statewide peak cooling power and annual cooling energy reductions would be 240 MW and 63 GWh yr- 1, respectively. Statewide energy savings would reduce annual emissions from California power plants by 35 kton CO2, 1.1 ton NOx, and 0.86 ton SOx. The economic value of cooling energy savings is well below the cost of coating a tile roof, but the simple payback times for using cool pigments in a roof tile coating are modest (5-7 yr) in the warm climates of Fresno and San Bernardino. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this paper is to understand the magnetic configuration and evolution of an active region, which permitted an X1.7 flare to be observed during the decaying phase of a long-duration X1.5 flare on 2005 September 13. Methods. We performed a multi-wavelength analysis using data from space-borne (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE), Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI), GOES) and ground-based (the French-Italian THEMIS telescope and the Huairou Video Vector Magnetograph (HVVM)) instruments. We coaligned all the data in order to study the origin of the flare by comparing the observed magnetic field structures with the emissions detected by different instruments. Results. Reconstructed RHESSI images show three hard X-ray (HXR) sources. In TRACE 195 Å images, two loops are seen: a short bright loop and a longer one. Five ribbons are identified in Hα images, with two of them remnant ribbons of the previous flare. We propose the following scenario to explain the X1.7 flare. A reconnection occurs between the short loop system and the longer loops (TRACE 195 Å). Two X-ray sources could be the footpoints of the short loop, while the third one between the two others is the site of the reconnection. The Ha ribbons are the footprints in the chromosphere of the reconnected loops. During the reconnection, the released energy is principally nonthermal according to the RHESSI energy spectrum analysis (two orders of magnitude higher than the maximum thermal energy). The proposed scenario is confirmed by a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation, which shows the presence of short sheared magnetic field lines before the eruption and less sheared ones after the reconnection, and the connectivity of the field lines involved in the flaring activity is modified after the reconnection process. The evolution of the photospheric magnetic field over a few days shows the continuous emergence of a large-scale magnetic flux tube, the tongue-shape of the two main polarities of the active region being the signature of such an emergence. After the previous X1.5 flare, the emergence of the tube continues and favors new magnetic energy storage and the onset of the X1.7 flare. © ESO 2007.","Sun: flares; Sun: magnetic fields; Sun: X-rays, gamma rays","Gamma rays; Magnetic field effects; Spectrum analysis; Wavelength; Flares; Hard X-ray (HXR); Wavelength analysis; Sun",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36549022098

Compared to the previous regulation where only an air pollution fee is used, the new regulation that requires a reduction in emissions by 10 per cent from the emission level in the year 2000 for a 5 year period will increase the costs by 77 per cent, which is equivalent to US$9.87 million.

Sensitivities of ozone and PM2.5 formation to precursor emissions are found to change only slightly in response to climate change. In many cases, mass per ton sensitivities to NOx and SO2 controls are predicted to be greater in the future due to both the lower emissions as well as climate, suggesting that current control strategies based on reducing such emissions will continue to be effective in decreasing ground-level ozone and PM2.5 concentrations. SO 2 emission controls are predicted to be most beneficial for decreasing summertime PM2.5 levels, whereas controls of NO x emissions are effective in winter. Spatial distributions of sensitivities are also found to be only slightly affected assuming no changes in land-use. Contributions of biogenic VOC emissions to PM2.5 formation are simulated to be more important in the future because of higher temperatures, higher biogenic emissions, and lower anthropogenic NDx and SO2 emissions. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Climate change; Concentration (process); Emission control; Ozone; Biogenic emissions; Precursor emissions; Particles (particulate matter); nitrogen oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; Climate change; Concentration (process); Emission control; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); climate change; emission control; ozone; particulate matter; sensitivity analysis; spatial distribution; volatile organic compound; air particle control; article; climate change; concentration (parameters); high temperature; land use; particle size; particulate matter; prediction; quantitative analysis; sensitivity analysis; summer; winter; Climate; Ozone; Particle Size; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37249072389

A high-resolution raster digital elevation model (1 m pixel resolution) consisting of building structures and ground heights is derived from a local government geodatabase, as well as land use patterns and artificial heat sources. Parameters such as the sky view factor (SVF) and daily averages of solar radiation are calculated. Results obtained from the model are compared with intra-urban air temperature variations which are derived from mobile measurements, as well as surface temperature variations derived from thermal infrared images. Results show that high-resolution digital elevation models in raster format are very useful sources of data for the investigation of intra-urban temperature variations. Results also show that the areal mean of SVF correlates with intra-urban air temperature variations to a higher degree than SVF that is taken from a point source location. The correlation between the modelled SVF and surface temperature is high during both spring and winter. Adding information about daily averages of global radiation for the spring measurement causes the correlation between SVF and surface temperature variations to increase.

Studies of the region near the separatrix have addressed the relationship of profiles to turbulence as well as the scaling of the parallel power flow. Enhanced low-field side radial transport is implicated as driving parallel flows to the inboard side. The medium-n nature of edge localized modes (ELMs) has been elucidated and new measurements have determined that they carry ∼10-20% of the ELM energy to the far SOL with implications for ITER limiters and the upper divertor. The predicted divertor power loads for ITER disruptions are reduced while those to main chamber plasma facing components (PFCs) increase. Disruption mitigation through massive gas puffing is successful at reducing PFC heat loads. New estimates of ITER tritium retention have shown tile sides to play a significant role; tritium cleanup may be necessary every few days to weeks. ITER's use of mixed materials gives rise to a reduction of surface melting temperatures and chemical sputtering. Advances in modelling of the ITER divertor and flows have enhanced the capability to match experimental data and predict ITER performance. © 2007 IAEA.",,"Fusion reactor divertors; Melting point; Plasma turbulence; Plasmas; Sputtering; Tritium; Edge localized modes; ITER; Plasma facing components; Radial transport; Scrape-off layer; Nuclear physics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548258158

A major difficulty is that Norway's present energy supply has a low carbon intensity because a substantial part derives from hydropower, but increasing demand may be met by gas-fired electricity generation, thereby making efficiency and conservation a much higher priority. A National Action Plan on Climate Research recognizes the need for increased research efforts in several areas, including the impacts on the built environment and the more general impacts on society. Mitigation opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions within the built environment include increased technological efficiencies, reduced energy usage through improved design, mandatory labelling schemes and a switch to climate neutral fuels for heating. However, radically lower energy requirements and lower U-values will be problematic, requiring new technical solutions and construction methods. There is little integration of policy and strategy for adaptation in Norway. The recognition that climate change will further enhance an array of different, harsh microclimates in Norway, which vary according to individual locality, has led to the development of new adaptation approaches and methods. These allow for the projected local climate to inform decisions on an appropriate design response to meet performance-based codes. The development of design guidance for high-performance building envelopes will, in future, take account of projected local climate. However, there is a tension between the need for standardized national building solutions and the need to adapt to local climatic conditions.","Adaptation; Building performance; Building stock; Climate change; Climate policy; Global warming; Mitigation; Norway; Vulnerability","Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Global warming; Structural design; Adaptation options; Building performance; Building stocks; Climate policy; Buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249735320

We used a 34-year time series of the abundance of Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and five prey species to show that the nature of trophic control in a North Pacific ecosystem depends on climate state. Rapid warming in the 1970s caused an oscillation between bottom-up and top-down control. This shift to top-down control apparently contributed to the transition from an initial, prey-rich ecosystem state to the final, prey-poor state. However, top-down control could not be detected in the final state without reference to the initial state and transition period. Complete understanding of trophic control in ecosystems capable of transitions between alternate states may therefore require observations spanning more than one state. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Alternate stable states; Bottom-up control; Climate change; Community reorganization; Fishery; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; Phase transition; Regime shift; Top-down control; Trophic control","abundance; bottom-up control; climate change; community composition; gadoid; marine ecosystem; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; top-down control; trophic control; animal; article; climate; Crustacea; food chain; Gadiformes; Pacific Ocean; physiology; population density; population dynamics; predation; temperature; Animals; Climate; Crustacea; Food Chain; Gadiformes; Pacific Ocean; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Predatory Behavior; Temperature; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Gadus macrocephalus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35848965246

During all of these periods, significantly lower mean CH4 uptake (±S.E.) at WG01 (28±0.7 μg C m-2 h-1) as compared to UG99 (56±1.0 μg C m-2 h-1) (p&lt;0.01) was found. Total CH4 uptake during the growing seasons (May-September) 2004 and 2005 at WG01 and UG99 was quantified as 1.15 and 2.15 kg C ha-1, respectively. Annual rates of CH4 uptake were approximately 1.91 (WG01) and 3.58 kg C ha-1 (UG99), respectively. These results indicate that winter-grazing of steppe significantly reduced atmospheric CH4 uptake by ca. 47%. The winter-grazing practice may have inhibited CH4 uptake by (a) increasing the likelihood of physiological water stress for CH4-consuming bacteria during dry periods, (b) decreasing gas diffusion into the soil and, (c) reducing the populations of CH4 oxidizing bacteria. These three mechanisms could have collectively or independently facilitated the observed inhibitory effects. Our results suggest that grazing exerts a considerable negative impact on CH4 uptake in semi-arid steppes at regional scales. Notwithstanding, further studies involving year-round, intensive measurements of CH4 uptake are needed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Coincident with the large tidal changes, a strong temperature inversion layer was also observed above 90 km. Examination of the simultaneous temperature measurement from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument, on board the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite, not only confirms the existence of the inversion layer but also reveals the global nature of the inversion, suggesting the presence of a transient planetary wave in the mesosphere. The large tidal variability, therefore, is probably a consequence of the interaction between the transient planetary wave and tides. This possibility is investigated by using the NCAR thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model (TIME-GCM) and by comparing model results with the lidar, SABER, and TIMED Doppler Interferometer (TIDI) measurements. With a large transient planetary wave specified at the model lower boundary, the model is able to produce strong diurnal tidal variability comparable to that from the lidar observation, and the modeled temperature inversion is similar to that from the SABER measurement. The model results suggest that the planetary/tidal wave interaction excites nonmigrating tides and modulates the gravity modes and/or the rotational modes of the diurnal migrating tide. Among the nonmigrating tides, the diurnal zonally symmetric (S = 0) component is the strongest, and its interaction with the planetary wave leads to a strong diurnal eastward wave number 1 component.

With 10% DWL observations from the ensemble spread strategy, both 3D-Var and LETKF attain about 90% of the impact that 100% DWL wind profile coverage would provide.

We use a global chemical transport model, Model of Ozone and Related Tracers, version 2 (MOZART-2), to quantify the source-receptor relationships of inter-continental transport of sulfate aerosols among ten regions in 2000. In order to compare the importance of foreign with domestic emissions and to estimate the effect of future changes in emissions on human exposure, we define an 'influence potential' (IP). The IP quantifies the human exposure that occurs in a receptor region as a result of a unit of SO2 emissions from a source region. We find that due to the non-linear nature of sulfate production, regions with low SO2 emissions usually have large domestic IP, and vice versa. An exception is East Asia (EA), which has both high SO2 emissions and relatively large domestic IP, mostly caused by the spatial coincidence of emissions and population. We find that inter-continental IPs are usually less than domestic IPs by 1-3 orders of magnitude. SO2 emissions from the Middle East (ME) and Europe (EU) have the largest potential to influence populations in surrounding regions. By comparing the IP ratios (IPR) between foreign and domestic SO2 emissions, we find that the IPR values range from 0.000 01 to 0.16 and change with season. Therefore, if reducing human exposure to sulfate aerosols is the objective, all regions should first focus on reducing domestic SO2 emissions. In addition, we find that relatively high IPR values exist among the EU, ME, the former Soviet Union (FSU) and African (AF) regions. Therefore, on the basis of the IP and IPR values, we conclude that a regional agreement among EA countries, and an inter-regional agreement among EU, ME, FSU and (north) AF regions to control sulfur emissions could benefit public health in these regions. © IOP Publishing Ltd.","Human exposure; Influence potential; Inter-continental transport; International environmental agreement; Public health; Source receptor relationship; Sulfate aerosol","Aerosols; Air quality; Environmental regulations; Public health; Sulfur dioxide; Human exposures; Influence potential; Inter-continental transport; International environmental agreements; Source-receptor relationships; Sulfate aerosols; Atmospheric movements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37649004519

The study focuses on formaldehyde and ozone, and a budget analysis was set up for interpreting the importance of different processes, namely emission, chemistry, transport and deposition, for three different areas (urban, downwind, suburban) around the Milan metropolitan region. In addition, a sensitivity study was carried out based on 11 different VOC emission scenarios. The results of the budget study show that the strongest O3 production rate (4 ppbv/hour) occurs in the downwind area of the city of Milan, and that accumulated O3 is transported back to Milan city during nighttime. More than 80% of the HCHO concentration over the Milan metropolitan region is secondary, i.e., photochemically produced from other VOCs. The sensitivity study shows that the emissions of isoprene are not, on average, a controlling factor for the peak concentrations of O3 and HCHO over the model domain because of very few oak trees in this region. Although the paraffinic (PAR) emissions are fairly large, a 20% reduction of PAR yields only 1.7% of HCHO reduction and 2.7% reduction of the O3, peak. The largest reduction of O3 levels can be obtained by reduced xylene (XYL) emissions. A 20% reduction of the total anthropogenic VOC emissions leads to 15.5% (20.3 ppbv) reduction of O3 peak levels over the Milan metropolitan region.

The values of species richness are higher in the lowlands and then decrease monotonically with increasing elevation in the tropical mountains. Species richness has unimodal patterns with a bias towards high values in the lower half of the elevation gradients in the subtropical mountains.

Emissions were also studied during steady-state operations in order to confirm consistency with previous findings. Testing methods were concurrent with those implemented by the EPA to regulate PM mass emissions, including the use of the Federal Transient Testing Procedure-Heavy Duty cycle to simulate transient conditions and the use of a Critical Flow Venturi-Constant Volume System to provide primary dilution. Steady-state results were found to be consistent with previous studies in that nuclei-mode particulate emissions were largely reduced when lower-sulfur content fuel was used in the newer engine, while the nuclei-mode PM emissions from the older engine were much less affected by fuel sulfur content. The transient results, however, show that the total number of nuclei-mode PM emissions from both engines increases with fuel sulfur content, although this effect is only seen under the higher primary dilution ratios with the older engine.

The new measurements show H i in absorption against SS 433 to a velocity of 75 km s -1 but not to the velocity of the tangent point, which bounds the kinematic distance at 5.5 ≤ d k &lt; 6.5 kpc. This is entirely consistent with a 5.5 ± 0.2 kpc distance determined from light traveltime arguments by Blundell &amp; Bowler. The H i emission map shows evidence of interaction of the lobes of W50 with the interstellar medium near the adopted systemic velocity of V LSR = 75 km s -1. The western lobe sits in a cavity in the H i emission near the Galactic plane, while the eastern lobe terminates at an expanding H i shell. The expanding shell has a radius of 40 pc, contains 8 ± 3 × 10 3 M ⊙ of H i and has a measured kinetic energy of 3 ± 1.5 × 10 49 erg. There may also be a static H i ring or shell around the main part of W50 itself at a local standard of rest (LSR) velocity of 75 km s -1, with a radius of 70 pc and a mass in H i of 3.5-10 × 10 4 M ⊙. We do not find convincing evidence for the interaction of the system with any molecular cloud or with H i at other velocities. The H i emission data suggest that SS 433 lies in an interstellar environment substantially denser than average for its distance from the Galactic plane. This Population I system, now about 200 pc below the Galactic plane, most likely originated as a runaway O-star binary ejected from a young cluster in the plane. Given a modest ejection velocity of ≥30 km s -1, the binary could have reached its present location in ≤10 Myr at which time the more massive member became a supernova (SN). New astrometric data on SS 433 show that the system now has a peculiar velocity of a few tens of km s -1 in the direction of the Galactic plane.

PFOA was the predominant contaminant in samples from Plant B (7.0-130 ng/g dry wt in solid samples and 1-227 ng/L in aqueous samples), followed by PFOS (<2.5-77 ng/g dry wt in solid samples and 1.8-22 ng/L in aqueous samples). PFHxS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFOSA were detected in most of the samples, whereas PFUnDA and PFDoDA were detected in very few samples. Concentrations of some PFCs, particularly PFOA, were slightly higher in effluent than in influent, suggesting that biodegradation of some precursors contributes to the increase in PFOA concentrations in wastewater treatment processes. No large-magnitude seasonal variations in concentrations were found, although mass flow of PFCs was higher in winter than in summer. In general, samples from the rural plant in Kentucky contained greater concentrations of PFCs than did those from the urban plant in Georgia. Incineration of sludge reduced the PFC levels significantly. The mass flows of PFCs in these two plants were several hundreds of mg/day, comparable to flow values reported earlier. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Non-periodic fluctuations were characterised at the fuel inlet via a pair of sinusoidal harmonics of incommensurate periods with identical amplitude and frequency. Harmonic amplitudes of 2.5%, 7.5%, and 12.5% with respect to the time-averaged fuel inlet velocity have been simulated and their results weighted against the predictions in a steady fuel delivery. The results showed a decrease in soot emissions as the amplitude of the perturbation increased; nonetheless, a logarithmic behaviour was observed, suggesting that soot reduction will stabilise after certain pulse amplitude for a given frequency. The results from the 12.5% incommensurate pulse were also compared with its simple harmonic equivalent. Localized reductions in NO emissions were also observed in the incommensurate flame with respect to the sinusoidal pulse. The case study was based on a 2-dimensional axi-symmetric piloted methane flame with a time-averaged jet Reynolds number of about 7000.

Those data, containing a strong non-LTE component, showed a structure in the 4.3 - μ m spectral region which was challenging for non-LTE models so far. The model used in this work was refined after analysis of Martian CO2 atmospheric emission taken by the ""Planetary Fourier Spectrometer"" (PFS) and the ""Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer"" (OMEGA) instruments on board Mars Express.

The paper defines engagement as an individual's state, comprising three elements: cognitive, affective and behavioural. A number of common barriers emerge from the three studies, which operate broadly at 'individual' and 'social' levels. These major constraints to individual engagement with climate change have implications for achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gases in the UK. We argue that targeted and tailored information provision should be supported by wider structural change to enable citizens and communities to reduce their carbon dependency.

The negative excursion was caused by transient enhanced precipitation of 13C- depleted carbonate, mediated by anaerobic oxidation of methane. Despite its local diagenetic origin, the Beauvoisin excursion is similar in shape and duration to globally recognized negative C-isotope excursions that have been related to catastrophic, massive dissociation of methane hydrate.

Synergies between the electricity supply system, intermediate energy-conversion systems and the dwelling envelope make it possible to achieve 60-70% reductions in CO2 emissions with plausible combinations of existing and/or emerging technologies. Sensitivity analysis shows that a halving of the carbon intensity of the UK electricity system, plausible improvements to dwelling envelopes, and extensive use of second law energy-conversion systems (typified by, but not restricted to, heat pumps and combined heat and power) to supply space and water heating render total CO2 emissions insensitive to demolition rates. As a result, increased demolition rates may be unnecessary to achieve deep cuts in carbon emissions from dwellings.

By analyzing the REE in core samples and crude oil, carbon isotope of carbon dioxide and inclusion temperature measurement in the west of the Tazhong Uplift in the western Tarim Basin, all the evidence confirms the existence of deep fluid. The deep fluid below the basin floor moved up into the basin through discordogenic fault and volcanicity to cause corrosion and metasomatosis of carbonate rock by exchange of matter and energy. The pore structure and permeability of the carbonate reservoirs were improved, making the carbonate reservoirs an excellent type of deeply buried modification. The fluorite ore belts discovered along the large fault and the volcanic area in the west of the Tazhong Uplift are the outcome of deep fluid action. Such carbonate reservoirs are the main type of reservoirs in the Tazhong 45 oilfield. The carbonate reservoirs in well YM 7 are improved obviously by thermal fluid dolomitization. The origin and territory of deep fluid are associated with the discordogenic fault and volcanicity in the basin.

However, EPA refused, stating that greenhouse gas were not pollutants so Section 202 does not provide authority to regulate air pollutants. The refusal made some states and cities challenge the agency's decision in the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. Massachusetts then provide 43 declarations and affidavits form scientist and government officials to prove that greenhouse gases were contributing to global warming. EPA countered the argument by declaring that even if greenhouse gases were provent pollutants, emissions from new vehicles contributed such a minuscule amount to global warming. EPA failed with that argument and the Court found that the long list of reasons the EPA cited for its refusal was irrelevant to the standard contained in the Clean Air Act.

The commercial harbour and the adjacent industrial area are very important for the economic system of Ravenna but, at the same time, they are highly critical areas. In particular, on average 8000 ships per year pass through the harbour of Ravenna, influencing air quality in harbour environment. The paper originates from a study about the contribution of different sources of air pollution in Ravenna and its aim is to evaluate the maritime traffic contribution to the air quality in the port area and to determine the suitability of an urban air quality model to support the air quality management in Ravenna. NOx and PM are selected as modelled pollutants. The study is made up of two parts. The first deals with the evaluation of annual emission of PM10 and NOx coming from ships through a standard European methodology while in the second we simulated the diffusion of these pollutants in the whole area. In order to evaluate the capability of the model to treat maritime traffic emissions, we compared hour-by-hour simulated concentrations with data collected by a fixed monitoring station located near the Candiano Canal. NOx concentrations obtained by short- and long-term simulations show a good match with the values measured by the fixed monitoring station, located in the centre of harbour area, and these results are also supported by FA2 performance index. Instead the omission of the secondary particulate and the contribution of other sources of particulate matter in the port area are probably the most important causes of the PM10 underestimation. The worse results obtained according to the performance indexes indicate the need to consider the formation and transport of secondary particulate matter in order to obtain more reliable predictions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The introduction of grain legumes has impacted soil organisms, including both symbiotic and nonsymbiotic N-fixing bacteria, pathogens, mycorrhizae and fauna, and the processes they perform. These changes occur through effects of legume seed exudates, rhizosphere exudates, and decomposing crop residues. The \egume-Rhizobium symbiosis results in dinitrogen (N2) fixation that adds plant available N into the soil system. It is estimated that about 171 million kg N2 was fixed by field pea (Pisum sativum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.), dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), and chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) crops in the Canadian Prairies in 2004, representing 7% of the total fertilizer-N (2580 million kg) used by Canadian prairie farmers in that year. Similarly, an estimated 40 million kg N2 was fixed by field pea, lentil, and dry bean (including chickpea) crops in U.S. agroecosy stems in 2004. Some of the fixed N 2 is recycled for the benefit of nonlegume crops grown after grain legumes. Many other associations benefit from the legume in a cropping system, including mycorrhizal associations that improve plant nutrient and water uptake, changes in the pathogen load and disease development, and overall changes in the soil community. Legumes contribute to greenhouse gas (N2O and CO2) emissions during nitrification and denitrification of fixed N. However, because less fertilizer-N is used in legume-based cropping systems, overall greenhouse gas emissions are usually less than those in fertilized monoculture cereals. Therefore, grain legumes in Northern Great Plains have positive effects on agriculture by adding and recycling biologically fixed N2, enhancing nutrient uptake, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by reducing N fertilizer use, and breaking nonlegume crop pest cycles. © American Society of Agronomy.",,"Crops; Decomposition; Greenhouse gases; Nitrification; Pathogens; Soils; Fixing bacteria; Grain legumes; Greenhouse gas emission; Mycorrhizae; Rhizosphere; Grain (agricultural product); Bacteria (microorganisms); Cicer arietinum; Lens culinaris; Phaseolus vulgaris; Pisum sativum; Rhizobium",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36448945412

Small fuel cell auxiliary power units (APUs) (now in development) are promising alternatives to idling the main engine. A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) APU is particularly attractive, because in conjunction with a reformer, it could operate on widely available diesel fuel. Because fuel cell APUs may not only reduce environmental impacts, but also reduce operating costs, this application has been cited as an attractive early market niche for fuel cells. Our objective is to determine whether SOFC APUs are likely to soon be economically feasible for those trucks that idle most and what energy and environmental benefits are probable. We estimate the APU market size as a function of APU costs by applying Monte Carlo sampling and net present value (NPV) economic analysis to our ADVISOR-based vehicle fuel consumption model. Emissions and fuel economy benefits estimates are then presented as a function of varying market penetration levels, assuming installation on only new vehicles and removal at the end of the 4-year SOFC lifecycle. With modest economic incentives from government and continuing fuel cell technology improvements, we find that SOFC APUs might be economically feasible for up to 15% of the long-haul truck population (60,000 trucks) in the United States in the 2015 time frame, resulting in a 30% reduction of heavy-duty truck fuel use during overnight idling and a 40% reduction in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) produced during idling. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Its expression levels are low in the presence of a rich nitrogen source but are higher when a poor nitrogen source is used. In addition, GABA can induce UGA4 expression when cells are grown with proline but not when they are grown with ammonium. Although vast amounts of evidence have been gathered about UGA4 regulation by nitrogen, little is known about its regulation by the carbon source. Using glucose and acetate as rich and poor carbon source respectively, this work aimed to shed light on hitherto unclear aspects of the regulation of this gene. In poor nitrogen conditions, cells grown with acetate were found to have higher UGA4 basal expression levels than those grown with glucose, and did not show UGA4 induction in response to GABA. Analysis of the expression and subcellular localization of the transcription factors that regulate UGA4 as well as partial deletions and site-directed mutations of the UGA4 promoter region suggested that there are two parallel pathways that act in regulating this gene by the carbon source. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the existence of a new factor operating in UGA4 regulation. © 2007 SGM.",,"4 aminobutyric acid; acetic acid; aminolevulinic acid; carbon; glucose; nitrogen; permease; repressor protein; transcription factor; transcription factor GAT1; transcription factor GATA; transcription factor gln3; transcription factor GZF3; UGA4 protein; Uga43 protein; unclassified drug; article; carbon source; cellular distribution; controlled study; gene control; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein localization; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; site directed mutagenesis; transcription regulation; Acetates; Carbon; Culture Media; GABA Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; GATA Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Glucose; Mutation; Nitrogen; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Repressor Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36448940491

There is strong evidence to suggest that GHB has an important role as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator. The human aldo-keto reductase AKR7A2 has been proposed previously to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of succinic semialdehyde (SSA) to GHB in human brain. In this study we have used RNA interference to evaluate the role of AKR7A2 in GHB biosynthesis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis and immunoblotting revealed that short interfering RNA molecules directed against AKR7A2 led to a significant reduction in both AKR7A2 transcript and protein levels 72 h post-transfection. We have shown that reduced expression of AKR7A2 results in a 90% decrease in SSA reductase activity of cell extracts. Furthermore, we have shown using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry that a decrease in the level of AKR7A2 was paralleled with a significant reduction in intracellular GHB concentration. This provides conclusive evidence that AKR7A2 is the major SSA reductase in these cells. In contrast, short interfering RNA-dependent reduction in AKR7A2 levels had no effect on the GHB dehydrogenase activity of the extracts, and inhibitor studies suggest that another enzyme characteristic of an NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase may be responsible for catalyzing this reverse reaction. Together these findings delineate pathways for GHB metabolism in the brain and will enable a better understanding of the relationship between GHB biosynthesis and catabolism in disease states and in drug overdose. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Catabolism; Neuromodulators; Neurotransmitters; Biosynthesis; Brain; Catalysis; Cells; Immunology; Metabolism; Neurology; RNA; Metabolites; 4 hydroxybutyric acid; alcohol dehydrogenase; oxidoreductase; protein akr7a2; unclassified drug; amino acid metabolism; amino acid synthesis; article; biosynthesis; brain metabolism; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme degradation; gas chromatography; human; human cell; mass spectrometry; neuroblastoma cell; priority journal; protein synthesis; proteomics; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Brain; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell-Free System; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Hydroxybutyrate Dehydrogenase; Neoplasm Proteins; Neuroblastoma; RNA, Small Interfering; Sodium Oxybate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548831366

It contains a chapel of elegant simplicity designed by one of the world's most famous architects of the time, Sir Herbert Baker, as a labour of love to commemorate Kingsley. Rhodes is one of the few scientists to research the sun/climate relationship in terms of the totality of the sun's impact on the earth (i.e. gravity, the electromagnetic force and output and their interaction). When the totality of the sun's impact is considered, having regard to the relevant research published over the last two decades, the influence of solar variability on the earth's climate is very strongly non-linear and stochastic. Rhodes also researched the idea that the planets might have a role in producing the sun's variable activity. If they do and if the sun's variable activity regulates climate, then ultimately the planets may regulate it. Recent research about the sun/climate relationship and the solar inertial motion (sim) hypothesis shows a large body of circumstantial evidence and several working hypotheses but no satisfactory account of a physical sim process. In 2007 Ulysses will send information about the solar poles. This could be decisive regarding the predictions about emergent Sunspot Cycle No 24, including the sim hypothesis. According to the sim hypothesis, this cycle should be like Sunspot Cycle No 14, and be followed by two that will create a brief ice age. During the 1920s and '30s Australia's Bureau of Meteorology published research about the sun/climate relationship, especially Sunspot Cycle No 14, showing that it probably caused the worst drought then on record.","Barycentre; Climate change; Drought; Global warming; IPCC; Meteorology; N-body problem; Non-stationary; Nonlinear; Solar inertial motion; Sunspot cycle",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954955550

The ceiling surface of the car park was covered with white acrylic TiO2-containing paint (PP), which was developed in the frame of the EU project 'PICADA' (Photocatalytic Innovative Coverings Application for Depollution Assessment). The closed area was fed with car exhaust gases. As soon as the system reached steady state, the UV lamps were turned on for 5 h.

Here I focus on the latter in order to better understand estimated changes in desert dust aerosols and the associated iron deposition into oceans. Using 17 model simulations from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 multi-model dataset and the BIOME4 equilibrium vegetation model, I estimate changes in desert dust source areas due to climate change and carbon dioxide fertilization. If I assume no carbon dioxide fertilization, the mean of the model predictions is that desert areas expand from the 1880s to the 2080s, due to increased aridity. If I allow for carbon dioxide fertilization, the desert areas become smaller. Thus better understanding carbon dioxide fertilization is important for predicting desert response to climate.

However, there is a limited amount of information to evaluate this agricultural system in the semi-arid region, specifically in the region of Ceará, Brazil. The objective of this work was to evaluate five agricultural (four agroforestry and one conventional) systems in order to test the hypothesis that the agroforestry systems promote an increase in the soil organic carbon stocks and organic carbon pools, thus improving soil quality. The following treatments were tested: agrosilvopasture (AGP), silvopasture (SILV), traditional agroforestry (TRAG), intensive cropping (IC), and native forest (NF). The soil samples were collected at four depths: 0-6, 6-12, 12-20 and 20-40 cm. Total soil organic carbon stocks and the organic carbon pools (microbial biomass-C, mineralizable-C, oxidizable-C, free, occluded light fraction organic matter, and C in the humic substances) were analyzed. After 5 years of experimental cultivation, the soil under the SILV system presented the best results for the attributes studied, preserving, and in some cases, improving these attributes, when compared to the other conditions. The traditional agroforestry system (TRAG) reduced total organic carbon stocks and, consequently, C in some organic matter compartments, indicating that the fallow period was not sufficient to maintain soil quality. The AGP and IC systems presented significant losses in some of the soil organic matter (SOM) pools, suggesting that the soil environment had been degraded. The most labile SOM components were considered sensitive indicators of change in the soil quality. The silvopasture system can, therefore, be recommended as an alternative soil management strategy for food production and for the maintenance of soil quality and agricultural sustainability in the semiarid region of Ceará state. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Agroforestry; Organic carbon pools; Semi-arid; Soil quality","agroforestry; cultivation; intensive agriculture; Luvisol; organic carbon; semiarid region; soil management; soil organic matter; soil quality; sustainability; Brazil; Ceara; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548589164

The influence of different gaseous pretreatments (under O2/H2 or H2 flows) on the physico-chemical properties and the catalytic activity in the total combustion of methane were investigated. Dispersion of Pd and Pt appeared to be a crucial parameter for the catalytic performances. All directly calcined catalysts displayed better catalytic behaviour than the pretreated ones. Long duration tests demonstrated that a bimetallic Pd-Pt catalyst has a better catalytic behaviour than a Pd-based one, which undergoes through sintering as evidenced by the formation of larger agglomerates. After the long duration test, palladium is in a fully oxidized state (PdO) (as well as platinum (PtO)). It is suggested that the better catalytic behaviour of the Pt-Pd catalyst could be due to an active cooperation between PtO, formed during the early stages of the catalytic reaction, and PdO. Two hypotheses can be put forward; in the first case, PtO could supply oxygen atoms to PdO, which actually would play the active role in the catalytic reaction. In the second case, CH4 would be adsorbed and dissociated on Pt atoms, and PdO would supply oxygen atoms leading to the formation of CO2. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We examined the breeding schedule of fulmars in the remote Cape Vera colony in the Canadian high Arctic, a marine region covered by sea ice much of the year, to determine if the timing of breeding and colony attendance patterns of birds differed from the breeding phenology of fulmars in colonies farther south. Cape Vera fulmars arrived at the colony later in the year, spent less time at the colony before egg-laying, and took a significantly longer prelaying exodus from the colony compared to fulmars nesting in more southerly colonies. After egg-laying, however, patterns of colony attendance by fulmars in the high Arctic were similar to patterns for fulmars in southern colonies; this part of the fulmar breeding schedule may be inflexible. The differences in breeding schedules across the species' range might reflect behavioral adaptations by arctic-nesting birds to accommodate the physical and biological limitations imposed by extensive sea ice near arctic colonies, particularly early in the breeding season. Given that climate warming and corresponding reductions in sea ice are taking place in the Arctic, it remains to be determined whether fulmars in the high Arctic have the behavioral flexibility in their breeding phenology to compensate for rapidly occurring changes in their environment. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2007.","Arctic; Breeding; Fulmarus glacialis; Northern Fulmar; Sea ice","Aves; Fulmarus glacialis; Procellariidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36549079938

A reassessment of carbon tetrachloride, a model hepatotoxicant and carcinogen, provides an opportunity to incorporate into the assessment biologically relevant mode of action data on its carcinogenesis. Mechanistic studies provide evidence that metabolism of carbon tetrachloride via CYP2E1 to highly reactive free radical metabolites plays a critical role in the postulated mode of action. The primary metabolites, trichloromethyl and trichloromethyl peroxy free radicals, are highly reactive and are capable of covalently binding locally to cellular macromolecules, with preference for fatty acids from membrane phospholipids. The free radicals initiate lipid peroxidation by attacking polyunsaturated fatty acids in membranes, setting off a free radical chain reaction sequence. Lipid peroxidation is known to cause membrane disruption, resulting in the loss of membrane integrity and leakage of microsomal enzymes. By-products of lipid peroxidation include reactive aldehydes that can form protein and DNA adducts and may contribute to hepatotoxicity and carcinogenicity, respectively. Natural antioxidants, including glutathione, are capable of quenching the lipid peroxidation reaction. When glutathione and other antioxidants are depleted, however, opportunities for lipid peroxidation are enhanced. Weakened cellular membranes allow sufficient leakage of calcium into the cytosol to disrupt intracellular calcium homeostasis. High calcium levels in the cytosol activate calcium-dependent proteases and phospholipases that further increase the breakdown of the membranes. Similarly, the increase in intracellular calcium can activate endonucleases that can cause chromosomal damage and also contribute to cell death. Sustained cell regeneration and proliferation following cell death may increase the likelihood of unrepaired spontaneous, lipid peroxidation- or endonuclease-derived mutations that can lead to cancer. Based on this body of scientific evidence, doses that do not cause sustained cytotoxicity and regenerative cell proliferation would subsequently be protective of liver tumors if this is the primary mode of action. To fulfill the mode of action framework, additional research may be necessary to determine alternative mode(s) of action for liver tumors formed via carbon tetrachloride exposure.

Long-term surface observations suggest that atmospheric sulfate concentrations have followed trends in sulfur emissions more closely across Asia, than across the USA and Europe. We use a global model of chemistry and aerosol to understand changes in the regional sulfur budget between 1985 and 2000. For every 1% decrease in SO2 emissions over Europe and the USA the modelled sulfate column burden decreased by 0.65%, while over Asia a 1% increase in SO2 resulted in a 0.88% increase in sulfate. The different responses can be explained by the availability of oxidant in cloud. We find that because emissions have moved southward to latitudes where in-cloud oxidation is less oxidant limited, the 12% reduction in global SO2 emissions between 1985 and 2000 caused only a 3% decrease in global sulfate.

Method: A randomised, non-blinded clinical trial undertaken in a large metropolitan ED. Eligible patients were aged 3 to 15 years and needed IV cannulation/venipuncture. The Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale was used to measure the child's pain. A 5-point ordinal scale (very unsatisfied to very satisfied) was used to measure parental satisfaction with the method used. Results: 56 patients received N 2O and 45 received EMLA. The groups had similar gender and age profiles. The median pain score was 1 (interquartile range 0-2) for the N 2O group and 1 (interquartile range 1-2) for the EMLA group (p = 0.85). The median parental satisfaction scores were 5 (interquartile range 4-5) for both methods (p = 0.29). 8 (14.3%; 95%CI 6.8-26.8) patients in the N 2O group experienced minor adverse events - drowsiness (3), carpopedal spasm/paraesthesia (2), agitation (1), vomiting (1), dizziness (1). One (2.2%; 95%CI 0.1-13.2) EMLA group patient experienced post-procedure emesis. Conclusion: There is no significant difference between EMLA and N2O in reducing the pain associated with IV cannulation/venipuncture in children in the ED.

Autotrophic biomass exceeded microbial heterotrophic biomass by a factor of 1.7. Mean (±SE), integrated chlorophyll a concentration and net particulate primary production (PP) were 17 ± 1 mg m-2 and 271 ± 29 mg C m-2 d -1, respectively. Protist grazing on phytoplankton represented &gt;90 % of PP. Bacterial production (BP) was 17 ± 3 mg C m-2 d -1. In vitro O2-evolution experiments indicated that net community production was -65 ± 16 mmol O2 m-2 d-1, while community respiration (CR) averaged 124 ± 13 mmol O2 m-2 d-1, equivalent to 1324 ± 142 mg C m-2 d-1. However, the sum of the respiration rates by each microbial group, estimated from their biomass and metabolic rates, ranged from 402 to 848 mg C m-2 d-1. Therefore, CR could not be reconciled with the respiratory fluxes sustained by each microbial group. Comparison between estimated gross photosynthesis by phytoplankton (481 to 616 mg C m-2 d-1) and the sum of respiration by each group suggests that the microbial community in the NASE province is close to metabolic balance, which would agree with the observed O2 supersaturation in the euphotic layer. Taking into account the mean open-ocean values for PP, BP, CR and bacterial growth efficiency, we show that bacteria account for approximately 20 % of CR. Our results suggest that the view that bacteria dominate carbon cycling in the unproductive ocean must be reconsidered, or else that in vitro incubations misrepresent the real metabolic rates of one or several microbial groups. © Inter-Research 2007.","Atlantic Meridional Transect; Bacterial production; Grazing; Plankton; Primary production; Respiration; Subtropical NE Atlantic","Bacteria (microorganisms); Protista",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38149085747

Three global climate models (GCMs) covering a range of climate sensitivities were selected, and their output was employed to adjust the parameters of a stochastic weather generator using simple transformation rules for precipitation and temperature. Values of monthly precipitation and temperature were extracted from the GCMs for the current (1960-1990) and future (2040-2060) climate. The International Panel on Climate Change emission scenario known as B2 was selected. It represents an average scenario and corresponds approximately to a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Resorting to stochastically generated climate scenarios allowed assessing whether the modelled effects of climate change on flows were statistically significant. Results indicate that spring and summer-fall peak flows were reduced on average by 30% and 12%, respectively, using the Echam4 model derived scenarios. The Hadcm3 model produced a weaker signal that was not statistically significant. The CGCM2 model produced a statistically significant reduction in spring peak flows of 8% on average, whereas the simulated reduction in summer flows was not statistically significant for many of the return periods considered. Many sources of uncertainties were partially considered in this study. One is the downscaling of the GCM climatology at the watershed scale. The approach employed to generate the future climate scenarios changed the precipitation variability through an adjustment of the parameters of the Gamma distribution function used to model precipitation amounts. Whether this approach is truly typical of climate change effect remains to be ascertained. Using more physically based hydrological models would help reduce uncertainties in climate change impacts studies. © 2007 NRC Canada.","Climate change; Flood; Frequency analysis; Hydrological modelling; Weather generator","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Climatology; Computer simulation; Hydrology; Precipitation (meteorology); Statistics; Watersheds; Frequency analysis; Hydrological modelling; Weather generator; Floods; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Climatology; Computer simulation; Floods; Hydrology; Precipitation (meteorology); Statistics; Watersheds; climate change; climate effect; flood; frequency analysis; general circulation model; global climate; hydrological modeling; peak flow; precipitation (climatology); Canada; Chateauguay Basin; North America; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148972486

Comparison of different forms of commercial power generation by use of the fuel cycle methods developed in European studies shows the health burdens to be greatest for power stations that most pollute outdoor air (those based on lignite, coal, and oil). The health burdens are appreciably smaller for generation from natural gas, and lower still for nuclear power. This same ranking also applies in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions and thus, potentially, to long-term health, social, and economic effects arising from climate change. Nuclear power remains controversial, however, because of public concern about storage of nuclear waste, the potential for catastrophic accident or terrorist attack, and the diversion of fissionable material for weapons production. Health risks are smaller for nuclear fusion, but commercial exploitation will not be achieved in time to help the crucial near-term reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions. The negative effects on health of electricity generation from renewable sources have not been assessed as fully as those from conventional sources, but for solar, wind, and wave power, such effects seem to be small; those of biofuels depend on the type of fuel and the mode of combustion. Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage is increasingly being considered for reduction of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel plants, but the health effects associated with this technology are largely unquantified and probably mixed: efficiency losses mean greater consumption of the primary fuel and accompanying increases in some waste products.

The resting state is a complex of the metallacyclic catalyst with the olefinic unit of the allylamine product. The species containing the branched allylamine N-phenyl-1-phenylprop-2-enylamine and a related ethylene complex have been isolated in pure form. Binding constants of enantiomeric allylamines to the Ir(I) fragment were measured. The ratio of binding affinities is within experimental error of the ratio of rates for formation of the two enantiomeric amine products in the catalytic cycle. The rates of the catalytic reaction are first-order in allylic carbonate, amine, and catalyst and inverse-first order in product. This combination of data, along with the observation that the resting state is stable toward 1.5 equiv of allylic carbonate, implies that the reaction of the iridium(I) species with the allylic carbonate is reversible and endergonic, and that the allyl intermediate reacts with the nucleophile to form product. Finally, the simple synthesis of the metallacyclic iridium ethylene complex gives rise to a single-component, highly active, and enantioselective catalyst for the allylic amination.

In particular, it is unclear what role plasticity versus adaptive evolution plays in enabling exotics to persist under new environmental circumstances in the introduced range. We determined the extent to which native and introduced populations of St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) are genetically differentiated with respect to leaf-level morphological and physiological traits that allow plants to tolerate different climatic conditions. In common gardens in Washington and Spain, and in a greenhouse, we examined clinal variation in percent leaf nitrogen and carbon, leaf δ13C values (as an integrative measure of water use efficiency), specific leaf area (SLA), root and shoot biomass, root/shoot ratio, total leaf area, and leaf area ratio (LAR). As well, we determined whether native European H. perforatum experienced directional selection on leaf-level traits in the introduced range and we compared, across gardens, levels of plasticity in these traits. In field gardens in both Washington and Spain, native populations formed latitudinal clines in percent leaf N. In the greenhouse, native populations formed latitudinal clines in root and shoot biomass and total leaf area, and in the Washington garden only, native populations also exhibited latitudinal clines in percent leaf C and leaf δ13C. Traits that failed to show consistent latitudinal clines instead exhibited significant phenotypic plasticity. Introduced St. John's Wort populations also formed significant or marginally significant latitudinal clines in percent leaf N in Washington and Spain, percent leaf C in Washington, and in root biomass and total leaf area in the greenhouse. In the Washington common garden, there was strong directional selection among European populations for higher percent leaf N and leaf δ13C, but no selection on any other measured trait. The presence of convergent, genetically based latitudinal clines between native and introduced H. perforatum, together with previously published molecular data, suggest that native and exotic genotypes have independently adapted to a broad-scale variation in climate that varies with latitude. © 2007 The Author(s).","Common gardens; Exotic plants; Hypericum perforatum; Latitudinal clines; Phenotypic plasticity; Rapid evolution","carbon; nitrogen; water; biomass; cline; convergent evolution; dicotyledon; ecophysiology; introduced species; leaf area; local adaptation; medicinal plant; phenotypic plasticity; acclimatization; altitude; article; climate; ecosystem; Europe; genetic selection; genotype; growth, development and aging; Hypericum; metabolism; phenotype; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; plant root; United States; Acclimatization; Altitude; Carbon; Carbon Isotopes; Climate; Ecosystem; Europe; Genotype; Hypericum; Nitrogen; Pacific States; Phenotype; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Selection (Genetics); Water; Hypericum perforatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547653226

Nevertheless, knowledge of the effects on zooplankton estuarine communities is still scarce. The present study aimed to examine zooplankton ecology over two contrasting environmental conditions: regular years and extreme dry years, in a shallow temperate southern European estuary, the Mondego Estuary (Portugal). Monthly samples were carried out during three consecutive years: 2003 characterized as a regular temperate year concerning precipitation and river flow, and an extremely dry period during 2004-2005. The spatial and temporal structure of the biological data was evaluated by a three-mode principal component analysis (PCA), which allowed us to distinguish three distinct ecological areas based on their biological composition and their relationship with hydrologic parameters. The severe drought in 2004-2005 was responsible for spatial shifts in the estuary regarding zooplankton community and interannual variability, with an increase in abundance and diversity during the period of low freshwater flow. This freshwater flow regime influenced the composition of the zooplankton community at the most upstream section of Mondego estuary (zone 3), with a replacement of the freshwater community by one predominantly dominated by estuarine organisms. The occurrence of such estuarine community contributed to the increase in zooplankton abundance which is ascribed to the estuarine species Acartia tonsa. The comparison with previous data obtained for this estuarine ecosystem, demonstrated the occurrence of a different scenario at times of high freshwater flow, being defined the existence of two sub-estuarine systems, the north and south arm, presenting the south one the highest values of abundance. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We describe the characteristics of C. neoformans biofilm development using a microtiter plate model, microscopic examinations, and a colorimetric 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5- [(phenylamino) carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium-hydroxide (XTT) reduction assay to observe the metabolic activity of cryptococci within a biofilm. A strong correlation between XTT and CFU assays was demonstrated. Chemical analysis of the exopolymeric material revealed sugar composition consisting predominantly of xylose, mannose, and glucose, indicating the presence of other polysaccharides in addition to glucurunoxylomannan. Biofilm formation was affected by surface support differences, conditioning films on the surface, characteristics of the medium, and properties of the microbial cell. A specific antibody to the capsular polysaccharide of this fungus was used to stain the extracellular polysaccharide matrix of the fungal biofilms using light and confocal microscopy. Additionally, the susceptibility of C. neoformans biofilms and planktonic cells to environmental stress was investigated using XTT reduction and CFU assays. Biofilms were less susceptible to heat, cold, and UV light exposition than their planktonic counterparts. Our findings demonstrate that fungal biofilm formation is dependent on support surface characteristics and that growth in the biofilm state makes fungal cells less susceptible to potential environmental stresses.

This is the first study to show the contribution of constantly applied 13C-labelled maize and wheat exudates to water extractable organic carbon (WEOC), microbial biomass-C (MB-C), and CO 2-C evolution during a 25-day incubation of agricultural soil material. The CO2-C evolution and respective δ13C values were measured daily. The WEOC and MB-C contents were determined weekly and a newly developed method for determining δ13C values in soil extracts was applied. Around 36% of exudate-C of both plants was recovered after the incubation, in the order WEOC &lt; MB-C &lt; CO2-C for maize and MB-C &lt; WEOC &lt; CO2-C for wheat. Around 64% of added exudate-C was not retrieved with the methods used here. Our results suggest that great amounts of exudates became stabilized in non-water extractable organic fractions. The amounts of MB-C stayed relatively constant over time despite a continuous exudate-C supply, which is the prerequisite for a growing microbial population. A lack of mineral nutrients might have limited microbial growth. The CO2-C mineralization rate declined during the incubation and this was probably caused by a shift in the microbial community structure. Consequently, incoming WEOC was left in the soil solution leading to rising WEOC amounts over time. In the exudate-treated soil additional amounts of soil-derived WEOC (up to 110 μg g-1) and MB-C (up to 60 μg g-1) relative to the control were determined. We suggest therefore that positive priming effects (i.e. accelerated turnover of soil organic matter due to the addition of organic substrates) can be explained by exchange processes between charged, soluble C-components and the soil matrix. As a result of this exchange, soil-derived WEOC becomes available for mineralization. © 2007 British Society of Soil Science.",,"agricultural soil; carbon isotope; environmental fate; exudation; maize; microbial activity; mineralization; organic carbon; soil management; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; wheat; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548599832

PCB126 treatment strongly induced CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA expression that was unaffected by co-treatment with E2 (17β-oestradiol). PCB104 failed to induce changes in either CYP1A1 or CYP1B1 expression levels. ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays show that PCB126, but not PCB104, increased the promoter occupancy by ERα to CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 promoters. Co-treatment with PCB126 + E2 significantly enhanced the promoter occupancy of ERα at CYP1A1, whereas co-treatment with PCB126 + 4-hydroxytamoxifen or ICI182.780 did not. Competitive binding studies revealed that neither PCB126 nor PCB104 bound to ERα. HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney-293 cells) stably transfected with ERα showed significantly higher PCB126-induced CYP1A1 expression compared with empty vector controls, whereas no increase was observed in cells stably transfected with ERα lacking its N-terminal AF1 (activation function-1) domain (ERαΔAF1). Despite no increase in AHR-mediated gene expression, ChIP assays revealed that ERαΔAF1 was present at CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 promoters. HC11 mouse mammary cells stably expressing shRNA (small-hairpin RNA) against ERα showed an 8-fold reduction in PCB126-dependent Cyp1a1 expression. Our results provide further evidence that AHR agonists induce ERα promoter occupancy at AHR target genes through indirect activation of ERα, and support a role for ERα in AHR transactivation. © The Authors.","Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) target gene; Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP); Cytochrome P450 (CYP); Oestrogen receptor α (ERα); Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB); Small-hairpin RNA","Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) target genes; Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP); Cytochrome P450 (CYP); Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB); Small-hairpin RNA; Bioassay; Chlorination; Gene expression; Oncology; RNA; Tumors; Hydrocarbons; 2,2'4,6,6' pentachlorinated biphenyl; 3,3',4,4',5 pentachlorinated biphenyl; 4 hydroxytamoxifen; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; biphenyl derivative; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 1B1; estradiol; estrogen receptor alpha; messenger RNA; unclassified drug; article; binding assay; breast cancer; breast cell; cancer cell; chromatin immunoprecipitation; gene expression; gene targeting; genetic transfection; human; human cell; priority journal; protein expression; transactivation; Animals; Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases; Cell Line; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Estradiol; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Ligands; Mice; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; RNA Interference",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548171191

Attainment of biofuel targets depends upon policy and infrastructure development but also on production of suitable raw materials. Production of relevant crops relies on the decisions that farmers make in their economic and political environment. We need to identify any farmer-related barriers to biofuel production and to determine whether novel policy and technology are required to meet targets. These aspects of the emerging biofuel industry are relevant across international barriers and have not yet been addressed quantitatively. We describe a case study from the UK of farmers' intentions toward producing two biofuel crops for which refining capacity either exists or is under construction. Given farmers' intentions, current land use, and conversion efficiency, we estimate potential biofuel production. These estimates indicate that EU targets are not achievable using domestically grown raw materials without policy intervention, use of alternative feedstocks, and either significant improvements in processing efficiency or large-scale changes in land use. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Biofuels; Fossil fuels; Particulate emissions; Public policy; Raw materials; Biofuel production; International barriers; Environmental engineering; biofuel; fossil fuel; Biofuels; Environmental engineering; Fossil fuels; Particulate emissions; Public policy; Raw materials; biofuel; carbon emission; crop production; infrastructural development; land use; land use change; agricultural worker; article; crop production; European Union; land use; policy; United Kingdom; Agriculture; Attitude; Behavior; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Brassica rapa; Crops, Agricultural; Gasoline; Intention; Public Policy; Questionnaires; Saccharum; Statistics, Nonparametric; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548067129

In the current case study, we examine the industrial sector of the greater Athens area under the prism of BATs introduction. The aim of the analysis is to find the mixture of BATs for the entire industrial sector that satisfies as much as possible the economic criteria (expressed by the Net Present Value of the projects) and the environmental criteria (quantified by the emission reduction in major pollutants). The obtained multi-objective optimization problem is addressed using two methods: (1) goal programming and (2) generation of the Pareto optimal solutions using the ε-constraint method, followed by an interactive filtering procedure in order to select the most preferred Pareto optimal solution (BAT mixture).

Amazonia remained predominantly forested at the LGM, although savannas expanded at the margins of the basin. The combination of reduced temperatures, precipitation, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations resulted in forests structurally and floristically quite different from those of today. Evergreen rainforest distribution increased during the glacial-Holocene transition due to ameliorating climatic and CO2 conditions. However, reduced precipitation in the early-mid Holocene (about 8000-3600 years ago) period caused widespread, frequent fires in seasonal southern Amazonia, with increased abundance of drought-tolerant dry forest taxa and savanna in ecotonal areas. Rainforests expanded once again in the late Holocene period as a result of increased precipitation. The plant communities that existed during the early-mid Holocene period may constitute the closest analogues to the kinds of vegetation responses expected from similar increases in temperature and aridity posited for the 21st century. © The Royal Society 2005.

We conducted a field study on a fleet of school buses to evaluate the effects of biodiesel use on gaseous and particulate matter fuel-based emission factors under real-world conditions. The field experiment was carried out in two phases during winter 2004. In January (phase I), emissions from approximately 200 school buses operating on petroleum diesel were measured. Immediately after the end of the first phase measurement period, the buses were switched to a 20% biodiesel blend. Emission factors were measured again in March 2004 (phase II) and compared with the January emission factors. To measure gaseous emission factors we used a commercial gaseous remote sensor. Particulate matter emission factors were determined with a combination of the gaseous remote sensor, a Lidar (light detection and ranging), and transmissometer system developed at the Desert Research Institute of Reno, NV, U.S.A. Particulate matter emissions from school buses significantly increased (up to a factor of 1.8) after the switch from petroleum diesel to a 20% biodiesel blend. The fuel used during this campaign was provided by a local distributor and was independently analyzed at the end of the on-road experiment. The analysis found high concentrations of free glycerin and reduced flash points in the B100 parent fuel. Both measures indicate improper separation and processing of the biodiesel product during production. The biodiesel fuels used in the school buses were not in compliance with the U.S.A. ASTM D6751 biodiesel standard that was finalized in December of 2001. The U.S.A. National Biodiesel Board has formed a voluntary National Biodiesel Accreditation Program for producers and marketers of biodiesel to ensure product quality and compliance with the ASTM standard. The results of our study underline the importance of the program since potential emission benefits from biodiesel may be reduced or even reversed without appropriate fuel quality control on real-world fuels. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Biodiesel blends of 20% produce reductions of 15% or higher (depending upon engine model and test cycle) in emissions of particulate matter, carbon monoxide, total hydrocarbons, and a group of toxic compounds including vapor-phase hydrocarbons from C1 to C12, aldehydes and ketones up to C8, and selected semivolatile and particle-phase PAH and NPAH. Based on the studies reviewed and recently acquired data, individual engines may show oxides of nitrogen increasing or decreasing, but on average there appears to be no net effect for blends of 20% biodiesel - the most common biodiesel blend. Exhaust from a diesel engine operating on 100% biodiesel was also shown to have only modest adverse effects in an animal exposure study. Studies of the impact of biodiesel on particle size have not produced consistent results and additional research in this area is needed. Biodiesel is also shown to significantly reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to petroleum diesel.

Mixtures of non-polar CCl4 with more polar solvents CHCl3, dichloromethane (DCM), and 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) are used to vary the polarity of the organic phase. The OH stretching modes of interfacial water molecules are used to characterize and compare the interactions between water and the different halocarbons in the organic phase. The spectroscopic results show differing degrees of interaction between water and the various halocarbon molecules in the interfacial region as manifested in spectral shifts and intensity changes in the OH stretching modes. The spectral observations indicate that as the organic phase is systematically increased in polarity with the addition of polar halocarbons, the interfacial water molecules display increased bonding interactions with the organic phase. This increased interaction between interfacial water and the interfacial halocarbons leads to a reduction in the strong orientation of interfacial water molecules that is so prevalent for water adjacent to non-polar organic liquids. The results provide important insights into water adjacent to a hydrophobic surface as that surface takes on increasingly polar characteristics.","Hydrogen bonding; Liquid-liquid interfaces; Vibrational sum-frequency spectroscopy; Water at hydrophobic surfaces","Hydrogen bonds; Mixtures; Organic solvents; Spectroscopic analysis; Spectrum analysis; Water; Halocarbon-water interfaces; Hydrophobic surfaces; Polarity; Vibrational sum-frequency spectroscopy; Interfaces (materials)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35648969596

Since the assessment was completed, output from another model has been added to the dataset, so the participation is now 17 groups from 12 countries with 24 models. This effort, as well as the subsequent analysis phase, was organized by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) Working Group on Coupled Models (WGCM) Climate Simulation Panel, and constitutes the third phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3). The dataset is called the WCRP CMIP3 multimodel dataset, and represents the largest and most comprehensive international global coupled climate model experiment and multimodel analysis effort ever attempted. As of March 2007, the Program for Climate Model Diagnostics and Intercomparison (PCMDI) has collected, archived, and served roughly 32 TB of model data. With oversight from the panel, the multimodel data were made openly available from PCMDI for analysis and academic applications. Over 171 TB of data had been downloaded among the more than 1000 registered users to date. Over 200 journal articles, based in part on the dataset, have been published so far. Though initially aimed at the IPCC AR4, this unique and valuable resource will continue to be maintained for at least the next several years. Never before has such an extensive set of climate model simulations been made available to the international climate science community for study. The ready access to the multimodel dataset opens up these types of model analyses to researchers, including students, who previously could not obtain state-of-the-art climate model output, and thus represents a new era in climate change research. As a direct consequence, these ongoing studies are increasing the body of knowledge regarding our understanding of how the climate system currently works, and how it may change in the future. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric movements; Computer simulation; Database systems; Oceanography; Atmospheric-ocean general circulation model; Dataset; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35448939676

Targets with atomic numbers of 6, 12, 28, 40, 50 and 82 were used. It is found that theoretical calculations for atomic electron-capture and stripping cross sections, which have been successful in describing the data up to beam energies of 200 MeV, are also applicable at this higher energy. However, where at the lower energies the stripping cross sections were calculated with a combination of models by Bohr and Gillespie, the best description of the data at E(3He) = 420 MeV is obtained when using only the model by Gillespie. The experimental results are also compared with calculations using the code CHARGE, originally developed for fast, heavy (Z &gt; 29) projectiles, to test the extrapolation to low-Z projectiles. It is found that the code underestimates the production of singly-charged 3He ions, in particular for heavier target nuclei. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, a field experiment was carried out on an irrigated sandy loam soil under Mediterranean conditions during the maize (Zea mays L.) growing season. Untreated pig slurry (UPS) both with and without the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (UPS + DCD), digested thin pig slurry fraction (DTP), composted solid fraction of slurry mixed with urea (CPS + U) and composted municipal solid waste mixed with urea (MSW + U) were applied at a rate of 175 kg available N ha-1. Their emissions were compared with those from urea (U) and a control treatment to which no nitrogen fertilization was administered (Control). Accumulated nitrous oxide losses during the crop season ranged from 6.0 to 9.3 kg N2O-N ha-1 for the Control and CPS + U, respectively, whereas nitric oxide losses ranged from 0.01 to 0.23 kg NO-N ha-1, for the Control and U, respectively. The use of digested slurries mitigated N2O emission by 25% in relation to untreated pig slurry, but NO emissions were similar for both treatments. Dicyandiamide reduced N2O and NO emissions by 64 and 78% with respect to slurry without the inhibitor. An indirect effect of DCD on denitrification was also observed, with a reduction of 32% in denitrification with respect to the slurry without the inhibitor. In this case, the greatest reduction in denitrification losses occurred during the irrigation period. Composts mixed with urea reduced NO emissions by 56% (CPS + U) and 85% (MSW + U) in relation to the urea treatment, but its effect on N2O depended on the type of compost involved: CPS + U increased N2O emission by 27%, whereas MSW + U reduced it by 55% in relation to urea. Denitrification was the most important process responsible for N2O emissions when organic fertilizers were applied to the soil, while nitrification was the most important for the inorganic fertilizer. The C:N ratio of fertilizers was a good predictor of their NO emissions, denitrification losses and N2O/N2 ratio. On the other hand, added soluble N was a good predictor for cumulative N2O emissions during the period before irrigation. This work shows that an appropriate selection of organic fertilizers based on their composition could be used to mitigate emissions of the atmospheric pollutants NO and N2O in comparison with urea. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This technical review explores the continued innovation in wood product processing technologies over the last 30 years to gauge how these advancements have served to underscore and demonstrate the environmental benefits of the industry's products in their traditional use-home building. The paper focuses on three wood products common to both studies-softwood lumber, sheathing plywood, and oriented Strandboard (OSB) - and compares advances in primary wood product production in terms of wood utilization, forest-to-mill gate energy use, and thermal process energy self-sufficiency. Results of this study indicate a marked improvement in wood usage by the softwood lumber industry, while both plywood and OSB have stayed steady despite declining log size and resource quality. Finally, this review puts the last 30 years of advancements in wood product production in perspective by comparing the varying resource and energy use associated with the major structural wood components in a typical single-family home built in North America. Applied across all single-family homes built in the United States, the industry's greater resource utilization, improved energy efficiency, and declining reliance on fossil fuels result in an annual savings of about 10 million barrels of oil, 4.4 million metric tons (9,700 million lbs) of carbon dioxide emissions, and a reduced harvesting level equivalent to 15,000 ha (37,066 acres) of forest. © Forest Products Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Plywood; Environmental benefits; Oriented Strandboard (OSB); Sheathing plywood; Wood product processing technology; Wood products; Carbon Dioxide; Energy; Ply Wood; Wood Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548761861

To evaluate how a warmer climate is likely to alter the snow cover and soil temperature in Scots pine stands of varying ages in northern Sweden, climate scenarios from the Swedish regional climate modelling programme SWECLIM were used to drive a Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT)-model (COUP). Using the two CO2 emission scenarios A and B in the Hadley centres global climate model, HadleyA and HadleyB, SWECLIM predicts that the annual mean air temperature and precipitation will increase at most 4.8°C and 315 mm, respectively, within a century in the study region. The results of this analysis indicate that a warmer climate will shorten the period of persistent snow pack by 73-93 days, increase the average soil temperature by 0.9-1.5°C at 10 cm depth, advance soil warming by 15-19 days in spring and cause more soil freeze-thaw cycles by 31-38%.

We argue that the methodology applied by WHO - the so-called fuel-based approach - underestimates the health effects, and suggest an alternative method. Combining exposure-response functions and current mortality and morbidity rates, we estimate the burden of disease of IAP in China and the impacts of three abatement scenarios. Using linear exposure-response functions, we find that 3.5 [0.8-14.7 95% CI] million people die prematurely due to IAP in China each year. The central estimate constitutes 47% of all deaths in China. We find that modest changes in the use of cooking fuels in rural households might have a large health impact, reducing annual mortality by 0.63 [0.1-3. 2 95% CI] million. If the indoor air quality (IAQ) standard set by the Chinese government (150 μg PM10/m3) was met in all households, we estimate that 0.9 [0.2-4.8] million premature deaths would be avoided in urban areas and 2.8 [0.7-12.4] million in rural areas. However, in urban areas this would require improvements to the outdoor air quality in addition to a complete fuel switch to clean fuels in households. We estimate that a fuel switch in urban China could prevent 0.7 [0.2-4.8] million premature deaths. The methodology for exposure assessment applied here is probably more realistic than the fuel-based approach; however, the use of linear exposure-response relationships most likely tends to overestimate the effects. The discrepancies between our results and the WHO estimates is probably also explained by our use of ""all-cause mortality"" which includes important causes of death like cardiovascular diseases, conditions known to be closely associated with exposure to particulate pollution, whereas the WHO estimate is limited to respiratory diseases. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The first technique is to find all likely sources in a direct image, extract their spectra, and search them for emission lines. The second method is to look for emission-line sources as compact structures in an unsharp masked version of the grism image. Using these methods we identify 46 emission-line targets in the Hubble Deep Field-North using a modest (three-orbit) expenditure of HST observing time. Grism spectroscopy is a powerful tool for efficiently identifying interesting low-luminosity, moderate-redshift emission-line field galaxies. The sources found here have a median i-band (F775W) flux 1.5 mag fainter than the spectroscopic redshift catalog of Cohen et al. They have redshift z ≤ 1.42, and high equivalent widths (typically >100 Å) and are usually less luminous than the characteristic luminosity at the same redshift. The chief obstacle in interpreting the results is line identification, since the majority of sources have a single emission line and the spectral resolution is low. Photometric redshifts are useful for providing a first-guess redshift. However, even at the depth of the state-of-the-art ground-based and HST data used here, photometric errors can result in uncertainties in line identifications, especially for sources with i magnitudes fainter than 24.5 ABmag. Reliable line identification for the faintest emission-line galaxies requires additional ground-based spectroscopy for confirmation. Of particular concern are the faint high-EW [O II] emitters, which could represent a strongly evolving galaxy population if the possibility that they are misidentified lower redshift interlopers can be ruled out. © 2007.

The study is based on empirical data that have been originally collated from international sources for the purpose of modeling region-specific car stock demand. Derived demands serve as indicator of car related fuel consumption and associated CO2 emissions, which are calculated on the basis of behavioral and technological scenarios. The obtained CO2 emission paths are sectoral baseline scenarios that identify region-specific potentials of growth in car induced CO2 emissions assuming that current trends continue to prevail. The study adopts a multi-model approach to car demand by applying two methodologies rooted in the economics of consumption: utility maximization and single equation models. The utility maximization method for modeling car demand is driven by the preferences of the representative consumers of each world region, subject to exogenous price and income trajectories. The latter is adopted from an optimal growth model. This is a novel approach to projecting global regionalized sectoral car demands. The study is complemented by the application of single equation income-consumption models based on logistical Gompertz functions and non-linear regression techniques to compare model results. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Most management-orientated research on invasions focuses on invaders that are already widespread and often have major impacts. This paper deals with ""emerging"" invaders-those alien species with the potential to become important problems without timely intervention. A climate matching procedure was developed to define areas of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland that could be invaded by 28 plant species that had previously been classified as emerging invaders. Information on the location of populations of these species in the study area was combined with information on their distributions (as native or alien) in parts of Australia and the United States of America. These two countries had the best available distribution data for this study. They also share many invasive alien plant species with South Africa. Climatic data obtained for weather stations near points of known occurrence in these countries were used to define the climatically suitable areas for each species in the study area. Almost 80% of the remaining natural environment in southern Africa was found to be vulnerable to invasion by at least one of these species, 50% by six or more and 24% by 16 or more species. The most vulnerable areas are the highveld grasslands and the eastern escarpment. The emerging invaders with the greatest potential range included Acacia podalyriifolia and Cortaderia selloana. The globally important invaders Ulex europaeus and Lythrum salicaria had a more limited invasion potential but could still become major invaders. There was no relationship between the extent of the climatically suitable areas for the different species and an expert ranking of their invasion potential, emphasising the uncertainties inherent in making expert assessments based on very little information.

Increasing dissatisfaction about the results of traditional development cooperation and the appeal of climate policy as a new policy field led to a rapid reorientation of aid flows. At the turn of the century, over 7% of aid flows were spent on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. However, the contribution of emissions mitigation projects to the central development objective of poverty reduction as specified in the Millennium Development Goals is limited and other project types are likely to be much more effective. Adaptation to climate change can be expected to have higher synergies with poverty alleviation than mitigation, primarily through its impact on health, the conservation of arable land and the protection against natural disasters. An analysis of the Clean Development Mechanism shows that projects addressing the poor directly are very rare; even small renewable energy projects in rural areas tend to benefit rich farmers and the urban population. Use of development aid for CDM projects and / or their preparation via capacity building is thus clearly not warranted. We further analyze whether the use of development aid for climate policy could be justified as a countermeasure against the emission increase related to successful development itself. However, countries that are achieving an improvement of human development from a low level are unlikely to increase their energy consumption substantially. Only at a level where the middle class expands rapidly, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions soar. Thus targeting middle class energy consumption by appliance efficiency standards and public transport-friendly urban planning are the most effective measures to address developing country emissions. Rural renewable energy provision in poor countries has a much higher impact on poverty, but a much lower impact on greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that while there are valid reasons for long-term collaboration with emerging economies on greenhouse gas mitigation, there should be a separate budget line for such activities to avoid ""obfuscation"" of a decline of resources aimed at poverty alleviation. Nevertheless, mitigation will remain attractive for donors because it ensures quick disbursements and relatively simple measures of success. Moreover, mitigation activities in developing countries provide politicians in industrialized countries with a welcome strategy to divert the attention of their constituencies from the lack of success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions domestically. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Population statistics; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Development cooperation; Greenhouse gas emissions; Poverty alleviation; Urban population; Climate change; aid flow; clean development mechanism; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; Millenium Development Goal; natural disaster; poverty alleviation; renewable resource; sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547598275

All 14C dating was carried out in the Gliwice Radiocarbon Laboratory, and results are stored in the RoS database. Probability density functions (PDFs) were created by summing up (on the calendar timescale) individual age probability distributions of all dates for different types of material and for different regions of Poland.

The 14C dates were calibrated using the IntCal04 calibration curve (Reimer et al. 2004), and results were compared with other paleoenvironmental records. The authors conclude that analyzing PDFs of different types of sediments can be helpful in the qualitative reconstruction of the past environment.

The Pleistocene climate-related evolutionary history of this region in particular may predispose Namaqualand (and Succulent Karoo) plant endemics to projected climate change impacts. Key Succulent Karoo plant lineages originated during cool Pleistocene times, and projected air temperatures under anthropogenic climate change are likely to exceed these significantly. Projected rainfall patterns are less certain, and projections of the future prevalence of coastal fog are lacking, but if either of these water inputs is reduced in concert with rising temperatures, this seems certain to threaten the persistence of, at least, narrow-endemic plant species. Simple modelling approaches show strong reduction in spatial extent of bioclimates typical of Namaqualand within the next five decades and that both generalist species with large geographic ranges, and narrow-range endemics may be susceptible to climate change induced loss of potential range. Persistence of endemics in micro-habitats that are buffered from extreme climate conditions cannot be discounted, though no attempts have been made to address this shortcoming of broader scale bioclimatic modelling. The few experimental data available on elevated temperature and drought tolerance suggest susceptibility of leaf succulent species, but high drought tolerance of non-succulent shrubs. Both species-level monitoring and further experimental work is essential to test and refine projections of climate change impacts on species persistence, and the implications for conservation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Under a GEF co-financed project, 'The GEFSOC Modelling System' was used to determine SOC stocks and projected stock change rates for four case study areas; The Brazilian Amazon, The Indo-Gangetic Plains of India, Kenya and Jordan. Each case study represented soil and vegetation types, climates and land management systems that are under represented globally, in terms of an understanding of land use and land management systems and the effects these systems have on SOC stocks. The stocks and stock change rates produced were based on detailed geo-referenced datasets of soils, climate, land use and management information. These datasets are unique as they bring together national and regional scale data on the main variables determining SOC, for four contrasting non-temperate eco-regions. They are also unique, as they include information on land management practices used in subsistence agriculture in tropical and arid areas. Implications of a greater understanding of SOC stocks and stock change rates in non-temperate areas are considered. Relevance to national land use plans are explored for each of the four case studies, in terms of sustainability, land degradation and greenhouse gas mitigation potential. Ways in which such information will aid the case study countries in fulfilling obligations under the United Nations Conventions on Climate Change, Biodiversity and Land Degradation are also considered. The need for more detailed land management data to improve SOC stock estimates in non-temperate areas is discussed. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Several effects of nano-anatase TiO2 were observed: (1) the absorption peak intensity of the chloroplast was obviously increased in red and blue region, the ratio of the Soret band and Q band was higher than that of the control; (2) the great enhancement of fluorescence quantum yield near 680 nm of the chloroplast was observed, the quantum yield under excitation wavelength of 480 nm was higher than the excitation wavelength of 440 nm; (3) the excitation peak intensity near 440 and 480 nm of the chloroplast significantly rose under emission wavelength of 680 nm, and F 480/F 440 ratio was reduced; (4) when emission wavelength was at 720 nm, the excitation peaks near 650 and 680 nm were obviously raised, and F 650/F 680 ratio rose; (5) the rate of whole chain electron transport, photochemical activities of PSII DCPIP photoreduction and oxygen evolution were greatly improved, but the photoreduction activities of PSI were a little changed. Together, the studies of the experiments showed that nano-anatase TiO2 could increase absorption of light on spinach chloroplast and promote excitation energy to be absorbed by LHCII and transferred to PSII and improve excitation energy from PSI to be transferred to PSII, thus, promote the conversion from light energy to electron energy and accelerate electron transport, water photolysis, and oxygen evolution. © Humana Press Inc. 2007.","Chloroplast; Energy distribution; Nano-anatase TiO2; Photochemical activity; Spinach","oxygen; titanium dioxide; article; chloroplast; controlled study; electron transport; excitation; fluorescence; light absorption; nonhuman; photochemistry; photolysis; quantum yield; spectral sensitivity; spectroscopy; spinach; Spinacia oleracea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34948823827

Raw gases were sampled in the afterburning chamber, using a specifically designed device, after the heat recovery section and at the stack. Samples of slags from the combustion chamber and fly ashes from the bag filter were also collected and analyzed. PCDD/Fs and PAHs concentrations in exhaust gas after the heat exchanger (200-350 °C) decreased in comparison with the values detected in the afterburning chamber. Pollutant mass balance regarding the heat exchanger did not confirm literature findings about the de novo synthesis of PCDD/Fs in the heat exchange process. In spite of a consistent reduction of PCDD/Fs in the flue gas treatment system (from 77% up to 98%), the limit of 0.1 ng ITEQ Nm-3 at the stack was not accomplished. PCDD/Fs emission factors for air spanned from 2.3 up to 44 μg ITEQ t-1 of burned waste, whereas those through solid residues (mainly fly ashes) were in the range 41-3700 μg ITEQ t-1. Tests run with cemetery wastes generally showed lower PCDD/F emission factors than those with hospital wastes. PAH total emission factors (91-414 μg kg-1 of burned waste) were in the range of values reported for incineration of municipal and industrial wastes. In spite of the observed release from the scrubber, carcinogenic PAHs concentrations at the stack (0.018-0.5 μg Nm-3) were below the Italian limit of 10 μg Nm-3. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Adenosine A1 receptors (A1R) mediate the TGF response and stimulate proximal reabsorption. Methods: Clearance and micropuncture studies were performed in Wistar rats to determine whether blockade of A1R (KW3902 0.3 mg/kg i.v.) would prevent CAI (benzolamide 5 mg/kg i.v.) from lowering GFR, whether CAI and KW3902 exert additive effects on sodium excretion, and to what extent such interactions depend on events in the glomerulus, proximal tubule, or distal nephron. Results: KW3902 raised GFR and prevented CAI from lowering GFR. KW3902 and CAI caused additive diuresis and natriuresis. KW3902 and CAI increased lithium clearance, but their effects were redundant. CAI increased the dependence of proximal reabsorption on active chloride transport. KW3902, alone, did likewise, but to a lesser extent than CAI. Adding KW3902 to CAI lessened the shift toward active chloride transport. Conclusions: The data reveal that A1R mediate glomerular vascular resistance whether or not TGF is activated, that additive effects of CAI and KW3902 on salt excretion occur, in part, because KW3902 inhibits reabsorption downstream from the macula densa, and that KW3902 likely inhibits proximal reabsorption by interfering with apical sodium-hydrogen exchange.

Sediment collected at an experimental site chronically subjected to hydrocarbon inputs was reworked into PVC cores with or without a massive addition of crude Arabian light oil (∼20 g kg-1 dry weight). Cores were reinserted into the sediment and incubated in situ at the sampling site (20 m water depth) for 135 and 503 days. The massive oil contamination induced significant shifts in the structure of the indigenous bacterial communities as shown by ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA). The vertical heterogeneity of the bacterial communities within the sediment was more pronounced in the oiled sediments particularly after 503 days of incubation. Response to oil of the deeper depth communities (8-10 cm) was slower than that of superficial depth communities (0-1 and 2-4 cm). Analysis of the oil composition by gas chromatography revealed a typical microbial alteration of n-alkanes during the experiment. Predominant RISA bands in oiled sediments were affiliated to hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria sequences. In particular, a 395-bp RISA band, which was the dominant band in all the oiled sediments for both incubation times, was closely related to hydrocarbonoclastic sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). These bacteria may have contributed to the main fingerprint changes and to the observed biodegradation of n-alkanes. This study provides useful information on bacterial dynamics in anoxic contaminated infralittoral sediments and highlights the need to assess more precisely the contribution of SRB to bioremediation in oil anoxic contaminated areas. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"bacterial DNA; hydrocarbon; oxygen; petroleum; ribosomal spacer DNA; RNA 16S; article; bacterium; chemistry; classification; DNA sequence; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; genetics; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; Mediterranean Sea; microbiology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; sediment; water pollutant; Bacteria; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal Spacer; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Hydrocarbons; Mediterranean Sea; Molecular Sequence Data; Oxygen; Petroleum; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Water Pollutants; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35448935593

Far-infrared dust emission has a self-similar structure which reveals the complex dynamical processes that shape the interstellar medium. The description of the statistical properties of this emission gives important constraints on the physics of the interstellar medium hut it is also a useful way to estimate the contamination of diffuse interstellar emission in the cases where it is considered a nuisance. Aims. The main goals of this analysis of the power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of far-infrared dust emission are 1) to estimate the power spectrum of interstellar matter density in three dimensions; 2) to review and extend previous estimates of the cirrus noise due to dust emission; and 3) to produce simulated dust emission maps that reproduce the observed statistical properties. Methods. To estimate the statistical properties of dust emission we analyzed the power spectrum and wavelet decomposition of 100 μm IRIS data (an improved version of the IRAS data) over 55% of the sky. The simulation of realistic infrared emission maps is based on modified Gaussian random fields. Results. The main results are the following, 1) The cirrus noise level as a function of brightness has been previously overestimated. It is found to be proportional to 〈I〉 instead of 〈I〉1.5, where 〈I〉 is the local average brightness at 100 μm. This scaling is in accordance with the fact that the brightness fluctuation level observed at a given angular scale on the sky is the sum of fluctuations of increasing amplitude with distance on the line of sight. 2) The spectral index of dust emission at scales between 5 arcmin and 12.5° is 〈γ〉 = -2.9 on average but shows significant variations over the sky. Bright regions have systematically steeper power spectra than diffuse regions. 3) The skewness and kurtosis of brightness fluctuations are high, indicative of strong non-Gaussianity. Unlike the standard deviation of the fluctuations, the skewness and kurtosis do not depend significantly on brightness, except in bright regions (&gt;10 MJy sr-1) where they are systematically higher, probably due to contrasted structures related to star formation activity. 4) Based on our characterization of the 100 μm power spectrum we provide a prescription of the cirrus confusion noise as a function of wavelength and scale. 5) Finally we present a method based on a modification of Gaussian random fields to produce simulations of dust maps which reproduce the power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of interstellar dust emission. © ESO 2007.","Infrared: ISM; ISM: dust, extinction; ISM: structure; Methods: statistical","Computer simulation; Contamination; Infrared radiation; Luminance; Power spectrum; Statistical methods; Gaussian random fields; Infrared emission; Statistical properties; Dust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547283457

The observed concentrations of SO2 were affected dominantly by anthropogenic emissions (for example, manufacturing industries) in source areas, while small fraction of the data (<30%) was affected by large point sources of SO2 (power plant and volcano). Although emission sources of CO in Tokyo are different from those of SO2, the major emission sources of CO and SO2 are colocated, indicating that CO can be used as a tracer of anthropogenic: SO2 emissions in Tokyo. The ratio of SO42- to total sulfur compounds (SOx = SO2 + SO42-) and the remaining fraction of SOx, which is derived as the ratio of the linear regression slope of the SOx-CO correlation, is used as measures for the formation of SO42- and removal of SOx, respectively. Using these parameters, the average formation efficiency of SO42- (i.e., amount of SO42- produced per SO2 emitted from emission sources) are estimated to be 0.18 and 0.03 in the summer and winter periods, respectively. A simple box model was developed to estimate the lifetime of SOx. The lifetime of SOx for the summer period (26 h) is estimated to be about two times longer than that for the winter period (14 h). The seasonal variations of the remaining fraction of SOx estimated formation efficiency of SO42-, and lifetime of SOx are likely due to those of the boundary layer height and photochemical activity (i.e., hydroxyl radical). These results provide useful insights into the formation and removal processes of sulfur compounds exported from an urban area.

The measured limb radiances are inverted to yield vertical profiles of the volume emission rate of energy from the O2 molecule. From these emission rates we subsequently derive the mesospheric ozone concentrations using a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative and kinetic model. Rates of energy deposition due to absorption of ultraviolet radiation in the Hartley band of ozone are also derived, independent of knowledge of the ozone abundance and solar irradiances.

Currently, sulfur is in net surplus on a global basis, and with environmental regulations, greater sulfur recovery from petroleum and gas processing is mandated. The outlook is clear: there will be substantial and growing surpluses in global sulfur supply in the foreseeable future. Sulfur prices are likely to be under pressure, and producers could face substantial and growing disposal fees. Therefore, new markets must be found for sulfur to avoid disposal crises. One potential new market is the production of sulfur-solidified concrete. This is a thermoplastic composite of mineral aggregates bound together with chemically modified sulfur. The product is more durable than Portland cement. There may be monetizeable benefits in reducing greenhouse gas emissions that would enhance the attraction of sulfur solidified cement applications. The main objective of this study is to evaluate experimentally the potential use of sulfur as a solidifying agent for hazardous waste. To achieve this objective, the study reviewed the sulfur concrete literature, analyzed locally produced sulfur, evaluated a number of sulfur polymer modifiers and physical stabilizing agents, designed a set of experiments and evaluated the produced product for its hydro-mechanical-chemical properties. The results indicated that the manufactured sulfur polymer cement is an excellent candidate for: waste management practices such as solidification/stabilization of hazardous waste; barrier systems for landfilling of hazardous waste; and waste water treatment plants. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Compressive strength; Density; Fly ash; Mineral formation; Modified sulfur; Molten sulfur; Monoclinic; Orthorhombic; Sand; Structure; Temperature; Voids","Compressive strength; Environmental regulations; Fly ash; Hazardous materials; Sand; Mineral formation; Modified sulfur; Molten sulfur; Sulfur compounds; cement; compressive strength; fly ash; hazardous waste; landfill; management practice; polymer; recovery; sand; solidification; sulfur; waste disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547798048

Over the years, pollution abatement in Delhi has become an important constituent of state policies. In the past one decade a lot of policies and regulations have been implemented which have had a noticeable effect on pollution levels. In this context, air quality models provide a powerful tool to study the impact of development plans on the expected air pollution levels and thus aid the regulating and planning authorities in decision-making process. In air quality modeling, emissions in the modeling domain at regular interval are one of the most important inputs. From the annual emission data of over a decade (1990-2000), emission inventory is prepared for the megacity Delhi. Four criteria pollutants namely, CO, SO2, PM, and NOx are considered and a gridded emission inventory over Delhi has been prepared taking into account land use pattern, population density, traffic density, industrial areas, etc. A top down approach is used for this purpose. Emission isopleths are drawn and annual emission patterns are discussed mainly for the years 1990, 1996 and 2000. Primary and secondary areas of emission hotspots are identified and emission variations discussed during the study period. Validation of estimated values is desired from the available data. There is a direct relationship of pollution levels and emission strength in a given area. Hence, an attempt has been made to validate the emission inventory for all criteria pollutants by analyzing emissions in various sampling zones with the ambient pollution levels. For validation purpose, the geographical region encompassing the study area (Delhi) has been divided into seven emission zones as per the air quality monitoring stations using Voronoi polygon concept. Dispersion modeling is also used for continuous elevated sources to have the contributing emissions at the ground level to facilitate validation. A good correlation between emission estimates and concentration has been found. Correlation coefficient of 0.82, 0.77, 0.58 and 0.68 for CO, SO2, PM and NOx respectively shows a reasonably satisfactory performance of the present estimates. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.","Criteria pollutants; Emission inventory; Megacity Delhi; Top-down approach; Voronoi polygon","Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Computer simulation; Decision making; Industrial emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Critera pollutants; Emission inventory; Top-down approach; Voronoi polygon; Air pollution; carbon monoxide; nitric oxide; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; megacity; pollution control; pollution policy; top-down approach; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; article; correlation coefficient; decision making; dispersion; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; India; particulate matter; policy; traffic; validation process; Air Pollutants; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; India; Vehicle Emissions; Asia; Delhi; Eurasia; India; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249899925

In many cases these wastes may provide a heating value of 666 kcal/kg (1,200 Btu/lb) and a SO2 emission potential of 0.027 g/kcal (15 lbs/mBtu). By utilizing physical separation technologies, these fine wastes can be turned at minimal cost into a feed stock for the combustion coupled gasification (CCG) technology, which can treat materials with heating values as low as 2,220 kcal/kg (4,000 Btu/lb) on an as-fired basis. Unlike conventional power plants, these CCG-based power plants are economically viable in small scale (5 to 10 megawatts), which makes them suitable for mine-mouth applications. This study has experimentally evaluated three alternative fine waste-coal processing flowsheets at a throughput capacity of more than 2 t/h (2.2 stph) at the Illinois Coal Development Park. Particular emphasis was given to minimize the sulfur content of the product to reduce the extent of post-combustion sulfur cleaning, which is more cost intensive than the precombustion physical cleaning methods. The following circuits were evaluated: a Falcon enhanced gravity separator and a Decanter screen-bowl centrifuge combination, a Falcon enhanced gravity separator and a Krebs gMax cyclone combination and a Decanter screen-bowl centrifuge alone. The screen-bowl centrifuge alone was able to meet the product requirement of a heating value of more than 2,220 kcal/kg (4,000 Btu/lb) on an as-fired basis; however, the SO2 emission potential of the product was as high as 0.0324 g/kcal (18 lbs/mBtu). The enhanced gravity separator and screen-bowl centrifuge circuit reduced the SO2 emission potential to nearly 0.0144 g/cal (8 lbs /mBtu) while achieving the required heating value. The maximum heating value produced from the enhanced gravity separator and cyclone circuit was lower than the required level for the particular waste coal tested in this investigation.",,"Centrifuges; Coal preparation; Energy conversion; Feedstocks; Industrial wastes; Separation; centrifuge; coal processing; coal production; coal-fired power plant; combustion; experimental study; sulfur emission; Falconidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35448951328

Strategies and incentives for reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) have emerged as one of the most active areas in the international climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). While the current negotiations focus on a REDD mechanism in developing countries, it should be recognized that risks of carbon losses from forests occur in all climate zones and also in industrialized countries. A future climate change agreement would be more effective if it included all carbon losses and gains from land use in all countries and climate zones. The REDD mechanism will be an important step towards reducing emissions from land use change in developing countries, but needs to be followed by steps in other land use systems and regions. A national approach to REDD and significant coverage globally are needed to deal with the risk that deforestation and degradation activities are displaced rather than avoided. Favourable institutional and governance conditions need to be established that guarantee in the long-term a stable incentive and control system for maintaining forest carbon stocks. Ambitious emission reductions from deforestation and forest degradation need sustained financial incentives, which go beyond positive incentives for reduced emissions but also give incentives for sustainable forest management. Current data limitations need - and can be - overcome in the coming years to allow accurate accounting of reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation. A proper application of the conservativeness approach in the REDD context could allow a simplified reporting of emissions from deforestation in a first phase, consistent with the already agreed UNFCCC reporting principles. © IOP Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Deforestation; Forest degradation; Kyoto Protocol","Carbon; Climate change; Developing countries; Emission control; Environmental impact; Environmental regulations; Global warming; International cooperation; Land use; Anthropogenic emissions; Degradation activity; Financial incentives; Forest degradation; Industrialized countries; KYOTO protocol; Sustainable forest management; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Deforestation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37649011578

One of the key inputs to these models is the emission of isoprene from forest ecosystems. Most models in current use rely on a scheme by which global change is coupled to changes in terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) which, in turn, is coupled to changes in the magnitude of isoprene emissions. In this study, we conducted measurements of isoprene emissions at three prominent global change experiments in the United States. Our results showed that growth in an atmosphere of elevated CO2 inhibited the emission of isoprene at levels that completely compensate for possible increases in emission due to increases in aboveground NPP. Exposure to a prolonged drought caused leaves to increase their isoprene emissions despite reductions in photosynthesis, and presumably NPP. Thus, the current generation of models intended to predict the response of isoprene emission to future global change probably contain large errors. A framework is offered as a foundation for constructing new isoprene emission models based on the responses of leaf biochemistry to future climate change and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations. © 2007 The Royal Society.","2-methyl-1,3-butadiene; Air pollution; Hydrocarbon; Net primary productivity; Volatile organic compound",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547266359

The stratification is intensified at upper levels in the western and central equatorial Pacific during periods of high ENSO amplitude. Furthermore, changes in equatorial stratification are connected with subsurface temperature anomalies originating from the central south tropical Pacific. The correlation analysis of ocean temperature anomalies against an index for the ENSO modulation supports the hypothesis of the existence of an oceanic ""tunnel"" that connects the south tropical Pacific to the equatorial wave guide. Further analysis of the wind stress projection coefficient onto the oceanic baroclinic modes suggests that the low frequency modulation of ENSO amplitude is associated with a significant contribution of higher-order modes in the western and central equatorial Pacific. In the light of these results, we suggest that, in the CGCM, change in the baroclinic mode energy distribution associated with low frequency ENSO amplitude modulation have its source in the central south tropical Pacific. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,"amplitude; atmosphere-ocean coupling; baroclinic mode; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; general circulation model; ocean wave; stratification; temperature anomaly; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Equatorial); Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248550566

Our previous works showed a prevalence of agglutinated species in the inner estuary and tidal marsh and significant abundance of calcareous species only in the estuary mouth. The new results clarify syndepositional aspects of the calcareous species related to calcite dissolution, such as thin tests that frequently lack the carbonate layer and show typical destruction features. Sites from the estuary mouth, tidal marsh and river were sampled, under Spring and Autumn conditions, in order to describe physical-chemical features and to allow the geochemical modelling of the solution in which calcification occurs. In particular, the chemical equilibrium regarding calcite was evaluated from the saturation index (SI). Such modelling suggests strongly undersaturated conditions at the majority of the sampling sites, in both sampling periods. The water quality data revealed strong spatial and temporal variability, mainly in the tidal marsh environment, and also the existence of a stressed medium regarding calcite saturation state.

Depending on the materials, the type of operation and the meteorological scenarios, these activities may have an impact on the levels of ambient air PM around harbour areas. Moreover, air quality at harbours may be affected by nearby urban and industrial emissions. The aim of this work is to compile an inventory of the main characteristics (chemical, morphological, mineralogical and grain size parameters) of the bulk cargo materials and of the material emitted during different port operations for possible use as tracers of the fugitive PM emission sources. For all cases, the tracer characteristics determined for each bulk material were also identified in the corresponding PM material emitted. This inventory could assist the harbour authorities to identify the origin of high PM events recorded by air quality monitoring networks in harbour areas, and could also help modellers to predict the impact of harbour activities on ambient PM levels. The harbour of Tarragona (north-east Spain) was selected for this study given the high volume of solids in bulk handled. To this end, 12 handling operations of selected materials (clinker, phosphate, pyrite ash, Mn mineral, fine Si-Mn, coke (coal), bituminous coal, tapioca, soybean, alfalfa, corn, andalusite) were selected for the characterisation of suspended and deposited PM. In spite of the coarse grain size distribution of these bulk cargo materials, with a very low % in the fraction <10 μm, manipulation of these materials during harbour operations may result in high emissions of PM10 with relatively high levels of potential toxic elements. Furthermore, ambient PM10 in the area with the highest traffic density of the harbour was also sampled and characterised. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike the warm season forage grasses they are displacing, woody plants have a photosynthetic metabolism and carbon allocation patterns that are responsive to CO2, and many have tap roots that are more effective than grasses for reaching deep soil water stores that can be enhanced under elevated CO2. However, this commonly cited hypothesis has little direct support from manipulative experimentation and competes with more traditional theories of shrub encroachment involving climate change, management, and fire. Here, we show that, although doubling [CO2] over the Colorado shortgrass steppe had little impact on plant species diversity, it resulted in an increasingly dissimilar plant community over the 5-year experiment compared with plots maintained at present-day [CO2]. Growth at the doubled [CO2] resulted in an ≈40-fold increase in aboveground biomass and a 20-fold increase in plant cover of Artemisia frigida Willd, a common subshrub of some North American and Asian grasslands. This CO2-induced enhancement of plant growth, among the highest yet reported, provides evidence from a native grassland suggesting that rising atmospheric [CO2] may be contributing to the shrubland expansions of the past 200 years. Encroachment of shrubs into grasslands is an important problem facing rangeland managers and ranchers; this process replaces grasses, the preferred forage of domestic livestock, with species that are unsuitable for domestic livestock grazing. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","C3; C4; Functional group; Global change; Semiarid grassland","carbon dioxide; Artemisia; Artemisia frigida; article; atmosphere; biomass; carbon allocation; carbon dioxide tension; community structure; domestic animal; enrichment culture; experimentation; forage; grass; grassland; grazing management; livestock; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant growth; priority journal; shortgrass steppe; soil analysis; species diversity; statistical analysis; Artemisia; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Colorado; Desert Climate; Ecosystem; Poaceae; Seasons; Species Specificity; Artemisia frigida; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35548954680

While transportation energy is an important consideration, the focus of this paper is on electric power. Today, the United States generates just over half of its electric power from coal. The average size-weighted age of the fleet of U.S. coal plants is 35 y, and many will have to be replaced in the next few years. If that capacity were to be replaced with new conventional coal plants, it would commit the nation (and the world) to many more decades of high carbon-dioxide emissions, or it would make the cost of meeting a future carbon-dioxide emission constraint much higher than it needs to be. A range of low- and no-carbon energy technologies offers great potential to create a portfolio of options that can dramatically reduce emissions. A few of the advantages and disadvantages of these technologies are discussed. Policy and regulatory advances that will be needed to move the energy system to a low-carbon future are identified. ©2007 Health Physics Society.","Coal; Emissions, atmospheric; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; Safety standards","carbon; coal; air pollutant; energy resource; greenhouse gas; nuclear energy; nuclear reactor; nuclear safety; policy; power supply; priority journal; review; technology; United States; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Coal; Electric Power Supplies; Greenhouse Effect; Nuclear Energy; Power Plants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37349067399

We retrospectively analysed clinical profile and seizure outcome in a consecutive series of six patients, paying special attention to pathophysiologic conditions in the ipsilateral hippocampus. Long-term video electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring showed attenuation of background activity, followed by ictal discharges in the ipsilateral temporal region in five cases. 18Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in five cases showed hypometabolism in the ipsilateral medial temporal lobe. Intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) after removal of the tumor revealed frequent paroxysmal activity or electrographic seizure activity on the hippocampus in five cases. A high incidence of hippocampal pathology, such as hippocampal sclerosis in four cases and dysgenesis in one case, was demonstrated. Five patients who underwent additional hippocampectomy along with resection of the tumor became completely seizure-free. Our findings indicated a proclivity for the epileptogenic zone to encompass the medial structures and for hippocampal pathology to be present even when no direct medial tumor involvement was identified. Thus, it is conceivable that removal of the hippocampus with the guidance of pre- and intraoperative multimodal examinations, in addition to resection of the tumor, may be recommended to achieve 'complete' freedom from seizures. © 2007 W.

Plant function is inextricably linked to climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. On the shortest and smallest scales, the climate affects the plant's immediate environment and so directly influences physiological processes. At larger scales, the climate influences species distribution and community composition, as well as the viability of different crops in managed ecosystems. Plant growth also influences the local, regional and global climate, through the exchanges of energy and gases between the plants and the air around them. Plant Growth and Climate Change examines the major aspects of how anthropogenic climate change affects plants, focusing on several key determinants of plant growth: atmospheric CO2, temperature, water availability and the interactions between these factors. The book demonstrates the variety of techniques used across plant science: detailed physiology in controlled environments; observational studies based on long-term data sets; field manipulation experiments and modelling.

LP modeling allows interplay between regionally specific switchgrass production forecasts, coal plant locations, and individual coal plant historic performance data to determine an allocation of switchgrass minimizing cost or maximizing carbon reduction. The LP methodology is applied to two states, Pennsylvania (PA) and Iowa (IA), and results are presented with a discussion of modeling assumptions, techniques, and carbon mitigation policy implications. The LP methodology estimates that, in PA, 4.9 million tons of CO2/year could be mitigated at an average cost of less than $34/ton of CO2 and that, in IA, 7 million tons of CO2/year could be mitigated at an average Cost of Mitigation of $27/ton of CO2. Because the factors determining the cofiring costs vary so much between the two states, results suggest that cofiring costs will also vary considerably between different U.S. regions.

Hydrogen sulphide presence in produced oil and gas results in operational, environmental and treatment problems. Therefore, understanding the origin and the amount of hydrogen sulphide in petroleum reservoirs has great importance for petroleum engineers. Three natural processes are set forth to explain the generation of H2S in reservoirs: bacterial sulphate reduction, thermal cracking and thermochemical sulphate reduction (TSR). It is the TSR that leads to the largest amount of H2S. This phenomenon involves hydrocarbon oxidation and sulphate reduction and produces as by-products, hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide, carbonate minerals and heavy organo-sulphur compounds. The reaction mechanisms of TSR, as well as its kinetics, are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we checked the thermodynamic feasibility of TSR, at temperatures prevailing in the reservoirs where TSR is encountered. Firstly, we calculated the Gibbs energy of the reactions proposed by Worden and Smalley (Worden R.H. and Smalley P.C., 1996, H2S producing reactions in deep carbonate gas reservoirs: Khuff Formation, Abu Dhabi, Chem. Geol., 133, p. 157-171). We concluded that they are thermodynamically possible from 25 °C, confirming thermodynamic data published by Anisimov (Anisimov L., 1978, Conditions of abiogenic reduction of sulfates in oil and gas bearing basins, Geochem. Int., 15, p. 63) and Yue and co-workers (Yue C., Li S., Ding K., Zhong N., 2003, Study of thermodynamics and kinetics of CH4-CaSO4 and H2S-Fe2O3 systems, Chinese J. chem. Eng., 11, (6), p.696-700., Yue C., Li S., Ding K., Zhong N., 2006, Thermodynamics and kinetics of reaction between C1-C3 hydrocarbons and calcium sulfate in deep carbonate reservoirs, Geochem. J., 40, 87-94). Secondly, we used a non-stoichiometric approach without any pre-requisite chemical scheme this time. We calculated the Gibbs Energy of chemical systems composed by hydrocarbons, sulphur, anhydrite and water. The minimization of the Gibbs Energy lead to find the most probable chemical systems at steady state. Our theoretical results are consistent with the chemical schemes set forth for TSR by Orr (Orr W., 1977, Changes in Sulfur Content and Isotopic Ratios of Sulfur during Petroleum Maturation - study of Big Horn Basin Paleozoic Oils, in R. Campo and J. Goni Eds, Advances in onorganic geochemistry, Madrid Spain, Enadimsa, p. 571-595), by Worden and Smalley (Worden R.H. and Smalley P.C., 1996, H2S producing reactions in deep carbonate gas reservoirs: Khuff Formation, Abu Dhabi, Chem.

Key factors which were perceived to inhibit the implementation of appropriate drought adaptation strategies are the lack of local capacity and the low financial resource base to cover the capital and running costs of most of the strategies. With the likelihood of increased future rainfall variability, it is important that planners and decision-makers take into account the effects of climate change and variability on water resources.

It links the latest advances in molecular genetics, climate research, and archaeology to give a new perspective on the evolution of agriculture and complex human societies across the world. Even today, our technologically advanced societies still rely on plants for basic food needs, not to mention clothing, shelter, medicines, and tools. This special relationship has tied together people and their chosen plants in mutual dependence for well over 50,000 years. Yet despite these millennia of intimate contact, people have only domesticated and cultivated a few dozen of the tens of thousands of edible plants. Crop domestication and agriculture then led directly to the evolution of the complex urban-based societies that have dominated much of human development over the past ten millennia. Thanks to the latest genomic studies, how, when, and where some of the most important crops came to be domesticated can now be explained, and the crucial roles of plant genetics, climatic change, and social organization in these processes. Indeed, it was their unique genetic organizations that ultimately determined which plants eventually became crops, rather than any conscious decisions by their human cultivators. © Oxford University Press, 2007.

While toxic effects have been ascribed individually to these and other pollutants in the air, it is clear that mixtures of these contaminants have the potential to interact and thereby influence their overall toxic outcomes. It follows that a more comprehensive assessment of the potential health effects of the air pollution complex might better protect human health; however, traditional regulatory drivers and funding constraints have impeded progress to such a goal. Despite difficulties in empirically conducting studies of complex mixtures of air pollutants and acquiring relevant exposure data, there remains a need to develop integrated, interdisciplinary research and analytical strategies to provide more comprehensive (and relevant) assessments of associated health outcomes and risks. The research and assessment communities are endeavoring to dissect this complexity using varied approaches Here we present five interdisciplinary perspectives of this evolving line of thought among researchers and those who use such data in assessment: (1) analyses that coordinate air quality-health analyses utilizing representative polluted U.S. air sheds to apportion source and component-specific health risks; (2) novel approaches to characterize air quality in terms of emission sources and how emission reduction strategies might effectively impact pollutant levels; (3) insights from present-day studies of effects of single ambient pollutants in animal and controlled clinical toxicology studies and how these are evolving to address air pollution; (4) refinements in epidemiologic health assessments that take advantage of the complexities of existent air quality conditions; and (5) new approaches to integrative analyses to establish the criteria for regulation of PM and other criteria pollutants. As these examples illustrate, implementing multidisciplined and integrative strategies offer the promise of more realistic and relevant science, greater reductions in uncertainty, and improved overall air pollution assessment. The regulatory mandate may lag behind the science, but real gains both in public health benefit and the science to dissect complex problems will result. © The Author 2007.

The Home Appliance Recycling Law (hereunder referred to as the Law) for used cathode ray tube (CRT) TVs, air conditioners, refrigerators and washing machines was enacted in April 2001 in Japan. The Law requires that retailers reclaim, and manufacturers and importers recycle such home appliances. Consumers are required to pay collection and recycling fees incurred in disposing of any of the four home appliances. Home appliances must, as a general rule, be managed in accordance with the Law. In reality, other routes exist, such as via local authorities, scrap processors, illegal dumping and exporting. At about the time the Law was enacted, the refrigerant used for air conditioners and refrigerators was replaced by more environmentally friendly substances such as isobutene. Local authorities had the responsibility of disposing of the appliances of households before the enactment of the Law. It was general practice for local authorities to dispose of home appliances in landfills after breaking them up and recovering valuable resources such as iron, copper and aluminum. Although they made efforts to recover refrigerant fluorocarbons, there were not required to do so. Materials and Methods. This study analyzed the material flow resulting from the Law and other processing flows to quantify the global warming effect caused by home appliance recycling using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. To evaluate the Law and to develop policy planning, the challenges of future efforts will be considered using time series data. For these reasons, we have assessed the Project Scenario, which corresponded to the present reality; the Baseline Scenario, which assumed that measures such as the Law were not implemented after 2000, and the Ideal Scenario, where all used products were recycled as prescribed by the Law. The environmental impacts for each scenario were estimated using value, which was obtained from multiplying the amount of reproduction and waste treatment by each inventory data. Results. It is estimated that emission reductions of 4.7E+4 t CO2e, subtracted the Project Scenario from the Baseline Scenario, were reduced for TVs in 2001 through recycling. The impact from recycling glass from cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions is significant. An improvement of 2.3E+4 t CO2e could be anticipated by upgrading to the Ideal Scenario in 2001. It was estimated that there was a reduction of 9.2E+5 t CO2e in 2001 for air conditioners. Although the effect of the recovery for refrigerants contributed greatly, some fluorocarbons that are still discharged have had a considerable impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Hypothetically, a reduction of 3.2E+6 t CO2e could be anticipated with the Ideal Scenario in 2001. A reduction of 2.6E+6 t CO2e was achieved for refrigerators in 2001. Although a further reduction can be anticipated through the Ideal Scenario, there will not be much difference with the Project Scenario by 2010. It was estimated that 3.8E+4 t CO2e were reduced for washing machines in 2001. Only a small improvement can be expected through the Ideal Scenario. Discussion. Since many assumptions were used in this study, a sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to grasp their impact. The findings of the sensitivity analysis are that the uncertainties are large, but the number of the greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions is still clear except for the difference between the Project Scenario and the Ideal Scenario for TVs. This analysis gives authenticity to the findings. Conclusions. Establishing a system for liquid crystal display and plasma display panel TVs is desirable because the absolute amount of used LCD/PDP TVs will rapidly increase as the usage of CRT TVs rapidly decreases from 2007. With regard to refrigerant recovery from air conditioners, a significant decrease in GHG emissions has been recorded. There is, however, still ample room for improvement. It will be necessary to switch to refrigerants with low global warming potentials (GWPs) or work more on improving the recovery rate in the future. Alternatives and recovery of fluorocarbons from refrigerators contributed greatly to GHG reductions. The GHG emissions from refrigerator recycling will be minimal whether used refrigerator will be processed legally or not because most used refrigerators will contain natural refrigerants in the near future. The improvement for washing machines was low because it was assumed that their main constituent steel has been previously recycled, and that the plastic recycling rate will not change significantly in the future. An improvement in the recycling technology itself is required. This study was carried out on four home appliance products, and it was found that the Home Appliance Recycling Law has brought significant reductions in GHG emissions. There is also room to make GHG reductions through improving the processing methods further. Recommendations and Perspectives. The impact on GHG emissions by fluorocarbons of air conditioners and refrigerators is the greatest. Adequate measures are particularly required for air conditioners that may continue to discharge GHGs in the future. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Huthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Air conditioner; Green house gases; Home appliance; LCA(Life Cycle Assessment); Policy evaluation; Policy planning; Recycling, refrigerator; Televisions; Time series data; Washing machine","aluminum; carbon dioxide; copper; fluorocarbon; iron; article; environmental impact; general practice; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; health care planning; health care policy; law enforcement; life cycle assessment; mathematical computing; priority journal; recycling; refrigerator; sensitivity analysis; television; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930475244

Despite sustained interest in this topic, little information is available concerning the environmental distributions of the compounds. In this study, a new method was developed for the analysis of 10 target PFCs and its performance was examined in a systematic evaluation of surface water in the Cape Fear River Basin in North Carolina. One hundred samples from 80 different locations were collected during the spring of 2006. Detectable levels of the target PFCs were found in all samples, and were comparable to values reported previously, with maximum PFOS at 132 ng/L, PFOA at 287 ng/L, perfluorononanoic acid (C9) at 194 ng/L, and perfluoroheptanoic acid (C7) at 329 ng/L.

The limited number of available studies suggests that significant reductions in CO2 emissions can be obtained and that prescribed burning can be a viable option for mitigating emissions in fire-prone countries. The present analysis shows that the potential reduction attained by prescribed burning as a percentage of the reduction in emissions required by the Kyoto Protocol varies from country to country. Out of the 33 European countries investigated, only in one the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol could potentially be achieved by applying prescribed burning, while three other nations showed a potential net CO2 emissions reduction of about 4-8% of the Kyoto requirements and the majority showed a reduction of less than 2%. This implies that prescribed burning can only make a significant contribution in those countries with high wildland fire occurrence. Over a 5-year period the emissions from wildfires in the European region were estimated to be approximately 11 million tonnes of CO2 per year, while with prescribed burning application this was estimated to be 6 million tonnes, a potential reduction of almost 50%. This means that for countries in the Mediterranean region it may be worthwhile to account for the reduction in emissions obtained when such techniques are applied. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We refute this contention by presenting arguments, data, and model results, overlooked by these authors. Our analysis indicates that oyster populations living on extensive reefs along the flanks of the mainstem Bay could substantially reduce summer phytoplankton growth and particulate organic carbon deposition to deep waters of the central channel. Because hypoxia in these deep waters is maintained through microbial decomposition of organic carbon generated by summer phytoplankton production, we conclude that reduced carbon fluxes to the deep channel associated with greatly increased oyster grazing could reduce the severity of hypoxia. © Inter-Research 2007.","Algal blooms; Biodeposition; Chesapeake Bay; Crassostrea virginica; Hypoxia; Oyster; Restoration; Suspension-feeder; Water quality","algal bloom; deep water; growth rate; hypoxia; particulate organic carbon; phytoplankton; top-down control; water quality; Chesapeake Bay; North America; United States; algae; Crassostrea virginica; Ostreidae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547589262

Plant material decomposition, organic carbon assimilation by the soil microbial biomass and soil inorganic N dynamics were studied with 13C labelled wheat straw and young rye. The genetic structure of the community in each soil zone were compared between residue locations and type by applying B- and F-ARISA (for bacterial- and fungal-automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis) directly to DNA extracts from these different zones at 50% decomposition of each residue. Both location and biochemical quality affected residue decomposition in soil: 21% of incorporated 13C wheat straw and 23% left at the soil surface remained undecomposed at the end of incubation, the corresponding values for 13C rye being 1% and 8%. Residue decomposition induced a gradient of microbial activity with more labelled C incorporated into the microbial biomass of the detritusphere. The sphere of influence of the decomposing residues on the dynamics of soluble organic C and inorganic N in the different soil zones showed particular patterns which were influenced by both residue location and quality. Residue degradation stimulated particular genetic structure of microbial community with a gradient from residue to bulk soil, and more pronounced spatial heterogeneity for fungal than for bacterial communities. The initial residue quality strongly affected the resulting spatial heterogeneity of bacteria, with a significance between-zone discrimination for rye but weak discrimination between the detritusphere and bulk soil, for wheat straw. Comparison of the different detrituspheres and residue zones (corresponding to different residue type and location), indicated that the genetic structure of the bacterial and fungal communities were specific to a residue type for detritusphere and to its location for residue, leading to conclude that the detritusphere and residue corresponded to distinct trophic and functional niches for microorganisms. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The deduced amino acid sequences of minke whale CYP2C78, 2E1, 3A72, 4A35 and 4V6 showed high identities with cattle CYP2C86 (83%), pig CYP2E1 (85%), sheep CYP3A24 (82%), pig CYP4A21 (80%), and human CYP4V2 (76%), respectively. To investigate whether or not these CYP expression levels are altered by contamination of organochlorine contaminants (OCs), mRNA levels of these CYPs in the liver of common minke whale were measured using a quantitative real-time RT-PCR method, and the quantified mRNA levels were employed for the statistical analysis with the residue levels of OCs including PCBs, DDTs (p,p′-DDT, p,p′-DDD and p,p′-DDE), chlordanes (cis-chlordane, trans-chlordane, cis-nonachlor, trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane), HCHs (α-, β- and γ-isomers) and hexachlorobenzene that have already been reported elsewhere. Spearman's rank correlation analyses showed no significant correlation between CYP expression levels and each OC level in the common minke whale liver, implying that these environmental chemicals have no potential to alter the expression levels of these CYPs or the residue levels encountered in the whale livers may not reach their transcriptional regulation levels. This suggests that the expression of individual CYPs in the whale liver may be at basal level. Relationships among hepatic mRNA expression levels of these CYP2-4 isozymes together with CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 were also examined. Significant positive correlations were detected among mRNA expression levels of individual CYP isozymes in most cases. These associations indicate that the transcriptional regulation of these CYPs examined in this study may be reciprocally related. CYP1A1 levels showed a positive correlation with CYP1A2 levels (r = 0.64, p < 0.01) indicating that both CYP isozymes were regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor activated by endogenous ligands. A strong positive correlation between CYP2C78 and 3A72 (r = 0.90, p < 0.001) suggests that expression of these CYP isozymes may be under a regulation mechanism of cross-talk in which specific nuclear receptors such as constitutive androstane receptor and pregnane X receptor are involved.

Factorially manipulating grassland plant species diversity and atmospheric CO2 concentrations for five years, we tested whether high diversity or elevated CO2 sustain larger or more active soil communities, affect soil aggregation, water dynamics, or nutrient cycling, and whether plant diversity and elevated CO2 interact. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pools, symbiotic N2 fixation, plant litter quality, soil moisture, soil physical structure, soil nematode, collembola and acari communities, soil microbial biomass and microflora community structure (phospholipid fatty acid [PLFA] profiles), soil enzyme activities, and rates of C fluxes to soils were measured. No increases in soil C fluxes or the biomass, number, or activity of soil organisms were detected at high plant diversity; soil H2O and aggregation remained unaltered. Elevated CO2 affected the ecosystem primarily by improving plant and soil water status by reducing leaf conductance, whereas changes in C cycling appeared to be of subordinate importance. Slowed-down soil drying cycles resulted in lower soil aggregation under elevated CO2. Collembola benefited from extra soil moisture under elevated CO2, whereas other faunal groups did not respond. Diversity effects and interactions with elevated CO2 may have been absent because soil responses were mainly driven by community-level processes such as rates of organic C input and water use; these drivers were not changed by plant diversity manipulations, possibly because our species diversity gradient did not extend below five species and because functional type composition remained unaltered. Our findings demonstrate that global change can affect soil aggregation, and we advocate that soil aggregation should be considered as a dynamic property that may respond to environmental changes and feed back on other ecosystem functions. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","15N isotope dilution; Biodiversity; Bromus erectus; Carbon isotopes; CO2 X H2O interactions; Global change; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Soil aggregation; Soil enzymes","carbon; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; phosphorus; water; carbon dioxide; grassland; insect; nematode; nutrient cycling; soil aggregate; soil biota; soil moisture; soil property; species diversity; article; biodiversity; biomass; ecosystem; metabolism; microbiology; oxygen consumption; parasitology; plant; soil; species difference; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Oxygen Consumption; Phosphorus; Plants; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Species Specificity; Water; Acari; Bromus; Bromus erectus; Collembola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40449119528

To quantify the mortality burden attributed to urban outdoor air pollution in South Africa in 2000. Design. The study followed comparative risk assessment (CRA) methodology developed by the World Heath Organization (WHO). In most urban areas, annual mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with diameters less than 10 μum (PM10) from monitoring network data and PM with diameters less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) derived using a ratio method were weighted according to population size. PM10 and PM2.5 data from air-quality assessment studies in areas not covered by the network were also included. Population-attributable fractions calculated using risk coefficients presented in the WHO study were weighted by the proportion of the total population (33%) in urban environments, and applied to revised estimates of deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) for South Africa in 2000. Setting. South Africa. Subjects. Children under 5 years and adults 30 years and older. Outcome measures. Mortality and YLLs from lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease in adults (30 years and older), and from acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in children aged 0 - 4 years. Results. Outdoor air pollution in urban areas in South Africa was estimated to cause 3.7% of the national mortality from cardiopulmonary disease and 5.1% of mortality attributable to cancers of the trachea, bronchus and lung in adults aged 30 years and older, and 1.1% of mortality from ARIs in children under 5 years of age. This amounts to 4 637 or 0.9% (95% uncertainty interval 0.3 - 1.5%) of all deaths and about 42 000 YLLs, or 0.4% (95% uncertainty interval 0.1 - 0.7%) of all YLLs in persons in South Africa in 2000. Conclusion. Urban air pollution has under-recognised public health impacts in South Africa.

Kenya region. Land use and climate change may pose additional challenges to water management in the future. In order to assess the impacts of environmental change, the NRM3 Streamflow Model, a simple, semi-distributed, grid-based water balance model, is evaluated as a tool for discharge prediction in six meso-scale catchments on the western slopes of Mt. Kenya, and used to analyse the impact of land use and climate change scenarios on water resources. The calibration and validation results show an acceptable performance of the NRM3 Streamflow Model in simulating discharge. Input data represent the main limitation. Rainfall patterns in the mountainous catchments are very heterogeneous and difficult to capture with the monitoring network. River water abstractions make up 80-100% of naturalized dry season discharge, but amounts can only be approximately estimated. Under the scenarios of land use and climate change examined, the total amount as well as the variability of discharge will increase: Conversion of the forest area to crop- or grassland will increase annual runoff by 11% or 59%, respectively, by mainly increasing flood flows and, under cropland, slightly reducing low flows. Climate change as projected by the IPCC Task Group on Scenarios for Impact Assessment [IPCC-TCGIA, 1999. Guidelines in the use of data for climate impact and adaptation assessment. Version 1. Prepared by Carter, T.R., Hulme, M.., Lal, M., Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Task Group on Scenarios for Climate Impact Assessment.] will result in an increase of annual runoff by 26%, with a severe increase in flood flows, and a reduction of the lowest flows to about a tenth of the current value. © 2007.","Climate change; Land use; Simulation; Tropical Africa; Water resources","Approximation theory; Calibration; Catchments; Climate change; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Flood control; Rain; Runoff; Stream flow; River water abstractions; Season discharge; Tropical Africa; Water management; Approximation theory; Calibration; Catchments; Climate change; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Flood control; Rain; Runoff; Stream flow; Water management; calibration; climate change; climate effect; environmental change; flow modeling; land use; model validation; rainfall; river water; water budget; water management; water resource; Africa; East Africa; Kenya; Mount Kenya; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548133151

But the monetary economic valuation of ecosystem goods and services (gains and losses) can only provide a good indication of social welfare impacts under certain conditions and in selective contexts. The values derived through this appraisal process will, for a number of measures, be underestimates of the full total system value [Turner, R.K., Paavola, J., Cooper, P. Farber, S., Jessamy, V., Georgiou, S., 2003. Valuing nature: lessons learned and future research directions. Ecol. Econ. 46, 493-510]. The economic analysis is best suited to assessing the value of 'marginal' gains and losses in ecosystem goods/services and not the total destruction of whole systems (including life support systems, the value of which is not commensurate with monetary values and/or is infinitely high). In this study economic costs and what we call 'ecological risk' analysis are used to appraise the implementation costs and ecological benefits of selected measures for combating eutrophication. Ecological risk is expressed in terms of ecosystem integrity and resilience. The paper presents three regional case studies dealing with the issue of nutrient emission reduction to the southern North Sea, namely the catchments/estuaries of the Humber (UK), the Rhine (Germany and The Netherlands) and the Elbe (Czech Republic and Germany). On the basis of these comparative regional examples, wider implications in the light of international management of the North Sea are presented. A range of nutrient reduction scenarios have been deployed within the overall OSPAR target agreement of 50% nitrogen and phosphorous reduction compared with 1985 levels. Each scenario assumes pollution reduction measures, characterised in terms of their overall implementation costs and nutrient-reduction effects. Specific policy instruments analysed were: the creation of more intertidal habitat via managed coastal realignment in the Humber area, farm-based land cover changes in the Rhine catchment and a mix of agricultural regime and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) improvements in the Elbe area. The ecological consequences associated with each reduction scenario have been modelled [using the ERSEM model, see Baretta, J.W., Ebenhöh, W., Ruardij, P., 1995. An overview over the European Regional Sea Ecosystem Model, a complex marine ecosystem model. Neth. J. Sea Res. 33 (3/4), 233-246] for the coastal zones supplied from the rivers Elbe, Humber and Rhine. The modelled ecological quality indicators, which describe scenario effects on the coastal zone ecosystem, are then aggregated in terms of ecosystem integrity and ecological risk. The results are presented in terms of two selected key-indicators: implementation costs of the abatement measures and changes in ecological risk status, across the different catchments and assuming different scenarios. They thus provide a possible basis for international agreement negotiations at the North Sea scale. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Particulate matter (PM) levels were estimated using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, and light extinctions were calculated using the modeled PM concentrations. First, likely changes in visibility at class I areas were estimated for 2018. Then, using emission projections for 2018 as a starting point, the sensitivity of light extinction was evaluated by reducing emissions from various source categories by 30%. Source categories to be analyzed were determined using a tiered approach: any category that showed significant impact in one tier was broken into subcategories for further analysis in the next tier. In the first tier, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides, ammonia, volatile organic compound, and primary carbon emissions were reduced uniformly over the entire domain. During summer, when most class I areas experience their worst visibility, reduction of SO2 emissions was the most effective control strategy. In the second tier, SO2 sources were separated as ground level and elevated. The elevated sources in 10 southeastern states were differentiated from those in the rest of the domain and broken into three subcategories: coal-fired power plant (CPP), other power plant, and other than power plant [i.e., non-electric generating unit (non EGU)], The SO2 emissions from the CPP subcategory had the largest impact on visibility at class I areas, followed by the non-EGU subcategory. In the third tier, emissions from these two subcategories were further broken down by state. Most class I areas were affected by the emissions from several states, indicating the regional nature of the haze problem. Here, the visibility responses to all of the aforementioned emission reductions are quantified and deviations from general trends are identified. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",,"Air quality; Ammonia; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Sensitivity analysis; Sulfur dioxide; Volatile organic compounds; Community multiscale air quality; Haze; Emission control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; coal-fired power plant; emission control; haze; modeling; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; sensitivity analysis; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38049129057

Seventeen (17) patients in complete clinical remission for epithelial ovarian cancer were included. After completion of chemotherapy, a mixture of 111indium-labeled muHMFG1 (imaging) and 90Y-muHMFG1 (therapy) was i.p. administered by a surgically placed, indwelling i.p. catheter. Planar and single-photon emission computed tomography images were recorded to determine the distribution of the study medication during the first 6 days postinjection. Of the first 3 patients, 2 patients had extraperitoneal leakage of up to 50% of the injected dose within 24 hours after injection of the study medication. Extraperitoneal leakage was mainly seen in the retroperitoneal spaces covering the upper and lower quadrant of the abdomen. After adjustments in the procedure, leakage was observed in 2 of the remaining 14 patients. Extraperitoneal leakage of i.p. administered therapy does occur. Such leakage would reduce the locally delivered dose of a drug and could potentially have a negative impact on therapeutic efficacy. Given the potential attraction of developing i.p. treatments for intra-abdominal cancer, the observations in this study need to be taken into consideration. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","HMFG1; Intraperitoneal; Monoclonal antibody; Ovarian cancer","monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody hmfg 1 y 90; unclassified drug; abdominal disease; advanced cancer; article; cancer patient; cancer regression; clinical article; drug distribution; extraperitoneal leakage; human; indwelling catheter; ovary cancer; priority journal; single photon emission computer tomography; treatment failure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548610273

This paper discusses manure management systems in the 27 Member States of the European Union (EU-27) and nutrient losses from these systems, with emphasis on nitrogen (N). In general, losses decrease in the order: C, N &gt;&gt; S &gt; K, Na, Cl, B &gt; P, Ca, Mg, metals. Assessments made with the integrated modeling tool MITERRA-EUROPE indicate that the total N excretion in 2000 by livestock in EU-27 was ∼ 10,400 kton. About 65% of the total N excretion was collected in barns and stored for some time prior to application to agricultural land. Almost 30% of the N excreted in barns was lost during storage; approximately 19% via NH3 emissions, 7% via emissions of NO, N2O and N2, and 4% via leaching and run-off. Differences between Member States in mean N losses from manure storages were large (range 19.5-35%). Another 19% of the N excreted in animal housing systems was lost via NH3 emissions following the application of the manure to land. The results indicate that maximally 52% of the N excreted in barns was effectively recycled as plant nutrient. Various emission abatement measures can be implemented and have been implemented already in some Member States to reduce the emissions of NH3 and N2O, and the leaching of N and P. There is scope to reduce NH3 emissions by ∼ 30% relative to the reference year 2000, although the uncertainty in estimated emissions and in the estimated effects of emission abatement measures is relatively large. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Positron emission tomography (PET) is the only technique that provides accurate, quantitative measurement of cerebral blood flow and metabolism in human. However, PET with the conventional 3-step technique requires relatively long time for the examination. Since October 2006, we have been ready to perform PET with a faster technique (a rapid dual autoradiographic method PET, rapid DARG-PET) 1) in patients with acute ischemic stroke within 24 hours after the onset. Total examination time is approximately 25 minutes in the rapid DARG-PET. We examined serial changes in a patient with severe carotid artery stenosis by use of the rapid DARG-PET. Case Presentation A 60-year-old man was admitted for mild dysarthria and right hemiparesis. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) on admission showed high signals in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). A rapid DARG-PET, performed 12 hours after the onset, showed slight reduction in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the area corresponding to the high signal lesion on DWI. It disclosed an increase in cerebral blood volume (CBV) without an increase in oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in the region surrounding the DWI-high signal area. Angiogram on the second hospital-day revealed pseudo occlusion of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) with a main collateral flow through the anterior communicating artery from the right ICA to the left MCA. The second rapid DARG-PET examination performed two weeks later, revealed normalization of increased CBV. It was hypothesized that, in an acute stroke, blood flow supply associated with the collateral circulation is dynamically changing in the area of ischemia, and thus quantitative assessment of ischemic status is important for the patient care. Conclusions: The rapid DARG-PET is able to identify transient changes in cerebral blood flow and oxidative metabolism in patients with acute ischemic stroke. This technique will be useful for further investigation of pathophysiology and hemodynamic status of stroke in man.",,"adult; anamnesis; angiography; autoradiography; brain blood flow; case report; cerebrovascular accident; clinical feature; conference paper; diffusion; hemodynamics; human; internal carotid artery; male; neuroimaging; positron emission tomography; priority journal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36348964700

The average climate of Japan during the period 1971-2000 was used as a baseline. The improved model was used to assess the possible effects of the future climate (2081-2100) on agricultural practices at a spatial resolution of approximately 1 km2. The most notable result from the simulations is that the water temperature during the growing season for the future climate increased by approximately 1.6-2.0 °C throughout the country. This increase can lead to a remarkable northward shift of the isochrones of safe transplanting dates for rice seedlings. This means that the rice cultivation period will be prolonged by approximately 25-30 days. Such an increase in the thermal resources allows greater flexibility of variation in the cropping season as compared with that at present; thus, resulting in a reduction in the frequency of cool summer damage in the northern districts. The area of safe cultivation expands to the northernmost region, if all the forests in the climatically suitable areas can be converted into rice fields. Conversely, climate warming will also induce high-temperature stress in rice plants in one-fifth of the current total cultivation area. The current agricultural practices and rice cultivars used in these areas will inevitably require altering to prevent the projected heat stress during summer. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We have to change our way of thinking and our economic systems from those dependent on fossil resources to those dependent on renewable energy resources, such as solar energy. In our field of research, electric vehicles are considered the best choice for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. A battery is not an adequate energy source for electric vehicles, because batteries quickly get depleted because of its low energy and power density. A fuel cell is a more favorable alternative to the battery; however, it has large mass and can only replace the internal combustion engine, but the power transmission mechanisms are still necessary. The new concept of an electric off-road vehicle proposed here is entirely different from those mentioned above. The vehicle has neither a combustion engine nor a battery but only electric motors. Energy to drive the motors is transmitted through air as microwaves at 2.45 GHz. This technology was developed at the Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere, Kyoto University, as a method for transmitting electricity from a large-scale solar power station (SPS) orbiting in space to the Earth. We have constructed some models of electric off-road vehicles and investigated their adoptability to microwave power transmission. In this paper, some experimental results on the use of microwave power transmission for powering the vehicles are presented, and some problems such as low energy transmission efficiency are also discussed. © 2007 ISTVS.","Environmental protection; Microwave power transmission; Zero emission vehicle","Carbon dioxide; Earth (planet); Environmental protection; Global warming; Internal combustion engines; Energy transmission efficiency; Zero emission vehicle; Microwave power transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40049092897

We describe the state-of-the-art in Integrated Assessment Modelling using a conceptual framework which locates the research activities driving integrated assessment in relation both to each other and to flows of information between activities, and identify inter-relationships with scientific and policy domains beyond the scope of the UN/ECE Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution, recognising the utility of social science in understanding the effects of policy on socio-cultural behaviours. We discuss how the issues identified are being captured by integrated assessment models, with particular focus on the treatment of non-technical pollution abatement measures, noting current developments at the micro-scale addressing the dynamics of behavioural responses to abatement policies. Finally, we identify three key challenges for issue-driven Integrated Assessment Modelling: (i) capturing the dynamics of behavioural responses to value-driven policy mechanisms designed to promote non-technical abatement measures; (ii) the development of new tools to handle the delay times, inter-dependencies and multi-pollutant effects of abatement measures; and (iii) the identification of boundaries between knowledge domains and the effective transfer of multi-disciplinary scientific and socio-cultural knowledge to an increasingly trans-disciplinary policy domain. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the life cycle assessment (LCA) of any hydroelectric plant shows that GHG emissions occur at different phases of the power plant's life. This work examines the role of decommissioning hydroelectric dams in greenhouse gas emissions. Accumulated sediments in reservoirs contain noticeable levels of carbon, which may be released to the atmosphere upon decommissioning of the dam. The rate of sediment accumulation and the sediment volume for six of the ten largest United States hydroelectric power plants is surveyed. The amount of sediments and the respective carbon content at the moment of dam decommissioning (100 years after construction) was estimated. The released carbon is partitioned into CO 2 and CH4 emissions and converted to CO2 equivalent emissions using the global warming potential (GWP) method. The global warming effect (GWE) due to dam decommissioning is normalized to the total electricity produced over the lifetime of each power plant. The estimated GWE of the power plants range from 128-380 g of CO2eq./kWh when 11% of the total available sediment organic carbon (SOC) is mineralized and between 35 and 104 g of CO2eq./kWh when 3% of the total SOC is mineralized. Though these values are below emission factors for coal power plants (890 g of CO 2eq./kWh), the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by the sediments upon dam decommissioning is a notable amount that should not be ignored and must be taken into account when considering construction and relicensing of hydroelectric dams. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Carbon; Dams; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Sediments; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Hydroelectric dams; Hydroelectric power; carbon dioxide; dam; decommissioning; emission; global warming; greenhouse gas; hydroelectric power plant; life cycle analysis; partitioning; sedimentation; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148954661

This effect urgently has to be taken into account when predicting future African climate under enhanced greenhouse conditions. Here, we present time slice experiments of African climate until 2025, using a high-resolution regional climate model. A supposable scenario of future land use changes, involving vegetation loss and soil degradation, is prescribed simultaneously with increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations in order to detect, where the different forcings counterbalance or reinforce each other. This proceeding allows us to define the regions of highest vulnerability with respect to future freshwater availability and food security in tropical and subtropical Africa and may provide a decision basis for political measures. The model simulates a considerable reduction in precipitation amount until 2025 over most of tropical Africa, amounting to partly more than 500 mm (20-40% of the annual sum), particularly in the Congo Basin and the Sahel Zone. The change is strongest in boreal summer and basically reflects the pattern of maximum vegetation cover during the seasonal cycle. The related change in the surface energy fluxes induces a substantial near-surface warming by up to 7°C. According to the modified temperature gradients over tropical Africa, the summer monsoon circulation intensifies and transports more humid air masses into the southern part of West Africa. This humidifying effect is overcompensated by a remarkable decrease in surface evaporation, leading to the overall drying tendency over most of Africa. Extreme daily rainfall events become stronger in autumn but less intense in spring. Summer and autumn appear to be characterized by more severe heat waves over Subsaharan West Africa. In addition, the Tropical Easterly Jet is weakening, leading to enhanced drought conditions in the Sahel Zone. All these results suggest that the local impact of land degradation and reduction of vegetation cover may be more important in tropical Africa than the global radiative heating, at least until 2025. This implies that vegetation protection measures at a national scale may directly lead to a mitigation of the expected negative implications of future climate change in tropical Africa. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",,"Drought; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Vegetation; Weathering; Drought conditions; Greenhouse conditions; Greenhouse gas concentrations; Land degradation; Greenhouse effect; air mass; climate modeling; land degradation; land use change; precipitation intensity; regional climate; seasonal variation; vegetation cover; warming; water availability; Africa; Congo Basin; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447108468

One of the main issues of these vehicles is the energy management in order to improve the overall fuel economy. The present investigation aims at identifying the best hybrid vehicle configuration and control strategy to reduce fuel consumption. The study focuses on a car powered by a fuel cell and equipped with two secondary energy storage devices: batteries and super-capacitors. To model the powertrain behavior an on purpose simulation program called ECoS has been developed in Matlab/Simulink environment. The fuel cell model is based on the Amphlett theory. The battery and the super-capacitor models account for charge/discharge efficiency. The analyzed powertrain is also equipped with an energy regeneration system to recover braking energy. The numerical optimization of vehicle configuration and control strategy of the hybrid electric vehicle has been carried out with a multi objective genetic algorithm. The goal of the optimization is the reduction of hydrogen consumption while sustaining the battery state of charge. By applying the algorithm to different driving cycles, several optimized configurations have been identified and discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Reaction kinetics mechanisms including pressure dependencies and prior validations at both low and high pressures were selected and include a detailed 24-step, 12-species hydrogen mechanism (H2/O2 and H2/air), and reduced mechanisms for methane (CH4/air: 11 steps, 15 species) and heptane (C7H16/air: 13 steps, 17 species), all including thermal NOx chemistry. The governing equations are the fully compressible Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with the Peng-Robinson real fluid equation of state. A generalized multicomponent diffusion model derived from nonequilibrium thermodynamics and fluctuation theory is employed and includes both heat and mass transport in the presence of concentration, temperature, and pressure gradients (i.e., Dufour and Soret diffusion). Previously tested high-pressure mixture property models are employed for the viscosity, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and mass diffusivities. Five models for high-pressure thermal diffusion coefficients related to Soret and Dufour cross-diffusion are first compared with experimental data over a wide range of pressures. Laminar flame simulations are then conducted for each of the four flames over a large range of pressures for all thermal diffusion coefficient models and results are compared with purely Fickian and Fourier diffusion simulations. The results reveal a considerable range in the influence of cross-diffusion predicted by the various models; however, the most plausible models show significant cross-diffusion effects, including reductions in the peak flame temperatures and minor species concentrations for all flames. These effects increase with pressure for both H2 flames and for the C7H16 flames indicating the elevated importance of proper cross-diffusion modeling at large pressures. Cross-diffusion effects, while not negligible, were observed to be less significant in the CH4 flames and to decrease with pressure. Deficiencies in the existing thermal diffusion coefficient models are discussed and future research directions suggested. © 2007 The Combustion Institute.","Dufour diffusion; Heptane; High-pressure; Hydrogen; Laminar diffusion flame; Methane; Multicomponent; Real gas; Soret diffusion; Supercritical","Hydrogen; Methane; Reaction kinetics; Thermal diffusion; Dufour diffusion; Laminar diffusion flame; Soret diffusion; Supercritical; Flame research; heptane; hydrogen; methane; Flame research; Hydrogen; Methane; Reaction kinetics; Thermal diffusion; article; chemical reaction kinetics; diffusion; diffusion coefficient; fluid transport; heat; laminar flow; mathematical model; pressure gradient; priority journal; simulation; supercritical fluid; temperature; thermal analysis; thermal conductivity; thermodynamics; transport kinetics; validation process; viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36048980919

The relationship of functional diversity, measured as carbon source utilisation in Biolog plates and extracellular enzymatic activities, and genetic diversity of bacteria was evaluated. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used for community analyses at the species level. Bulk soil and rhizosphere soil from pine and poplar plantations were analysed separately to determine if the plant rhizosphere impacted hydrocarbon degradation. Prevailing microbial communities in the field site were both genetically and metabolically diverse. Furthermore, both tree rhizosphere and fertilisation affected the compositions of these communities and increased activities of extracellular aminopeptidases. In addition, the abundance of alkane hydroxylase and naphthalene dioxygenase genes in the communities was low, but the prevalence of these genes was increased by the addition of bioavailable hydrocarbons. Tree rhizosphere communities had greater hydrocarbon degradation potential than those of bulk soil. Hydrocarbon utilising communities were dominated generally by the species Ralstonia eutropha and bacteria belonging to the genus Burkholderia. Despite the presence of viable hydrocarbon-degrading microbiota, decomposition of hydrocarbons from weathered hydrocarbon contaminated soil over four years, regardless of the presence of vegetation, was low in unfertilised soil.

To address this issue, experimental modeling of natural diamond-forming processes with the participation of sulfides has been performed with the MgCO3-SiO2-Al2O3-FeS system at 6.3 GPa in the temperature range of 1250-1800 °C, using a multi-anvil high pressure apparatus of the ""split-sphere"" type. As a result of redox reactions involving carbonate, oxides and sulfide, diamond and/or graphite are produced in association with garnet, orthopyroxene, coesite and sulfides (pyrite, pyrrhotite). Diamond crystals, formed from the carbon of initial carbonate, are found to contain nitrogen impurity with total concentration of approximately 1500 ppm, and defects related to hydrogen impurity. Based on the experimental data and thermodynamic calculations, the processes of the carbonate-oxide-sulfide interaction are reconstructed, revealing the role of sulfides as a reducing agent for CO2-fluid. It is established that pyrrhotite acts as the reducing agent irrespective of its aggregate state (solid or melt). At temperatures below melting, pyrrhotite is enriched with sulfur and depleted with iron from FeS to Fe0.85S. At higher temperatures, sulfide melt is enriched with sulfur and crystallizes as pyrite and pyrrhotite during quenching. The medium in which diamond and/or graphite crystallize is a CO2-dominated fluid containing dissolved carbon, silicates, oxides and sulfides. The investigated processes and mechanisms of diamond crystallization can be considered as a possible model of the diamond formation in sulfide-bearing paragenesis in mantle metasomatism or UHP metamorphism of crustal material. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of the work is to investigate the so-called primary measures technique. Twenty different thermally resistant inorganic compounds were added directly to the fuel as inhibitors of PCDD/F formation. The fuel-types used in this study included lignite coal, pre-treated municipal solid waste and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Principle component analysis (PCA) provides the basis for a feasible discussion about the efficiency of 20 inhibitors on PCDD/F and PCB formation. The study showed that the metal oxides group investigated had no inhibitory effect. Although the single N- and S-containing compounds, used as additives for the type of lignite coal, solid waste and PVC fuel, are not very effective as inhibitors, all other N- and S-containing substances are capable to strongly reduce PCDD/F and PCB flue gas emission. The most effective inhibitors are (NH4)2SO4 and (NH4)2S2O3. (NH4)2SO4 present at 3% of the fuel can reduce the PCDD/F emissions to 90%.

The ability to cut bone with a laser beam would also be of great technical benefit in minimally invasive maxillofacial surgery (endoscopic). The Erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) laser has been demonstrated to result in minimal thermal damage of bone, precise cutting, rapid osseous healing and osteoinduction. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using Er:YAG laser to perform vertical ramus osteotomy, and to determine the most efficient energy per pulse for its completion. Two fresh pig mandibles, one pig cadaver head and one human mandible were used. A different energy per pulse (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 J/pulse) was used for each osteotomy on the pig mandibles (n = 4). Vertical ramus osteotomy was feasible with all energy settings but time decreased considerably from 28 to 5.33 min as the energy per pulse increased. The human and the pig cadaver head mandibles were osteotomized bilaterally with 2000 mJ/pulse that was the most efficient in terms of time.

Such a porous electrode has been widely modeled as a homogeneous porous medium with a constant permeability in the literature of PEM fuel cell. In fact, most of gas diffusion media are not homogeneous having non-isotropic permeability. In case of carbon cloth, the porous structure consists of carbon fiber tows, the bundles of carbon fiber, and void spaces among tows. The combinational effect of the void space and tow permeability results in the effective permeability of the porous electrode. In this work, the lattice Boltzmann method is applied to the simulation of the flow in the electrode of a PEM fuel cell. The electrode is modeled as void space and porous region which has certain permeability and the Stokes and Brinkman equations are solved in the flow field using the lattice Boltzmann model. The effective permeability of the porous medium is calculated and compared to an analytical calculation showing a good agreement. It has been shown that the permeability of porous medium is strongly dependant on the fiber tow orientation in three-dimensional simulations. The lattice Boltzmann method is an efficient and effective numerical scheme to analyze the flow in a complicated geometry such as the porous medium. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Two different wind-blown-dust emission schemes, the Marticorena-Bergametti-Alfaro (MBA) scheme and the Shao scheme, were incorporated into AURAMS to simulate dust generation, and sensitivity analyses for various dust-emission-scheme parameters were performed. Comparison of the model results with satellite observations and surface measurements showed that the model simulation reasonably reproduced the temporal and spatial distribution of wind-blown dust particles during the episode period in the downwind area of Oklahoma but not in the source region. Both dust-emission schemes captured the main features of the dust transport. The dust-emission-scheme parameter most responsible for inaccurate prediction of wind-blown-dust emission in the source region in this study appeared to be soil moisture content. The soil grain size distribution and the soil plastic pressure were also shown to be important parameters that should be accurately estimated for better model performance. For further validation and reliable use of wind-blown-dust emission schemes, accurate field and remote sensing measurements of those parameters are imperative. The unusually fast transport of dust during the episode appeared to be due to vigorous vertical mixing and uplift of emitted dust. Appropriate parameterization of additional vertical mixing by sub-grid-scale convection may help to better predict the long-range transport of dust storms.

The EnerGuide for Houses Program illustrates the growing importance of local decisions where the federal government developed a home energy rating system that was delivered through a range of partnerships across the country. Despite all political parties voting to increase funding for the programme in 2005, the Conservative government cancelled it in May 2006.

Thus, their response to elevated CO2 can have large effects on plant nutrient acquisition and carbon movement through forests. • Here, the effects of CO2 and nitrogen (N) fertilization on EMM biomass and community structure in Pinus taeda forest plots were examined using sand-filled mesh bags buried in the field, the contents of which were analyzed by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and DNA sequencing. • A total of 2138 sequences comprising 295 taxa were recovered; most (83.5%) were from ectomycorrhizal fungal taxa.

The traditional view is that the TR emission originates from a thin thermal interface in hot coronal structures, connecting their chromosphere with their corona. This paradigm fails badly for cool plasmas (≈T &lt; 105 K), since it predicts emission orders of magnitude less than what it is observed. It was therefore proposed that the ""missing"" TR emission could originate from tiny, isolated from the hot corona, cool loops at TR temperatures. A major problem in investigating this proposal is the very small sizes of the hypothesized cool loops. Here, we report the first spatially resolved observations of subarcsecond-scale looplike structures seen in the Lyα line made by the Very High Angular Resolution Ultraviolet Telescope (VAULT). The subarcsecond (≈0.3″) resolution of VAULT allows us to directly view and resolve looplike structures in the quiet Sun network. We compare the observed intensities of these structures with simplified radiative transfer models of cool loops. The reasonable agreement between the models and the observations indicates that an explanation of the observed fine structure in terms of cool loops is plausible. © 2007.

According to statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), regions or populations already experiencing the most increase in diseases attributable to temperature rise in the past 30 years ironically contain those populations least responsible for causing greenhouse gas warming of the planet. Average global carbon emissions approximate one metric ton per year (tC/yr) per person. In 2004, United States per capita emissions neared 6 tC/yr (with Canada and Australia not far behind), and Japan and Western European countries range from 2 to 5 tC/yr per capita. Yet developing countries' per capita emissions approximate 0.6 tC/yr, and more than 50 countries are below 0.2 tC/yr (or 30-fold less than an average American). This imbalance between populations suffering from an increase in climate-sensitive diseases versus those nations producing greenhouse gases that cause global warming can be quantified using a ""natural debt"" index, which is the cumulative depleted CO2 emissions per capita. This is a better representation of the responsibility for current warming than a single year's emissions. By this measure, for example, the relative responsibilities of the U.S. in relation to those of India or China is nearly double that using an index of current emissions, although it does not greatly change the relationship between India and China. Rich countries like the U.S. have caused much more of today's warming than poor ones, which have not been emitting at significant levels for many years yet, no matter what current emissions indicate. Along with taking necessary measures to reduce the extent of global warming and the associated impacts, society also needs to pursue equitable solutions that first protect the most vulnerable population groups; be they defined by demographics, income, or location. For example, according to the WHO, 88% of the disease burden attributable to climate change afflicts children under age 5 (obviously an innocent and ""nonconsenting"" segment of the population), presenting another major axis of inequity. Not only is the health burden from climate change itself greatest among the world's poor, but some of the major mitigation approaches to reduce the degree of warming may produce negative side effects disproportionately among the poor, for example, competition for land from biofuels creating pressure on food prices. Of course, in today's globalized world, eventually all nations will share some risk, but underserved populations will suffer first and most strongly from climate change. Moreover, growing recognition that society faces a nonlinear and potentially irreversible threat has deep ethical implications about humanity's stewardship of the planet that affect both rich and poor. © 2007 Ecohealth Journal Consortium.","Biofuels; Built environment; CO2 emissions; Cobenefits; Equity; Food security; Global warming; Malaria; Malnutrition; Natural debt","biofuel; carbon dioxide; body burden; climate change; environmental impact; environmental temperature; greenhouse effect; priority journal; review; world health organization",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37349048091

First, the extent of customer charges was determined from a nationwide survey of US electric tariffs. To eliminate the customer charge nationally while maintaining a fixed sum for electric companies for a given amount of electricity, an increase of 7.12% in the residential electrical rate was found to be necessary. If enacted, this increase in the electric rate would result in a 6.4% reduction in overall electricity consumption, conserving 73 billion kW h, eliminating 44.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, and saving the entire US residential sector over $8 billion per year. As shown here, these reductions would come from increased avoidable costs, thus leveraging an increased rate of return on investments in energy efficiency, energy conservation behavior, distributed energy generation, and fuel choices.

The present EU greenhouse gas emission allowance trading regime starts from a decentralised allocation of emission rights, based on rather vague criteria stipulated in an annex to the greenhouse gas emissions trading Directive, and with much discretion left to the Member States. This approach, where most of the allowances are given free of charge to industries, entails that different amount of allowances are given to equal installations vested in different Member States, is vulnerable to lobbying activities, does not stimulate at full force new climate-friendly options, and moreover appears to be an administratively complex instrument. Because of the fact that the present method contains such disadvantages, there is a serious need for examining alternative options. Besides auctioning, which is thus far politically seen not attractive because of the negative effects on the global competitive position of industries, it is also interesting to examine the so-called ""credit-and-trade"" regime as being a possible future approach towards allocating greenhouse gas emission rights in Europe and probably on a wider scale too. This approach fits better into the polluter-pays principle, deals easily with new entrants and closures, and is a concept from which harmonisation within the EU could be realised. It also contains some regulatory complexities, as all allocation mechanisms do. However, the concept has strikingly been subject to little debate in the literature thus far, and the merits of it compared to the other methods of allocation should he closely examined too.",,"emissions trading; European Union; greenhouse gas; polluter pays principle; trade-environment relations; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547478324

This uncertainty is due in part to the difficulty in detecting small changes in soil carbon pools. We conducted a series of long-term (170-330 days) laboratory incubation experiments to examine changes in soil organic matter pool sizes and turnover rates in soil collected from an open-top chamber (OTC) elevated CO2 study in Colorado shortgrass steppe. We measured concentration and isotopic composition of respired CO2 and applied a two-pool exponential decay model to estimate pool sizes and turnover rates of active and slow C pools. The active and slow C pools of surface soils (5-10 cm depth) were increased by elevated CO2, but turnover rates of these pools were not consistently altered. These findings indicate a potential for C accumulation in near-surface soil C pools under elevated CO2. Stable isotopes provided evidence that elevated CO2 did not alter the decomposition rate of new C inputs. Temporal variations in measured δ13C of respired CO2 during incubation probably resulted mainly from the decomposition of changing mixtures of fresh residue and older organic matter. Lignin decomposition may have contributed to declining δ13C values late in the experiments. Isotopic dynamics during decomposition should be taken into account when interpreting δ13C measurements of soil respiration. Our study provides new understanding of soil C dynamics under elevated CO2 through the use of stable C isotope measurements during microbial organic matter mineralization. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, changes in climate could have significant impacts on ecosystem structure and function. In the southwestern US, interactions among regional climate drivers (e.g., El Niño Southern Oscillation) and topographically controlled convective storms create a spatially and temporally variable precipitation regime that governs the rate and magnitude of ecosystem processes. We quantified the spatial and temporal distribution of reduced grassland greenness in response to seasonal and annual variation in precipitation at two scales at the Sevilleta Long Term Ecological Research site in central New Mexico, using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values from bi-weekly AVHRR data and seasonal ETM data from 1989 to 2005. We used spatially explicit NDVI Z-scores to identify times and places of significantly reduced greenness and related those to interactions between plant functional type, seasonal climate variation, and topography. Seasonal greenness was bimodal with a small peak in spring and a stronger peak following the summer monsoon. Greenness was generally spatially homogeneous in spring and more spatially variable in summer. From 2001 through spring 2002, drought effects were evidenced by a 4-fold increase in the number of pixels showing significantly low greenness. Spatial distribution of low greenness was initially modulated by topographic position, but as the drought intensified spread throughout the study area. Vegetation green up occurred rapidly when drought conditions ceased. We conclude that drought effects vary spatially over time, pervasive drought reduces broad-scale spatial heterogeneity, and greenness patterns recover rapidly when drought conditions end. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Aridland ecosystems; Drought; Grasslands; NDVI; New Mexico","annual variation; arid environment; AVHRR; climate change; drought; ecosystem function; ecosystem structure; environmental response; grassland; heterogeneity; NDVI; precipitation (climatology); seasonal variation; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; storm; New Mexico; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249827269

The warming treatment raised the plot daily temperature by ca. 1 °C, while the drought treatment led to a reduction in soil moisture at the peak of the growing season that ranged from 26% at the SP site to 82% in the NL site. During the 7 years the experiment lasted (1999-2005), we used the pin-point method to measure the species composition of plant communities and plant biomass, litterfall, and shoot growth of the dominant plant species at each site. A significantly lower increase in the number of species pin-pointed per transect was found in the drought plots at the SP site, where the plant community was still in a process of recovering from a forest fire in 1994. No changes in species richness were found at the other sites, which were at a more mature and stable state of succession and, thus less liable to recruitment of new species. The relationship between annual biomass accumulation and temperature of the growing season was positive at the coldest site and negative at the warmest site. The warming treatment tended to increase the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) at the northern sites. The relationship between annual biomass accumulation and soil moisture during the growing season was not significant at the wettest sites, but was positive at the driest sites. The drought treatment tended to reduce the ANPP in the NL, HU, IT, and SP sites. The responses to warming were very strongly related to the Gaussen aridity index (stronger responses the lower the aridity), whereas the responses to drought were not. Changes in the annual aboveground biomass accumulation, litterfall, and, thus, the ANPP, mirrored the interannual variation in climate conditions: the most outstanding change was a decrease in biomass accumulation and an increase in litterfall at most sites during the abnormally hot year of 2003. Species richness also tended to decrease in 2003 at all sites except the cold and wet UK site. Species-specific responses to warming were found in shoot growth: at the SP site, Globularia alypum was not affected, while the other dominant species, Erica multiflora, grew 30% more; at the UK site, Calluna vulgaris tended to grow more in the warming plots, while Empetrum nigrum tended to grow less. Drought treatment decreased plant growth in several studied species, although there were some species such as Pinus halepensis at the SP site or C. vulgaris at the UK site that were not affected. The magnitude of responses to warming and drought thus depended greatly on the differences between sites, years, and species and these multiple plant responses may be expected to have consequences at ecosystem and community level. Decreases in biodiversity and the increase in E. multiflora growth at the SP site as a response to warming challenge the assumption that sensitivity to warming may be less well developed at more southerly latitudes; likewise, the fact that one of the studied shrublands presented negative ANPP as a response to the 2003 heat wave also challenges the hypothesis that future climate warming will lead to an enhancement of plant growth and carbon sequestration in temperate ecosystems. Extreme events may thus change the general trend of increased productivity in response to warming in the colder sites. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biodiversity; Climate change; Drought; European gradient; Forest-steppe; Global warming; Heat wave; Heathland; Litterfall; Net primary productivity; Plant biomass; Plant growth; Shrubland; Species richness","biodiversity; climate change; global warming; plant community; primary production; shrubland; species richness; Benelux; Catalonia; Central Europe; Denmark; Eurasia; Europe; Hungary; Italy; Netherlands; Northern Europe; Sardinia; Scandinavia; Southern Europe; Spain; United Kingdom; Wales; Western Europe; Calluna; Calluna vulgaris; Empetrum nigrum; Erica multiflora; Globularia alypum; Pinus halepensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36348961910

Fruit and vegetable processing systems can be broadly categorized into three classes, based on the scale of processing. Small-scale processing is done at the cottage industry level by small-scale farmers for personal subsistence or for sale in nearby markets. Intermediate-scale processing is based on the technology used by small-scale processors with differences in the type and capacity of the equipment used. The raw materials are usually grown by the processors themselves or are purchased on contract from other farmers. Intermediate-scale processing can provide quantities of processed products to urban areas. Large-scale processing is highly mechanized and requires a substantial supply of raw materials for economical operation. This system requires a large capital investment, high technical and managerial skills, and regular supplies of adequate quantities of raw materials. The choice of processing system depends entirely on the type of industry and the extent of infrastructure for growing, transport, manpower, technology, and other resources available in different countries as well as the marketing opportunities for the products processed. Harvested vegetables are highly perishable and need careful handling and storage conditions to maintain quality. Lowering the temperature of the storage room and being able to transfer crops as rapidly as possible to such storage can help delay death. Cool storage can also help reduce water loss due to a reduction in evaporation and transpiration, but control of relative humidity is also necessary. Storage life can be increased by changing the atmosphere of the store from the normal atmosphere of 79% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 0.03% carbon dioxide to predetermined concentrations in which the level of oxygen is reduced and carbon dioxide is increased. © 2007 William Andrew Inc.

Understanding the key drivers behind China's growing energy consumption and the associated CO 2 emissions is critical for the development of global climate policies and provides insight into how other emerging economies may develop a low emissions future. Using recently released Chinese economic input-output data and structural decomposition analysis we analyze how changes in China's technology, economic structure, urbanization, and lifestyles affect CO 2 emissions. We find that infrastructure construction and urban household consumption, both in turn driven by urbanization and lifestyle changes, have outpaced efficiency improvements in the growth of CO2 emissions. Net trade had a small effect on total emissions due to equal, but significant, growth in emissions from the production of exports and emissions avoided by imports. Technology and efficiency improvements have only partially offset consumption growth, but there remains considerable untapped potential to reduce emissions by improving both production and consumption systems. As China continues to rapidly develop there is an opportunity to further implement and extend policies, such as the Circular Economy, that will help China avoid the high emissions path taken by today's developed countries. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; China; Decomposition; Economic analysis; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Efficiency gains; Offset consumption; Total emissions; Environmental engineering; carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide; China; Decomposition; Economic analysis; Energy utilization; Environmental engineering; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; environmental policy; fuel consumption; global climate; national economy; urbanization; air pollutant; air pollution; article; China; climate change; decomposition; economic development; energy consumption; environmental health; field emission; human; urban population; Carbon Dioxide; China; Climate; Developed Countries; Ecosystem; Energy-Generating Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Forecasting; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Socioeconomic Factors; Time Factors; Urbanization; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548567157

However, CO2 also is a plant fertilizer. When allowing for the increase in foliage area that results from increasing atmospheric CO2 levels in a global vegetation model, we find a decrease in global runoff from 1901 to 1999. This finding highlights the importance of vegetation structure feedback on the water balance of the land surface. Therefore, the elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration does not explain the estimated increase in global runoff over the last century. In contrast, we find that changes in mean climate, as well as its variability, do contribute to the global runoff increase. Using historic land-use data, we show that land-use change plays an additional important role in controlling regional runoff values, particularly in the tropics. Land-use change has been strongest in tropical regions, and its contribution is substantially larger than that of climate change. On average, land-use change has increased global runoff by 0.08 mm/year2 and accounts for ≈50% of the reconstructed global runoff trend over the last century. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of land-cover change in forecasting future freshwater availability and climate. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Atmospheric CO2; Climate change; Land cover change; Water cycle","carbon dioxide; fertilizer; fresh water; runoff; article; biogeography; biosphere; climate change; foliage; hydrology; land use; priority journal; vegetation; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; Rain; Rivers; Time Factors; Water; Water Movements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34848855141

The system treated municipal wastewater from 100 inhabitants and it was situated in South Bohemia, Czech Republic. The aims of the study were to estimate gas emissions and carbon balance of the whole system, and to evaluate the importance of plants to the whole system. Gases, water and plants were sampled from June till October 2004. Gas emissions ranged from 4 to 309 mg CO2-C m-2 h-1 and from 0 to 93 mg CH4-C m-2 h-1. N2O emission was negligible in the studied system; the only product of denitrification was N2. Only 10% of total carbon emissions were in the form of CH4. Amount of C emitted was higher than carbon input in the wastewater; it was calculated that between one fourth and one third of total carbon emissions originated in plants. The study documented the importance of plants as a source of available carbon for microorganisms in constructed wetlands which are not heavily loaded with wastewater. This carbon is further transformed to gaseous forms and increases carbon emissions from the wetland. However, plant exudation also affects microbial processes and pore water quality. In this way, plants increase the efficiency of nitrogen removal from the wastewater by supporting denitrifying microorganisms with easily decomposable organic matter. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

WOLFE, the architect of CLAMP, and DILCHER, who helped place angiosperin paleobotany within the context of plant systematics, have found their own innovative ways of documenting and interpreting the evolutionary history and paleoccology of the angiosperms. From the beginning, both DILCHER and WOLFE recognized that an understanding of regional geological processes was essential when determining both the kinds of questions and techniques used when studying Tertiary floras. DILCHER'S Eocene work has focused on the megathermal Claiborne Formation of the Mississippi Embayment, while WOLFE'S centered on the ""upland"" microthermal floras of the northwestern Okanogan Highlands. DILCHER and his students, working in the Eocene floras of the clay pits of Kentucky and Tennessee, described an extinct, dry vegetation of the Southeast that was dominated by Lauraceae, Fagaceae and Leguminosae. The exquisite preservation of these southeastern floras allowed for detailed pollen and cuticular studies that provided a high degree of taxonomic precision. In contrast, WOLFE turned his attention to floras of British Columbia and eastern Washington that are dominated temperate elements such as Betulaceae and Rosaceae in an upland environment. The ability to precisely date dramatic changes in these floras through radiometric means provided WOLFE with a database for leaf physiognomic studies and the development of CLAMP (Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program). The contrasting contributions of DILCHER and WOLFE have played a significant role in the development of Tertiary North American paleobotany and its contribution to the understanding of fossil and extant floras. © E.

High microvessel density (MVD) as well as hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) have been related to recurrent disease and tumor aggressiveness, respectively. In this study, MVD and hypoxic status were investigated in primary and recurrent endometrial carcinomas. A total of 65 primary tumors of patients with recurrent endometrial carcinoma (n = 40), and without recurrent endometrial carcinoma (n = 25) were studied. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. MVD was determined by quantitative analysis of CD31/FVIII positive vessels. Tumor hypoxia was estimated by evaluating the expression of the hypoxia-regulated gene HIF-1α and its target gene carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX). An additional 23 recurrent tumors were available for determination of MVD and HIF-1α expression. Effects of hypoxia on tumor protein p53 (TP53) expression were evaluated in the endometrial cancer cell lines (ECC-1), Ishikawa (derived from adenocarcinomas), and AN3CA (derived from a lymph node metastasis). MVD, CA-IX, and HIF-1α expression were not significantly different in primary tumors of patients with recurrence compared to the control tumors. The MVD was significantly lower, and HIF-1α expression was significantly higher in recurrent tumors when compared with their primary tumors (paired t test, P < 0.05). HIF-1α expression correlated well with TP53 expression levels in primary tumors, but not in recurrences. TP53 protein levels were highest in AN3CA cells. Hypoxic conditions induced TP53 protein in ECC-1 and Ishikawa, but not AN3CA cells. We conclude that MVD, CA-IX, and HIF-1α expression are not independent prognostic markers for recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The low MVD, increased HIF-1α protein levels, dissociation of hypoxia, and TP53 protein induction in the metastatic tumor cells (AN3CA) support a role for hypoxia in the development of recurrent endometrial carcinoma. © 2007, IGCS and ESGO.","CA-IX; Endometrial carcinoma; HIF-1α; Hypoxia; MVD; Recurrence","carbonate dehydratase IX; CD31 antigen; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; paraffin; protein p53; adult; aged; article; cancer cell culture; carcinogenesis; comparative study; controlled study; correlation analysis; endometrium carcinoma; female; gene expression regulation; human; human cell; human tissue; hypoxia; immunohistochemistry; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; priority journal; prognosis; protein determination; protein expression; protein induction; quantitative analysis; recurrent cancer; statistical significance; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antigens, Neoplasm; Carbonic Anhydrases; Carcinoma, Endometrioid; Cell Hypoxia; Cell Line, Tumor; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Lymphatic Metastasis; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447302617

The origin band, near 385 nm, is the most intense feature in the T1(n,π.*) -S0 PE spectrum. A short progression in the ring-bending mode (ν′ 30) is also observed. The effective vibrational temperature in the jet is estimated at 50 K. The spectral simplification arising from jet cooling helps confirm assignments made previously in the room-temperature cavity ringdown (CRD) absorption spectrum, which is congested by vibrational hot bands. In addition to the origin and ν′30 assignments, the jet-cooled PE spectrum also confirms the 2801 (C=O out-of-plane wag), 2901 (C=O twist), and 19 01 (C=O in-plane wag) band assignments that were made in the T1(n,π*) -S0 room-temperature CRD spectrum. The temporal decay of the T1 state of 2CP was investigated as a function of vibronic excitation. Phosphorescence from the ν′= 0 level persists the entire time the molecules traverse the emission detection zone. Thus the phosphorescence lifetime of the ν′ = 0 level is significantly longer than the 2 μs transit time through the viewing zone. Higher vibrational levels in the T1 state have shorter phosphorescence lifetimes, on the order of 2 μs or less. The concomitant reduction in emission quantum yield causes the higher vibronic bands (above 200 cm -1) in the PE spectrum to be weak. It is proposed that intersystem crossing to highly vibrationally excited levels of the ground state is responsible for the faster decay and diminished quantum yield. The jet cooling affords partial rotational resolution in the T1(nπ*) -S 0 spectrum of 2CP. The rotational structure of the origin band was simulated by using inertial constants available from a previously reported density functional (DFT) calculation of the T1(n,π*) state, along with spin constants obtained via a fitting procedure. Intensity parameters were also systematically varied. The optimized intensity factors support a model that identifies the S2(π,π*) -S0 transition in 2CP as the sole source of oscillator strength for the T 1(n,π*) ←S0 transition. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption; Density functional theory; Ground state; Phosphorescence; Quantum yield; Free-jet expansion; Intensity parameters; Optimized intensity factors; Phosphorescence excitation (PE) spectroscopy; Vibrationally excited levels; Ketones",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548573154

Representing rainfall data at every location as the product of the mean rainfall by the rainfall series reduced to unit average, it is shown that the regionalization of both terms should follow different ways for broad-scale modeling. Whereas the regionalization of the mean rainfall is based on its spatial continuity, it is demonstrated from the study of three French basins that are subject to different climates that the reduced rainfall data should be represented from a weighted sum of a small number of observed rainfall data (three to five) located both inside and outside the catchments to be as representative as possible at catchment scale. The reliability of peak flow modeling increases with the basin size as well as the return period of flood events provided that the rainfall is correctly regionalized, which is particularly important for real-time forecasting of rainfall and flow. This contradicts the widespread assumption that for the distributed rainfall-runoff model, the denser the network of rain samplers used as input in the models, the more accurate the broad-scale flood model will be.

Utilizing the so-called price-gap approach - the difference between the market price and the regulated price paid by consumers, Dr. Pineau concludes that market inefficiencies in Canada are gleaned from ""over-consumption"" of electricity on a per-capita basis with substantial adverse environmental impacts. More concretely, his analysis shows that as a result of existing subsidies and departures from market-based price signals, the total loss for shareholders (subsidy to consumers) is about $10 billion per year, before valuing GHG emissions. Trading electricity under market prices would allow CO2-equivalent emissions to be reduced by up to 57,000 kilotonnes-which would represent almost a third of the Kyoto reduction effort (from 2005 emission levels). From the policy perspective, Dr. Pineau's paper concludes that Canada's fossil fuel resources are managed under a market system that works-if we ignore the absence of an adequate environmental framework to deal with greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, incentives are mostly absent from Canada's electricity market, with a heavy reliance on inefficient average-cost pricing structures. This regulation maintains electricity prices at a low level and creates market distortions preventing significant economic and environmental gains to be made. First, current shareholders of regulated electricity companies do not obtain the full return on their investment because they accept much lower prices than what the market would bare. Second, these economic losses (taking the form of high electricity consumption in regulated provinces) create the need in other provinces to rely on more fossil fuel to generate electricity. He claims that under a Canadian system where market prices and trade would be used to their full extent, significantly more hydropower could be exported.",,"economic theory; electricity supply; emission control; empirical analysis; environmental impact; fossil fuel; international trade; Kyoto Protocol; price dynamics; Canada; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36049039155

Isolates were analysed by amplified 16S rDNA restriction analysis using the enzyme AluI, resulting in two different groups corresponding to different bacterial species. These species were assigned to the genera Rhodococcus and Alcaligenes, on the basis of 16S rDNA sequencing. This low degree of inter-specific biodiversity was parallel to a low intra-specific biodiversity, as shown by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA analysis. Then, a 550-bp DNA fragment coding for the inner region of alkane mono-oxygenase was PCR-amplified from the genome of each strain. The phylogenetic analysis of the sequence of the putative AlkB protein coded for by the amplified DNA fragment revealed that these alkB genes were very likely inherited by horizontal gene transfer. Lastly, the analysis of the biodegradation ability of four strains revealed two different strategies of hydrocarbon uptake, mediated either by bio-surfactants and peculiar of Rhodococcus isolates, or by membrane modifications and shown by Alcaligenes isolates. In order to understand the interrelationships between hydrocarbon-degrading isolates, the dynamics of two strains, belonging to Rhodococcus and Alcaligenes, grown together in a co-culture was also followed over a seventeen days period. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We present here results from the application of an inversion method designed to assimilate various remote sensing surface flux products, e.g. albedos from Terra and FAPAR from ENVISAT, into a a state of the art plane-parallel (2-stream) radiation transfer scheme. This method implements the adjoint and Hessian codes, generated using automatic differentiation techniques, of a cost function accounting for 1) the deviation from the prior knowledge on the model parameter values and, 2) the misfit between the remote sensing products and the 2-stream model calculations. Uncertainties associated with the products, models and priors are specified via relevant prior covariance matrices. The inversion method provides an estimate of the posterior covariance matrix on the model parameters which is further exploited to evaluate, in turn, the posterior probability density functions of the radiant fluxes simulated by the two stream model, including those that are not measured, e.g. the fraction of radiation absorbed in the ground. Applications presented here are performed using the operational MERIS FAPAR and MODIS-MISR broadband surface albedo products.","2-stream model; Adjoint and hessian codes; FAPAR","Computer simulation; Covariance matrix; Mathematical models; Probability density function; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Weather forecasting; 2-stream model; Automatic differentiation; FAPAR; Hessian codes; Radiation transfer; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36448986797

We used the chemistry-transport model CHIMERE and its adjoint to develop a new methodology that includes kriging of measurements and a dynamic spatial aggregation model taking into account surface morphology of emission fluxes and ozone plumes to determine areas where emissions are inverted. This method is first applied to a seasonal approach over the Paris area. All emission fluxes were inverted hourly for the months of July and August of years 1998 and 1999. This leads to a significant reduction of the differences between simulated and measured concentrations of ozone and NOx. The results suggest that in the first-guess inventory, NOx fluxes are overestimated in the city of Paris and underestimated in the suburban areas. For the two periods the differences between optimized and first-guess profiles are about 15%. Comparisons between time profiles showed that Mondays and Wednesdays in August had characteristics that made them differ from the other days of the week. Two intensive observation periods of the Air Pollution Over Paris Region (ESQUIF) campaign are focused on and hourly results are discussed in order to refine the climatological results.

The effects of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita on microbial biomass (C mic) and community structure (phospholipid fatty acids) in the rhizosphere of barley were studied. Inoculation densities of 2000, 4000, and 8000 nematodes were well below the threshold level for plant damage. A 13CO2 pulse-labelling was performed to assess the distribution of assimilated 13C in the rhizosphere. Infection with M. incognita increased the carbon concentration in shoots, and enhanced root biomass slightly. The presence of nematodes did not affect microbial biomass, but significantly changed the allocation of the recent photosynthate. Less plant carbon was sequestered by microorganisms with increasing nematode abundance. Microbial community structure was distinctly altered in the early stages of the plant-nematode interactions. Both, bacteria and fungi, showed a positive response with 2000, and a negative one with 4000 and 8000 M. incognita added. The results suggest that low-level root herbivory still imposes a considerable carbon demand, and that proliferation of microorganisms due to increased rhizodeposition may be short-termed. The carbon flow to rhizosphere microbial communities is likely dependent on the specific nematode-plant association and the developmental stage of the nematode in the host. © 2007 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.","Belowground herbivory; Carbon isotopes; Microorganisms; Nematodes; PLFA; Rhizodeposition","carbon; fatty acid; nitrogen; biomass allocation; carbon isotope; community dynamics; community structure; herbivory; microbial community; nematode; plant-herbivore interaction; rhizosphere; article; bacterium; carbon allocation; controlled study; fungus; herbivory; meloidogyne incognita; nematode; nonhuman; priority journal; rhizosphere; Animals; Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystem; Fatty Acids; Hordeum; Nematoda; Phospholipids; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Hordeum; Meloidogyne; Meloidogyne incognita; Meloidogyne javanica; Nematoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35948966858

However, there is currently no published literature on the interaction of building materials and ozone under such extreme conditions. It would be useful to understand, for example in the case of building re-occupation planning, what types and amounts of reaction products may form and persist in a building after ozonation. In this study, 24 materials were exposed to ozone at concentrations of 1000 ppm in the inlet stream of experimental chambers. Fifteen target carbonyls were selected and measured as building ozonation by-products (BOBPs). During the 36 h that include the 16 h ozonation and 20 h persistence phase, the total BOBP mass released from flooring and wall coverings ranged from 1 to 20 mg m-2, with most of the carbonyls being of lower molecular weight (C1-C4). In contrast, total BOBP mass released from wood-based products ranged from 20 to 100 mg m-2, with a greater fraction of the BOBPs being heavier carbonyls (C5-C9). The total BOBP mass released during an ozonation event is a function of both the total surface area of the material and the BOBP emission rate per unit area of material. Ceiling tile, carpet, office partition, and gypsum wallboard with flat latex paint often have large surface areas in commercial buildings and these same materials exhibited relatively high BOBP releases. The greatest overall BOBP mass releases were observed for three materials that building occupants might have significant contact with: paper, office partition, and medium density fiberboard, e.g., often used in office furniture. These materials also exhibited extended BOBP persistence following ozonation; some BOBPs (e.g., nonanal) persist for months or more at emission rates large enough to result in indoor concentrations that exceed their odor threshold. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The diversity of AMF was low in comparison with other ecosystems, only seven operational taxonomic units (OTU) were found in B. gracilis and all belong to the genus Glomus. The dominant OTU was closely related to the ubiquitous G. intraradices/G. fasciculatum group. N-amended plots showed a reduction in the abundance of the dominant OTU and an increase in AMF diversity.

To better illustrate the potential of the method, two cases where the latex technique was applied successfully are reported: the first one is a mummified body discovered in a shack on the outskirts of Milan and the second one is the case of a burnt corpse found in a car boot. Such a technique is versatile, easy to apply, and allows the operator to work quickly on cadavers without amputating parts, except in rare cases (i.e., burnt bodies with muscle retraction). By the latex technique, a perfect and enduring negative copy of the fingerprint is obtained, ready to be inked and photographed. The numerous copies produced this way can be inked several times allowing for the repeatability of the procedure and this is crucial in cases of problematic legal identification of corpses. In both the cases illustrated, the fingerprints obtained by the latex technique were useful for identification. The quality was good enough for the automatic fingerprint identification system research system to be applied. © 2007 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.","Fingerprinting; Fingerprints; Forensic science; Identification; Latex","latex; article; autopsy; cadaver; finger dermatoglyphics; photography; preservation; priority journal; Burns; Dermatoglyphics; Humans; Latex; Mummies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36949029153

In this work, 100 wood fragments were analysed along with 25 pollen samples and 2 coprolites, all from the same horizon. These remains revealed the presence of a mixed deciduous forest with significant numbers of Quercus (Quercetum mixtum). Thermophilous, meso-hygrothermophilous and river forest species were also present, including some taxa rarely recorded for the Pleistocene, e.g., the mesocratic group of species represented by Juglans, Carya and Platanus. Fossil wood of Aesculus was also identified; this is the first Pleistocene reference of this species in Iberia. In this open Mediterranean forest, several remarkable gymnosperms were present. For example, Pinus haploxylon-type pollen was identified, demonstrating the survival of this group of conifers during the lower Pleistocene in the Iberian Peninsula. Pollen of Taxodiaceae was also found - the first reference of this family for the Iberian Pleistocene-showing these taxa survived on the Peninsula until the lower-middle Pleistocene transition.

The inventory is established for the reference year 2000 and it has 10 km spatial resolution. Annual anthropogenic emission data obtained from official national emission inventories and from international emission databases were spatially disaggregated and allocated to a gridded domain using the top-down methodology. Source specific temporal profiles were used in order monthly and hourly emission data to be estimated. In the study area, the highest NOx amounts are emitted by the maritime and road transport sectors. Road transport has a prominent role in anthropogenic NMVOCs emissions followed by the solvent and other product use sector. The main CO emission sources are represented by the road transport sector and the non-industrial combustion plants. In the present study, the contribution of the transport sector to the total emissions of pollutants over urban and non-urban areas of Greece is investigated. Over almost all Greek urban areas, road transport is the major NMVOCs and CO emission source. Road transport contribution to NOx emissions is greater than 50% at the large urban centres of Greece.

Due to the pervasive nature of its impacts for many important aspects of human life, climate change is likely to influence and be influenced by the most diverse policy or management choices. This is particularly true for those interventions affecting agriculture and forestry: they are strongly dependent on climate phenomena, but also contribute to climate evolution being sources of and sinks for greenhouse gases (GHG). This paper offers a survey of the existing literature assessing cost-effectiveness and efficiency of greenhouse gas mitigation strategies or the effects of broader economic reforms in the agricultural and forestry sectors. The focus is mainly on European countries. Different methodological approaches, research questions addressed and results are examined. The main findings are that agriculture can potentially provide emissions reduction at a competitive cost, mainly with methane abatement, while carbon sequestration seems more cost-effective with appropriate forest management measures. Afforestation, cropland management and bioenergy are less economically viable measures due to competition with other land use. Mitigation policies should be carefully designed either to balance costs with expected benefits in terms of social welfare. Regional variability is one of the main drawbacks to fully assess the cost-effectiveness of different measures. Integration of models to take into account both social welfare and spatial heterogeneity seems to be the frontier of the next model generation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Information from genetic markers can help inform the development of conservation strategies, including those for endemic tree species. This chapter summarizes the results of recent research into the conservation genetics of tree species inhabiting temperate forests of southern Argentina and Chile, and montane forests of northern Argentina and Mexico. Pronounced genetic differences were recorded between populations of all species studied, reflecting their complex biogeographic and evolutionary histories. Species such as Araucaria, Fitzroya and Pilgerodendron appear to have survived in multiple refugia during Pleistocene glaciations, indicated by marked genetic differentiation over small geographical areas. Patterns of variation in the latter two species strongly support the suggestion of local refugia persisting east of the Andes during the last glacial period. Montane species inhabiting subtropical latitudes, such as Podocarpus parlatorei and Pinus chiapensis, appear to have migrated in elevation during periods of climatic change. In each case, the result is a complex pattern of local population differentiation and adaptation, differing markedly from north temperate tree taxa characterized by large-scale postglacial migrations. Some species, including Pinus chiapensis, Pilgerodendron uviferum and Nothofagus pumilio, displayed evidence of low genetic variation within populations, reflecting the possible occurrence of inbreeding and genetic drift as a result of population isolation. This is despite their possession of life history attributes (such as wind pollination) that imply gene flow over long distances. Results suggest that gene flow may often be restricted, even in wind-pollinated species, in fragmented forest landscapes. However, weak effects of fragmentation were measured in the self-incompatible Embothrium coccineum. In this species, higher pollinator activity in fragments reduces selfing, thereby buffering genetic erosion and maintaining adaptive variation. Such results highlight the difficulty of generalizing about the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on patterns of genetic variation in tree species. These results emphasize the importance of including many populations in conservation strategies and action plans, if the full variation within a species is to be conserved. Particular priorities for conservation include areas of high genetic diversity, which may coincide with putative glacial refugia, such as the coastal mountain range of Chile. © CAB International 2007.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891013551

The methodology developed can be extended to a region much larger than Vancouver Island. Results from the model indicate that Vancouver Island could experience blackouts in the near future unless greater name-plate capacity is developed. While wind-generated energy has the ability to contribute to the Island's power needs, the problem with wind power is its intermittency. The results indicate that wind power may not be able to prevent shortfalls, regardless of the overall name-plate capacity of the wind turbines. Further, costs of reducing CO2 emissions using wind power are unacceptably large, perhaps more than $100 per tCO2, although this might be attributable to the mix of power sources making up the Island's grid.

In particular, by applying external fields to electrically isolated (single) NWs, their emission can be localized in areas of the wire closest to the positive electrode. In a few cases, the resulting emission intensity increases over the corresponding zero-field value by nearly an order of magnitude. More often than not, factors of 2-3 are seen. Reversing the field polarity causes the emission to localize in opposite regions of the wire. Emission from individual NWs can therefore be modulated. Complementary ac electric field measurements show that the effect persists up to 500 kHz. To explain the phenomenon, the effective passivation of surface trap states by mobile carriers is speculated. This, in turn, causes local changes in the NW emission quantum yield (QY). To verify the presence of such mobile charges, both ensemble and single NW bundle electrophoresis experiments are conducted. By investigating subsequent NW rotational and translational dynamics, an estimate for the number of mobile carriers is determined. A lower limit (best case) linear charge density of ∼0.45-1.2 mobile electrons per micrometer of the wire is obtained. Apart from self-consistently explaining the field-induced NW emission modulation, the resulting data and subsequent analysis also suggests that the same mobile carriers may be the root cause of NW emission intermittency. Furthermore, given the ubiquity of stray charges, the resulting hypothesis may have additional applicability toward explaining blinking in other systems, a problem of current interest especially within the context of colloidal QDs. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Charge transfer; Electron emission; Electrophoresis; Passivation; Quantum yield; Mobile carriers; NW bundle electrophoresis experiments; NW emission intermittency; Surface trap; Nanowires; nanowire; article; chemical binding; electric conductivity; electric field; molecular dynamics; quantum mechanics; quantum yield",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35848966563

Typically, bioformation involves the initial transport and deposition of the bacteria, adhesion or release from the surface, growth and replication, cell release and translocation and the formation of biofilm. The relatively high level of nutrients in the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) explains the survival of bacteria in permeate water of industrial and municipal membranes systems. Once the initial deposition occurs an the EPS is produced, the multiple step process of bacteria growth and colonization throughout the water treatment system (WTS) becomes operationally difficult to control. Polyamide membrane system's operational performance and reliability relies pretreatment processes, membrane system design and characteristics. Pretreatment process is a critical component because it can remove microbiological activity from the feedwater, remove the nutrient source from the feedwater or a combination of both. Techniques commonly used to address the microbial activity and reduction of assimilable organic carbon include utilization of chemical residuals, ultraviolet disinfection, production of hydroxide radicals through generation of ozone, advanced oxidation processes and organic digestion followed by mechanical filtration.","Biofouling; Chlorine; Fouling; Membranes; Microorganisms; Ozone; Reverse osmosis; UV","Bacteria; Biofouling; Membranes; Organic carbon; Polyamides; Removal; Reverse osmosis; Water treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547221033

Methods: B. fragilis ATCC 25285 untreated or pretreated with sublethal concentrations of ACs (n = 25) was grown for 12 h. Susceptibility of cells pre-treated with various ACs to antibiotics and expression of resistance nodulation division family (bmeB) efflux pumps and putative marA-like global activators (PGAs) were measured. Results: Twelve aromatic ACs containing benzene or its activated derivatives (salicylate, acetaminophen, gingerol, benzoate, phenol, chlorhexidine gluconate, capsaicin, juglone, cinnamaldehyde, benzene, ibuprofen and Triton X-100) induced MAR, which was reduced by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. There was a positive correlation between the predicted degree of benzene activation and the level of induction. Deactivated benzene or non-aromatic ACs were either poor inducers or non-inducers. Efflux pumps bmeB1, 3, 4, 7 and two PGAs bfrA1 and bfrA2 were overexpressed. Expression of bfrA1 or bfrA2 in Escherichia coli caused a >2-fold increase in the MAR and overexpression of acrB, suggesting that they were putative marA orthologues. Conclusions: These data demonstrate (i) the presence of an MarA-like system(s) in B. fragilis and (ii) the propensity of benzene or its activated derivatives present in pharmaceutical products to induce MAR. © The Author 2007.

We presented continuous hourly average concentrations of 45 C2-C10 NMHCs measured in urban area of Dallas, USA from 1996 to 2004. Most of the selected compounds are good variables with less noise. The top 10 species with high ozone-generating potential were identified according to their concentrations and reactivities. The ambient concentrations of abundant anthropogenic emission hydrocarbons measured in Dallas were about 2-4 times of the background values measured in the remote areas with adjacent latitude. The time series for anthropogenic emission hydrocarbons showed an obvious seasonal cycle with relatively high concentration in winter and low concentration in summer. The sinusoidal function with a linearly decreasing factor could well fit the time series of NMHCs. The phase of seasonal cycle for the aromatic hydrocarbons of toluene, m/p xylene and o-xylene that might come from both vehicle emission and solvent utilities evaporation was about 1 month earlier than that for alkanes and alkenes that mainly came from vehicle emission. Ambient NMHCs in Dallas decreased with a stable rate during 1996-2004. For most of compounds with high ozone-generating potential, the rate of ambient concentration decrease was higher or much higher than the rate of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) source emission reduction estimated by EPA's National Emission Inventory. On weekdays, the morning hydrocarbon concentration peak was coincident with morning traffic rush time in Dallas. Another concentration peak was delayed to afternoon traffic rush time. The characteristics of VOCs sources, photochemical removal processes and atmospheric dilution could be interpreted by the diurnal variations of benzene/ethylbenzene (B/E), toluene/ethylbenzene (T/E) and xylene/ethylbenzene (X/E). The ratio of VOC/NOx measured in Dallas was substantially smaller than that calculated for USA cities. Ozone formation in Dallas was VOC sensitive. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents trends in world carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion worldwide, based on the estimates of the International Energy Agency (IEA) [IEA, 2006a. CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion 1971-2004. International Energy Agency, Paris, France]. Analyzing the drivers of CO2 emissions, the paper considers regions, types of fuel, sectors, and socio-economic indicators. The paper then examines the growing body of climate change mitigation policies and measures, both multinational and federal. Policies discussed include the Kyoto Protocol, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, and the potential measures to be implemented in 2012 and beyond. CO2 emissions of recent years have grown at the highest rates ever recorded, an observed trend incompatible with stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and avoiding long-term climate change. Within this aggregate upward trend, a comparison of emissions sources proves dynamic: while industrialized countries have so far dominated historical emissions, rapid growth in energy demand of developing economies, led by China, may soon spur their absolute emissions beyond those of industrialized countries. To provide context for the drivers of CO2 emissions, the paper examines fuel sources, from coal to biofuels, and fuel use in the production of heat and electricity, in transport, in industrial production and in households. The sectoral analysis illustrates the primacy, in terms of emissions growth and absolute emissions, of two sectors: electricity and heat generation, and transport. A discussion of several socio-economic emissions drivers complements the paper's analysis of mitigation mechanisms. As illustrated, emissions per capita and emissions per unit of economic production, as measured in gross domestic product (GDP), vary widely between regions. In this context, the paper examines the constraints and choices of energy use in two prominent developing economies: China and Brazil. This analysis of long-term trends in CO2 emissions from fuel combustion will prove useful for policymakers and energy policy analysts alike. Understanding the sources and drivers of greenhouse gas emissions is essential to their worldwide management and to the mitigation of climate change. © 2007 OECD/IEA.","Climate change; Energy; Greenhouse gas emissions","Brazil; Carbon dioxide; China; Climate change; Combustion; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Atmospheric concentrations; Fuel combustion; Sectoral analysis; Energy policy; carbon emission; climate change; combustion; energy policy; European Union; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; mitigation; policy implementation; pollution policy; trend analysis; Asia; Brazil; China; Eurasia; Far East; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548718695

The question is how to manage groundwater in order to reduce the anticipated increased hydrological risk. Furthermore the surface water quality in the Netherlands is insufficient to meet the standards of the Water Framework Directive. The required improvements are difficult to reach, because the diffuse loads of nutrients from agricultural land can not be easily reduced. This demands for innovative solutions with respect to improve the surface wa-ter quality. In this pilot study the focus is on the purification in reed fields and use it as well to reduce the effects of the anticipated climate change. An experimental evidence on a practical scale is lacking and therefore in the woodland area of Lankheet in the eastern part of the Netherlands, 3 ha has been planted with reeds to purify the river water. The aim of the study is further to store the purified water in the groundwater in order to reduce climate change effects. For the hydrological situation a scenario study was set up, using a regional hydrological model to simulate the groundwater flow together with the water flow in a network of water courses.

The most voluminous alluvial fans in the Flinders Ranges region have developed adjacent to catchments uplifted by Plio-Quaternary reverse faults, implying that young tectonic activity has exerted a first-order control on long-term sediment accumulation rates along the range front. However, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of alluvial fan sequences indicates that late Quaternary facies changes and intervals of sediment aggradation and dissection are not directly correlated with individual faulting events. Fan sequences record a transition from debris flow deposition and soil formation to clast-supported conglomeritic sedimentation by ∼30 ka. This transition is interpreted to reflect a landscape response to increasing climatic aridity, coupled with large flood events that episodically stripped previously weathered regolith from the landscape. Late Pleistocene to Holocene cycles of fan incision and aggradation post-date the youngest-dated surface ruptures and are interpreted to reflect changes in the frequency and magnitude of large floods. These datasets indicate that tectonic activity controlled long-term sediment supply but climate governed the spatial and temporal patterns of range-front sedimentation. Mild intraplate tectonism appears to have influenced Plio-Quaternary sedimentation patterns across much of the southern Australian continent, including the geometry and extent of alluvial fans and sea-level incursions. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"accumulation rate; aggradation; alluvial fan; catchment; climate; faulting; landscape evolution; sedimentation; tectonics; Australasia; Australia; Flinders Range; South Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36749074963

The decade of experience following the 1997 signing of the Kyoto Protocol suggests a far more complex process involving a wide range of policy options and varied engagement by multiple levels of governance systems. The respective experiences of the United States and Canada suggest that formal engagement in the international realm of policy is not a good indicator of domestic policy development or emissions reductions. The different contexts of intergovernmental relations, varied resources available to subnational governments for policy development and implementation, and role of subnational leaders in policy formation have emerged as important factors in explaining national differences between these North American neighbors. Consequently, climate change increasingly presents itself as a challenge not only of international relations but also of multilevel governance, thereby creating considerable opportunity to learn from domestic policy experimentation. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548363841

The nodule bacteria included two standard Rhizobium leguminosarum strains, two standard Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains, and one unknown nodule bacterial strain that was locally isolated from Vicia faba nodules. The PGPR included one standard Serratia liquefaciens strain and two locally isolated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Flavobacterium sp. The pure hydrocarbons tested included n-alkanes with chain lengths from C9 to C40 and the aromatic hydrocarbons benzene, biphenyle, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and toluene. Quantitative gas liquid chromatographic analyses confirmed that pure cultures of representative nodule bacteria and PGPR could attenuate n-octadecane and phenanthrene in the surrounding nutrient medium. Further, intact nodules of V. faba containing bacteria immobilized on and within those nodules reduced hydrocarbon levels in a medium in which those nodules were shaken. It was concluded that legume crops are suitable phytoremediation tools for oily soil, since they enrich such soils not only with fixed nitrogen, but also with hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms.

The presence of n-C4H10 in the mixture considerably reduces CH4 solubility. For example, CH4 solubility (in the limit of zero CH4 fugacity) at 25°C decreases from 4.0 (pure gas) to 0.78 cm3(STP)/(cm3 polymer atm) in the presence of n-C4H10 at an activity of 0.60. At -20 °C, CH4 solubility decreases by almost an order of magnitude, from 10.2 (pure gas) to 1.22 cm3(STP)/(cm3 polymer atm) in the presence of n-C4H10 at an activity of 0.61. In contrast, n-C4H10 mixture sorption properties are not measurably affected by the presence of CH4. The dual mode sorption model parameters for CH4 and n-C4H10 in PTMSP were determined from pure and mixed gas sorption measurements, and this model can adequately describe the sorption data. The n-C4H10/CH4 mixed gas solubility selectivity in PTMSP decreases as temperature increases and as n-C4H10 activity increases. For example, at 25 °C, the n-C4H10/CH4 solubility selectivity decreases from 250 to 120 as n-C4H10 activity increases from 0.02 to 0.25. At -20 °C and an n-C4H10 activity of 0.24, the n-C4H10/CH4 solubility selectivity is 590. Penetrant-induced volume dilation of PTMSP can be adequately modeled by assuming that all swelling is caused by penetrant molecules sorbed in the polymer's dense equilibrium region (i.e., the Henry's law region) during sorption. However, the best fit partial molar volumes in the Henry's law region for the dilation data are considerably lower than the penetrant partial molar volumes in liquids, suggesting that further theoretical efforts are needed to develop predictive models of volume dilation in high free volume glassy polymers. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The tests are conducted using each of the above fuel blends or neat diesel fuel, with the engine working at a speed of 2000 rpm and at four different loads. In each test, combustion chamber and fuel injection pressure diagrams are obtained using a specially developed, high-speed, data acquisition and processing system. A heat release analysis of the experimentally obtained cylinder pressure diagrams is developed and used, with the pertinent application of the energy and state equations. From the analysis results, plots of the history in the combustion chamber of the gross heat release rate and other related parameters reveal some very interesting features, which shed light on the combustion mechanism when using these blends. Moreover, for each test, volumetric fuel consumption, exhaust smokiness and exhaust regulated gas emissions are measured. The differences in the performance and exhaust emission parameters from the baseline operation of the diesel engine, i.e., when working with neat diesel fuel, are determined and compared.

Previous studies have indicated that the 372.4 GHz ground transition of ortho-H2D+ might be a powerful probe of ProtoPlanetary Disks. The line could be especially suited for study of the disk mid-plane, where the bulk of the mass resides and where planet formation takes place. Aims. Provide detailed theoretical predictions for the line intensity, profile and maps expected for representative disk models. Methods. We determine the physical and chemical structure of the disks from the model developed by Ceccarelli &amp; Dominik (2005, A&amp;A, 440, 583). The line emission is computed with the new radiative transfer method developed recently by Elitzur &amp; Asensio Ramos (2006, MNRAS, 365, 779). Results. We present intensity maps convolved with the expected ALMA resolution, which delineate the origin of the H2D+ 372.4 GHz line. In the disk inner regions, the line probes the conditions in the mid-plane out to radial distances of a few tens of AU, where Solar-like planetary systems might form. In the disk outermost regions, the line originates from slightly above the mid-plane. When the disk is spatially resolved, the variation of line profile across the image provides important information about the velocity field. Spectral profiles of the entire disk flux show a double peak shape at most inclination angles. Conclusions. Our study confirms that the 372.4 GHz H2D+ line provides powerful diagnostics of the mid-plane of Proto-Planetary Disks. Current submillimeter telescopes are capable of observing this line, though with some difficulties. The future ALMA interferometer will have the sensitivity to observe and even spatially resolve the H2D+ line emission. © ESO 2007.","Stars: circumstellar matter; Stars: formation; Stars: planetary systems: protoplanetary disks","Computational methods; Interferometers; Mathematical models; Planets; Structure (composition); Stars: circumstellar matter; Stars: formation; Stars: planetary systems: protoplanetary disks; Electromagnetic wave emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547958158

During its years as a protest movement, the ANC came to embrace 'non-racialism', a doctrine emphasising a common South African identity, in order to provide a counter-rhetoric to the racially exclusive doctrine of apartheid. However, the organisation had difficulty in garnering support from the Indian and Coloured communities during the transition to democratic rule. It increasingly adopted a multiculturalist conception of the South African nation and promoted the idea of the 'rainbow nation' in order to foster a sense of unity among South Africa's diverse population groups. This multicultural conception of the South African nation has met with some success. The majority of Indians voted for the ANC in the 2004 elections, shifting their political loyalties from the National and Democratic Parties in previous elections. This trend demonstrates an increasing identification among Indians with the African majority government. However, in spite of the ANC's success in courting the Indian vote in the 2004 elections, Indian-African tensions have been fuelled by recent anti-Indian rhetoric. The paper argues that a multiculturalism that does not address the material conditions that fuel class antagonisms will prove to be shallow in the present neo-liberal policy climate. © 2007 by the Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG.","Class; Gandhi; Identity; Indians; Multiculturalism; Nationalism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548414120

Methods and Results: Entodinium caudatum, Isotricha intestinalis, Metadinium medium, and Eudiplodinium maggii from monofaunated wethers and mixed protozoa from conventional wethers were obtained by centrifugation, re-suspended at their normal densities in rumen fluid supernatants from defaunated or conventional wethers and incubated in vitro. The presence of protozoa increased the concentration of ammonia and altered the volatile fatty acids balance with more acetate and butyrate produced at the expense of propionate. Differences among species were observed, notably in the production of methane, which increased with E. caudatum as compared to other ciliates and to defaunated and mixed protozoa treatments (P < 0.05). The increased methanogenesis was not correlated to protozoal biomass indicating that the metabolism of this protozoan and/or its influence on the microbial ecosystem was responsible for this effect. Conclusions: Entodinium caudatum stimulated the production of methane, a negative effect that was reinforced by a concomitant increase in protein degradation. Significance and Impact of the Study: Comparison of individual species of protozoa highlighted the particular influence of E. caudatum on rumen fermentation. Its elimination (targeted defaunation) from the rumen could reduce methane production without affecting feed degradation. © 2007 The Authors.","Entodinium caudatum; Eudiplodinium maggii; Fermentation; Isotricha intestinalis; Metadinium medium; Methane; Protozoa; Rumen","fatty acid; methane; Centrifugation; Degradation; Methane; Protozoa; Substrates; biodegradation; fatty acid; fermentation; metabolism; methanogenesis; microbial community; protozoan; ruminant; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; biomass; centrifugation; controlled study; Entodinium caudatum; eudiplodinium maggii; fermentation; in vitro study; isotricha intestinalis; metadinium medium; methanogenesis; nonhuman; protozoon; ruminant stomach; supernatant; Acetic Acid; Ammonia; Animals; Bacteria; Butyrates; Ecosystem; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Methane; Propionic Acids; Protozoa; Rumen; Ruminants; Ciliophora; Entodinium caudatum; Eudiplodinium maggii; Isotricha intestinalis; Metadinium medium; Protozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36348936139

Waste fines, representing more than 20% of current US crushed limestone production (&gt;109 tonnes/yr), could provide an inexpensive or free source of AWL carbonate. With limestone transportation then as the dominant cost variable, CO2 mitigation costs of $3-$4/tonne appear to be possible in certain locations. Perhaps 10-20% of US point-source CO2 emissions could be mitigated in this fashion. It is experimentally shown that CO2 sequestration rates of 10-6 to 10-5 moles/sec per m2 of limestone surface area are achievable, with reaction densities on the order of 10-2 tonnes CO2 m-3day-1, highly dependent on limestone particle size, solution turbulence and flow, and CO2 concentration.

The present study aims to estimate the mitigation potential for a large diverse country such as India, based on the GTAP global land classification system of agro-ecological zones (AEZs), as well the Indian AEZ system. The study also estimates the implications of carbon price incentive (US$50 and $100) on mitigation potential in the short-, medium- and long-term, since afforestation and reforestation (A & R) is constrained by lack of investment and financial incentives. The mitigation potential for short and long rotation plantations and natural regeneration was estimated using the GCOMAP global forest model for two land area scenarios. One scenario included only wastelands (29 Mha), and the second enhanced area scenario, included wastelands plus long fallow and marginal croplands (54 Mha). Under the $100 carbon price case, significant additional area (3.6 Mha under the wasteland scenario and 6.4 Mha under the enhanced area scenario) and carbon mitigation is gained in the short-term (2025) compared to the baseline when using the GTAP land classification system. The area brought under A & R increases by 85-100% for the $100 carbon price compared to $50 carbon price in the short-term, indicating the effectiveness of higher carbon price incentives, especially in the short-term. A comparison of estimates of mitigation potential using GTAP and Indian AEZ land classification systems showed that in the short-term, 35% additional C-stock gain is achieved in the $100 carbon price case in the enhanced area scenario of the Indian AEZ system. This difference highlights the role of the land classification system adopted in estimation of aggregate mitigation potential estimates, particularly in the short-term.

The presence of CO2 in the upper airway lumen evokes a number of reflexes which favour upper airway re-opening, and we have proposed previously that CO2 would build up in the upper airway following airway collapse and that this would contribute to reflex airway re-opening. However, it is not known if CO2 can transfer from the alveoli to the anatomical dead space of the upper airway during apnoea. Objectives: To determine if alveolar CO2 can enter the upper airway during breath-holds and Muller manoeuvres. Material and Methods: With local ethics committee approval, 6 male volunteers (aged 22-48 years), following a quiet inspiration, carried out breath-holds and Muller manoeuvres until breaking point. CO2 was measured continuously in samples obtained from the hypopharynx using an infrared analyser with a sample rate of 50 ml/min. Muller manoeuvres (forced inspirations against a closed upper airway) mimic the respiratory efforts which occur during obstructive apnoeas. Results: In all cases, CO2 increased progressively during apnoeas. There was a much larger increase in Muller manoeuvres (3.78 ± 0.51%, mean ± SEM at breaking point) compared to breath-holds. Discussion: These results show that upper airway CO2 concentration rises substantially during apnoeas and suggest that transfer of CO2 from the lungs to the upper airway may evoke a number of reflex effects which could affect breathing and upper airway re-opening during obstructive apnoeas.

These incentives yielded native species reforestation programs throughout the country. This research aims to provide information about growth, carbon sequestration, and management of seven native tree species (Vochysia guatemalensis, Vochysia ferruginea, Hyeronima alchorneoides, Calophyllum brasiliense, Terminalia amazonia, Virola koschnyi, and Dipteryx panamensis) growing in small and medium-sized plantations in the Caribbean and Northern lowlands of Costa Rica. A total of 179 plots were evaluated in 32 farms. Overall, I found that V. guatemalensis, V. ferruginea, H. alchorneoides, and T. amazonia were the species with the fastest diameter, total height, and volume growth; and T. amazonia and D. panamensis sequestered more carbon. Moreover, I found that the plantations that had been thinned before this assessment had the best growth. The results of the present research enhance the criteria elaborated in previous research findings to improve species choices for reforestation and silvicultural management in Costa Rica and in other regions with similar ecological features. Furthermore, they support the concept that tropical plantations can serve diverse economic, social, and ecological functions that may ultimately help reduce atmospheric CO2 accumulation. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Aboveground biomass; Allometric equations; Environmental services; Productivity; Silvicultural management; Timber production","Biodiversity; Carbon; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Aboveground biomass; Allometric equations; Environmental services; Silvicultural management; Timber production; Forestry; carbon sequestration; dicotyledon; governance approach; growth rate; humid environment; incentive; management practice; native species; plantation; reforestation; silviculture; thinning; Biodiversity; Biomass; Chelation; Ecology; Reforestation; Silviculture; Central America; Costa Rica; Calophyllum; Calophyllum brasiliense; Dipteryx odorata; Dipteryx panamensis; Hyeronima alchorneoides; Terminalia; Terminalia amazonia; Virola koschnyi; Vochysia ferruginea; Vochysia guatemalensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248679262

The transmitted signal of this driver is shaped with a predefined slope so as to reduce electromagnetic emission at higher frequencies. The effect of EMI coupling from the data bus into the driver circuit is countered using a new feedback scheme which shields the slope shaping function from the output stage. Although the output signal may be heavily corrupted by EMI, the LIN driver continues to deliver an unaltered duty cycle, which is mandatory to obtain an error-free data transmission.

Two prototypes of the new carbon-filtered PREP Marlboro UltraSmooth (MUS) were investigated using both standard (FTC/ISO) and intensive (Health Canada) machine methods to measure gas/vapor- and particulate-phase smoke constituents. Basic physical design characteristics that may influence smoke constituent yields, such as ventilation, pressure drop (resistance to draw), quantity of tobacco, and quantity and type of carbon, were measured. The possible presence of added chemical flavorant compounds was investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. MUS prototypes were found to have several key differences in physical design compared with a conventional cigarette, including higher ventilation, lower draw resistance, and in the case of the Salt Lake City prototype, the use of vitreous carbon beads and the presence of chemical flavorants on both the beads and an embedded filter fiber. When tested under the standard regimen, gas-phase constituents of MUS prototypes were reduced compared with a conventional low-yield cigarette. However, far smaller reductions in gas-phase constituents were observed under the intensive regimen, suggesting that the carbon technology used in MUS is less effective when smoked under more intensive conditions. Particulate-phase constituents were not reduced by the carbon filter under either machine-smoking regimen. The data suggest that MUS has been designed to reduce toxic yields while preserving consumer appeal.

Here we use data from 2021 species at 175 sites around the world from the GLOPNET compilation to show that key physiological traits that are difficult to measure (such as photosynthetic capacity) can be predicted from simple qualitative plant characteristics, climate information, easily measured (""soft"") leaf traits, or all of these in combination. The qualitative plant functional type (PFT) attributes examined are phylogeny (angiosperm or gymnosperm), growth form (grass, herb, shrub, or tree), and leaf phenology (deciduous vs. evergreen). These three PFT attributes explain between one-third and two-thirds of the variation in each of five quantitative leaf ecophysiological traits: specific leaf area (SLA), leaf life span, mass-based net photosynthetic capacity (Amass), nitrogen content (Nmass), and phosphorus content (Pmass). Alternatively, the combination of four simple, widely available climate metrics (mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, mean vapor pressure deficit, and solar irradiance) explain only 5-20% of the variation in those same five leaf traits. Adding the climate metrics to the qualitative PFTs as independent factors in the model increases explanatory power by 3-11% for the five traits. If a single easily measured leaf trait (SLA) is also included in the model along with qualitative plant traits and climate metrics, an additional 5-25% of the variation in the other four other leaf traits is explained, with the models accounting for 62%, 65%, 66%, and 73% of global variation in N mass, Pmass, Amass, and leaf life span, respectively. Given the wide availability of the summary climate data and qualitative PFT data used in these analyses, they could be used to explain roughly half of global variation in the less accessible leaf traits (A mass, leaf life span, Nmass, Pmass); this can be augmented to two-thirds of all variation if climatic and PFT data are used in combination with the readily measured trait SLA. This shows encouraging possibilities of progress in developing general predictive equations for macro-ecology, global scaling, and global modeling. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Leaf life span; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Photosynthesis; Plant functional type; Specific leaf area","climate effect; data set; ecological modeling; ecophysiology; grass; herb; leaf area; nitrogen; phenology; phosphorus; photosynthesis; phylogeny; phytochemistry; vegetation structure; Gymnospermae; Magnoliophyta; nitrogen; phosphorus; rain; article; climate; factual database; forecasting; growth, development and aging; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plant; plant leaf; sunlight; temperature; Climate; Databases, Factual; Forecasting; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plants; Rain; Sunlight; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36048989994

Extended grazing of cattle and technical and organisational manure application measures offer the most effective abatement potential. The combination of the different abatement measures results in estimated technically possible and realistically feasible reduction potentials of approximately 33% and 20%, respectively, of the NH3 emissions from agriculture. Substantial differences in the abatement potential of measures were observed between altitudinal zones.

We examine the combined effects of changes in climate, increases in carbon dioxide (CO2), and changes in tropospheric ozone on crop, pasture, and forest lands and the consequences for the global and regional economies. We examine scenarios where there is limited or little effort to control these substances, and policy scenarios that limit emissions of CO2 and ozone precursors. We find the effects of climate and CO2 to be generally positive, and the effects of ozone to be very detrimental. Unless ozone is strongly controlled, damage could offset CO2 and climate benefits.

The simulated results showed that elevated O3 could result in a mean 4.5% reduction in NPP and 0.9% reduction in total carbon storage nationwide from 1961 to 2000. The reduction of carbon storage varied from 0.1 Tg C to 312 Tg C (a decreased rate ranging from 0.2% to 6.9%) among plant functional types. The effects of tropospheric O3 on NPP were strongest in east-central China. Significant reductions in NPP occurred in northeastern and central China where a large proportion of cropland is distributed. The O3 effects on carbon fluxes and storage are dependent upon other environmental factors. Therefore direct and indirect effects of O3, as well as interactive effects with other environmental factors, should be taken into account in order to accurately assess the regional carbon budget in China. The results showed that the adverse influences of increasing O3 concentration across China on NPP could be an important disturbance factor on carbon storage in the near future, and the improvement of air quality in China could enhance the capability of China's terrestrial ecosystems to sequester more atmospheric CO2. Our estimation of O3 impacts on NPP and carbon storage in China, however, must be used with caution because of the limitation of historical tropospheric O3 data and other uncertainties associated with model parameters and field experiments.

The analysis was made by following the applicable methodologies and based on publicly available data from official and other sources on the websites. The results show that with the electricity displacement potential at 260,253 MWh, Indonesia could generate Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reductions as much as 240,774 (large scale) or 198,177 tCO2 (small scale) per annum from the recently-employed low efficiency cogeneration leading to the earnings of about US$1.36 or 1.12 million, respectively. Out of 6 regional grids where the electricity from the project activities can be grid-connected, the primary emission reductions potentials are encountered in Java-Bali and Southern Sumatera grids.

However, studies of tree ring growth have revealed trends thought to result from either physiological changes or changes in the climate-growth relationship. We investigated whether or not similar trends exist for tree ring stable isotopic ratios using a statistical approach. Correlations between climate (temperature and precipitation amount) and tree ring cellulose δ13C and δ 18O of oak and pine from Ticino, Switzerland, were calculated for the period AD 1660-2000. Climate calibration of tree rings was enabled by long-term monthly resolved temperature and precipitation data sets on the basis of instrumental and documentary proxy data. Overall, five findings have been identified: (1) Isotopic ratios in tree rings most strongly reflect conditions of the current growing season, (2) temporally stable climate signals are found in pine δ13C only, (3) all other correlations between tree ring isotopes and climate are temporally unstable and characterized by shifts in correlation sign and strength, (4) climate signals in oak are strongest in the 20th century, and (5) tree ring δ13C reflects local climatic conditions while δ180 is influenced by large-scale synoptic circulation. The nonstationary relationships observed could reflect changes in the relationship between the climate variables or a physiological adaptation to warmer conditions.

This increase is due to several factors like decreasing the dependence on imported petroleum; providing a market for the excess production of vegetable oils and animal fats; using renewable and biodegradable fuels; reducing global warming due to its closed carbon cycle by CO2 recycling; increasing lubricity; and reducing substantially the exhaust emissions of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and particulate emissions from diesel engines. However, there are major drawbacks in the use of biofuel blends as NOx tends to be higher, the intervals of motor parts replacement such as fuel filters are reduced and degradation by chronic exposure of varnish deposits in fuel tanks and fuel lines, paint, concrete, and paving occurs as some materials are incompatible. Here, fuel additives become indispensable tools not only to decrease these drawbacks but also to produce specified products that meet international and regional standards like EN 14214, ASTM D 6751, and DIN EN 14214, allowing the fuels trade to take place. Additives improve ignition and combustion efficiency, stabilize fuel mixtures, protect the motor from abrasion and wax deposition, and reduce pollutant emissions, among other features. Two basic trends are becoming more relevant: the progressive reduction of sulfur content and the increased use of biofuels. Several additives' compositions may be used as long as they keep the basic chemical functions that are active. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Biodiesel; Cost reduction; Diesel engines; Ethanol; Fuel filters; Ignition; Nitrogen oxides; Standards; Closed carbon cycle; Exhaust emissions; Lubricity; Fuel additives",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547778958

In the southeastern United States, this is expected to include increased precipitation and more frequent extreme precipitation events, resulting in more freshwater runoff into coastal habitats. Marine and estuarine communities in this region can expect more frequent and larger salinity reductions if climate change model predictions are realized. We studied a benthic harpacticoid copepod to test the effects of environmental variability, in the form of estuarine salinity reductions, on vital rates. Specifically, we tested the effects of 3-day salinity reductions on the harpacticoid copepod Amphiascus tenuiremis. We varied the magnitude of salinity reduction (pre-storm: 30‰, reduced to 10 or 15‰) and the timing of salinity reduction relative to life stage (naupliar, copepodite, adult). Survival and fecundity decreased with salinity reductions of greater magnitude and with exposure during earlier life stages. An age-classified Leslie matrix model constructed using these data predicted lower population growth rates with exposure to salinity reduction of greater magnitude or during an earlier life stage, although this trend was not significant. We modeled the effects of environmental variability on copepods using a 98-year salinity record for coastal South Carolina. Population growth rate was highly variable in short-term simulations (3-week, 10-week), depending upon the salinity levels dictated in simulations by the natural salinity record. Cohorts ""born"" into a sequence with little or no salinity reduction had higher population growth rates than cohorts that experienced salinity reduction during a simulation. The greater the frequency of salinity reduction, the lower the population growth rate of that cohort. If climate change models are correct in predicting greater frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as precipitation and estuarine salinity reductions, then benthic copepod populations are likely to have even lower population growth rates than those described here, which could include population declines.

LDGVs emitted PAH isomers of MW 302, 326, 350, and 374, while the HDDV did not emit these compounds. This suggests that large PAHs may be useful tracers for the source apportionment of gasoline-powered motor vehicle exhaust in the atmosphere. Emission rates of MW 302, 326, and 350 isomers from LDGVs equipped with three-way catalysts (TWCs) ranged from 2 to 10 (μg L-1 fuel burned), while emissions from LDGVs classified as low emission vehicles (LEVs) were almost a factor of 10 lower. MW 374 PAH isomers were not quantified due to the lack of a quantification-grade standard. The reduced emissions associated with the LEVs are likely attributable to improved vapor recovery during the ""cold-start"" phase of the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) driving cycle before the catalyst reaches operating temperature. Approximately 2 (μg g-1 PM) of MW 326 and 350 PAH isomer groups were found in the National Institute of Standards and Technology standard reference material (SRM)#1649 (Urban Dust). The pattern of the MW 302, 326, and 350 isomers detected in SRM#1649 qualitatively matched the ratio of these compounds detected in the exhaust of TWC LDGVs suggesting that each gram of Urban Dust SRM contained 5-10 mg of PM originally emitted from gasoline-powered motor vehicles. Large PAHs made up 24% of the total LEV PAH emissions and 39% of the TWC PAH emissions released from gasoline-powered motor vehicles. Recent studies have shown certain large PAH isomers have greater toxicity than benzo[a]pyrene. Even though the specific toxicity measurements on PAHs with MW &gt;302 have yet to be performed, the detection of significant amounts of MW 326 and 350 PAHs in motor vehicle exhaust in the current study suggests that these compounds may pose a significant public health risk. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Used in the continuous mode, the CO2 laser can cut and coagulate simultaneously. Used in the pulsed mode, the CO2 laser is a powerful tool for epidermal ablation in many different contexts both therapeutic and cosmetic. Both the CO2 and Erbium YAG lasers emit light in the infrared spectrum. Energy is preferentially absorbed by intracellular water creating rapid heating and vaporization of tissue. Because of the wavelength of the Er:YAG laser (2940nm) more closely approximates the absorption peak of water (3000nm) the target chromophore than the CO2 laser (10,600nm) nearly all of the energy is absorbed in the epidermis and papillary dermis yielding superficial ablation and less underlying thermal damage. The advantages, disadvantages, and applications of each type of laser resurfacing will be discussed. Despite proven efficacy, the public acceptance of laser resurfacing has declined with the emergence of new laser systems that cause dermal remodeling without ablating the overlying epidermis dramatically reducing recovery time.

CO2 and CH4 exchange was measured at the plant community scale with chambers and at the ecosystem scale with the eddy covariance (EC) technique. Community-scale measurements were upscaled to the ecosystem scale by weighting the community-specific estimates by the area of the community. All communities were net CO2 sinks and CH4 sources during the growing season, but net ecosystem production (NEP) and CH4 emissions ranged from 21 to 190 g CO2-C m-2 and from 4.3 to 13 g CH4-C m-2, respectively, between the communities. The seasonal estimates of NEP and CH4, upscaled to the 200 m radius from the EC tower, were 82 and 7.9 g CH4 -C m-2, which agreed well with the EC measurements. As the communities differed markedly in their C gas dynamics, their proportions controlled the ecosystem scale estimates.

This target is chosen in order to test the potential of biofuel assets in Sweden, facilitating the transition to renewable fuel systems, and to display the potential of transport energy demand at macrolevel under tighter conditions on the energy market after fossil oil production has peaked. The distribution of bioenergy to the transport sector, including conversion losses and relationships to other energy sectors, is analysed explicitly. State-of-the-art traffic forecasting models, complemented with a specially designed energy quantification model, are applied to assess energy quantities needed at different vehicle efficiency levels and mobility patterns. The purpose is not to determine the most energy-efficient transport system possible, or to forecast the optimal distribution of bioenergy set aside for the transport sector in the future. Rather, we try to visualise, at a more conceptual level, energy demand as dependent on principle transport strategies, future technological developments and a type of planning that takes technological interlinkages between evolving components into strategic account.

This study explores the implications for biome C pool sizes and global C fluxes. It predicts a root C pool of at least 268 Pg, 68% larger than previously thought. Although still a low-precision estimate (owing to the uncertainties of biome-scale measurements), a global root C pool this large implies stronger land C sinks, particularly in tropical and temperate forests, shrubland and savanna. The land sink predicted from revised C inventories is 2.7 Pg yr-1. This is 0.1 Pg yr -1 larger than current estimates, within the uncertainties associated with global C fluxes, but conflicting with a smaller sink (2.4 Pg yr -1) estimated from C balance. Sink estimates derived from C inventories and C balance match, however, if global soil C is assumed to be declining by 0.4-0.7% yr-1, rates that agree with long-term regional rates of soil C loss. Either possibility, a stronger land C sink or widespread soil C loss, argues that these features of the global C cycle should be reassessed to improve the accuracy and precision of C flux and pool estimates at both global and biome scales. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Biome; Carbon; Global; Root; Sink; Soil","carbon; biomass; carbon cycle; carbon sink; estimation method; forest; nutrient dynamics; root; savanna; shrubland; soil carbon; article; biomass; biome; carbon dynamics; data analysis; prediction; priority journal; soil analysis; soil chemistry; source sink relationship",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35048900112

Federal and state regulations aiming at controlling these emissions require refineries and petrochemical plants in the United States to implement a Leak Detection and Repair Program (LDAR). The current regulatory work practice, U.S. Environment Protection Agency Method 21, requires designated components to be monitored individually at regular intervals. The annual costs of these LDAR programs in a typical refinery can exceed US$1,000,000. Previous studies have shown that a majority of controllable fugitive emissions come from a very small fraction of components. The Smart LDAR program aims to find cost-effective methods to monitor and reduce emissions from these large leakers. Optical gas imaging has been identified as one such technology that can help achieve this objective. This paper discusses a refinery evaluation of an instrument based on backscatter absorption gas imaging technology. This portable camera allows an operator to scan components more quickly and image gas leaks in real time. During the evaluation, the instrument was able to identify leaking components that were the source of 97% of the total mass emissions from leaks detected. More than 27,000 components were monitored. This was achieved in far less time than it would have taken using Method 21. In addition, the instrument was able to find leaks from components that are not required to be monitored by the current LDAR regulations. The technology principles and the parameters that affect instrument performance are also discussed in the paper.

The selection of input parameters is based on their potential to affect concentration levels of ozone and PM2.5 predicted by the model and to reflect changes in emissions due to the implementation of distributed generation (DG) in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) of California. Numerical simulations are performed with the CIT air quality model. Response of the CIT predictions to the variation of selected input parameters is investigated to separate the potential air quality impacts of DG from model uncertainty. This study provides a measure of the model errors for selected species concentrations. A spatial sensitivity analysis is used to investigate the effect of placing DG in specific regions of the SoCAB. In general, results show that confidence in the model results is greatest in locations where ozone and PM2.5 concentrations are the highest. Changes no greater than 80% in the nominal values of selected input variables, cause changes of 18% in ozone mixing ratios and 25% for PM2.5 aerosol concentrations. Sensitivity analysis reveals that nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions and side boundary conditions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) are the major contributors to uncertainty and sensitivity of ozone predictions. An increase in NOx emissions leads to reductions in ozone mixing ratios at peak times and sites where the maximum values are located. PM2.5 aerosol is most sensitive to changes in NH3 and NOx emissions. Increasing these emissions leads to higher aerosol concentrations. Sensitivity analyses show that the impacts of DG implementation are highly dependent on both space and time. In particular, ozone concentrations are reduced during the nighttime nearby locations where DGs are installed. However, during the daytime ozone concentrations increase downwind from the sources. A major finding of this study is that the emissions of DG installed in coastal areas produce a significant impact on the production of ozone and PM2.5 aerosol in the eastern regions of the SoCAB. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to assess the source contributions to a given site, chemical mass balance (CMB) modeling is typically used together with source-specific profiles for organic and inorganic constituents. Yet, the mass balance closure can be achieved only if emission profiles for all major sources are considered. While a higher degree of mass balance closure has been achieved by adding individual organic marker compounds to elements, ions, EC, and organic carbon (OC), major source profiles for fugitive dust are not available. Consequently, neither the exposure of the population living near fugitive dust sources from farm land, nor its chemical composition is known. Surface soils from crop fields are enriched in plant detritus from both above and below ground plant parts; therefore, surface soil dust contains natural organic compounds from the crops and soil microbiota. Here, surface soils derived from fields growing cotton, safflower, tomato, almonds, and grapes have been analyzed for more than 180 organic compounds, including natural lipids, saccharides, pesticides, herbicides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). The major result of this study is that selective biogenically derived organic compounds are suitable markers of fugitive dust from major agricultural crop fields in the San Joaquin Valley. Aliphatic homologs exhibit the typical biogenic signatures of epicuticular plant waxes and are therefore indicative of fugitive dust emissions and mechanical abrasion of wax protrusions from leaf surfaces. Saccharides, among which α- and β-glucose, sucrose, and mycose show the highest concentrations in surface soils, have been proposed to be generic markers for fugitive dust from cultivated land. Similarly, steroids are strongly indicative of fugitive dust. Yet, triterpenoids reveal the most pronounced distribution differences for all types of cultivated soils examined here and are by themselves powerful markers for fugitive dust that allow differentiation between the types of crops cultivated. PAHs are also found in some surface soils, as well as persistent pesticides, e.g., DDE, Fosfall, and others. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective is to model the effects of policies designed to induce landowners to change land use and management patterns with a view to sequester carbon or to reduce deforestation. The approach uses the spatially explicit Dynamic Integrated Model of Forestry and Alternative Land Use (DIMA) to quantify the economic potential of global forests. The model chooses which of the land-use processes (afforestation, reforestation, deforestation, or conservation and management options) would be applied in a specific location, based on land prices, cost of forest production and harvesting, site productivity, population density, and estimates of economic growth. The approach is relevant in that it (1) couples a revised and updated version of the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios with the dynamic development of climate policy implications through integration with the Model for Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives and their General Environmental Impact (MESSAGE); (2) is spatially explicit on a 0.5° grid; and (3) is constrained by guaranteeing food security and land for urban development. As outputs, DIMA produces 100-year forecasts of land-use change, carbon sequestration, impacts of carbon incentives (e.g., avoided deforestation), biomass for bioenergy, and climate policy impacts. The modeling results indicate that carbon sequestration policies could contribute to a significant part of the global portfolio of efficient climate mitigation policies, dependent upon carbon prices. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Such systems exclude the use of synthetic fertilisers, whilst aiming to optimise internal nutrient cycling. The low availability of manures, particularly in dry areas, can lead to negative nutrient balances in many organic farming systems. Such negative nutrient balances are mainly found for P and K. In this paper, we aim to study the availability of P in irrigated and rainfed semiarid Mediterranean grassy crops with long-term organic and conventional farming practices. NaHCO3 extracts were prepared from an array of soils from 16 plots, covering organic and conventional management in rainfed and irrigated conditions. Inorganic (NaHCO3-Pi) and organic P (NaHCO3-Po) were analysed in the extracts and related to soil properties (carbonate content, pH, organic C and N content). Rainfed, organically managed soils showed low P availability compared to conventionally managed soils. However, organically managed irrigated soils showed slightly higher NaHCO3-Pi than conventional soils. This is due to the fertilisation regime applied to the irrigated, organically managed systems. Such systems received four-fold the amount of manure applied to organically managed rainfed soils. In soils with low P availability, NaHCO3-Pi was largely depleted while NaHCO3-Po remained nearly unchanged. In soils with good or moderate P availability, NaHCO3-Pi appeared mainly to be regulated by soil organic matter (organic C and N). In conditions of low P availability, NaHCO3-Pi was mainly regulated by chemical processes related to soil pH and carbonate content. The regulation of NaHCO3-Po was less clear. Under low P availability, NaHCO3-Pi depletion occurred mainly in soils with high organic C and N and low pH. In low P soils with a high pH and carbonate content, NaHCO3-Pi appeared to be geochemically protected. In calcareous soils, management practices need to increase or maintain the level of soil organic C to facilitate mobilisation of the P reserve. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Simultaneously, a strong global trend towards urbanisation of poverty exists, with increased challenges for urban populations and local governance to protect and sustain the well-being of growing cities. In the context of these 2 overarching trends, interdisciplinary research at the city scale is prioritised for understanding the social impacts of climate change and variability and for the evaluation of strategies in the built environment that might serve as adaptive responses to climate change. This article discusses 2 recent initiatives of The Earth Institute at Columbia University (EI) as examples of research that integrates the methods and objectives of several disciplines, including environmental health science and urban planning, to understand the potential public health impacts of global climate change and mitigative measures for the more localised effects of the urban heat island in the New York City metropolitan region. These efforts embody 2 distinct research approaches. The New York Climate & Health Project created a new integrated modeling system to assess the public health impacts of climate and land use change in the metropolitan region. The Cool City Project aims for more applied policy-oriented research that incorporates the local knowledge of community residents to understand the costs and benefits of interventions in the built environment that might serve to mitigate the harmful impacts of climate change and variability, and protect urban populations from health stressors associated with summertime heat. Both types of research are potentially useful for understanding the impacts of environmental change at the urban scale, the policies needed to address these challenges, and to train scholars capable of collaborative approaches across the social and biophysical sciences.","Adaptation; Cities; Planning; Urban heat island","city planning; climate change; cost benefit analysis; environment; environmental change; environmental health; global change; health status; land use; medical research; population; public health; review; summer; thermal exposure; United States; urban area; urbanization; wellbeing; City Planning; Environment; Environment Design; Greenhouse Effect; New York City; Research; Urban Health",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148988786

The New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP), the agency responsible for managing New York City's (NYC) water supply, sewer, and wastewater treatment systems, has developed a climate risk management framework through its Climate Change Task Force, a government-university collaborative effort. Its purpose is to ensure that NYCDEP's strategic and capital planning take into account the potential risks of climate change-sea-level rise, higher temperature, increases in extreme events, changes in drought and flood frequency and intensity, and changing precipitation patterns-on NYC's water systems. This approach will enable NYCDEP and other agencies to incorporate adaptations to the risks of climate change into their management, investment, and policy decisions over the long term as a regular part of their planning activities. The framework includes a 9-step Adaptation Assessment procedure. Potential climate change adaptations are divided into management, infrastructure, and policy categories, and are assessed by their relevance in terms of climate change time-frame (immediate, medium, and long term), the capital cycle, costs, and other risks.

The effect of each species on above- and belowground biomass, soil C pools, soil labile C, litter decomposition rates, and microbial catabolic response profiles were analyzed. Phragmites australis and Typha spp. produced significantly more aboveground biomass (1,522 ± 464 and 1,177 ± 164 g DM m-2 respectively) than S. latifolia (500 ± 80 g DM m-2), although no difference was observed in terms of belowground biomass. After 208 days in the field, litter of S. latifolia had lost 72% of its initial mass while only 47% of the litter of Typha spp. and P. australis had decomposed. This coupled process of high primary production and slow litter decomposition within P. australis and Typha spp. communities did not translate into greater accumulation of C in the soil. In fact, we observed lower rates of C mineralization and greater biomass of methanogens in the S. latifolia plots. Despite similar water level, soil conditions in the S. latifolia community was more saturated, which might have limited availability of C for microbial consumption in these plots. Microbial catabolic responses to 24 substrates demonstrated distinct differences in the respiration responses of the soil microbial communities of the three macrophyte species. The microbial community found in the rhizosphere of P. australis was particularly responsive to phenolic acids. Few differences in C fluxes and pools were observed between plots occupied by P. australis and Typha spp., but the replacement of S. latifolia by one of the two other species could have a significant effect on the C cycle in the Great Lakes coastal wetlands. © 2007, The Society of Wetland Scientists.","Catabolic response profile; Invasive species; Phragmites australis; Sagittaria latifolia; Typha","aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; carbon cycle; coastal wetland; invasive species; macrophyte; primary production; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Erie; North America; Alismataceae; Phragmites australis; Sagittaria latifolia; Typha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55949128211

The altitude, climate and plant composition of these habitats differ. Our goal was to compare the diets of gorillas living in each of these habitats. The nutrients in staple foods and in the diets of individuals in a group of gorillas in Bwindi (N = 12 individuals) and a group in the Virungas (N = 7 individuals) were compared to determine if differences in dietary composition affected concentrations of nutrients in their diets. At both sites gorilla diets consisted primarily of herbaceous leaves, but the diet of Bwindi gorillas contained more tree leaves, fruit, pith and dry wood, and fewer stems. Despite differences in habitat and dietary composition, the nutrient concentrations in both gorilla diets were remarkably similar. On a dry matter basis, the diets and staple foods of Bwindi and Virunga gorillas contained similar concentrations of crude protein (CP), fibre (NDF) and non-structural carbohydrates (TNC). Bwindi gorillas ate diets containing 18% CP, 43% NDF and 19% TNC on a dry-matter basis, while the diets of the Virunga gorillas contained 17% CP, 41% NDF and 18% TNC. Our results demonstrate that gorillas consume diets that differ by plant species and part, but contain similar concentrations of nutrients. This suggests that classifying animals by broad dietary strategy (e.g. frugivory and folivory) does not provide a reliable indicator of the nutritional quality of their diet, and that our previous assumptions about these categories should be re-evaluated.

This was achieved by liquid infiltration of furfuryl alcool and chemical vapor deposition of propylene and acetonitrile. These carbon materials were characterized by adsorption of gaseous nitrogen and carbon dioxide, and the carbon structure was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). They exhibit a very large pore volume in the micropore region (i.e., narrower than 2 nm), and the XRD spectra show the presence of a nanostructured carbon material with a well-defined unit cell whose size and symmetry are imposed by the zeolite template. We made use of Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation of carbon adsorption in order to obtain numerical models of such materials and study their texture and mechanical and adsorption properties on an atomistic scale. The carbon-carbon interactions were modeled within the frame of the tight binding and the reactive bond order (REBO) formalisms, while carbon-zeolite interactions were assumed to be relevant to physisorption and described with the PNtrAZ potential. This simulation strategy allowed us to obtain numerical replica that are well-ordered and the opposite of the original 3D zeolite porosity. The numerical samples obtained at various temperatures are made of curved surfaces containing almost exclusively sp2 carbon atoms and are very rigid and stiff. The calculated structure factor of such a numerical sample exhibits features that are present in the experimental diffractograms, hence validating the nanocasting procedure. However, the comparison between simulated nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K with experimental values lead us to understand that the real material is defective and contains cavities of a few nanometers in size, larger that those of the perfect original numerical samples. Finally, we found from both experiment and simulation that pure carbon replicas of faujasite zeolite that have optimized pore dimensions are not good candidates for hydrogen storage at room temperature and moderate pressures, allowing us to draw general conclusions on the use of porous carbon for such an application. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Acetonitrile; Adsorption; Carbon dioxide; Chemical vapor deposition; Computer simulation; Nanostructured materials; X ray diffraction; Atomistic simulation; Micropores; Nanostructured carbon; Zeolites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36049029013

Here we look specifically at the co-benefits of various European post-2012 climate policy scenarios related to air quality in the Nordic region. We analyse how caps on emissions, expansion of the European Union (EU) Emissions Trading System, carbon taxes, and Russian and non-EU Eastern Europe participation after 2012 will influence emissions, air quality, avoided abatement costs, welfare effects, the regional environment and human exposure to particulate matter in the Nordic countries. We find that stricter targets will contribute to reduced emissions of air pollutants, and benefits to ecosystems and human health, which would have required substantial abatement costs if achieved by application of 'end-of-pipe' measures. Due to the assumed use of the flexibility mechanisms, reductions in emissions in the Nordic countries are smaller than in other regions, but the Nordic countries benefit from reductions in emissions in nearby regions. The more sectors that are included in the emissions trading scheme, the greater the emission of air pollutants. If Eastern Europe and Russia were to abandon participation in a climate agreement, the EU and Norway would have to undertake more emission cuts at home in order to meet the same targets. This would benefit ecosystems in southern Scandinavia, but acidification would increase in the north because of increased emissions in Russia. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This primary olfactory circuit is hard-wired through the action of genetic cues. We asked whether individual glomeruli have the capacity for stimulus-evoked plasticity by focusing on the carbon dioxide (CO2) circuit in Drosophila. Specialized OSNs detect this gas and relay the information to a dedicated circuit in the brain. Prolonged exposure to CO2 induced a reversible volume increase in the CO2-specific glomerulus. OSNs showed neither altered morphology nor function after chronic exposure, but one class of inhibitory local interneurons showed significantly increased responses to CO2. Two-photon imaging of the axon terminals of a single PN innervating the CO2 glomerulus showed significantly decreased functional output following CO2 exposure. Behavioral responses to CO2 were also reduced after such exposure.

Factors at three levels contribute to explaining these differences: (1) the company level, 2) the political framework conditions in the various regions where the companies operate, 3) international climate cooperation.

Spatially and temporally explicit data on nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes from soils under this land use are needed at farm-scale to better estimate regional and national greenhouse gas inventories. In this study, we measured N2O and CH4 fluxes at the soil surface of a sheep-grazed pasture over a 20-month period, to assess the influence of soil moisture, temperature and seasonal variations in the emissions of N2O and CH4, and to calculate an N2O emission factor. The farm-scale N2O emissions were also simulated using a process-based NZ-DNDC model, and the model was tested against measurements of CH4. Measured annual N2O emissions from this pasture site are estimated to be 3.7 ± 2.2 kg N2O-N ha-1 year-1. The mean of daily N2O emission measurements (7.4 g N2O-N ha-1 day-1) for this sheep-grazed pasture was higher than the mean of daily emission measurements from ungrazed control site (3.4 g N2O-N ha-1 day-1) but significantly lower than reported value of 32.0 g N2O-N ha-1 day-1for pastures grazed by dairy cows on the same soil type at an adjacent farm. The emission factor (EF), i.e. amount of N2O-N emitted expressed as a percentage of excretal and fertiliser N input for this site, is 0.99, which is essentially the same as the New Zealand specific N2O emission factor of 1.0 for excretal N. The sheep-grazed pasture acted as a CH4 source and sink but was an overall annual CH4 sink (0.64 ± 0.19 kg CH4-C ha-1). Methane consumption was highest in the summer and lowest during the wetter, colder winter months. Thus mitigation strategies for reducing anaerobic N2O emissions will also favour greater CH4 oxidation at the soil surface. NZ-DNDC model simulated effectively general pulses and trends in both N2O and CH4 fluxes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

With the perspective of three years after the event, an emphasis is placed on the readiness of society in the case of a similar climatic event. Using 2003 recorded data and subsequent analyses, the paper addresses several components of social readiness for extreme heat waves: the thermal quality of the built environment at the scale of individual buildings as well the urban surroundings; the inhabitants' behaviour in managing indoor comfort; the consequences of clay soil subsidence; and the market boom for air-conditioning and the subsequent increased load placed upon the impaired capacity of the electricity supply system. These are specific instances of the following three general categories of climate impact: direct impacts on the population; impacts on the energy supply infrastructure; and impacts on buildings.

The results support the convergent validity and concurrent validity of several domains. Namely, the domains focusing on motivational readiness and training needs were associated with higher appeal and openness to innovations.

In this configuration, two perpendicular rotating carbon targets were ablated by two synchronized laser beams generating two interacting plasma plumes. A Nd: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (1064 nm) laser beam is focused onto a target generating a highly directed plume; subsequently an excimer laser (248 nm) produces a second perpendicular plasma, which expands through the plume region generated by the first laser. In the cross-beam configuration, collision processes cause a reduction in the C II ion kinetic energy from ∼ 110 to 35 eV; moreover, the species of the second plasma which travel on the normal direction to the target surface (toward the substrate) are mainly C II. Interaction between plasmas has been compared with laser-induced plume propagation through a background gas in terms to the drag model.

In situ Raman spectra of oxygen were collected and corresponding temperatures were measured from the Stokes/anti-Stokes intensity ratios of vibrational transitions. The intense optical emission overwhelmed the Raman spectrum at temperatures exceeding 750 K. The spectrum was found to be much narrower than Planck-type thermal emission, and the intensity increase with input power was much steeper than expected for the thermal emission. The result places an important general caveat on calculating temperatures based on optical emission spectra in high-pressure laser-heating experiments. The intense emission in oxygen is photo-induced rather than being purely thermal, through multiphoton or multi-step single photon absorption processes related to the interaction with infrared radiation. The results suggest that short lived ionic species are induced by this laser-matter interaction. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","A. Insulators; B.

Poplar Program, Boardman, OR, United States","Establishment of short-rotation woody crop (SRWC) plantations for meeting the demand of wood and bioenergy production necessitates reclamation of agricultural lands and desert soils, such as those in the southern Columbia Plateau of Oregon, USA. The effects of plantation management on soil carbon (C) storage and nutrient concentration were evaluated, using a chronosequence of poplar (Populus spp.) stands on soils of eolian origin (Xeric Torripsamments). Stands of ages 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, and 10 years (n = 3 per stand age), as well as adjacent agricultural and desert lands, were compared based on soil C, inorganic C (SIC), total nitrogen (N), and nutrient concentrations within the 0- to 50-cm soil depth. The 7- through 10-year-old stands that were in a first-rotation cycle were irrigated and fertilized. The 1- through 4-year-old stands in a second-rotation cycle received a mulch application treatment in addition to the irrigation and fertilization treatments. At age 11 years, the projected plantation C (147.5 Mg ha-1) accumulated almost entirely in the aboveground biomass (62.2%), forest floor (24.3%), and roots (11.7%). There were no significant increases in the mineral soil C and N pools with stand age, despite the presence of increasing trends within the surface layer. The accumulation of the mineral soil C pool (∼1.8%), from the first- (23.5 ± 1.7 Mg C ha-1) to the second-rotation stands (26.3 ± 3.5 Mg C ha-1), was partially offset by a loss of SIC due to irrigation. The SIC pool had a decreasing trend, which was related to dissolution of calcite along the soil profile, from the first- (16.7 ± 3.4 Mg C ha-1) to the second-rotation stands (8.4 ± 5.0 Mg C ha-1). Soil pH (r &gt; 0.6) and exchangeable acidity (r = -0.5) patterns were dependent upon the concentration of exchangeable Ca2+. Soil Mg2+ and K+ concentrations were correlated with soil C concentration in the surface layer (r = 0.5). In coarse-textured soils, a decadal time scale was insufficient to measure significant changes in the mineral soil C pool. Carbon benefits may be gained, however, in aboveground (tree and forest floor) and belowground (roots) biomass accumulations.

This approach is subjective, lacks transparency, can generate inconsistent baselines for similar projects, and is likely to have high transaction costs. The use of regional baselines, which partially addresses these issues, has been reported in the literature on forestry and agriculture projects, and in greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation program guidance for them (e.g., WRI/WBCSD GHG Project Protocol, USDOE's 1605(b) registry, UNFCCC's Clean Development Mechanism). This paper provides an assessment of project-specific and regional baselines approaches for key baseline tasks, using project and program examples. The regional experience to date is then synthesized into generic steps that are referred to as Stratified Regional Baselines (SRB). Regional approaches generally, and SRB in particular explicitly acknowledge the heterogeneity of carbon density, land use change, and other key baseline driver variables across a landscape. SRB focuses on providing guidance on how to stratify lands into parcels with relatively homogeneous characteristics to estimate conservative baselines within a GHG assessment boundary, by applying systematic methods to determine the boundary and time period for input data. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Carbon sequestration; GHG mitigation; Project-specific; Stratified regional baselines","assessment method; climate change; emission; estimation method; forestry; greenhouse gas; land use change; mitigation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347386239

The regional climate model evaluates the spatiotemporal variations of precipitation and water vapor budget, which are used to drive the single-layer isotope circulation model. Intraseasonal variations of δ18O in precipitation are well simulated during June-July-August of 2003. The δ18O in water vapor experiences rapid decreases according to the passage of synoptic-scale disturbances. The rapid decreases of δ18O are attributed to two processes. (1) The δ18O in air mass locally decreases over the western mountains associated with the mountain precipitation; the light vapor is advected to eastern Mongolia by the prevailing westerly wind. (2) Convective systems pass by in the vicinity of the observation site, which persistently keep the lower δ18O in the air mass. Origin of the water vapor during June-July-August in 2003 is evaluated by the colored moisture analysis in which the tracers are assigned depending on the region where the water vapor finally evaporated. Seasonal mean result indicates that the regions contributing to precipitation in Mongolia are not low-latitude regions but central Asia and western Siberia located to the northwest of Mongolia. Observed multilevel isotopic composition supports the model estimation. The moisture transport along the southwesterly wind of the Asian summer monsoon has difficulty reaching Mongolia as a monthly/seasonal mean perspective.

Historians and anthropologists are increasingly using the concept of ""transnationalism"" both to emphasize that individual lives transcend national territory and to acknowledge the undeniable power that national states, cultures, and elites possess in delineating the parameters of multi-sited social spaces and their meaning. The study of immigration agents is a useful tool to demonstrate transcultural competency and its value to both the individual and the host society. Nearly all immigration agents in post-Confederation Canada were men, yet Elise von Koerber is one notable exception. Through her work, von Koerber, whose outlook was profoundly transnational, contested interpretations of the meaning of gender, ethnicity, and class from her own vantage point in the intellectual and ideological borderlands between Europe and North America. Although various currents in 1870s Canada and Continental Europe created a favourable climate for Koerber's approach, her gendered transnationalism intersected and collided with national projects. Her ideas were cautiously endorsed on both sides of the Atlantic during the 1870s, yet lost ground to the dominant vision of Canada as integral part of the British Empire by the 1880s.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47849096186

They are also gaining attention as an important emission source under the larger set of nonroad sources, both from a regulated emissions and health effects standpoint. The present work analyzes regulated (NOx, PM, THC, CO) and non-regulated emissions from three in-use diesel-electric switching locomotives using standardized sampling and analytical techniques. The engines tested in this work were from 1950, 1960, and 1970 and showed a range of NOx and PM emissions. In general, non-regulated gaseous emissions showed a sharp increase as engines shifted from non-idle to idle operating modes. This is interesting from an emissions perspective since activity data shows that these locomotives spend around 60% of their time idling. In terms of polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contributions, the dominance of naphthalene and its derivatives over the total PAH emissions was apparent, similar to observations for on-road diesel tractors. Among non-naphthalenic species, it was observed that lower molecular weight PAHs and n-alkanes dominated their respective compound classes. Regulated emissions from a newer technology engine used in a back-up generator (BUG) application were also compared against the present engines; it was determined that use of the newer engine may lower NOx and PM emissions by up to 30%. Another area of interest to regulators is better estimation of the marine engine inventory for port operations. Toward that end, a comparison of emissions from these engines with engine manufacturer data and the newer technology BUG engine was also performed for a marine duty cycle, another application where these engines are used typically with little modifications. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Electric switchboards; Electric switches; Engines; Gas emissions; Locomotives; Molecular weight; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Important emission; Regulated emissions; Source category; Particulate emissions; carbon; carbon monoxide; carbonyl derivative; nitrogen oxide; organic carbon; phenanthrene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrene; trace element; Electric switchboards; Electric switches; Engines; Gas emissions; Locomotives; Molecular weight; Particulate emissions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; chemical compound; diesel; PAH; technology; traffic emission; air pollution control; analytic method; article; electricity; electronics; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; particulate matter; railway; technology; Air Pollutants; Carbon Monoxide; Environmental Monitoring; Gasoline; Motor Vehicles; Nitrogen Oxides; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; United States; Vehicle Emissions; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548558900

Woody species were largely excluded from these early experiments, despite the ecological and socioeconomic importance of forest ecosystems. We discuss conceptual aspects of mechanistically driven research on the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship in forests, including the comparison of scientific approaches like 'observational studies', 'removal experiments', and 'synthetic-assemblage experiments'. We give a short overview on the differences between herbaceous and forest ecosystems, focusing on canopy characteristics, and the possibilities for individual versus population-based investigations. We present detailed information about the first large-scale, multisite and long-term biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment with tree species of temperate forests (BIOTREE - BIOdiversity and ecosystem processes in experimental TREE stands). At three sites of differing geology and local climate, we planted 200,000 saplings on a total area of 70 ha. At two sites, diversity gradients were established by varying the number of tree species (BIOTREE-SPECIES). At a third site, only functional diversity at a constant level of tree species richness was manipulated by selecting mixtures that differ in the functional trait values of the corresponding species (BIOTREE-FD). Additional experimental treatments at the subplot level include silvicultural management options, the addition of subdominant species, and the reduction of genetic diversity. Response variables focus on productivity, biogeochemical cycles and carbon sequestration, and resource use complementarity. We explore the use of different measures of functional diversity for a posteriori classifications of functional richness and their use in the analysis of our tree diversity experiment. The experiment is thought to provide a long-term research platform for a variety of scientific questions related to forest biodiversity and ecosystem processes. © 2007 Rübel Foundation, ETH Zürich.","Afforestation; Biodiversity; Ecosystem processes; Experimental design; Functional diversity; Temperate forests","afforestation; biodiversity; ecosystem function; experimental design; removal experiment; silviculture; species richness; temperate forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148998792

Changes in German and European legislation shifted processing of polymer-rich shredding residues (SR) from landfill to thermal treatment. However, when waste of electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) is the source of SR, thermal treatment is complicated by halogens as well as the presence of polybrominated dioxins and furans (PBDD/F) and brominated flame retardants (BFR). Hence, WEEE requires high temperature incineration with sufficient residence times. Post-combustion synthesis of polyhalogenated dioxins and furans (PXDD/F) is dominant in the temperature range between 250-450°C. Thus, a very rapid gas cooling from 450° to 250°C is important for proper raw gas treatment. The pebble heatet technology developed by ATZ Entwicklungszentrum (Sulzbach-Rosenberg, Germany) might serve as an alternative to the state-of-the-art quench cooling. It is based on the application of a pebble bed of natural bulk material, which the exhaust gases flows through radially. It provides an excellent heat transfer and a temperature gradient in the range of 1,500-2,000 K/m. The paper presents data of a pilot application of the pebble heater technology for the treatment of raw gas derived from the incineration of polymeric materials from WEEE. Methods. A liquid fuel was chosen in order to minimise technical modifications of the plant. It was analysed for halogens by x-ray fluorescence, for brominated flame retardants by HPLC-UV/MS and for PXDD/F by GC-HRMS. Combustion gases were rapidly cooled down to temperatures below 200°C and emissions of PBDD/F and PCDD/F were estimated without further off-gas treatment. PBDD/F emissions were computed as PCDD/F toxicity equivalents applying two different calculation approaches. Results and Discussion. PCDD/F emissions accounted for 0.04 ng I-TEQ/Nm3 and are in compliance with European emission limits. Calculated PBDD/F toxicity equivalents exceeded the emission limit of 0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm3 by factors of 75 and 208 depending on the calculation approach. A mass balance of PBDD/F and PCDD/F congeners revealed an efficient elimination of more than 95% in most cases. Lower reduction rates (76% for 2,3,7,8-TeBDF and 82% for 1,2,3,7,8-PeBDF) were attributed to incomplete combustion. An intended recovery of halogens by one-stage scrubbing downstream of the pebble heater was ineffective, recovering 28% of the applied chlorine and 9% of the bromine, only. Conclusions. Our pilot incineration test indicates that the pebble heater technology can effectively suppress a post-combustion synthesis of PCDD/F and PBDD/F, resulting in low PCDD/F emission levels without further off-gas treatment. The presented data state that WEEE is sensible to incomplete combustion, which will lead to increased PBDD/F emissions without increasing PCDD/F emission limits. This finding is especially relevant for small and low-technical incineration appliances, which have been reported to treat WEEE in developing countries and are considered to serve as a significant source of PXDD/F these days. Recommendations and Perspectives. Monitoring of PCDD/F emissions only might considerably underestimate the total emission of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds. It is therefore an ineffective means for assessing resulting health risks, at least for those waste treatment plants which are considered to handle the increasing amounts of PBDD/F-containing polymers from WEEE in future. Consequently, it is recommended to initiate a screening programme for PXDD/F emissions in large scale incineration facilities which are capable of treating WEEE shredder residues. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Brominated flame retardants; Combustion; Off-gas treatment; Off-gas-cooling; PBDD/F; PCDD/F; Shredder residue, polymer rich","dioxin; furan derivative; halogen; combustion; fuel; halogen; high temperature; PCDD; PCDF; pebble; toxicity; X-ray fluorescence; article; chemistry; incineration; instrumentation; methodology; pilot study; synthesis; Dioxins; Furans; Halogens; Incineration; Pilot Projects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35548958691

Species-rich communities generally had the higher percentage of exotics, but were not significantly related to latitude or environmental variables. Exotics, in contrast, were at generally higher levels at lower latitudes and were more abundant in large river plains and communities with intermediate levels of disturbance.

Particular emphasise is given to detailed design, maintenance and water quality control aspects. The most important target pollutants are hydrocarbons, heavy metals and nutrients (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus). The advantages and disadvantages of different PPS are discussed with the help of recent case studies.

To this end, two regions of Central Europe were selected for investigation: the Weser-Ems Region (WER) and the Euro Region Nissa (ERN). They were assumed to have land use-specific accumulation profiles. Thus, the metal and N accumulations in both regions were examined by means of geostatistically based comparative moss analysis. The sampling and chemical analysis of mosses were conducted in accordance with the convenient guidelines and methods, respectively. The spatial representativity of the sampling sites was computed by means of a land classification which was calculated for Europe by means of classification trees and GIS-techniques. The differences of deposition loads were tested for statistical significance with regard to time and space. The measurement values corroborated the decline of metal accumulation observed since the beginning of the European Metals in Mosses Surveys in 1990. The metal loads of the mosses in the ERN exceeded those in the WER significantly. The opposite holds true for the N concentrations: those in the WER were significantly higher than those in the ERN. The reduction of emissions from power plants, factories and houses was strongly correlated with the decline of deposition and bioaccumulation of metals. As proved by the European Metals in Mosses Surveys, this tendency is due to successful environmental policies. But no such success could be verified by monitoring the accumulation of N in mosses. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Biomonitoring; Geostatistically based comparative moss analysis; GIS; Metal accumulation; N accumulation","Metal accumulation; Moss analysis; Nitrogen accumulation; Bioaccumulation; Chemical analysis; Classification (of information); Ecosystems; Environmental regulations; Geographic information systems; Metals; Nitrogen; Plants (botany); Land use; antimony; arsenic; cadmium; chromium; copper; iron; lead; metal; nickel; nitrogen; titanium; vanadium; zinc; bioaccumulation; biomonitoring; geostatistics; GIS; land use; moss; article; bioaccumulation; calculation; chemical analysis; classification; controlled study; correlation analysis; ecosystem; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; Europe; geographic distribution; geographic information system; geostatistical analysis; land use; moss; nonhuman; policy; practice guideline; statistical significance; time; Bryophyta; Europe; Geographic Information Systems; Metals; Nitrogen; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Bryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548761517

This is provided that we recognize climate change as a threat to humankind and so set the course for adopting a dynamic and globally coordinated climate policy. If we fail to do so, climate change will draw ever-deeper lines of division and conflict in international relations, triggering numerous conflicts between and within countries over the distribution of resources - especially water and land, and over the management of migration, or over compensation payments between the countries mainly responsible for climate change and those countries most affected by its destructive effects.

Many Amazonian reserves have been selected systematically to achieve biodiversity representativeness. We review the role natural-scientific understanding has played in reserve selection, and evaluate the theoretical potential of the existing reserves to cover a complete sample of the species diversity of the Amazonian rainforest biome. In total, 108 reserves (604,832 km2) are treated as strictly protected and Amazonian; 87 of these can be seen as systematically selected to sample species diversity (75.3% of total area). Because direct knowledge on all species distributions is unavailable, surrogates have been used to select reserves: direct information on some species distributions (15 reserves, 14.8% of total area); species distribution patterns predicted on the basis of conceptual models, mainly the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis, (5/10.3%); environmental units (46/27.3%); or a combination of distribution patterns and environmental units (21/22.9%). None of these surrogates are reliable: direct information on species distributions is inadequate; the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis is highly controversial; and environmental classifications do not capture all relevant ecological variation, and their relevance for species distribution patterns is undocumented. Hence, Amazonian reserves cannot be safely assumed to capture all Amazonian species. To improve the situation, transparency and an active dialogue with the scientific community should be integral to conservation planning. We suggest that the best currently available approach for sampling Amazonian species diversity in reserve selection is to simultaneously inventory indicator plant species and climatic and geological conditions, and to combine field studies with remote sensing. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Amazon analysis; Biodiversity surrogates; Indicator species; Refuge hypothesis; Representativeness; Reserve selection; Strictly protected area; Systematic conservation planning; Workshop 90; Workshop 99","biodiversity; bioindicator; biome; conceptual framework; conservation planning; nature conservation; Pleistocene; population distribution; protected area; rainforest; refuge; reserve design; species diversity; Amazonia; South America",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548187766

The peroxy-acid process was applied to two Superfund site soils provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Initial small-scale experiments applied ratios of 3:5:7 (v/v/v) or 3:3:9 (v/v/v) hydrogen peroxide:acetic acid:deionized (DI) water solution to 5 g of Superfund site soil. The experiment using 3:5:7 (v/v/v) ratio resulted in an almost complete degradation of the 14 EPA regulated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Bedford LT soil during a 24-h reaction period, while the 3:3:9 (v/v/v) ratio resulted in no applicable degradation in Bedford LT lot 10 soil over the same reaction period. Specific Superfund site soil characteristics (e.g., pH, total organic carbon content and particle size distribution) were found to play an important role in the availability of the PAHs and the efficiency of the transformation during the peroxy-acid process. A scaled-up experiment followed treating 150 g of Bedford LT lot 10 soil with and without mixing. The scaled-up processes applied a 3:3:9 (v/v/v) solution resulting in significant decrease in PAH contamination. These findings demonstrate the peroxy-acid process as a viable option for the treatment of PAH contaminated soils.

While some economic sectors (e.g., agriculture, water resources and construction) have been actively engaged in climate change adaptation research for years, adaptation has received scant consideration within the tourism-recreation industry. This is particularly the case for adaptation by tourism operators (supply-side). One exception where progress on supply-side climate adaptation has been made is the ski industry. This paper provides a brief overview of the literature on the implications of climate change for the international ski industry and how adaptation by ski area operators has been treated within these studies. This is followed by an inventory of climate adaptation practices currently used by ski industry stakeholders, including the historical development of certain key adaptations and constraints to wider use. The characteristics of ski areas with higher adaptive capacity are identified. Considering the highly competitive nature of the ski industry and the generally low climate change risk appraisal within the industry, climate change adaptation is anticipated to remain individualistic and reactive for some time. With only a few exceptions, the existing climate change literature on winter tourism has not considered the wide range of adaptation options identified in this paper and has likely overestimated potential damages. An important task for future studies is to develop methodologies to incorporate adaptation so that a more accurate understanding of the vulnerability of the international ski industry can be ascertained. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Ski industry; Tourism; Winter sports","adaptive management; climate change; literature review; mitigation; stakeholder; tourism management; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548527108

Forest knowledge and management of the commons represents a relevant component of this heritage that is being progressively lost when critical management problems are not solved. Sustainable development actions that, through participatory processes, involve the community in strategy design and implementation, offer a great opportunity to preserve commons cultural heritage and take best advantage of available knowledge. ForEnCarb is a pilot project financed by the Sustainable Development Service of Sardinia's regional administration, with scientific support of Sassari University. The project goal is to promote sustainable development of Seneghe, a local community of inner Sardinia, by effectively implementing provisions of the international agreements to combat climate change through forest planning programs. Most of Seneghe's forest area is in common land. For countless generations its residents have been entitled to collect wood, to hunt and to graze their cattle and sheep on these lands. In support of a process towards sustainable forest management, our study focused on the social and cultural heritage of the local community and the historical development of its territorial identity, with specific reference to forest-related knowledge. The paper presents the first results of an analysis of forest service archive documents and town council deliberations found in municipal and state archives. The sources used include the documentation from the 19th and 20th centuries, but enlighten only fragments of history since a large number of potentially useful documents have been lost or destroyed. Results include a time series analysis of allowances for cattle access, wood withdrawal and occurrence of forest fires. We conclude that woodlands subject to common rights carry a high symbolic value for this community, but social sensitivity concerning forest management practices, while necessary, is not sufficient to encourage sustainable practices. Integration in sustainable development processes, such as this climate change mitigation project, offers hope to reverse such a cultural decline. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the mass-radius relationships for cold terrestrial mass planets of all compositions we considered follow a generic functional form that is not a simple power law: log10Rs = k1 + 1/3 log10(M s) - k2Msk3 for up to Mp ≈ 20 M⊕, where Ms and Rs are scaled mass and radius values. This functional form arises because the common building blocks of solid planets all have equations of state that are well approximated by a modified polytrope of the form ρ = ρ0 + cPn. We find that highly detailed planet interior models, including temperature structure and phase changes, are not necessary to derive solid exoplanet bulk composition from mass and radius measurements. For solid exoplanets with no substantial atmosphere we have also found the following: with 5% fractional uncertainty in planet mass and radius it is possible to distinguish among planets composed predominantly of iron or silicates or water ice but not more detailed compositions; with ∼5% uncertainty water ice planets with ≳25% water by mass may be identified; the minimum plausible planet size for a given mass is that of a pure iron planet; and carbon planet mass-radius relationships overlap with those of silicate and water planets due to similar zero-pressure densities and equations of state.

Government authorities and power companies in the UK, along with oil and gasfield operators, are proposing to capture CO2 from their power plants and either store it in depleted reservoirs or saline aquifers, or use it for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in depleted oil and gasfields. The capture of anthropogenic CO2 will mitigate against global warming and possibly reduce the impact of climate change. The United States has over 30 years of experience in transporting CO2, mainly from naturally-occurring CO2 sources, and mostly for the purpose of EOR. Both the source and the function of the CO2 pipelines in the USA have dictated a relatively-pure CO2 stream, in comparison, the UK's proposed carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects will be focusing on anthropogenic sources from major polluters such as fossil-fuel power plants, and the CO2 transport infrastructure will involve both on- and offshore pipelines. The fossil-fuel power plants will produce CO2 with varying combinations of impurities depending on the capture technology used. CO2 pipelines have never been designed for some of the impurities released from these power plants. Other key differences between the transport of CO2 in the US and the UK relate to design codes and legislation, pipeline routes, offshore transportation and also storage. The presence of impurities has a great impact on the physical properties of the transported CO2 that consequently affects pipeline design, compressor power, recompression distance, and pipeline capacity, and could also have implications for the prevention of fracture propagation. The effects could be either negative or positive: for example, the addition of some impurities tends to reduce compressor power while others increase the power required. These effects have direct implications for both the technical and economic feasibility of developing a CO2 transport infrastructure on- and offshore. This paper discusses the key differences between the CO2 transport scenarios in the US and the potential transport infrastructure in the UK and provides an understanding of these differences and the implications for designing a CO2-compliant pipeline. It focuses on such factors as recompression distance, flow assurance, and phase equilibrium, and present results of some initial hydraulic modelling work done using proprietary software.",,"Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Compressor power; Enhanced oil recovery (EOR); Recompression distance; Gas pipelines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548020546

In spring, bloom conditions were encountered with high phytoplankton concentrations of 20 to 30 mg chlorophyll a m-3. The zooplankton community associated with the spring bloom could not control the developing bloom, which resulted in high sedimentation rates of 1438 mg C m-2 d-1, of which 518 mg C m-2 d-1 could be related to chlorophyll a (chl a). The settling phytoplankton was ingested by filter-feeding as well as deposit-feeding bivalves. In autumn, the water column was stratified and nutrient levels reduced, resulting in a phytoplankton biomass below 0.5 mg chl a m-3. The vertical flux of particulate carbon was reduced to 235 mg C m-2 d-1. Compared to spring, benthic mineralisation rates had increased. Ingestion of chl a was reduced in filter-feeding and in deposit-feeding bivalves. The pronounced seasonal shift in production and mineralisation pathways clearly highlights the importance of the spring bloom in the costal waters of subarctic Greenland. Analysis of local sea ice conditions from 1979 to 2003 suggests that the mismatch between primary producers and copepods observed during 2 wk in spring could be related to an earlier than usual break-up of sea ice in 2003, which illustrates how climate can influence pelagic-benthic coupling. © Inter-Research 2007.","Carbon flux; Greenland; Pelagic-benthic coupling; Sea ice; Vertical flux","algal bloom; bacterium; benthos; carbon flux; organic carbon; pelagic environment; phytoplankton; primary production; sea ice; zooplankton; Arctic; Disko Bay; Greenland; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bivalvia; Copepoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547603038

We also determined the energy level alignment of the pentacene-rubrene interface by using X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy.

Based on the MEDALUS approach and the characteristics of study area a regional model developed using GIS. Six main factors or indicators of desertification including: soil, climate, erosion, plant cover, groundwater and management were considered for evaluation. Then several sub-indicators affecting the quality of each main indicator were identified. Based on the MEDALUS approach, each sub-indicator was quantified according to its quality and given a weighting of between 1.0 and 2.0. ArcGIS 9 was used to analyze and prepare the layers of quality maps using the geometric mean to integrate the individual sub-indicator maps. In turn the geometric mean of all six quality maps was used to generate a single desertification status map. Results showed that 12% of the area is classified as very severe, 81% as severe and 7% as moderately affected by desertification. In addition the plant cover and groundwater indicators were the most important factors affecting desertification process in the study area.

The specific purpose of the Asthma-Friendly Outdoor (Ambient) Air Quality Flag Program was to establish an education and communication tool for Central California communities that would accomplish two things: 1) Establish permanent local policy change to existing operating procedures in school districts and schools to help reduce the exposure of students, teachers, staff, and nearby communities to outdoor environmental asthma triggers and 2) provide education on air quality and potential health effects of exposure to air pollutants. Data on the program from its initial years are presented. To date, the following important lessons have been learned: 1) Science-based, simple, visual, low-cost school-based educational interventions to help reduce human exposure to outdoor environmental asthma triggers (i.e., ozone, particles, and pollens) can work in socioeconomically and ethnically diverse urban and rural or agricultural communities, and 2) local health and environmental justice groups such as asthma coalitions can successfully lead school-based environmental interventions to help improve children's quality of life.",,"ozone; air quality; asthma; atmospheric pollution; child health; communication; education; health education; ozone; pollution exposure; public health; quality of life; student; air pollutant; asthma; child; child welfare; conference paper; consumer; education; environmental exposure; environmental health; human; particulate matter; school; United States; Air Pollutants; Asthma; California; Child; Child Welfare; Consumer Participation; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Humans; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Schools; California; North America; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148948960

We find that the adsorption of molecular hydrogen on both types of structure is endothermic with respect to dissociation, with the small-diameter nanotube possessing the smaller barrier. Although chemisorption along the tube axis is energetically preferred, the barrier for dissociation is lower for chemisorption across the tube axis, implying that chemisorbed hydrogen can be kinetically trapped in a higher energy state. Dopants that maximize the localization of the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital states maximize hydrogen binding energies. Carbon dopants do not enhance H2 binding in contrast to the literature, whereas silicon dopants for nitrogen provide H2 binding energies of 0.8 eV, at the upper end of the range required to meet DOE targets for hydrogen storage. The formation energy of most defects is reduced with increasing curvature except for the carbon substitutionals. Vacancies reduce the barriers for H2 dissociation for the planar sheets but not for strongly curved nanotubes. The surface stress induced by nanotube curvature boosts the hydrogen storage capabilities of vacancies compared to the sheet, with the nitrogen vacancy chemisorbing 4H and allowing a H2 molecule to enter the interior of the tube. The hydrogen binding properties of boron-nitride systems are strongly dependent on the defects and dopants present. Pretreating of these systems so as to partially remove nitrogen should enhance H2 adsorption properties. © 2007 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447323061

The analysis of dynamic velocity data recorded using an array of piezoelectric transducers mounted on a core sample showed that the P-wave velocities at different positions displayed a similar trend in time, i.e., an initial sharp fall followed by a more gradual decline. Considerable variations observed in the measured P-wave velocity reductions across the sandstone core could largely be attributed to the final state of saturation (e.g. uniform, patchy or in-between) attained by the two-phase fluids. Numerical simulation of the injection test using a simple 1D model was carried out to provide an estimation of the phase saturation changes underlying the measured P-wave velocity reductions. A second order polynomial correlation between the measured ultrasonic P-wave velocity reductions and the estimated CO2 saturation was established.

(2007) Biochemistry 46, 12005-12013], the 1.5 Å resolution crystal structure of green fluorescent protein (GFP) variant S65T/H148D is presented, and the possible consequences of an unusual short hydrogen bond (≤2.4 Å) between the carboxyl oxygen of Asp148 and the phenol oxygen of the chromophore are discussed. This work reports the femtosecond time-resolved emission of this variant at pH 5.6 by ultrafast fluorescence upconversion spectroscopy. Following excitation at 400 nm, green fluorescence is observed at 510 nm with a rise on a time scale that is faster than the 170 fs instrument response. Time-resolved emission spectra at 140 K also exhibit the immediate appearance of green fluorescence, and this extremely fast process is hardly affected by deuteration of exchangeable protons. These results appear to be dramatically different from those of wild-type GFP, in which the green fluorescence at 508 nm is produced on the picosecond time scale as a result of excited-state proton transfer from the state that is excited at 400 nm. The unique features observed in S65T/H148D and apparent ultrafast excited-state proton transfer are discussed in light of evidence for multiple states underlying the band at around 415 nm, as suggested by steady-state fluorescence spectra. The behavior of these different states may explain the novel photophysical properties observed for this GFP variant, including the ultrafast green fluorescence and the absence of completely matched decay in blue fluorescence. It is speculated that two different orientations of the Asp introduced at position 148, not distinguishable by chromatography, mass spectrometry, or X-ray crystallography, give rise to the two functionally distinct populations. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Chromophores; Excited states; Fluorescence; Hydrogen bonds; Phenols; Ultrashort pulses; Carboxyl oxygen; Excited-state dynamics; Green fluorescence; Time-resolved emission spectra; Proteins; aspartic acid; carboxyl group; green fluorescent protein; oxygen; phenol derivative; article; chromatography; crystal structure; fluorescence; fluorescence spectroscopy; hydrogen bond; mass spectrometry; molecular dynamics; pH; priority journal; protein variant; proton transport; steady state; wild type; X ray crystallography; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Kinetics; Photochemistry; Physics; Spectrometry, Fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35648943635

This investigation takes into account evidence from the Earth's history, from climate models and our understanding of the physical processes governing climate shifts. Sudden alterations to climate forcing seem to be improbable, with sudden changes instead most likely to arise from climate feedbacks. Based on projections from models validated against historical events, dramatic changes in ocean circulation appear unlikely. Ecosystem-climate feedbacks clearly have the potential to induce sudden change, but are relatively poorly understood at present. More probable sudden changes are large increases in the frequency of summer heatwaves and changes resulting from feedbacks involving hydrology. These include ice sheet decay, which may be set in motion this century. The most devastating consequences are likely to occur further in the future, however. Reductions in subtropical precipitation are likely to be the most severe hydrologic effects this century, with rapid changes due to the feedbacks of relatively well-understood large-scale circulation patterns. Water stress may become particularly acute in the Southwest US and Mexico, and in the Mediterranean and Middle East, where rainfall decreases of 10-25% (regionally) and up to 40% (locally) are projected. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Abrupt climate change; Ice sheets; Rapid climate change; Sea-level rise; Solar variability; Water cycle",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35948946930

Trade in automobiles was the target of fierce trade disputes in the 1980s between, for example, the United States and Japan. The governments of Japan, the United States and Europe were involved in trade negotiations as agents of the automobile industry of each country, often focusing on environmental standards as sources of non-tariff barriers. But since the mid-1990s, because of the globalization of the automobile industry, automobile firms have had common interests in collaborating in relation to voluntary harmonized standards. They also have common interests in relation to other sectors such as the petroleum industry in that the burden for emission reductions needs to be shared equitably among sectors. In that sense, it can be said that a 'depoliticizing strategy' has been used, which is the strategy used by the automobile industry not to rely on government intervention and trade conflicts at an intergovernmental level to deal with the difference in standards. There is a tendency for high-level convergence concerning environmental emission standards for NOx etc. in Japan, the United States and Europe and related sulfur content standards for complying with them. In addition, the automobile industry has been consciously seeking international harmonization through the Trans Atlantic Business Dialogue (TABD) and the TrilateralWorking Group. Harmonization has also been attempted at the intergovernmental level to gain legitimacy at the arena of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) through the signing of the 1995 Agreement (the revision of 1958 Agreement) and the establishment of the 1998 Global Agreement. In the process, governments have been requested by automobile firms to adopt harmonized standards; but governments also have their own incentives to set up an intergovernmental mechanism to establish harmonized standards.","Automobile; Harmonization; TABD; UNECE","automobile industry; emission control; globalization; standard (regulation); United Nations; Asia; Eurasia; Europe; Far East; Japan; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548400891

The method can also provide an estimate of the concentration of OH. A key step in the method is to use observed concentrations of two aromatic hydrocarbons, namely ethylbenzene and m,p-xylene, to estimate the degree of photochemical processing and amounts of photochemically consumed NOx and NMHCs by OH. In addition, total oxidant (O3+NO2) instead of O3 itself turns out to be very useful for representing ozone production in the OBM approach. The average O3 production efficiency during the field campaign in Fall (2003) is found to be about 10.2±3.9. The relationship of P(O3) with NOx is examined and compared with a one-dimensional (1D) photochemical model. Values of P(O3) derived from the OBM are slightly lower than those calculated in the 1D model. However, OH concentrations estimated by the OBM are about a factor of 2 lower than the 1D model. Fresh emissions, which affect the degree of photochemical processing appear to be a major cause of the underestimate. We have developed a three-dimensional (3D) OBM O3 production diagram that resembles the EKMA ozone isopleth diagram to study the relationship of the total oxidant versus O3 precursors. The 3D OBM O3 production diagram suggests that reducing emissions of NMHCs are more effective in controlling O3 than reducing NOx. However, significant uncertainties remain in the OBM, and considerable more work is required to minimize these uncertainties before a definitive control strategy can be reached. The observation-based approach provides a good alternative to measuring peroxy radicals for evaluating the production of O3 and formulating O3 control strategy in urban and suburban environments. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) and conservation tillage (CT) are some techniques being included in these systems. Weed population dynamics under these systems continue to be explored. An experiment was conducted in 2004 and 2005 near Five Points, CA, to assess weed populations in processing tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). The experimental design was a split-split plot with the main plots as irrigation [SDI or furrow irrigation (FI)], sub-plots as tillage [standard tillage (ST) or CT] and sub-sub-plots as weed control system [weed control (WC) or no weed control (NWC)]. In both years, weed emergence in the furrows of SDI treatments were almost eliminated. Similarly, weed densities on the beds were 46-96% lower in the SDI than FI plots. Tillage did not generally affect weed densities but interacted with irrigation in 2005 when the SDICT plots had 87% fewer weeds than SDI-ST plots. Weed biomass on the bed was not affected by irrigation or tillage system but the biomass in the furrows was 90% lower in the SDI than FI plots. Total and marketable tomato fruit yields were 33 and 46% greater, respectively, in the FI than the SDI system but tillage system had no effect on tomato yield. The WC compared toNWCplots had 20% greater tomato yield. Fruit quality (soluble solids concentration or pH) was not affected by irrigation or tillage systems.

At lower temperature, there exists a surfactant solid, which solubilize different amounts of oils depending on the oil nature. The melting temperature of the solid phase is virtually constant in a wide range of composition. In all the systems, a lamellar liquid crystal (Lα) is formed in surfactant-rich regions at intermediate temperatures between the solid-melt and isotropic two- or single-phase regions. In the dilute regions reverse vesicles are formed in the Lα+O regions mainly in the case of linear hydrocarbon type oils. In the aromatic and cyclic aliphatic oils, there are isotropic solutions at 25°C. However, there is dispersion of α-solid in the case of liner hydrocarbon oils. Two liquid-phase regions above the Lα phase are observed in the case of tetradecane and hexadecane. In the shorter chain oil systems, such as octane and decane, no two liquid-phase appear above Lα region. That is the two liquid-phase region is largely dependent on the chain length of the oils, and becomes wider in longer hydrocarbon oil.","Diglycerol monomyristate (DGM); Lamellar liquid crystal; Organic solvents; Phase behavior; SAXS","Chemical analysis; Lamellar structures; Liquid crystals; Melting point; Phase behavior; Thermal effects; X ray scattering; Diglycerol monomyristate; Lamellar liquid crystal; Liquid-phase regions; Nonpolar organic solvent systems; Organic solvents; Chemical analysis; Lamellar structures; Liquid crystals; Melting point; Organic solvents; Phase behavior; Thermal effects; X ray scattering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35948974273

A goal is to evaluate the air quality impacts occurring between 1990 and 2004 resulting from legislatively mandated changes in emissions. Three 5-year periods, 1990-1994 (P1), 1995-1999 (P2), and 2000-2004 (P3) are considered. Period-to-period changes in selected pollutant metrics are examined, focusing on P1-to-P3 changes. Data are composed from reported weekly measurements into estimates of means for year, site, and season. The mean squared error derived from analysis of variance applied to these means for atmospheric concentration, dry deposition velocity, precipitation rate, and dry, wet and total deposition is used to examine differences between periods for seasons and predefined regional groupings of sites. Results suggest that relationships exist at the current scale between changes in both concentration and deposition of relevant atmospheric pollutants and changes in SO2 emissions that are generally less than 1:1 and that these disparities are more pronounced for SO42- (a reaction product) than SO2 (the primary pollutant). Coincident timing and location suggest that legislatively mandated summertime reductions in estimated NOx emissions contributed strongly to observed reductions of atmospheric HNO3 concentration and dry deposition in the eastern U.S. Less than 1:1 relationships are also indicated at the current scale between changes in both concentration and deposition of the relevant measured secondary atmospheric pollutants, HNO3 and NO3-, and changes in NOx emissions. In the face of P1-to-P3 reductions in estimated emissions of both SO2 and NOx, wintertime changes in the sum of atmospheric SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+ concentrations, relative to those for corresponding SO42- concentrations, range from reductions that are less than 1:1 to actual increases.",,"Air pollution; Air quality; Atmospheric composition; Climate change; Particulate emissions; Precipitation (meteorology); air quality; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; dry deposition; emission; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35748968489

These led, respectively, to limited algal growth due to phosphorus deficiency (low-P culture), maximum algal growth with no luxury consumption (intermediate-P) and maximum algal growth with luxury phosphorus consumption (high-P culture). In all cultures, FTIR spectra had nine major absorbance bands (wavenumber range 1760-900 cm-1), including bands at 1736 cm-1 (lipid), 1652 cm-1 (amide I) and the region from 1180 to 950 cm-1 (carbohydrate). Internal phosphorus concentrations (Qp), determined by energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis, differed markedly between low-P (typically &lt; 0.1% dry wt), intermediate-P (&gt; 0.1%) and high-P (&gt; 0.3%) cultures. During logarithmic growth phase, a rapid change in carbon allocation was observed in the low-P cultures, with increases in both the lipid:protein (0.1-0.34) and carbohydrate:protein (0.4-1.0) ratio. Mean cell volume increased by 60%, and the mean chlorophyll a content remained consistently low (typically &lt; 0.2 pg cell-1). The change in carbon allocation was triggered primarily by low Qp values rather than low external (culture medium) concentrations. Intermediate-P and high-P cultures showed higher chlorophyll a content (&gt; 0.2 pg cell-1) and changes in carbon allocation only after entry into stationary phase. No increase in cell volume occurred, suggesting that a switch in carbon allocation during stationary phase (intermediate- and high-P cultures) rather than log phase (low-P culture) does not result in an increase in cell size. Entry into stationary growth phase occurred simultaneously in all three cultures and was not caused by internal (Qp) or external phosphorus depletion. Medium replacement in late stationary phase (day 35) cultures led to a rapid stimulation of growth, with a reversed carbon allocation (reduced lipid:protein and carbohydrate:protein ratios) and in low-P cultures a decrease in cell volume.","Carbon allocation; EDXRMA; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; FTIR; Phosphorus quota; Scenedesmus; X-ray microanalysis","algae; Desmodesmus subspicatus; Scenedesmus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35048875396

Sometimes light energy is accumulated also in the modified glass structure elements. Active (luminescence) centres may be complex defects or special impurity atoms. Light energy accumulation occurs when active centres or glass matrix are excited by radiation able to release electrons (holes) from centres, break a bond in a complex defects or change the glass local structure (short range order). Light emission occurs when previously localised electrons (holes) or atoms (ions) return to the excited luminescence centres and recombine with them. Localised electrons (holes) or atoms (ions) can be stimulated to move back to the luminescence centres by rising temperature or infrared radiation. Structural rearrangements (relaxation) could also lead to the light emission. From practical viewpoint it is necessary to increase the concentration of active (luminescence) centres in optical glasses.

The choice of packaging materials and the atmospheric conditions both inside and outside the package contribute significantly to the shelf-life of these products. This study evaluated quality changes such as firmness, color, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), sensory quality, and microbial safety of fresh-cut mangoes, pineapples, melons, and mixes of these fruits. Chemical treatments to reduce browning, firmness loss, and decay for these fruits were also investigated. The most effective treatments for fresh-cut mangoes, pineapples, and melons were 0.1 M ascorbic acid, 0.2 M ascorbic acid, and 0.2 M ascorbic acid plus 0.2 M calcium chloride, respectively. These fresh-cut tropical fruits were packaged in three semi-rigid containers made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), oriented polystyrene (OPS), and oriented poly(lactide) (OPLA). Gas composition in the package headspace and the time to reach steady-state conditions were observed to vary among fresh-cut packaging systems and affected their quality and shelf-life. The effects of package permeability, with regards to O2 and CO2, on quality and shelf-life of the fresh-cut products are discussed in this paper. Extended shelf-life was observed in fresh-cut mangoes, pineapples, and mixes packaged in PET due to reduced O2 and elevated CO2 atmosphere. Modified atmosphere of 6% O2 and 14% CO2 achieved in PET extended the shelf-life of fresh-cut pineapples from 6 to 13 days.

Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) and computer modeling using density functional theory were used to determine the transition state of N. meningitides MTAN. KIEs were measured for hydrolysis of 5′- methylthioadenosine (MTA) and were corrected for forward commitment to catalysis to obtain intrinsic KIEs for [1′-3H], [9-15N], [1′-14C], [2′-3H], [4′-3H], [5′-3H2], and [Me-3H3] MTAs. KIEs support an early SN1 transition state unlike the dissociative transition states of other MTANs. Computational modeling of intrinsic KIEs places the leaving group adenine at 1.68 Å from the anomeric carbon, a Pauling bond order of 0.50, and no participation of the hydroxide nucleophile. The N7 of adenine is protonated and the leaving group is cationic owing to the significant bond order to the C1′-N9 bond at the transition state. The 3′-OH is not strongly polarized or ionized at the transition state, unlike other MTANs. The early transition state of N. meningitides MTAN is supported by its inhibition with transition-state analogues.

It was found out that furfural is a bidentate ligand and binds through furan oxygen and carbonyl oxygen with the entire four metal ions in the gas and solution phases. The binding effect is found to be in the order : furan oxygen &lt; carbonyl oxygen. The results indicate that furan oxygen binds to the metal ion through s and Pz orbitals, and the carbonyl oxygen binds through s and py orbitals. The binding effects and modes of both the oxygens are found to differ. Furfural forms high spin complex with CoII and NiII with the multiplicity of 4 and 3 respectively. The strength of CuII-furfural binding in both gas and solution phases is found to be lesser than expected. This may be due to the weak binding effect of furan oxygen.

In this case, the organic air pollution in two important industrial cities, Sarajevo and Tuzla, in Bosnia and Herzegovina (part of former Yugoslavia) was assessed with the emphasis placed on genotoxic risks using both chemical (PAHs analyses) and biological approaches (genotoxicity testing with a screening bacterial genotoxicity test - SOS chromotest). The study was performed as a part of the APOPSBAL project (ICA2-CT2002-10007). So far there has not been any information either about the PAHs pollution or the genotoxic activity of the organic air pollution for the localities under the study. Therefore, the presented information is considered absolutely unique. Both used approaches made possible to identify the localities with the highest pollution level and genotoxic risks in both cities. Generally, higher levels of both parameters were determined in Tuzla, which is much more industrialized than Sarajevo, and especially at localities close to city centers and affected by traffic emissions, but also at localities polluted by emissions from industry and household heating. Even if benzo(a)pyrene concentrations exceeded the maximum permitted levels for this pollutant at some localities in Tuzla, the PAHs concentrations were fully comparable with the levels determined in other industrial European cities. Significant genotoxicity of the organic extracts was detected for almost all of the urban localities in the test both without (- S9; direct genotoxicity) and with the addition of metabolic activation (+ S9; indirect genotoxicity). The observed direct genotoxic activities were discussed in relation to a potential presence of PAHs derivatives in the air. The indirect genotoxic activities were apparently higher at the localities with higher contents of carcinogenic PAHs. The significant relationship between the determined genotoxic activities and the PAHs pollution was also confirmed by a regression analysis. However, the correlations were not absolute because the observed genotoxic activity was also dependent on the presence of other organic pollutants than the PAHs. It concerns predominantly direct genotoxicity which is not related with the PAHs, but with their nitro-, oxi-, and hydroxy-derivatives and also other unknown polar organic pollutants. However, the concentrations of the direct genotoxins apparently correlated with the PAHs contents in the air. The study showed that screening genotoxicity tests, such as the SOS chromotest, could be effectively used for the identification of localities with increased genotoxic risks. In comparison with the health risk assessment which is usually based on the chemical analyses of only a small part of the pollution mixture, the bioassays enable us to evaluate the risks of all the mixture. The localities with the highest detected human health risks according to the screening bioassays may then be analyzed in detail with specific chemical methods to identify their causes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: This study determined whether [11C]mirtazapine is an appropriate molecular tool for use with PET to estimate the magnitude of neuroreceptor occupancy produced by daily intake of mirtazapine. Methods: This study used a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, within-subject design. Eighteen healthy volunteers were PET-scanned twice with [ 11C]mirtazapine; once under baseline condition and again after receiving either placebo or mirtazapine (7.5 or 15 mg) for 5 days. We determined kinetic parameters of [11C]mirtazapine in brain regions by the simplified reference region method and used binding potential values to calculate receptor occupancy produced by mirtazapine. Results: Serum concentrations of mirtazapine ranged from 33 to 56 nmol/l after five daily doses of 7.5 mg mirtazapine and were between 41 and 74 nmol/l after 15 mg mirtazapine. Placebo treatment failed to alter the binding potential of [ 11C]mirtazapine from baseline values, whereas daily intake of mirtazapine markedly decreased the binding potential in cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. Receptor occupancy ranged from 74 to 96% in high-binding regions of the brain after five daily doses of 7.5 mg or 15 mg mirtazapine, whereas 17-48% occupancy occurred in low-binding regions. Conclusions: [11C] Mirtazapine together with PET can determine the degree of receptor occupancy produced by daily doses of mirtazapine in regions of the living human brain. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Anti-depressant; Binding potential; Mirtazapine; PET; Receptor occupancy","mirtazapine; mirtazapine c 11; placebo; unclassified drug; adult; amygdaloid nucleus; article; binding kinetics; brain cortex; brain region; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug binding; drug blood level; fatigue; female; hippocampus; human; irritability; male; positron emission tomography; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; receptor affinity; side effect; volunteer; Adult; Amygdala; Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic; Brain; Carbon Radioisotopes; Cerebellum; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Injections, Intravenous; Male; Mianserin; Middle Aged; Positron-Emission Tomography; Radioligand Assay; Receptors, Cell Surface; Tablets; Time Factors; Trimipramine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35248852880

Reconciling these records requires either that marine carbonates fail to record the full magnitude of the CIE or that the CIE in plants has been amplified relative to the marine. Amplification of the CIE has been proposed to result from an increase in available moisture that allowed terrestrial plants to increase 13C-discrimination during the PETM. Leaf physiognomy, paleopedology and hydrogen isotope ratios of leaf-wax lipids from the Bighorn Basin, however, all suggest that rather than a simple increase in available moisture, climate alternated between wet and dry during the PETM. Here we consider two other explanations and test them quantitatively with the carbon isotopic record of plant lipids. The ""marine modification"" hypothesis is that the marine carbonate record was modified by chemical changes at the PETM and that plant lipids record the true magnitude of the CIE. Using atmospheric CO2 δ13C values estimated from the lipid record, and equilibrium fractionation between CO2 and carbonate, we estimate the expected CIE for planktonic foraminifera to be 6‰. Instead, the largest excursion observed is about 4‰. No mechanism for altering marine carbonate by 2‰ has been identified and we thus reject this explanation. The ""plant community change"" hypothesis is that major changes in floral composition during the PETM amplified the CIE observed in n-alkanes by 1-2‰ relative to marine carbonate. This effect could have been caused by a rapid transition from a mixed angiosperm/conifer flora to a purely angiosperm flora. The plant community change hypothesis is consistent with both the magnitude and pattern of CIE amplification among the different n-alkanes, and with data from fossil plants. This hypothesis predicts that the magnitude and pattern of amplification of CIEs among different n-alkanes will vary regionally and systematically depending on the extent of the replacement of conifers by angiosperms during the PETM. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A method to assist local governments deal with climate variability in the Sydney region is being developed by CSIRO and the Sydney Coastal Councils Group through the Australian Greenhouse Office National Climate Change Adaptation Program. The method consists of: (i) creating vulnerability mapping templates; (ii) working with local governments to determine collective and local vulnerabilities; (iii) analysis of local government priorities and capacity for adaptation; and (iv) assessment of transferability of the method to other regions.","Adaptation; Climate vulnerability; Resilience; Systems approaches",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649100057

Long-term monitoring data are frequently lacking and are especially sparse from Arctic ecosystems, where logistical difficulties limit most monitoring programs. Fortunately, lake and pond sediments contain important archives of past limnological communities that can be used to reconstruct environmental change. Here, we summarize some of the pale-olimnological studies that have documented recent climate warming in Arctic lakes and ponds. Several hypotheses have been evaluated to determine if warming, resulting in changes in ice cover and related variables (eg increased habitat availability), was the factor most strongly influencing recent diatom and other biotic changes. Striking and often unprecedented community changes were evident in post-1850 sediments, and could be linked to ecological shifts consistent with warming. Because future temperature increases are predicted to be greatly amplified in polar regions, the ecological integrity of these sensitive ecosystems will be further imperiled. © The Ecological Society of America.",,"arctic environment; climate change; community dynamics; environmental change; environmental monitoring; ice cover; lacustrine deposit; paleolimnology; pond; temperature effect; warming; Arctic; Bacillariophyta",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35948932939

In this study, two 12-month measurements of PM2.5 mass and speciation were conducted in 00/01 and 04/05 to determine long-term trend and spatial variations of PM2.5 mass and chemical composition in Hong Kong. This study covered three sites with different land-use characteristics, namely roadside, urban, and rural environments. The highest annual average PM2.5 concentration was observed at the roadside site (58.0±2.0 μg m-3 (average±2σ) in 00/01 and 53.0±2.7 μg m-3 in 04/05), followed by the urban site (33.9±2.5 μg m-3 in 00/01 and 39.0±2.0 μg m-3 in 04/05), and the rural site (23.7±1.9 μg m-3 in 00/01 and 28.4±2.4 μg m-3 in 04/05). The lowest PM2.5 level measured at the rural site was still higher than the United States' annual average National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 15 μg m-3. As expected, seasonal variations of PM2.5 mass concentration at the three sites were similar: higher in autumn/winter and lower in summer. Comparing PM2.5 data in 04/05 with those collected in 00/01, a reduction in PM2.5 mass concentration at the roadside (8.7%) but an increase at the urban (15%) and rural (20%) sites were observed. The reduction of PM2.5 at the roadside was attributed to the decrease of carbonaceous aerosols (organic carbon and elemental carbon) (&gt;30%), indicating the effective control of motor vehicle emissions over the period. On the other hand, the sulfate concentration at the three sites was consistent regardless of different land-use characteristics in both studies. The lack of spatial variation of sulfate concentrations in PM2.5 implied its origin of regional contribution. Moreover, over 36% growth in sulfate concentration was found from 00/01 to 04/05, suggesting a significant increase in regional sulfate pollution over the years.

The authors sought to obtain precise dissolution rate data in a short time observing a crystal surface on a nanoscale. For this purpose, phase-shift interferometry was applied. Using this method, uncertainty of the reactive surface area that is imparted on calculation of the dissolution rate constant can also be avoided. The time-course profile of vertical retreat of the surface revealed that the anorthite dissolution process changes from the initial transient state to a later steady state, which is consistent with results of numerous precedent studies. The transient dissolution rate depends strongly on local features (e.g., density of defects, variation of chemical compositions) of the crystal surface, rather than on temperature. Therefore, it is very important to determine the original properties of the anorthite surface for the examination of subsequent dissolution process. Contrary to general expectations, the anorthite dissolution can alter the physical properties of reservoir rock immediately after CO2 injection. The simple estimation using the anorthite dissolution rate obtained in this study, which was done as a test case for the CO2 underground sequestration project conducted by RITE, revealed that porosity of reservoir rock increased about 2% (23-23.4%) of initial values during 60 a. That change in physical property in such a short time might enhance the diffusion of injected CO2 and formation water, and therefore accelerate further geochemical reactions. Results of this study demonstrate that the geochemical water-rock interaction, which is generally regarded as a longer-term phenomenon than various physical processes, can also affect the reservoir system from the initial stage. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Only recently through, research initiatives such as Southern African Fire-Atmosphere Research Initiative in 2000 (SAFARI 2000) and the Cross Border Air Pollution Impact Assessment Project, have the importance of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions been recognized in regional atmospheric chemistry and composition, particularly relating to surface ozone formation. These projects have identified significant gaps in the understanding of BVOC emissions in southern Africa. BVOC emissions are relatively well understood for southern African savanna and woodland plant species and landscapes. Considering that the region is home to more than 20 000 plant species, the most significant gap in the understanding of BVOC emissions is the acute lack of plant specific emission information. Equally important is an understanding of the unique local factors that control BVOC emissions. A project has been launched in South Africa to develop capacity and technologies to address the BVOC knowledge gaps. It focuses on measurement and modelling and aims to develop a cadre of skilled scientists in BVOC sampling techniques using leaf and branch enclosures, relaxed eddy accumulation and lidar techniques in conjunction with development and application of photochemical modelling. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; biogenic emission; volatile organic compound; Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547599167

Non-catalysed motorcycles still represent a large proportion of circulating two-wheelers in Italy and, possibly, also in other countries. Tests were performed on a dynamometer bench, using the ECE-40 test cycle procedure. Particulate matter into the exhaust emissions was collected both during the ""hot"" phase of the ECE-40 driving cycle and including the first two elementary cycles of engine warming-up heating (whole cycle). Fourteen PAHs were quantified and total PAH emission factors (PAH) ranged from 7 to 169 μg km-1. Expressed in benzo(a)pyrene equivalent (BaPeq), emission factors ranged from 0.6 to 18 μg km-1. Results from the tested scooters show that despite their small engine size, non-catalysed motorcycles can emit amounts of particulate PAHs that can be comparable or even higher than emissions reported elsewhere from gasoline- and diesel-powered passenger cars and light- and heavy-duty vehicles. In countries where a large number of non-catalysed motorcycles are circulating, PAH emissions in urban areas from this class of vehicles might be of the same order of magnitude of emissions from diesel passenger cars. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.","Dynamometer bench; Emission factors; Exhaust emission; Motorcycle; Particulate matter; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","Dynamometer bench; Emission factor; Exhaust emission; Air pollution; Dynamometers; Motorcycles; Particles (particulate matter); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Particulate emissions; benzo[a]pyrene; diesel fuel; gasoline; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; automobile; exhaust emission; PAH; particulate matter; article; car; controlled study; dynamometry; exhaust gas; gas chromatography; heating; Italy; mass spectrometry; motorcycle; particulate matter; urban area; Catalysis; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Motor Vehicles; Polycyclic Compounds; Vehicle Emissions; Eurasia; Europe; Italy; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548733784

Fumigation is a common practice in agricultural crop and nursery seedling protection. Soils from various agricultural experiment stations, forest nurseries, and a landfill were evaluated for effects of 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D), methyl isothiocyanate (MITC), and chloropicrin (CP) on CH4 oxidation capacities. All three fumigants significantly reduced CH4 oxidation rates in historically non-fumigated soils (&gt;50%). 1,3-D enhanced CH4 oxidation in 3 out of 5 previously fumigated soils and MITC increased CH4 oxidation rates in all historically MITC-fumigated soils compared to controls. CP universally decreased oxidation capacity regardless of fumigation history. These results support the conclusion that CH4 oxidation effects are fumigant specific and that prior fumigation history plays a vital role in determining the impact on CH4 oxidizer community functionality, which may have implications on the global CH4 cycle.","Enhanced biodegradation; Fumigation history; Methane oxidation; Methanotrophs","Enhanced biodegradation; Fumigation history; Methane oxidation; Methanotrophs; Biodegradation; Land fill; Methane; Oxidation; Soil mechanics; 1,3 dichloropene; agricultural chemical; chloropicrin; methane; methylisothiocyanate; propylene; thiocyanic acid derivative; unclassified drug; fumigant; fumigation; methane; methanogenic bacterium; methanotrophy; microbial activity; microbial community; oxidation; article; biodegradation; crop; forest management; landfill; methanotroph; oxidation; priority journal; seedling; soil fumigation; soil property",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36049005013

This has led to substantial efforts to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions and thereby mitigate the impacts of climate change on a global scale. Despite these efforts, we are committed to substantial further changes over at least the next few decades. Societies will therefore have to adapt to changes in climate. Both adaptation and mitigation require action on scales ranging from local to global, but adaptation could directly benefit from climate predictions on regional scales while mitigation could be driven solely by awareness of the global problem; regional projections being principally of motivational value. We discuss how recent developments of large ensembles of climate model simulations can be interpreted to provide information on these scales and to inform societal decisions. Adaptation is most relevant as an influence on decisions which exist irrespective of climate change, but which have consequences on decadal time-scales. Even in such situations, climate change is often only a minor influence; perhaps helping to restrict the choice of 'no regrets' strategies. Nevertheless, if climate models are to provide inputs to societal decisions, it is important to interpret them appropriately. We take climate ensembles exploring model uncertainty as potentially providing a lower bound on the maximum range of uncertainty and thus a non-discountable climate change envelope. An analysis pathway is presented, describing how this information may provide an input to decisions, sometimes via a number of other analysis procedures and thus a cascade of uncertainty. An initial screening is seen as a valuable component of this process, potentially avoiding unnecessary effort while guiding decision makers through issues of confidence and robustness in climate modelling information. Our focus is the usage of decadal to centennial time-scale climate change simulations as inputs to decision making, but we acknowledge that robust adaptation to the variability of present day climate encourages the development of less vulnerable systems as well as building critical experience in how to respond to climatic uncertainty. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Climate change; Decision making; Probability; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547176663

Maize straw was incorporated into (i) control soil, (ii) soil irrigated with acid rain, (iii) soil amended with heavy metal-polluted filter dust and (iv) soil with both, heavy metal and acid rain treatment, over a period of 74 weeks. The mineralization of maize straw carbon was significantly reduced by heavy metal impact. Reduced mineralization rate of the added carbon likely resulted from a reduction of the microbial biomass due to heavy metal stress, while the efficiency of 13C incorporation into microbial PLFAs was hardly affected. Since acid rain did not significantly change soil pH, little impact on soil microorganisms and mineralization rate was found. Temporal dynamics of labelling of microbial PLFAs were different between bacterial and fungal PLFA biomarkers. Utilization of maize straw by bacterial PLFAs peaked immediately after the application (2 weeks), while labelling of the fungal biomarker 18:2ω6,9 was most pronounced 5 weeks after the application. In general, 13C labelling of microbial PLFAs was closely linked to the amounts of maize carbon present in the soil.

Morphologically cryptic, yet genetically divergent species groups require alternative approaches to delimiting species that assess adaptive divergence and ecological interchangeability of lineages. We apply such an approach to Promyrmekiaphila, a small genus (three nominal taxa) of trapdoor spiders endemic to northern California to define cohesion species (lineages that are genetically exchangeable and ecologically interchangeable). Genetic exchangeability is evaluated using standard phylogeographical techniques (e.g. nested clade analysis); ecological interchangeability is assessed using two GIS-based approaches. First, climatic values are extracted from layer data for each locality point and utilized in a principal components analysis followed by MANOVA. Second, niche-based distribution models of genetically divergent lineages are created using a maximum-entropy modelling approach; the amount of overlap among lineages is calculated and evaluated against a probability distribution of null overlap. Lineages that have significant amounts of predicted overlap are considered ecologically interchangeable. Based on a synthetic evaluation of ecological interchangeability, geographical concordance, and morphological differentiation, we conclude that Promyrmekiaphila comprises six cohesion species, five of which are cryptic (i.e. undetectable by conventional means). © 2007 The Authors.","California; Conservation genetics; Cryptic species; Niche-based distribution modelling; Phylogeography; Trapdoor spiders","animal; article; classification; ecosystem; environment; genetic variability; genetics; geography; phylogeny; population dynamics; spider; United States; Animals; California; Ecosystem; Environment; Geography; Phylogeny; Population Dynamics; Spiders; Variation (Genetics); Araneae; Nemesiidae; Promyrmekiaphila",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547702658

The persistence of these pollutants, in combination with a rapid rise in vehicle travel in recent decades, has raised concerns within the planning and public health communities about the long-term success of an air quality management program that is effectively divorced from the land use planning process. Purpose: This work, which is part of an EPA-sponsored study tided Projecting the Impact of Land Use and Transportation on Future Air Quality (PLUTO), was intended to assess the effectiveness of compact growth in improving air quality at a geographic scale compatible with secondary pollution formation and transport and over a planning horizon sufficient to capture the longer-term benefits of regional land use change. Methods: Future air quality is associated with alternative land development scenarios in this study through the integration of three separate and previously unrelated modeling components. These components consist of a set of standard population projection techniques, a household vehicle travel activity framework, and a mobile source emissions model (MOBILE 6) developed by the EPA. Results and conclusions: The results of our analysis find the median elasticity of vehicle travel with respect to density change over time to be -0.35, suggesting metropolitan areas can expect a 10% increase in population density to be associated with a 3.5% reduction in household vehicle travel and emissions. In addition, vehicle elasticities derived for urban and suburban census tracts across the 11 metro regions suggest density increments within urban zones (-0.43) to be more than twice as effective in reducing vehicle travel and emissions as density increments within suburban zones (-0.19). Takeaway for practice: We found compactness to be associated with greater reductions in vehicle travel than in previous studies, which suggests land use change can play a measurable role in improving regional air quality over time. Importantly, we found where compact growth occurs to be critically important to determining the extent to which higher density development reduces vehicle travel and emissions. We found the densification of urban zones to be more than twice as effective in reducing vehicle miles of travel and emissions as the densification of suburban zones, suggesting compact growth to be better for air quality than historical patterns of growth when densifying urban zones is given priority over non-urban zones. © American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.","Air pollution; Climate change; Compact growth; Growth management; Smart growth; Travel behavior","air quality; atmospheric pollution; climate change; emission control; environmental planning; land use planning; metropolitan area; pollution policy; regulatory framework; travel behavior; urban planning; urban pollution; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36549035717

There are two approaches for setting baselines namely, project-specific and regional baseline. This paper presents the methodology adopted for estimating the land available for mitigation, for developing a regional baseline, transaction cost involved and a comparison of project-specific and regional baseline. The study showed that it is possible to estimate the potential land and its suitability for afforestation and reforestation mitigation projects, using existing maps and data, in the dry zone of Karnataka, southern India. The study adopted a three-step approach for developing a regional baseline, namely: (i) identification of likely baseline options for land use, (ii) estimation of baseline rates of land-use change, and (iii) quantification of baseline carbon profile over time. The analysis showed that carbon stock estimates made for wastelands and fallow lands for project-specific as well as the regional baseline are comparable. The ratio of wasteland Carbon stocks of a project to regional baseline is 1.02, and that of fallow lands in the project to regional baseline is 0.97. The cost of conducting field studies for determination of regional baseline is about a quarter of the cost of developing a project-specific baseline on a per hectare basis.

Field studies for aboveground and belowground biomass, woody litter, and soil organic carbon for baseline and project scenarios were conducted to estimate the carbon sequestration potential. The baseline carbon stock was estimated to be 45.3 t C/ha, predominately in soils. The additional carbon sequestration potential under the project scenario for 30 years is estimated to be 12.8 t C/ha/year inclusive of harvest regimes and carbon emissions due to biomass burning and fertilizer application. Considering carbon storage in harvested wood, an additional 45% carbon benefit can be accounted. The project scenario has a higher benefit/cost ratio compared to the baseline scenario.

We build on our own recent work which decomposes changes in the aggregate US energy-GDP ratio into shifts in sectoral composition (structural change) and adjustments in the energy demand of individual industries (intensity change), and identifies the impact on the latter of price-induced substitution of variable inputs, shifts in the composition of capital and embodied and disembodied technical progress. We employ a recursive-dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the US economy to analyze the implications of these findings for future energy use and carbon emissions. Comparison of the simulation results against projections of historical trends in GDP, energy use and emissions reveals that the range of values for the rate of autonomous energy efficiency improvement (AEEI) conventionally used in CGE models is consistent with the effects of structural changes at the sub-sector level, rather than disembodied technological change. Even so, our results suggest that US emissions may well grow faster in the future than in the recent past. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we have investigated the effects of formaldehyde on mRNA expression in rat lung tissues by applying genomics. Rats were exposed to ambient air and two different concentrations of formaldehyde (0, 5, 10 ppm) for 2 weeks at 6 h/day and 5 days/week in an inhalation chamber. Malondialdehyde (MDA) assay and carbonyl spectrometric assay were conducted to determine lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation levels and Comet assays were used for genotoxicity evaluation. Level of MDA, carbonyl insertion and DNA damage in the lungs of rats exposed to FA were found to be dose dependently increased. Gene expression was evaluated by using a bio-array hybridization analysis. A total of 21 (2 up- and 19 down-regulated) genes were identified as biomarkers for formaldehyde effects. Several differentiated gene groups were found. Genes involved in apoptosis, immunity, metabolism, signal transduction, transportation, coagulation and oncogenesis were found to be up- and down-regulated. Among these genes, the mRNA expressions of cytochrome P450, hydroxymethylbilane synthase, glutathione reductase, carbonic anhydrase 2, natriuretic peptide receptor 3, lysosomal associated protein transmembrane 5, regulator of G-protein signaling 3, olfactomedin related ER localized protein, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. In summary, the MDA lipid peroxidation and the carbonyl protein oxidation assays showed that cytotoxic effects increased with increasing formaldehyde levels. Genomic analysis showed that 21 genes were up- or down-regulated. Of these genes, nine were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and could be potential biomarkers for human diseases associated with formaldehyde exposure. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","DNA damage; Formaldehyde; Genomics; Lipid peroxidation; Protein oxidation; Rat lung","biological marker; carbonate dehydratase II; carbonyl derivative; cytochrome P450; formaldehyde; glutathione reductase; lysosomal associated protein transmembrane 5; malonaldehyde; messenger RNA; natriuretic peptide receptor 3; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase 1; olfactomedin related ER localized protein; porphobilinogen deaminase; receptor protein; regulator of G protein signaling 3; unclassified drug; ambient air; animal experiment; animal tissue; apoptosis; article; blood clotting; carcinogenesis; comet assay; concentration (parameters); controlled study; DNA damage; DNA hybridization; dose response; down regulation; evaluation; gene expression profiling; gene insertion sequence; genomics; genotoxicity; immunity; lipid peroxidation; lung parenchyma; male; metabolism; nonhuman; oxidation kinetics; priority journal; rat; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; spectrometry; upregulation; Animals; Carcinogens; DNA Damage; Formaldehyde; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Lipid Peroxidation; Lung; Male; Malondialdehyde; Mutagens; Protein Carbonylation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447550088

More recently, most monitored lakes have shown signs of chemical recovery (increase in acid neutralizing capacity) as sulfur deposition levels have declined in response to the Clean Air Act and other emissions control legislation. We used measured and modeled trends in past lakewater acidification and projections of future recovery from acidification to extrapolate results from judgment samples of intensively studied lakes to the population of acid-sensitive Adirondack lakes. Simulations were developed for 70 watersheds using the Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments (MAGIC) to classify lakes according to their sensitivity to change in atmospheric S and N deposition. MAGIC simulations suggested that the modeled Adirondack Long-Term Monitoring Project (ALTM) and Adirondack Effects Assessment Project (AEAP) lakes were largely among the lakes in the population that had acidified most between 1850 and 1990. Most of the modeled ALTM/AEAP lakes were within the top 36% of acid sensitivity, based on model projections of past acidification and future chemical recovery, compared with the 1,829 Adirondack lakes in EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) statistical frame. Results of this research will allow fuller utilization of data from on-going chemical and biological monitoring and process-level studies by providing a basis for regionalization of findings and developing/refining relationships among watershed characteristics, chemical change, and biological responses to changing levels of acidic deposition. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Acidic deposition; Acidification; Adirondack Mountains; Air pollution; Lakes; Nitrogen; Recovery; Regional representativeness; Sulfur","Acidity; Air pollution; Computer simulation; Groundwater; Nitrogen; Particulate emissions; Population dynamics; Sensitivity analysis; Statistical methods; Sulfur deposits; Adirondack Effects Assessment; Atmospheric deposition; Chemical recovery; Neutralizing capacity; Environmental engineering; lake water; nitrogen; sulfur; Acidity; Air pollution; Computer simulation; Environmental engineering; Groundwater; Nitrogen; Particulate emissions; Population dynamics; Sensitivity analysis; Statistical methods; Sulfur deposits; acid deposition; acidification; assessment method; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; biomonitoring; emission control; lacustrine environment; nitrogen; sulfur; acidification; article; atmospheric deposition; biological monitoring; environmental monitoring; human; lake; nitrogen deposition; sensitivity analysis; simulation; United States; watershed; Adirondack Mountains; New York [United States]; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34648835098

At both locations, samples were collected between November 2002 and August 2005 and analyzed for fine PM mass and its chemical constituents. The measured chemical constituents included elements, cations, anions, organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC), black carbon (BC), and water-soluble short-chain (WSSC) organic acids. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to the measured concentrations and eight and seven factors were resolved at Potsdam and Stockton, respectively. Four factors were resolved in common between the two locations including secondary sulfate, secondary nitrate, secondary OC, and a crustal factor. The factor profiles of mixed industrial and motor vehicle factors resolved at Potsdam were different compared with the corresponding profiles for these factors at Stockton. A resuspended road salt factor was identified at Potsdam, while an aged sea salt factor was identified at Stockton. At Potsdam, a wood smoke factor was also resolved. Among the resolved factors, secondary sulfate was the highest contributor to the measured mass at both sites. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis indicated the Ohio River Valley region as a common potential source region for this factor at both locations. For the secondary nitrate factor, at Potsdam PSCF analysis indicated the Midwestern US (NOx emissions), and the US farm belt (ammonia emissions) as potential source regions, while at Stockton, the Midwestern US (power plant NOx emissions) was indicated as a major potential source region. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Functional polymorphisms in genes encoding one-carbon metabolism enzymes, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T and A1298C), methionine synthase (MTR A2756G), methionine synthase reductase (MTRR A66G) and thymidylate synthase, influence folate metabolism and thus might be suspected of impacting on lung cancer risk. We therefore conducted a case-control study with 515 lung cancer cases newly and histologically diagnosed and 1030 age- and sex-matched non-cancer controls to clarify associations with these five polymorphisms according to lung cancer subtype. Gene-environment interactions with smoking and drinking habit and folate consumption were also evaluated by logistic regression analysis. None of the polymorphisms showed any significant impact on lung cancer overall risk by genotype alone, but on histology-based analysis increase in MTHFR 677T and 1298C alleles was associated with reduced risk of squamous/small cell carcinoma (P = 0.029), especially among heavy smokers (P = 0.035), whereas the MTHFR 677TT genotype was linked to decreased risk for these subtypes among heavy drinkers (odds ratio = 0.17, 95% confidence interval: 0.03-0.98). In addition, we found interactions between the MTRR A66G polymorphism and smoking (P = 0.015) and the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and alcohol consumption (P = 0.025) for risk of lung cancer overall. In conclusion, the results suggest that MTHFR polymorphisms contribute to risk of squamous/small cell carcinomas of the lung, along with possible interactions among folate metabolism-related polymorphisms and smoking/ drinking habits.

The aim of the study was to elucidate the impact of host preference or host specificity on the AMF community in the roots. The roots were analyzed by nested PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism screening, and sequencing of ribosomal DNA small-subunit and internal transcribed spacer regions. The AMF sequences were analyzed phylogenetically and used to define monophyletic sequence types. The AMF community composition was strongly influenced by the host plant species, but compositions did not significantly differ between the two sites. Detailed analyses of the two cooccurring gentian species G. verna and G. acaulis, as well as of neighboring Trifolium spp., revealed that their AMF communities differed significantly. All three host plant taxa harbored AMF communities comprising multiple phylotypes from different fungal lineages. A frequent fungal phylotype from Glomus group B was almost exclusively found in Trifolium spp., suggesting some degree of host preference for this fungus in this habitat. In conclusion, the results indicate that within a relatively small area with similar soil and climatic conditions, the host plant species can have a major influence on the AMF communities within the roots. No evidence was found for a narrowing of the mycosymbiont spectrum in the two green gentians, in contrast to previous findings with their achlorophyllous relatives.

CBSM takes into account basic principles of psychology with applied research methods in a way that provides a usable framework for practitioners working to promote behavior change across a variety of settings. One strategy is to select the target behavior and make an appropriate strategy to persuade them, such as desired income. In order to make it successful, the identification of barriers must first be solved for the customers.

The nature of adsorbed NO species and the structures of divalent Co species were characterized by FT-IR, DR-UV/vis, XAFS, and DFT calculations. The Co2+-ensemble structure attached on the γ-Al2O3 surface was crucial for the increase in the NO adsorption equilibrium and the promotion of NO reactivity at the surface by gas-phase CO, while monomeric Co2+ sites did not bring out the promotional effects of CO. DFT calculations and FT-IR study revealed that the coordination structure of Co2+ sites was restructured to form a more stable geminal dinitrosyl species, showing Co-OAl (surface) bond breaking, which is an origin of the increase in NO adsorption. Direct interaction of the adsorbed dinitrosyl with gas-phase CO (Eley-Rideal mechanism) was conceived to be involved in the transition state of the NO reduction to form N2O + CO2. The reactive NO species were assigned to cis-(NO)2 dimeric species (mononitrosyl pair) with the 2π*-2π* bonding between the two NO adsorbates on the adjacent two Co2+ sites with unoccupied d orbitals directed to each other. The energy profiles for the NO adsorption and reduction on the Co2+-ensemble catalyst were presented.

Meteorological inputs to the CMAQ chemical transport model are developed by downscaling the GISS Global Climate Model simulations using an MM5-based regional climate model. Future-year emissions for North America are developed by growing the U.S. EPA CAIR inventory, Mexican and Canadian emissions and by using the IMAGE model with the IPCC A1B emissions scenario that is also used in projecting future climate. Reductions of more than 50% in NOX and SO2 emissions are forecast. Impacts of global climate change alone on regional air quality are small compared to impacts from emission control-related reductions, although increases in pollutant concentrations due to stagnation and other factors are found. The combined effect of climate change and emission reductions lead to a 20% decrease (regionally varying from -11% to -28%) in the mean summer maximum daily 8-hour ozone levels (M8hO3) over the United States. Mean annual PM2.5 concentrations are estimated to be 23% lower (varies from -9% to -32%). Major reductions in sulfate, nitrate and ammonium PM2.5 components combined with the limited reduction in organic carbon suggests that organic carbon will be the dominant component of PM2.5 mass in the future. Regionally, the eastern United States benefits more than the rest of the regions from reductions in both M8hO3 and PM2.5, because of both spatial variations in the meteorological and emissions changes. Reduction in the higher M8hO3 concentrations is also estimated for all subregions and fewer days with M8hO3 above the air quality standards in urban sites with Atlanta in the southeast benefiting most.

The reproducibility of the present-climate precipitation amounts, in the lower-latitude regions was not as good as that of the surface air temperature, although it was better simulated in the higher-latitude regions. The future precipitation increase was not statistically significant. It was also statistically revealed that precipitation in future projections, with GCM-RCM systems, tended to converge in regions where the model biases were small.

A procedure for identifying the minimum amount of zero-carbon energy resource required to achieve the overall emissions target for a country or region, given that the amount of fossil energy resources available are already known. The pinch analysis method can be used for a single overall emissions target, or for cases wherein separate sectors or geographic regions have distinct targets but share a common energy resource. For the latter case the procedure allows the allocation of the energy resources to meet both the overall emissions limit and the individual targets of the different sectors or location. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the technique, which is intended for use as a preliminary energy sector-planning tool. © 2006.","Carbon constraints; Emissions; Energy planning; Pinch analysis","Carbon; Climate change; Energy resources; Numerical methods; Particulate emissions; Strategic planning; Carbon constraints; Energy planning; Pinch analysis; Industrial management; Carbon; Climate change; Energy resources; Industrial management; Numerical methods; Particulate emissions; Strategic planning; carbon emission; energy efficiency; energy planning; environmental constraint; optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247223649

To satisfy these demands, various free-machining steels have been researched and developed. One of them is BN free-machining steel that contains hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). However, the machinability was not stable. In this study, machining tests were carried out to clarify the machinability of steels and appropriate chemical composition of work material and tool material to achieve high efficient machining. Tested work materials were plane carbon steel JIS S45C and BN free-machining steels. The JIS S45C was used as the standard. The tool wear in turning BN free-machining steel was smaller than that in turning standard steel. In case of turning BN1 with P30 at 200, 300 m/min, the wear progress rate of flank wear and crater depth were about half as much as that in turning standard steel. BN free-machining steel showed slightly lower cutting temperature and smaller cutting force in comparison with standard steel at the tested cutting speeds. Al and N were detected as a layer at the tool wear region of P grade carbide tools after turning BN free-machining steel at high cutting speed. It is thought that one of the main reasons of outstanding machinability of BN free-machining steel is that the deposited layer containing Al and N acts as diffusion barrier at the tool-chip interface. In turning larger Al content BN-added steel with higher Ti content cutting tools, a larger wear reduction was observed. Therefore, it is said that not only added BN but also appropriate Al is necessary in work material. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The Ro values of the coal range from 0.88% to 0.91%. The trends of the δ13C1 values and δ13CCO2 values downward in the stratigraphic profile are opposite: the former appears as a slight light-heavy-light trend, but the latter appears as a heavy-light-heavy trend. The δ13C1 values have a negative correlation with the δ13CCO2 values. However, the δ13C2 values have no correlation with the δ13C1 values due to its complicated variation. The thermal evolution of the coal in the Xinji area is in the phase of a lot of wet gas generation, but most of the CO2 and heavy hydrocarbons have been reduced or degraded by microbes and have changed into biogenic methane. The coalbed gas is comprised of secondary biogenic methane, thermogenic methane, the residual thermogenic CO2 and heavy-hydrocarbons, and nitrogen (mainly derived from the atmosphere). Based on the binary mixed mode, the estimated portion of thermogenic methane is 31.5% to 39.9% while that for the secondary biogenic methane is 60.1% to 68.5%. Intense tectonic uplift, faults and erosion in the studied area have created favorable conditions for the infiltration of surface water, the abundance of microbes and the formation of the secondary biogenic methane. The coalbed gas in the Xinji area is a mixed type made of a greater portion of secondary biogenic gas and a smaller portion of thermogenic gas. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Our approach is to formulate the emission projections for a given scenario into growth factors that can be used to project forward the 1999 National Emission Inventory (NEI99). The process involves (1) mapping NEI99 source classification code (SCC)-based emissions into the sector or standard industrial classification (SIC)-based representation used by the econometric model, (2) developing a sectoral emission intensity (EMI) defined as the sector emissions per unit of sector economic output and the mechanism to consider EMI variations over time, (3) using the resulting EMI with econometric models and future emission activities to project future emissions, (4) and then mapping the emissions back to the original NEI99 format. As a case study, we apply the model to project emissions in the Chicago metropolitan area.

Hydrogen isotopes were also measured in the oil fraction and the produced water. Experimental runs were conducted in the flow-through reactor at 260-310 °C and 30 bar using the synthesis gas composed of 5N2 + 3H2 + 2CO, on Fe-catalyst mixed with ZSM-5 synthetic zeolite. In the two of seven runs a Fe + Co-catalyst was used that gives a lower yield of unsaturated hydrocarbons in reaction products. The isotopic effects depended on the conversion of the carbon monoxide. Under steady-state conditions (CO conversion more than 90%) a strong kinetic fractionation was observed between CO and CO2 (∼-10‰) and CO and hydrocarbons (∼+38‰). At low conversion a clear ""inverse"" isotopic trend of the depletion in 13C of longer hydrocarbon chains was observed. On average, Δ12 = δ13C(CH4) - δ13C(C2H6) correlates well with the CO conversion: the C2H6 is ∼6‰ isotopically lighter than CH4 at low conversion and ∼2‰ heavier at steady-state regime. Under steady-state conditions there almost no difference was observed in the isotopic composition of methane and ethane and higher hydrocarbons. The chemical composition of light hydrocarbons in the products of flow-through, dynamic FTS is different from that found in the static FTS-type experiments with Fe-catalyst, but isotopic effects are similar. Our results suggest that the isotopic distribution of carbon found in so-called ""abiogenic"" hydrocarbons from some natural gases (δ13C1 &gt; δ13C2 &gt; δ13C3 &gt;⋯) is somewhat similar to that at low conversion of CO, but do not resemble the distribution characteristic for the high conversion products, at least, on Fe-catalyst. Other processes (a simple mixing of two or more endmembers) or other P-T conditions of the carbon reduction could be responsible for the ""inverse"" isotopic trend found in meteorites and some natural gases. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, relatively little attention has been given so far to associated changes in trace gas fluxes. Here, we measure methane (CH4) fluxes and CO2 production, as well as microbial C, nitrogen (N) and mineral-N, in intact, gradually dried (ca. 2 months at 20 °C) cores of a volcanic soil and a heavier textured, non-volcanic soil collected within plantations of Pinus radiata D. Don (pine) and adjacent permanent pastures. CH4 fluxes and CO2 production were also measured in cores of another volcanic soil under reverting shrubland (mainly Kunzea var. ericoides (A. Rich) J. Thompson) and an adjacent pasture. CH4 uptake in the pine and shrubland cores of the volcanic soils at field capacity averaged about 35 and 14 μg CH4-C m-2 h-1, respectively, and was significantly higher than in the pasture cores (about 21 and 6 μg CH4-C m-2 h-1, respectively). In the non-volcanic soil, however, CH4-C uptake was similar in most cores of the pine and pasture soils, averaging about 7-9 μg m-2 h-1, except in very wet samples. In contrast, rates of CO2 production and microbial C and N concentrations were significantly lower under pine than under pasture. In the air-dry cores, microbial C and N had declined in the volcanic soil, but not in the non-volcanic soil; ammonium-N, and especially nitrate-N, had increased significantly in all samples. CH4 uptake was, with few exceptions, not significantly influenced by initial concentrations of ammonium-N or nitrate-N, nor by their changes on air-drying. A combination of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and stable isotope probing (SIP) analyses of only the pine and pasture soils showed that different methanotrophic communities were probably active in soils under the different vegetations. The C18 PLFAs (type II methanotrophs) predominated under pine and C16 PLFAs (type I methanotrophs) predominated under pasture. Overall, vegetation, soil texture, and water-filled pore space influenced CH4-C uptake more than did soil mineral-N concentrations. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Objective: We determined the effectiveness of a 2-y controlled community-based intervention to prevent excessive weight gain in 5-12-y-old children by enhancing opportunities for healthy eating and noncurricular physical activity. Design: Children (n = 730) from 4 intervention and 3 control schools underwent measurements of height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, diet, and physical activity at baseline and at 1 and 2 y. Intervention components included nutrition education that targeted reductions in sweetened drinks and increased fruit and vegetable intake and activity coordinators who managed an activity program that focused on noncurricular lifestyle-based activities (eg, community walks). Results: Body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) z score was significantly lower in intervention children than in control children by a mean of 0.09 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.18) after 1 y and 0.26 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.32) at 2 y, but the prevalence of overweight did not differ. Waist circumference was significantly lower at 2 y (-1 cm), and systolic blood pressure was reduced at 1 y (-2.9 mm Hg). An interaction existed between intervention group and overweight status (P=0.029), such that mean BMI z score was reduced in normal-weight (-0.29; 95% CI:-0.38,-0.21) but not overweight (-0.02;95%CI:-0.16, 0.12) intervention children relative to controls. Intervention children consumed fewer carbonated beverages (67% of control intake; P = 0.04) and fruit juice or drinks (70%; P = 0.03) and more fruit (0.8 servings/3 d; P &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: A relatively simple approach, providing activity coordinators and basic nutrition education in schools, significantly reduces the rate of excessive weight gain in children, although this may be limited to those not initially overweight.

The results indicate that the surface layer of the glasses contains tellurium ions in two chemical states, which differ markedly in concentration. The oxidation state of one type of tellurium ion is close to that in TeO, E b1 (Te 3d 5/2)= 574.0 eV, and the oxidation state of the other is close to that in TeO 2 [ E b2 (Te 3d 5/2) = 576.6 eV.

Ar +-ion milling for 4 min using an argon gun markedly reduces the surface hydrocarbon contamination but has, for the most part, an insignificant effect on the characteristics of the XPS spectra. Increasing the ion milling time leads to the formation of new states of both tellurium and tungsten ions.

Model parameterization was done using measured and published soil and vegetation data, published trends of nutrient dynamics, governmental databases on atmospheric deposition and climate, the reconstruction method MAKEDEP and throughfall equations that we developed for coniferous stands. The model suggested that forest disturbances, both anthropogenic and natural, increased base saturation, and thus base cation availability, to different degrees for periods of one to five decades. However, such disturbances, no matter their interval of return and their intensity, did not appear to be the main driving force of soil chemistry in the long term. On the other hand, simulation results showed that the B horizon at all sites has undergone acidification due to acid atmospheric deposition during the 20th century. Results suggest that atmospheric deposition is the main driver of long-term trends of soil chemistry for the study sites and that the issue of sustainability of soil productivity depends more on air pollution abatement policies than on forest management strategies. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Interesting results were observed for the above reactions and they support the efficiency of the MBI to derive the fundamental parameters of adsorption and catalysis. Sustenance of CO oxidation at 400 K is dependent mostly on the absence of CO-poisoning; apparently, CO + O recombination is the rate determining step ≤400 K.

The surprisingly rapid decline in air-sea partial pressure difference (δpCO2) is primarily a response to an elevated water column inventory of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), which, in turn, reflects mostly anthropogenic CO2 input rather than natural interannual variability. The resulting decline in the buffering capacity of the inorganic carbonate system (increasing Revelle factor) sets up a theoretically predicted feedback loop whereby the invasion of anthropogenic CO2 reduces the ocean's ability to uptake additional CO2. Model simulations for the North Atlantic Ocean and thermodynamic principles reveal that this feedback should be stronger, at present, in colder midlatitude and subpolar waters because of the lower present-day buffer capacity and elevated DIC levels driven either by northward advected surface water and/or excess local air-sea CO2 uptake.

This paper reports a new combination of existing methods for indirect estimation of resuspension emission factors for Marylebone Road, London, a busy multi-lane highway in a street canyon. The method involves firstly estimating the total source strength of coarse particles (PM2.5-10) arising from the road by calculating the roadside incremental concentration of coarse particles above the urban background. This is converted to a source strength by its ratio to NOx whose source strength is estimated from the knowledge of the traffic mix and mean speed. This coarse particle source strength is assumed to represent the sum of resuspension emissions and the coarse particle component of abrasion emissions. Using information on the traffic mix and speed, the abrasion emissions have been calculated from the EMEP/CORINAIR emissions factor database, the result subtracted from the total coarse particle emissions in order to yield resuspension emissions, and combined with traffic count data to derive fleet-average emission factors. Using the fact that the traffic mix differs substantially between weekdays and weekends, separate average emission factors for light- and heavy-duty vehicles have been estimated. In addition to traffic mix, the influence of wind speed and the time elapsed since the last rainfall upon resuspension have been estimated. Wind speed was found to have by far the larger influence, although this was still secondary to the number of heavy-duty vehicles. Uncertainties arising from the choice of urban background site and poor data quality are discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to gain a more comprehensive view on the diversity of methanogenic Archaea in compost, gas chromatographical methods and molecular cloning were used to study relationships of thermophilic archaeal communities and changes in methane production potential during compost maturation. According to the thermophilic methane production potential, wide differences could be detected between differently aged compost materials. In material derived from 3- and 4-week-old piles, low and no thermophilic methane production potential, respectively, was observed at 50 °C. Material from a 6-week-old pile showed the maximum methane production. With compost maturation, the production slowly decreased again with 6 weeks, 8 weeks, and mature compost showing an optimum methane production potential at 60 °C. At 70 °C, only 6-week-old material showed a comparable high production of methane. The 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic surveys revealed an increase of archaeal diversity with compost maturation. In the 6-week-old material, 86% of the sequences in the archaeal 16S rRNA library had the highest sequence similarities to Methanothermobacter spp. and the remaining 14% of the clones were related to Methanosarcina thermophila. Quantification of methanogens in 6-week-old material, on the basis of the methane production rate, resulted in values of about 2×107 cells per gram fresh weight. In 8-week-old and mature compost material, the proportion of sequences similar to Methanothermobacter spp. decreased to 34% and 0%, respectively. The mature compost material showed the highest variation in identified sequences, although 33% could be assigned to as yet uncultured Archaea (e.g. Rice cluster I, III, and IV). Our results indicate that compost harbours a diverse community of thermophilic methanogens, with changing composition during the maturation process, presumably due to altered pile conditions. Likewise, compost may act as a potential carrier for thermophilic methanogens in temperate soils because it is widely used as a soil amendment. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

The decomposition rate constant (wk-1) ranged from 0.034 (Dactyladenia, subhumid zone) to 0.49 (Gliricidia, humid zone) in the rainy season, and from 0.01 (Dactyladenia, subhumid zone) to 0.235 (Pterocarpus, arid zone) in the dry season. The direct correlation between the decomposition rate of plant residues and their quality was only valid in agroeco-zones where there is not moisture stress. Similarly, the direct correlation between the decomposition rate of plant residues and moisture availability was only valid for plant residues with high quality. The decomposition rate of the low quality plant residue could increase from humid to arid zone in West Africa. In the arid zone, the low quality plant residue could also decompose faster than high quality plant residue. The climate-residue quality interactive effects on plant residue decomposition in West Africa were attributed to the feedback of low quality plant residue's mulching effect, soil fauna and appreciable photodegradation in dry regions. A decomposition equation that could be used to predict the decomposition rate of plant residues with various qualities across agroeco-zones in West Africa was obtained from this study. The equation was expressed as follow: k = 0.122 - 0.000747*PRQI2- 0.0233*PRQI*CI + 0.00337*CI*PRQI2, in which k is the decomposition rate constant (wk-1), PRQI the plant residue quality index, and CI the climate index (ratio of rainfall to sunshine hours cumulative during the entire decomposition). The response of N and P release from plant residues to residue quality and climate was similar to that of residue decomposition. At the late stage of the dry season decomposition, the high C/N and C/P ratio plant residue (Dactyladenia leaves) that immobilized N and P in wet zones showed a release of N and P in the dry zone. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Decomposition rate constant; Mulching effect; N and P release; Niger; Nigeria; Photodegradation; Soil fauna","decomposition; humid environment; mulching; nutrient; photodegradation; plant residue; soil fauna; Africa; East Africa; Eritrea; Nigeria; Sahel [Eritrea]; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa; Alchornea cordifolia; Dactyladenia; Dactyladenia barteri; Gliricidia; Gliricidia sepium; Pterocarpus; Pterocarpus santalinoides; Senna; Senna siamea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348825581

Yohe (2003) suggested that this problem could be alleviated if international development aid were directed at eliminating the source of the problem - climate induced negative growth rates in a few regions along a handful of troublesome scenarios. The hypothesis about adding a second policy lever to the climate policy calculus is shown to hold, though perhaps not as robustly as originally thought. A portfolio of international policies with at least two independent tools can avoid infinite uncertainty on the margins and the associated implications for global mitigation policy at a reasonable price even in the relatively unlikely event that climate change causes negative economic growth in a region or two. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Cost benefit analysis; Economic analysis; International cooperation; Public policy; Robust control; Uncertainty analysis; Climate policy; Economic growth; Global mitigation policy; Marginal damage; Climate change; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; environmental policy; feedback mechanism; global change; international aid; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447109221

In this issue of the Journal (Am J Epidemiol 2007;166:880-888), Dominici et al. explore temporal and spatial effect modification of particulate matter potency with the goal of gaining insights about how differences in the mixture may affect toxicity of the particulate matter, and they propose that it may be a useful tool in assessing the net impact of regulatory activity. Their approach is fresh and creative and yields provocative results. Such assessments will, of course, be constrained by limited power to detect the expected small degree of effect modification, as well as an abundance of possible explanations for observed differences in risk per unit mass. The utility for accountability assessment is further limited because regulatory actions impacting particulate matter levels do not necessarily target the most toxic species within the mixture and may confer benefits by reducing population exposure to particles and components of lesser toxicity. Used cautiously, however, this new methodology may provide a complementary approach to more direct assessments in shedding light on the characteristics of ambient particulate matter predictive of health effects. © The Author 2007.

The present study evaluated the distribution of residual DDT in channel sediment six years following extensive remedial dredging. High DDT concentrations (up to 252 mg/ kg) were found in Young Bay Mud sampled across the channel. Particle analyses showed most of the contamination is contained in the clay/silt sediment fraction, and desorption tests showed that availability is greater for DDT metabolites than parent DDT. The present study examined the feasibility of using activated carbon amendment to sequester DDT from sediment, including an evaluation of reactivated carbon as a less costly alternative to virgin activated carbons. Treatment success of activated carbon amendment to sediment collected from Lauritzen Channel was measured by reductions in aqueous equilibrium concentrations and uptake in semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs). Four different activated carbons were tested and, after one month of treatment with 3.2 weight % carbon, DDT aqueous equilibrium concentrations were reduced up to 83% and SPMD uptake was reduced up to 91%. Reactivated carbon was comparable with virgin carbons in all tests. Reduction in SPMD uptake of DDT by treatment with 3.2% reactivated carbon increased to 99% after 26 months of treatment. The effectiveness of activated carbon was dependent on the type, size, dose, and contact time.

In particular, the costs of hydrogen addition were evaluated against the combined costs for other current NOx and CO2 emissions control technologies for both existing and new systems to determine its benefits and market feasibility. Markets for NOx emissions credits currently exist in California and the Northeast States and are expected to grow. Although regulations are not currently in place in the United States, several other countries have implemented carbon tax and carbon credit programs. The analysis thus assumes that the United States adopts future legislation similar to these programs. Therefore, potential sale of emissions credits for volunteer retrofits was also included in the study. It was found that hydrogen addition is a competitive alternative to traditional emissions abatement techniques under certain conditions.

To address this problem, telescoping, multimodel approaches are proposed, which allow representation of a broad range of processes that could regulate convective storm behavior. In the global-cloud approach (G-C), the NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis Project (NNRP) global data set provides initial and boundary conditions for short-term integrations of a mesoscale model and nested convective-cloud-permitting domain. In the global-regional-cloud approach (G-R-C), the NNRP data set provides initial and boundary conditions for long-term integrations of a regional climate model, which in turn forces short-term integrations of a mesoscale model and nested convective-cloud-permitting domain. Upon applying these approaches to historical extreme convective storm events, it was found that the global-scale data could be dynamically downscaled to produce realistic convective-scale solutions. In particular, tornado proxies computed from the model-simulated winds were shown to compare well in relative numbers to those of tornado observations on many of the days considered. This supports the telescoping modeling concept as a viable means to address effects of elevated greenhouse gas concentrations on convective-scale phenomena. In an evaluation of the two approaches, it was also found that simulations of the historical events by the G-C were superior to those by the G-R-C. Sensitivity of the convective-scale processes to details in the downscaled synoptic-scale flow, and to the placement of the mesoscale model domain within the regional climate model, reduced the effectiveness of the G-R-C.

Multiple linear regression is used to model interannual variation in snow cover duration as a function of winter mean daily temperature and monthly precipitation. Snow cover duration is closely linked to temperature, while precipitation contributes a positive effect among winters of similar temperature mode. Snow cover duration at mid to upper altitudes (600-900 m) responds most strongly to variation in mean daily temperature. A 1°C rise in temperature at the station corresponds to a 15-day reduction in snow cover at 130 m and a 33-day reduction at 750 m. The empirical relationship is applied to climate change scenarios from the HadRM3 regional climate model. Under a 'low' greenhouse gas emissions scenario, snow cover in the 2050s is projected to be reduced by 93% at 130 m, 43% at 600 m and 21% at 1060 m, while under a 'high' emissions scenario these reductions are projected to be 100%, 68%, and 32%, respectively. The potential impact of snow cover reduction on snow-dependent vegetation is modeled.

Three electrolyser implementation cases were simulated for three days characterised mainly by wind availability and emphasis was placed on maximizing the smoothness of the load profile (LF) applied to thermal power plant. If zero-carbon hydrogen is to be produced a daily load factor for thermal power plant of 90% is the upper limit, but load factors of up to 100% are achievable if a carbon intensity of 3 kgCO2 / kgH2 is permitted. For wind penetrations exceeding approximately 30% of system maximum demand, the electrolyser stock must include implementations close to WPP if curtailment is to be avoided.

Converting from vapour compression chillers to absorption chillers in a combined heat and power (CHP) system is a measure towards sustainability as electricity consumption is replaced with electricity generation. This electricity produced in Swedish CHP-system will substitute marginally produced electricity and as result lower global emissions of carbon dioxide. The use of absorption chillers is limited in Sweden but the conditions are in fact most favourable. Rising demand of cooling and increasing electricity prices in combination with a surplus of heat during the summer in CHP system makes heat driven cooling extremely interesting in Sweden. In this paper we analyse the most cost-effective technology for cooling by comparing vapour compression chillers with heat driven absorption cooling for a local energy utility with a district cooling network and for industries in a Swedish municipality with CHP. Whilst this case is necessarily local in scope, the results have global relevance showing that when considering higher European electricity prices, and when natural gas is introduced, absorption cooling is the most cost-effective solution for both industries and for the energy supplier. This will result in a resource effective energy system with a possibility to reduce global emissions of CO2 with 80%, a 300% lower system cost, and a 170% reduction of the cost of producing cooling due to revenues from electricity production. The results also show that, with these prerequisites, a decrease in COP of the absorption chillers will not have a negative impact on the cost-effectiveness of the system, due to increased electricity production. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The necessity to evaluate aircraft NOx production at cruise is urgent, since ICAO standard on NOx limitations has not yet taken into account cruise NOx emissions. The purpose of this work is to solve the problem of aircraft cruise NOx emissions regulation. The evaluation of nitrogen oxides production according to operational time in mode is realized with the ICAO data bank from different types of aircraft engines. Cruise NOx production is compared to LTO NOx production. A predictive correlation linking cruise NOx production to flight distance is developed and evaluated with good accuracy. Although cruise NOx production prediction is very important, alone it may not be enough to settle a limitation regulation on cruise. NOx emissions, then the maximum flight range and the maximum take off weight, as those important factors influencing the NOx emissions are taken into account to develop a specific NOx production parameter which can enable the commercial aircraft classification according to their pollution factor, by so doing, ICAO NOx emissions regulation can be completed using the approach we propose to set up a limit value on aircraft cruise NOx emissions.","Commercial aircraft; Cruise NOx; NOx environmental pollution factor (EPFNNOx; Specific NOx","Air quality; Aircraft; Correlation methods; Gas emissions; Health risks; Ozone layer; Environmental pollution factor; Nitrogen oxides; accuracy assessment; air quality; atmospheric pollution; correlation; exhaust emission; nitrogen oxides; ozone; stratosphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41949103719

Average annual visibility (1961-2003) was significantly higher at the rural centers. Unlike at the other centers, visibility in Taipei improved between 1992 (6.6 km) and 2003 (9.9 km), and this can be linked to the construction and expansion of a mass transit rail system in Taipei, the use of which has helped reduce emissions of traffic related air pollutants, particles, and NO2. This has left Kaohsiung with the lowest annual visibility since 1994, despite its 1961-2003 average being superior to that of Taipei. Precipitation lowers visibility, as demonstrated by the all-centers correlation coefficient for visibility and precipitation of - 0.92. Hence, frequency of precipitation is one of the factors contributing to the average annual visibility number. The poorest air quality category ('episode'), most commonly experienced in Taipei and Kaohsiung, was characterized by relatively high concentrations of PM10 and NOx at those centers, with comparatively high atmospheric pressure and comparatively low visibility and wind speed. Excepting O3, pollutant concentrations were slightly higher during weekdays, although there was no consistent, significant difference in weekday-weekend visibility. Principal component analysis demonstrated that visibility was markedly reduced in Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Hualien by increased vehicular emissions, road traffic dust, and industrial activity, but not in Taitung, where visibility was as a result superior to that at the other centers and degradation in visibility was likely a response to long-range transport of pollutants rather than local sources. Optimal empirical regression models indicated a negative impact on visibility for each of PM10, SO2 and NO2, particularly so for PM10, and validity of these models for Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Hualien was confirmed by correlation coefficients of simulated and observed average visibility of 0.63-0.72 for daily visibility and 0.85-0.88 for monthly visibility.

A uniform 50% reduction in SO2 emissions was predicted to produce an average decrease of PM2.5 concentrations by 26% during July but only 6% during January. A 50% reduction of NH3 emissions leads to an average 4 and 9% decrease in PM2.5 in July and January, respectively. During the summer, the highest concentration of sulfate is in South Indiana (12.8 μg·m-3), and the 50% reduction of SO2 emissions results in a 5.7 μg·m-3(44%) sulfate decrease over this area. During winter, the SO2 emissions reduction results in a 1.5 μg·m-3 (29%) decrease of the peak sulfate levels (5.2 μg·m-3) over Southeast Georgia. The maximum nitrate and ammonium concentrations are predicted to be over the Midwest (1.9 μg·m-3 in Ohio and 5.3 μg·m -3 in South Indiana, respectively) in the summer whereas in the winter these concentrations are higher over the Northeast (3 μg·m -3 of nitrate in Connecticut and 2.7 μg·m-3 of ammonium in New York). The 50% NH3 emissions reduction is more effective for controlling nitrate, compared with SO2 reductions, producing a 1.1 μg·m-3 nitrate decrease over Ohio in July and a 1.2 μg·m-3 decrease over Connecticut in January. Ammonium decreases significantly when either SO2 or NH3 emissions are decreased. However, the SO2 control strategy has better results in July when ammonium decreases, up to 2 μg·m-3 (37%), are predicted in South Indiana. The NH3 control strategy has better results in January (ammonium decreases up to 0.4 μg·m -3 in New York). The spatial and temporal characteristics of the effectiveness of these emission control strategies during the summer and winter seasons are discussed.

Thus, there is a need to document the social benefits of these global goods in order to justify the costs of restoration and preservation programmes (RPPs). This study adds to the scarce literature on economic benefits of WHSs in developing countries, and reduces the need to perform very uncertain benefit transfers from European or US valuation studies. We apply Contingent Valuation (CV) and Choice Modelling (CM) to estimate the social benefits of RPPs for the My Son world cultural heritage site in Vietnam; both to foreign visitors and the local residents. We then compare the estimates from the CV and CM methods, and pool the results from the two methods. The results show that both CV and CM are suited to estimating the economic benefits of preserving cultural heritage of My Son. The two methods produce very similar results, which can be interpreted as a test of convergence validity. The pooling results give evidence to show that the CV and CM models have the same underlying preference structures. Thus, these valuation models can be successfully used in cost-benefit analyses to assess the benefits to cultural heritage of measures to reduce air pollution, soil erosion, climate change and other causes to deterioration of cultural heritage sites. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Choice modelling; Contingent valuation; Cultural heritage; Developing countries","Convergence of numerical methods; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Uncertain systems; Choice Modeling (CM); Contingent Valuation (CV); Cultural heritage; Restoration and preservation programmes (RPP); Social aspects; comparative study; contingent valuation; cultural heritage; developing world; Asia; Eurasia; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547451131

By when and by how much are impacts reduced? Where does it matter most? We investigated these questions within the new A2 emission scenario, recently developed at the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis with revised population and gross domestic product projections. Coupling an agro-ecological model to a global food trade model, two distinct sets of climate simulations were analyzed: 1) A non-mitigated scenario, with atmospheric CO2 concentrations over 800 ppm by 2100; and 2) A mitigation scenario, with CO2 concentrations stabilized at 550 ppm by 2100. Impacts of climate change on crop yield were evaluated for the period 1990-2080, then used as input for economic analyses. Key trends were computed over the 21st century for food demand, production and trade, focusing on potential monetary (aggregate value added) and human (risk of hunger) impacts. The results from this study suggested that mitigation could positively impact agriculture. With mitigation, global costs of climate change, though relatively small in absolute amounts, were reduced by 75-100%; and the number of additional people at risk of malnutrition was reduced by 80-95%. Significant geographic and temporal differences were found. Regional effects often diverged from global net results, with some regions worse off under mitigation compared to the unmitigated case. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Russian knapweed's success is attributed to allelopathy, extensive tap rooting, zinc accumulation in soils, and a lack of North American predators. Revegetation following chemical control slows exotic reestablishment, but the impacts of Russian knapweed-invaded soils on the establishment of native forbs and shrubs have not been determined. In a greenhouse experiment, we monitored the establishment of two native forbs, Indian blanketflower (Gaillardia aristata Pursh) and purple prairie clover (Dalea purpurea Vent.) and two native shrubs, winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata [Pursh] A.D.J. Meeuse &amp; Smit syn.

We analyzed soils collected near Greybull and Riverton, Wyoming, and Greeley, Colorado, for cation exchange capacity, organic matter, electroconductivity, pH, and total nitrogen, carbon, and plant-available potassium, zinc, manganese, copper, and phosphate. We documented seedling emergence of the four natives and Russian knapweed every two days for 14-17 weeks, harvested seedlings biweekly to assess their growth, and determined their zinc accumulation. All species established in invaded soil and seedlings were larger in invaded than in noninvaded soils. Invaded rangeland soils had greater organic matter (8.6% and 1.1% in invaded vs. 2.5% and 0.4% in noninvaded soils) and lower pH (7.4 in invaded versus 8.0 noninvaded soils). Zinc concentrations in invaded soils (from 0.15 to 6.56 mg·kg -1) were not high enough to limit plant growth. Reports that Russian knapweed is a hyper-accumulator of zinc are not supported by our seedling data, which suggests that previously invaded soils may not limit native seedlings.","Allelopathy; Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis; Dalea purpurea; Exotic weed; Gaillardia aristata; Krascheninnikovia lanata; Organic matter; Zinc toxicity","biological invasion; chemical control; concentration (composition); herb; monitoring; native species; revegetation; seedling emergence; soil chemistry; toxicity test; weed control; zinc; Colorado; Greeley; Greybull; North America; Riverton; United States; Wyoming; Acroptilon; Acroptilon repens; Artemisia; Artemisia tridentata; Artemisia tridentata wyomingensis; Dalea lasiathera; Dalea purpurea; Gaillardia; Gaillardia aristata; Krascheninnikovia lanata; Trifolium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36749032380

Consequently, there are a variety of national and international guidelines, e.g. Swedish National Environmental Quality Objectives and the EU Water Framework Directive, which include targets to be achieved within a certain time frame. This paper uses the example of a large Swedish lake to show that national and international targets must be adapted to the local situations. Despite decreasing nutrient concentrations, cyanobacterial blooms in the lake have increased over recent years. We found that these blooms coincide with depleted nitrate-nitrogen concentrations and increased water temperatures. We propose a simple model with water temperature, nitrate-nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations as input variables as a basis for formulation of regional eutrophication targets. Political decisions should be preceded by open discussion between policymakers and scientists to differentiate between real knowledge, assumptions or feelings. For optimal results, recommendations for reducing nutrient load should consider all sources, including urban stormwater and wastewater from rural houses, and should be founded on a balanced reduction in emissions of algae-available nutrients.

Buildings and the building stock can play a major role in mitigating climate change in the short- to medium-term, since substantial reductions in CO2 emissions from their energy use can be achieved over the coming years. A significant portion of these savings can be achieved in ways that reduce life cycle costs, thus providing reductions in CO2 emissions that have a net negative cost. There are indications that the building stock has the highest share of negative- and low-cost greenhouse gas reduction potential among all sectors. Based on 80 collected national or regional studies estimating CO2 mitigation potential in five continents, the global potential for CO2 reductions through buildings is analysed and estimated. The co-benefits associated with the implementation of these measures are also substantial, helping policy-makers justify actions even in the absence of a strong climate commitment. Since the barriers to unlocking the high potentials in the residential and commercial sectors are especially strong, no single instrument can make a large impact. Instead, portfolios of targeted policies tailored to local conditions, combined with strong compliance and enforcement regimes, are needed.","Building stock; Climate change; CO2 reduction; Design; Energy efficiency; Mitigation; Policies","Buildings; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Life cycle; Structural design; Building stocks; Policy makers; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249677837

Due to a lack of suitable model systems, we designed a laboratory column to study this process in diffusional CH4/O2 counter-gradients in unsaturated porous media. Analysis and simulations of the steady-state CH4, CO2 and O2 gas profiles showed that in a 15-cm-deep active zone, CH4 oxidation followed first-order kinetics with respect to CH4 with a high apparent first-order rate constant of ∼ 30 h- 1. Total cell counts obtained using DAPI-staining suggested growth of methanotrophic bacteria, resulting in a high capacity for CH4 oxidation. This together with apparent tolerance to anoxic conditions enabled a rapid response of the methanotrophic community to changing substrate availability, which was induced by changes in O2 concentrations at the top of the column. Microbial oxidation was confirmed by a ∼ 7‰ enrichment in CH4 stable carbon isotope ratios along profiles. Using a fractionation factor of 1.025 ± 0.0005 for microbial oxidation estimated from this shift and the fractionation factor for diffusion, simulations of isotope profiles agreed well with measured data confirming large fractionation associated with microbial oxidation. The designed column should be valuable for investigating response of methanotrophic bacteria to environmental parameters in future studies. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The absorption coefficient within the ring is assumed to follow a power-law dependence on the distance from the central mass as κ = κ0r-9. We have calculated position-velocity diagrams for the most intense maser features, for different values of the exponent q. We have found that, depending on the value of q, these diagrams can be qualitatively different.

Time resolved studies were performed for a Cu target by optical emission spectroscopy and electrical measurements for different pressures of Ar buffer gas. Due to the elimination of the statistical delay time and a fast discharge current rise the quasi-stationary state was reached in 6 νs. The quasi-stationary state is characterized by an extremely high and pressure independent discharge current density of ∼10 A cm-2 and stable Cu+ and Cu ++ emissions. Such fast discharge dynamics permits the magnetron cathode current to be driven with a pulse of duration of the order of a few νs, significantly shorter than in other devices. During this short time, the plasma does not have time to undergo the transition from the glow to the arc discharge even at the extremely high cathode loads met in our case. Different stages of the fast discharge development are identified and the composition of the magnetized plasma as a function of the pressure is discussed in detail. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Current density; Electric current control; Ionization; Magnetron sputtering; Optical emission spectroscopy; Discharge current; Low current pre-ionization; Power pulsed magnetron discharge; Electric discharges",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547734614

Among the green energies that have been developed, wind can actually be seen as one of the most promising solution if we refer to its past and predicted evolutions. However and, even though wind can be considered as an interesting alternative to fossil fuels, it is imperious to emphasize on problematic situations that could be due to the intermittent behavior of wind generation. Indeed, actually, most of the electric utilities do not consider wind power in the classical units management; consequently involving, in the case of increased wind power penetration, untimely stopping of big thermal (or nuclear) units. It is, therefore, necessary to calculate wind equivalent capacities in order to introduce a coherent evaluation of wind production in the management of the centralized production park. In this paper, wind equivalent capacities are calculated using a Non Sequential Monte Carlo Simulation. Moreover, in order to evaluate the importance of the wind correlation level between parks located in the same geographical region, two cases are investigated, respectively considering entirely correlated wind parks and, on the opposite, totally independent wind sites. Finally, simulation results show that durations of simultaneous zero wind power production for each considered wind parks stay, in both cases, very low involving quasi-identical calculated equivalent capacities; what tends to demonstrate the minor importance of the wind parks correlation level for wind power estimation in reliability studies. Note that, here, the proposed conclusions are obtained using the Belgian production park data and that the objective is not to dynamically estimate wind production on the short-term (by the use of an autocorrelation function) but rather to give a simplified way to introduce an hourly evaluation of wind production in the day by day management of the classical thermal (nuclear) units. © 2007 IEEE.","Energy management; Modeling; Power system generation; Power system modeling; Public utilities; Weibull distribution; Wind energy; Wind power","Computer simulation; Correlation methods; Electric power generation; Energy management; Monte Carlo methods; Public utilities; Weibull distribution; Power system generation; Power system modeling; Wind generation; Wind geographical correlation level; Wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36348957426

Using a carbon mass-balance approach, I investigated the relationships between fine detritus production and soil respiration for five tropical tree species established on 16-year-old plantations. Total fine detritus production ranged from 0.69 to 1.21 kg C·m-2·year-1 with significant differences among species but with no correlation between litterfall and fine-root growth. Soil CO2 emissions ranged from 1.61 to 2.36 kg C·m -2·year-1 with no significant differences among species. Soil respiration increased with fine-root production but not with litterfall, suggesting that soil C emissions may depend more on belowground inputs or that both fine root production and soil respiration are similarly influenced by an external factor. Estimates of root + rhizosphere respiration comprised 52% of total soil respiration on average, and there was no evidence that rhizosphere respiration was associated with fine-root growth rates among species. These results suggest that inherent differences in fine-root production among species, rather than differences in aboveground litterfall, might play a main role explaining local-scale, among-forest variations in soil C emissions. © 2007 NRC.",,"Biodiversity; Carbon; Correlation methods; Soil mechanics; Fine-root production; Soil respiration; Tropical tree species; Variability of carbon (C); Forestry; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; chemical mass balance; forest ecosystem; growth rate; litterfall; phytodetritus; plantation forestry; rhizosphere; soil emission; soil respiration; Carbon; Forest Litter; Forestry; Respiration; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38148999342

The type of measurement and the situation in the demonstration cities influence the exact fuel consumption and emission reduction. Variables that could enable the adoption of all types of APBs are: (1) the compatibility with previously introduced ideas; (2) the already available necessary supporting infrastructure in the city; (3) a changed external appearance of the APB; (4) the acceptance of the APBs by passengers and bus drivers; and (5) political support in the city regarding the APBs.

To achieve these reductions, we argue that policymakers and regulators should focus not only on factories and other industrial sources of emissions but also on individuals. We construct a model that demonstrates that individuals contribute roughly one-third of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. This one-third share accounts for roughly 8% of the world's total, more than the total emissions of any other country except China, and more than several continents. We contend that it is desirable, if not imperative, that governments address emissions from individual behavior. This task will be difficult because individual behaviors, including idling cars and wasting electricity, are resistant to change, even when the change is rational. Mindful of the costs, we propose measures that have a high likelihood of success. We draw on norms theory and empirical studies to demonstrate how legal reforms can tie the widely held abstract norm of personal responsibility to the emerging concrete norm of carbon neutrality. We suggest that these legal reforms could push carbon neutrality past a tipping point, directly influencing many carbon-emitting individual behaviors and building the public support necessary for policymakers to address the remaining sources.

The system greatly increased the efficiency of liquid-solid separation by polymer injection to increase solids flocculation. Nitrogen management to reduce ammonia emissions was accomplished by passing the liquid through a module where bacteria transformed ammonia into harmless nitrogen gas. Subsequent alkaline treatment of the wastewater in a phosphorus module precipitated phosphorus and killed pathogens. Treated wastewater was recycled to clean swine houses and for crop irrigation. The system was tested during one year in a 4400-head finishing farm as part of the Agreement between the Attorney General of North Carolina and swine producers Smithfield Foods, Premium Standard Farms and Frontline Farmers to replace traditional waste treatment anaerobic lagoons with environmentally superior technology. The on-farm system removed 97.6% of the suspended solids, 99.7% of BOD, 98.5% of TKN, 98.7% of soluble ammonia (NH4+ s(-) N), 95.0% of total P, 98.7% of copper and 99.0% of zinc. It also removed 97.9% of odor compounds in the liquid and reduced pathogen indicators to non-detectable levels. Based on performance obtained, it was determined that the treatment system met the Agreement's technical performance standards that define an environmentally superior technology. These findings overall showed that cleaner alternative technologies are technically and operationally feasible and that they can have significant positive impacts on the environment and the livestock industry. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

So far, more than 200 air pollution hotspots have been identified by local authorities in the UK, many of them associated with NO2 and/or PM10 exceedences in heavily trafficked urban streets that may be classified as street canyons or canyon intersections. This is due to the increased traffic-related emissions and reduced natural ventilation in such streets. Specialised dispersion models and empirical adjustment factors have been commonly used to account for the entrapment of pollutants in street canyons. However, most of the available operational tools have been validated using experimental datasets from relatively deep canyons (H/W≥1) from continental Europe. The particular characteristics of low-rise street canyons (H/W&lt;1), which are a typical feature of urban/sub-urban areas in the UK, have been rarely taken into account. The main objective of this study is to review current practice and evaluate three widely used regulatory dispersion models, WinOSPM, ADMS-Urban 2.0 and AEOLIUS Full. The model evaluation relied on two comprehensive datasets, which included CO, PM10 and NOx measurements, traffic information and relevant meteorological data from two busy street canyons in Birmingham and London for a 1-year period. The performance of the selected models was tested for different times of the day/days of the week and varying wind conditions. Furthermore, the ability of the models to reproduce roadside NO2/NOx concentration ratios using simplified chemistry schemes was evaluated for one of the sites. Finally, advantages and limitations of the current regulatory street canyon modelling practice in the UK, as well as needs for future research, have been identified and discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

H3B 3L2, Canada","The control options for air emissions of SO x (SO 2 and SO 3/H 2SO 4), NO x, VOCs, ClO 2, particulate matter (PM), dioxins and furans, total reduced sulphur (TRS), greenhouse gases (CO 2, N 2O) and mercury, especially those relevant to the pulp and paper (P&amp;P) and wood products (WP) industry in Canada, are summarized in this report. First, the predominant emission sources for these compounds are identified within a P&amp;P or WP mill, followed by a discussion of the widely tested control technologies. A fair amount of the experience with technologies is from a lateral transfer from applications to boilers operating mainly in the electric utility industry. For SO 2 emission control for boilers, besides substitution of lower sulphur fuels and capture within the combustion process itself by alkaline constituents of the fuel, end-of-pipe control technologies involve several mature flue gas desulphurization technologies. Control of H 2SO 4 aerosols from combustion is relatively difficult and limited experience has been gained with candle filters and wet electrostatic precipitators (ESPs). For NO x emission control, besides switching to lower nitrogen fuels such as oils, control technologies applicable to fossil fuel-fired boilers are also fairly advanced and include both combustion modifications and end-of-pipe technologies like selective non-catalytic reduction and selective catalytic reduction. NO x control for wood-fired and combination wood-fired boilers is difficult to achieve since the wood N content governs the NO x emissions, and post-combustion NO x control is generally only effective on ""base-loaded"" boilers. NO x emission control for kraft recovery furnaces is mainly obtained by maximizing the principle of staged combustion, while NO x emission control techniques for kraft lime kilns are still in their infancy. Regenerative thermal oxidizers and regenerative catalytic oxidizers are the dominant VOC reduction technologies in the WP sectors. VOC reduction in kraft P&amp;P mills is mostly brought about by incinerating NCGs in boilers, kilns and thermal oxidizers. ClO 2 is controlled quite effectively with wet scrubbers with scrubbing media ranging from chilled water to alkaline medium with and without sulphides and sulphites. Particulate matter emissions, including total PM, PM 10, and PM 2.5, from P&amp;P and WP facility sources are controlled by a range of control devices including ESPs, fabric filters, venturi scrubbers and multiclones. The control of minute quantities of dioxins and furans that result from combustion of just about any fuel with some chloride content is a continuously evolving art form. Current understanding focuses on three important principles: a) minimize products of incomplete combustion, b) minimize extraneous sources of chloride in the boiler fuel mix, and c) minimize the residence time spent by flue gases in the temperature range of 250 and 400°C where maximum ""de novo"" formation is believed to occur. TRS emissions, comprised essentially of the four reduced sulphur compounds (RSCs) H 2S, CH 3SH, (CH 3) 2S and (CH 3) 2S 2, from kraft pulping and recovery sources are mainly controlled by incineration. TRS emission control from recovery furnaces, lime kilns and smelt dissolving tanks is accomplished chiefly by process control. Other TRS control technologies include scrubbing, which only addresses the acidic RSCs. The control of greenhouse gases, principally CO 2, is mainly concerned with improving the overall energy efficiency of the process. Control of mercury emissions revolves around oxidizing the elemental mercury and removing the oxidized species in wet scrubbers or by injecting activated carbon in the flue gas stream to capture the Hg prior to the PM control device. © 2007 by the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc.","Boilers; ClO 2; CO 2; Control technologies; Formation; Furnaces; GHGs; Lime kilns; Mercury; NO x; PM; Pulp and paper; Sulphur dioxide; Sulphuric acid; TRS; VOCs; Wood products",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35748942546

While the role of NO2- as a substrate regulating nitrous oxide (N2O) production is recognized, kinetic data are not available that allow for estimating N2O production or soil-to-atmosphere fluxes as a function of NO2- levels under aerobic conditions. The current study investigated these kinetics as influenced by soil physical and biochemical factors in soils from cultivated and uncultivated fields in Minnesota, USA. A linear response of N2O production rate (PN2O) to NO2- was observed at concentrations below 60 μg Ng-1 soil in both nonsterile and sterilized soils. Rate coefficients (Kp) relating to PN2O- varied over two orders of magnitude and were correlated with pH, total nitrogen, and soluble and total carbon (C). Total C explained 84% of the variance in Kp across all samples. Abiotic processes accounted for 31-75% of total N2O production. Biological reduction of NO2- was enhanced as oxygen (O2) levels were decreased from above ambient to 5%, consistent with nitrifier denitrification. In contrast, nitrate (NO3-)-reduction, and the reduction of N2O itself, were only stimulated at O2 levels below 5%. Greater temperature sensitivity was observed for biological compared with chemical N2O production. Steady-state model simulations predict that NO2- levels often found after fertilizer applications have the potential to generate substantial N2O fluxes even at ambient O2. This potential derives in part from the production of N2O under conditions not favorable for N2O reduction, in contrast to N2 O generated from NO2- reduction. These results have implications with regard to improved management to minimize agricultural N2O emissions and improved emissions assessments. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Anhydrous ammonia; Fertilizer; Greenhouse gas; Nitric oxide; Nitrification; Nitrifier denitrification; PH; Q10; Soil carbon; Urea","ammonia; denitrification; fertilizer; greenhouse gas; nitric oxide; nitrification; nitrite; nitrous oxide; pH; soil carbon; soil property; soil temperature; urea; Minnesota; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547803769

Here we present an experimental study on the amyloid aggregation of Succinyl Concanavalin A, which is a dimeric active variant of Concanavalin. The results show that, as for the native protein, the fibrillation process appears to be favoured by alkaline pH, far from the isoelectric point of the protein. Moreover, it strongly depends on temperature and requires large conformational changes both at secondary and tertiary structure level. With respect to the native protein, the succinyl derivative forms amyloid fibrils in considerably longer times and with a minor exposure of hydrophobic regions. At physiological conditions, Concanavalin A still displays a sizeable tendency to form amyloid fibril, while the succinyl variant does not. A close correlation was observed between the progress of amyloid formation and a narrowing of the tryptophans fluorescence emission band, indicating a reduction of protein conformational heterogeneity in amyloid fibrils. © 2007 EBSA.","Amyloids; Circular dichroism; Concanavalin A; Fluorescence; Protein aggregation; Succinylation","amyloid; concanavalin A; tryptophan; alkalinity; conference paper; fluorescence; hydrophobicity; isoelectric point; nonhuman; pH; protein conformation; protein secondary structure; protein tertiary structure; temperature sensitivity; Amyloid; Circular Dichroism; Concanavalin A; Dimerization; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrophobicity; Protein Denaturation; Protein Structure, Secondary; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Thermodynamics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36048995611

A theoretical model is presented to describe the steady state flux of CO2 through a mixed conducting, dual-phase membrane consisting of solid oxide and molten carbonate phases. An analytical flux solution is derived for the case in which only ionic conduction is present. The limiting factor dominating the flux of CO2 is the oxide ion conductivity. To take advantage of solid oxide materials with higher ionic conductivities, the additional presence of n-type electronic conductivity under low oxygen atmospheres is also investigated.

Here we describe and quantify an important source of CH4-point-source ebullition (bubbling) from northern lakes-that has not been incorporated in previous regional or global methane budgets. Employing a method recently introduced to measure ebullition more accurately by taking into account its spatial patchiness in lakes, we estimate point-source ebullition for 16 lakes in Alaska and Siberia that represent several common northern lake types: glacial, alluvial floodplain, peatland and thermokarst (thaw) lakes. Extrapolation of measured fluxes from these 16 sites to all lakes north of 45°N using circumpolar databases of lake and permafrost distributions suggests that northern lakes are a globally significant source of atmospheric CH4, emitting approximately 24.2±10.5 Tg CH4yr-1. Thermokarst lakes have particularly high emissions because they release CH4 produced from organic matter previously sequestered in permafrost. A carbon mass balance calculation of CH4 release from thermokarst lakes on the Siberian yedoma ice complex suggests that these lakes alone would emit as much as approximately 49 000 Tg CH4 if this ice complex was to thaw completely. Using a space-for-time substitution based on the current lake distributions in permafrost-dominated and permafrost-free terrains, we estimate that lake emissions would be reduced by approximately 12% in a more probable transitional permafrost scenario and by approximately 53% in a 'permafrost-free' Northern Hemisphere. Long-term decline in CH4 ebullition from lakes due to lake area loss and permafrost thaw would occur only after the large release of CH4 associated thermokarst lake development in the zone of continuous permafrost. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Climate change; Geographical information system; Methane emissions; Northern lakes; Permafrost; Thermokarst",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547267913

In this paper we explore potential climatic factors governing the recent establishment of new palm populations far to the north of any other viable palm population in the world. Location: Southern Switzerland, Europe, Asia and the world. Methods: Weidentified ecological threshold values for the target species, Trachycarpus fortunei, based on gridded climate data, altitude and distributional records from the native range and applied them to the introduced range using local field monitoring and measured meteorological data as well as a bioclimatic model. Results: We identified a strong relationship between minimum winter temperatures, influenced by growing season length and the distribution of the palm in its native range. Recent climate change strongly coincides with the palm's recent spread into southern Switzerland, which is in concert with the expansion of the global range of palms across various continents. Main conclusions: Our results strongly suggest that the expansion of palms into (semi-)natural forests is driven by changes in winter temperature and growing season length and not by delayed population expansion. This implies that this rapid expansion is likely to continue in the future under a warming climate. Palms in general, and T. fortunei in particular, are significant bioindicators across continents for present-day climate change and reflect a global signal towards warmer conditions. © 2007 The AuthorsJournal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Arecaceae; Biogeography; Bioindicator; Exotic species; Global warming; Invasion; Northernmost palm population; Ticino; Trachycarpus fortunei; Vegetation shift","biogeography; bioindicator; climate change; geographical distribution; global warming; range expansion; tree; Asia; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Switzerland; Ticino; Arecaceae; Trachycarpus fortunei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348871564

Variation among marginal costs of control for individual ships choosing between fuel-switching and aftertreatment reveals cost-saving potential of economic incentive instruments. Compared to regulations prescribing low sulfur fuels, a performance-based policy can save up to $260 million for these ships with 80% more emission reductions than required because least-cost options on some individual ships outperform standards. Optimal simulation of a market-based SO2 control policy for ∼4,700 U.S. foreign commerce ships traveling in the SECAs in 2002 shows that SECA emissions control targets can be achieved by scrubbing exhaust gas of one out of ten ships with annual savings up to $480 million over performance-based policy. A market-based policy could save the fleet ∼$63 million annually under our best-estimate scenario.

Although environmental impacts have played a vital role in the general reasoning and argumentation for forest plantations, environmental impact analyses have often received less attention than economic analyses in the planning of plantation forestry projects. The overall goal of this paper is to evaluate the program's environmental impact considering the farmer's interests and the potential social benefits due to carbon sequestration in different scenarios based on household and field survey data in Dunhua County. Our findings are that: (1) in many cases, the program did not give adequate consideration to land productivity and environmental heterogeneity when selecting plots; (2) more than half of the reforestation plots were on flat cropland (slopes of less than 5°); (3) in five of the eight townships, net incomes on reforested land were substantially above or below previous crop incomes, raising questions about the efficiency of the allocation of compensation to farmers participating in the program; (4) the potential carbon co-benefit increased the NPV of the program by 5954-7009 RMB/ha. In conclusion, we recommend that more attention should be paid to the quality of reforestation programs rather than just their scale and note that consideration of potential carbon sequestration co-benefits enhances the benefits of cropland conversion programs. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Net benefits of reducing SO2 emissions from cargo ships in the US West Coast waters are found to range between $98 million and $284 million, annually; the benefit-cost ratio varies between 1.8 and 3.36, depending on the size of the control area and the sulfur content limit. The results show that about 21,000 tons of on-land equivalent SO2 emissions or about 33% of SO2 emissions from all mobile sources in California in 2005 can be reduced annually if the US West Coast exclusive economic zone is designated as an International Maritime Organization-compliant SOx emission control area (SECA) with fuel-sulfur content not exceeding 1.5%. The analysis demonstrates that designating this area reduces more emissions than establishing a smaller zone at a lower but favorable benefit-cost ratio. Control measures that require 0.5% low-sulfur fuels reduce more SO2 emissions, and also may have higher net benefits. Technological alternatives may achieve benefits of emissions reductions on the US West Coast across higher ranges of potential fuel prices.

It was found that dissolved CO2 and silicate in Changjiang decreased dramatically during this decades, as opposed to a marked increase in nutrient (e.g. NO3-) concentrations. Our analyses revealed that dissolved CO2 in Changjiang was over-saturated with the atmosphere CO2, and its concentration had showed a declining trend since the 1960s, despite that fluvial DIC flux had maintained stable. Analysis results also suggested that the decrease in dissolved CO2 concentration was attributed to changes on the riverine trophic level and river damming activities in the Changjiang drainage basin. Due to the economic innovation (e.g. agriculture and industry development) across the Changjiang watershed, fertilizers application and river regulations have significantly altered the original state of the river. Its ecosystem and hydrological condition have been evolving toward the ""lacustrine/reservoir"" autotrophic type prevailing with plankton. Accordingly, average CO2 diffusing flux to the atmosphere from the river had been reduced by three-fourth from the 1960s to 1990s, with the flux value being down to 14.2 mol.m-2.yr-1 in the 1990s.

The potential relationship between extremophile activities and hydrocarbon resources in marine extreme environments are then discussed in details. It could be now preliminary concluded that archaea and bacteria are the two main kinds of extremophiles in marine extreme environments. The dominating microbe communities in hydrothermal vents are heterotrophic zymogens, sulfate reducers and methanogens, while the ANME-2 group (Methanosarcinales) surrounded by sulfate-reducing bacteria and ANME-1 group dominate in cold vents. Marine extremophiles would be able to use CH4 and H2S to synthesize energy for metabolism and to support food chains for other unique macrobiota nearby, which together present a high abundance but a low diversity with distinct characteristics of horizontal and vertical distributions. Marine extremophiles might play an important role either directly or indirectly in the processes of hydrocarbon formation and subsequent alteration, and could indicate the evolution of hydrocarbon resources in marine extreme environments. Our research thus has a great significance both in theoretical approach of potential hydrocarbon resources formed by marine extremophile activities and in practical exploration of the potential hydrocarbonsource sedimentary layers formed in the Earth history or the potential strata in southern China. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag 2007.","Extremophiles; Hydrocarbon resource; Marine extreme environment; Potential contribution","bacterium; extremophile; hydrocarbon resource; marine environment; microbial community; spatial distribution",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36448943277

Al speciation study is essential to better evaluate the mobility, availability, and persistence of trace Al and Al species in the atmosphere. This paper reports Al distribution and speciation in atmospheric particles with aerodynamic diameters &gt;10.0, 10.0-2.5 and &lt;2.5 μm in the urban area of Nanjing, China. Urban particles were collected with a high-volume sampling system equipped with a cascade impactor, which effectively separates the particulate matter into three size ranges. Particulate Al was fractionated into five different forms (insoluble, oxide, organic, carbonate, and exchangeable species) by the modified five-step Tessier's sequential extraction procedure. The main points are as follows: (1) The average levels of Al in PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PM&gt;10 are 2.02±0.35, 3.04±0.43 and 6.32±0.76 μg m-3, respectively, with PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PM&gt;10 constituting respectively, 17.8±3.1%, 26.7±3.8% and 55.5±6.7% of suspended particulate matter (SPM) mass (11.38 μg m-3). (2) The vertical profile of airborne Al in the above three size fractions has been estimated. A significant increase in airborne Al concentrations was found for PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PM&gt;10 as the sampling height above the ground increased from 2.5 to 17.5 m; however, there was an obvious decrease in airborne Al concentrations between 17.5 and 40.0 m. The maximum mean of total Al in PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PM&gt;10 occurred between 12.5 and 20.0 m above the ground. (3) The distribution of Al speciation was studied. It was found that the size distribution of airborne Al species followed the order: insoluble species&gt;oxide species&gt;organic species&gt;carbonate species&gt;exchangeable species. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

(P. euphratica) (salt-resistant) and rooted cuttings of P. ""popularis 35-44"" (P. popularis) (salt-sensitive). Initial salinity caused a rapid decline of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and unit transpiration rate (TRN) in P. euphratica, resulting from the NaCl-induced stomatal closure. In a longer-term of salinity, CO2 assimilation in P. popularis was severely reduced whereas stressed P. euphratica maintained a relatively higher and constant level of Pn. Pn-Ci curves showed that salt stress (12 days) reduced CO2 saturation point (CSP), CO2 saturated Pn (CSP n), and carboxylation efficiency (CE), but increased CO2 compensation point (CCP) in the two genotypes. Similarly, salinity lowered light saturation point (LSP), light saturated Pn (LSPn), and apparent quantum yield (AQY) in both genotypes but the inhibitory effect of NaCl on light reaction was more pronounced in P. popularis, as compared to P. euphratica. Chlorophyll a fluorescence data indicated that a longer-term of salt stress (12 days) exhibited a marked influence on fluorescence parameters of P. popularis in both dark- and light-adapted states: (a) NaCl inhibited the maximal efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm) due to the salt-induced increase of Fo (the minimal fluorescence) and the marked decline of Fm (the maximal fluorescence); (b) salinity decreased coefficient of photochemical quenching (qP) but markedly elevated coefficient of nonphotochemical quenching (qN) in the light-adapted state. In contrast, there were no corresponding changes of chlorophyll a fluorescence in salinised P. euphratica. X-ray microanalysis results showed that salinity caused salt accumulation in the chloroplasts of P. popularis in which Na+ and Cl- increased up to 42 and 221 mmol dm -3, respectively. Great buildup of Na+ and Cl- in chloroplasts of P. popularis may exhibit direct and indirect restrictions on dark and light reactions. The activity of SOD isoenzymes (CuZn-SOD I and CuZn-SOD II) and POD isoenzymes in P. popularis decreased with increasing exposure period, and leaf malondialdehyde (MDA) content and membrane permeability (MP) increased correspondingly. In contrast to P. popularis, stressed P. euphratica maintained activity of SOD and POD isoenzymes and there was no significant increase of MDA and MP during the period of salt stress. In conclusion, P. euphratica plants exhibited a higher capacity to maintain the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes and restrict salt accumulation in the chloroplasts, the photosynthesis processes were less restricted consequently. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Chlorophyll a fluorescence; Chloroplast ion compartmentation; NaCl; P. euphratica; P. popularis; Photosynthesis; POD isoenzymes; SOD isoenzymes; X-ray microanalysis","Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Oxidative stress; Photosynthesis; Quantum yield; Carboxylation efficiency; Chloroplast salt compartmentation; Compensation point (CCP); Nonphotochemical quenching; Superoxide dismutase; Transpiration rate; Forestry; Chlorophylls; Fluorescence; Forestry; Photosynthesis; Populus; Populus euphratica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148934461

Investigations show that the annual average concentrations of SO2, NO2, PM10 are 12-64, 13-57, and 79-184 μg m-3, respectively. As the primary air pollutants in the target area, surface NO2 levels increased by 13% while PM10 levels decreased by 39% from 1996 to 2003. The surface SO2 concentration showed fluctuations during the study period, reaching a minimum in 1999 and rising again in 2003. Acid rain still remains an important atmospheric environmental issue. The frequency of acid rain was about 23.5-36.7%, and the pH value of precipitation ranged from 5.09 to 5.48, with little change in these years. Modeling studies indicated that sulfur deposition and nitrogen deposition were in the ranges 0.5-10 and 0.2-5 g m-2 yr-1, respectively; these levels exceed the critical load in some regions. The trans-boundary transport of sulfur deposition and nitrogen deposition due to SO2 and NOx emission among city clusters (Shanghai and the other 8 cities in Jiangsu Province, including Nanjing, Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Nantong, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, land Taizhou) in the YRD region was significant. The emission from Shanghai contributes 5%-29% of sulfur deposition and 3%-30% of nitrogen deposition in the 8 cities, while the 8 cities contribute 27.5% of sulfur deposition and 20.2% of nitrogen deposition in Shanghai.","Acid rain; Air pollution; China; Yangtze River Delta","acid deposition; acid rain; air quality; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; cluster analysis; modeling; nitrogen; pH; sulfur; trend analysis; urban pollution; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Yangtze Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39149130757

Gamma-ray line emission from radioactive decay of 60Fe provides constraints on nucleosynthesis in massive stars and supernovae. Methods, spectrometer SPI on board INTEGRAL has accumulated nearly three years of data on gamma-ray emission from the Galactic plane. We have analyzed these data with suitable instrumental-background models and sky distributions to produce high-resolution spectra of Galactic emission. Results. We detect the γ-ray lines from 60Fe decay at 1173 and 1333 keV, obtaining an improvement over our earlier measurement of both lines with now 4.9σ significance for the combination of the two lines. The average flux per line is (4.4 ± 0.9) × 10-5 ph cm-2 s-1 rad-1 for the inner Galaxy region. Deriving the Galactic 26Al gamma-ray line flux with using the same set of observations and analysis method, we determine the flux ratio of 60Fe/26Al gamma-rays as 0.148 ± 0.06. Conclusions. The current theoretical predictions are consistent with our result. We discuss the implications of these results for the widely-held hypothesis that 60Fe is synthesized in core-collapse supernovae, and also for the closely-related question of the precise origin of 26Al in massive stars. © ESO 2007.","Gamma rays: observations; ISM: abundances; Nuclear reactions, nucleosynthesis, abundances","Gamma rays; Radioactive materials; Spectrum analysis; Stars; Abundances; ISM: abundances; Nuclear reactions; Nucleosynthesis; Galaxies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547180796

In this meta-analysis, we examined effects of elevated CO 2 on plant biomass accumulation in single- (populations) and multi-species (communities) assemblages. The primary objectives were to statistically synthesize the voluminous CO2 studies conducted so far and to assess the collective response of plant growth to elevated CO2 as affected by species richness. Our analysis showed that biomass enhancement by higher CO2 was consistently lower in communities than in populations. For example, total plant biomass (W T) increased only 13% in communities compared to 30% in populations in response to elevated CO2 across all studies included in this synthesis. Above- and below-ground biomass responded similarly as W T to elevated CO 2 and species richness. Smaller growth enhancement by CO2 was found in communities consisting of species of different growth forms (woody vs. herbaceous species) or functional groups (legumes vs. non-legumes). This pattern was consistent across three major classes of facilities (closed, semi-open and open systems) used to manipulate CO2 concentrations. An analysis of free-air CO2 enrichment studies revealed that the population-community difference in growth enhancement by higher CO2 was also dependent on the rate of N addition. Populations responded more than communities only when soil was amended with N. From the CO2 studies synthesized in this meta-analysis, it is obvious that the collective growth responsiveness to elevated CO2 will be lower in communities than in populations. We hypothesize that resource usurpation, i.e., competitive compartmentation of growth-limiting resources by less responsive species, may be important in determining growth response to elevated CO2 in a community and is one of the reasons responsible for the lower biomass enhancement by elevated CO2 in communities, as found in this synthesis. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Biodiversity; Community; Global changes; Plant growth; Population","carbon dioxide; aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; bioaccumulation; carbon dioxide enrichment; growth rate; herb; legume; nutrient enrichment; soil amendment; species richness; wood; article; biodiversity; biomass; classification; clinical trial; growth, development and aging; meta analysis; metabolism; plant; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250672429

Tropical regions are a major global source of VOC emissions and magnitude and chemical speciation of VOC emissions are highly plant-species specific. Therefore it is important to study emissions from dominant species in tropical regions undergoing large-scale land-use change, for example, rubber plantations in South East Asia. Rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) are strong emitters of light-dependent monoterpenes. Measurements of emissions from leaves were made in the dry season in February 2003 and at the beginning of the wet season in May 2005. Major emitted compounds were sabinene, α-pinene and β-pinene, but β-ocimene and linalool also contributed significantly at low temperature and light. Cis-ocimene was emitted with a circadian course independent of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and temperature changes with a maximum in the middle of the day. Total isoprenoid VOC emission potential at the beginning of the wet season (94 μg gdw-1h-1) was almost two orders of magnitude higher than measured in the dry season (2 μg g dw-1 h-1). Composition of total emissions changed with increasing temperature or PAR ramps imposed throughout a day. As well as light and temperature, there was evidence that assimilation rate was also a factor contributing to seasonal regulating emission potential of monoterpenes from rubber trees. Results presented here contribute to a better understanding of an important source of biogenic VOC associated with land-use change in tropical South East Asia. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Atmospheric chemistry; Biogenic VOC; Climate change; Hevea brasiliensis; Land-use change; Monoterpene emission; Regional VOC flux; Xishuangbanna","atmospheric chemistry; climate change; ecophysiology; emission; landscape change; monoterpene; plantation; rubber; speciation (chemistry); tree; volatile organic compound; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Xishuangbanna; Yunnan; Hevea brasiliensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348895851

By reformulating the statistical retrieval method with clear-sky measurements as a reference, a simple method is presented to significantly reduce uncertainties in the LWP retrieval due to errors in MWR calibration, uncertainties in the absorption coefficients of atmospheric gases, and variations in the vertical profiles of temperature and pressure. The improvement is illustrated by comparing the statistics of the erroneous clear-sky LWP for the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program Climate Research Facility observations at the North Slope of Alaska site and by comparing LWP retrieved with a multiple-sensor algorithm and LWP retrieved based mainly on MWR measurements. This letter also demonstrates the importance of using correct water cloud temperature and temperature-dependent water absorption coefficients for MWR LWP retrieval over cold regions. This approach can be easily implemented for combined MWR, ceilometer, and surface meteorological measurements. © 2007 IEEE.","Liquid water path (LWP); LWP retrieval; Microwave radiometers (MWRs); Multiple-sensor LWP algorithm","Algorithms; Atmospheric radiation; Radiometers; Sensors; Statistical methods; Thermal effects; Liquid water path (LWP); Microwave radiometers (MWRs); Multiple-sensor LWP algorithm; Microwaves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348843538

Plant community composition, C stocks in soils and vegetation, and C fluxes of CO2, CH4 and DOC, were measured over an 18-month period. We found that both burning and grazing reduced aboveground C stocks, and that burning reduced C stocks in the surface peat. Both burning and grazing strongly affected vegetation community composition, causing an increase in graminoids and a decrease in ericoid subshrubs and bryophytes relative to unburned and ungrazed controls; this effect was especially pronounced in burned treatments. Soil microbial properties were unaffected by grazing and showed minor responses to burning, in that the C:N ratio of the microbial biomass increased in burned relative to unburned treatments. Increases in the gross ecosystem CO2 fluxes of respiration and photosynthesis were observed in burned and grazed treatments relative to controls. Here, the greatest effects were seen in the burning treatment, where the mean increase in gross fluxes over the experimental period was greater than 40%. Increases in gross CO2 fluxes were greatest during the summer months, suggesting an interactive effect of land use and climate on ecosystem C cycling. Collectively, our results indicate that long-term management of peatland has marked effects on ecosystem C dynamics and CO2 flux, which are primarily related to changes in vegetation community structure. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Carbon controlled burning; CH4; CO2; DOC; Fire; Grazing; Land use; Microbial biomass; Moorland; Peat; Photosynthesis; Respiration; Vegetation","burning; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; community composition; dissolved organic carbon; fire; grazing; land use; methane; peatland; photosynthesis; plant community; Bryophyta; bryophytes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36549072074

During January through March 2005, a particulate matter (PM) sampling program was conducted within Libby's elementary and middle schools to establish baseline indoor PM concentrations before a wood stove change-out program is implemented over the next several years. As part of this program, indoor concentrations of PM mass, organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC) in five different size fractions (&gt;2.5, 1.0-2.5, 0.5-1.0, 0.25-0.5, and &lt;0.25 μm) were measured. Total measured PM mass concentrations were much higher inside the elementary school, with particle size fraction (&gt;2.5, 0.5-1.0, 0.25-0.5, and &lt;0.25 μm) concentrations between 2 and 5 times higher when compared to the middle school. The 1.0-2.5 μm fraction had the largest difference between the two sites, with elementary school concentrations nearly 10 times higher than the middle school values. The carbon component for the schools' indoor PM was found to be predominantly composed of OC. Measured total OC and EC concentrations, as well as concentrations within individual size fractions, were an average of two to five times higher at the elementary school when compared to the middle school. For the ultrafine fraction (&lt;0.25), EC concentrations were similar between each of the schools. Despite the differences in concentrations between the schools at the various fraction levels, the OC/EC ratio was determined to be similar. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2006.","Elemental carbon; Organic carbon; PM2.5; Residential wood combustion; Smoke; Valley air pollution","Combustion; Organic carbon; Particle size; Particles (particulate matter); Elemental carbon; Residential wood combustion; Size fractions; Indoor air pollution; carbon; organic carbon; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); indoor air; organic carbon; particle size; particulate matter; quantitative analysis; smoke; air sampling; article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cooking; environmental exposure; fractionation; indoor air pollution; middle school; particle size; particulate matter; primary school; United States; wood; Air Pollution, Indoor; Montana; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Sampling Studies; Schools; Smoke; Libby; Montana; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249867669

Globally, termites are an extremely successful group of wood-degrading organisms 1 and are therefore important both for their roles in carbon turnover in the environment and as potential sources of biochemical catalysts for efforts aimed at converting wood into biofuels. Only recently have data supported any direct role for the symbiotic bacteria in the gut of the termite in cellulose and xylan hydrolysis2. Here we use a metagenomic analysis of the bacterial community resident in the hindgut paunch of a wood-feeding 'higher' Nasutitermes species (which do not contain cellulose-fermenting protozoa) to show the presence of a large, diverse set of bacterial genes for cellulose and xylan hydrolysis. Many of these genes were expressed in vivo or had cellulase activity in vitro, and further analyses implicate spirochete and fibrobacter species in gut lignocellulose degradation. New insights into other important symbiotic functions including H2 metabolism, CO2-reductive acetogenesis and N2 fixation are also provided by this first system-wide gene analysis of a microbial community specialized towards plant lignocellulose degradation.

On-board fluorescence imaging of six biological signatures (e.g., chlorophyll, DNA, proteins) was used to assess abundance, based on a percent positive sample rating system and standardized robotic ecological transects. The percent positive rating system scored each sample based on the measured signal strength (0 for no signal to 2 for strong signal) for each biological signature relative to the total rating possible. The 2005 field experiment results show that percent positive ratings varied significantly across Site D (coastal site with fog), with patchy zones of high abundance correlated with orbital and microscale habitat types (heaved surface crust and gravel bars); alluvial fan habitats generally had lower abundance. Non-random multi-scale biological patchiness also characterized interior desert Sites E and F, with relatively high abundance associated with (paleo)aqueous habitats such as playas. Localized variables, including topography, played an important, albeit complex, role in microbial spatial distribution. Site D biosignature trends correlated with culturable soil bacteria, with MPN ranging from 10-1000 CFU/g-soil, and chlorophyll ratings accurately mapped lichen/ moss abundance (Site D) and higher plant (Site F) distributions. Climate also affected biological patchiness, with significant correlation shown between abundance and (rover) air relative humidity, while lichen patterns were linked to the presence of fog. Rover biological mapping results across sites parallel longitudinal W-E wet/dry/wet Atacama climate trends. Overall, the study highlights the success of targeting of aqueous-associated habitats identifiable from orbital geology and mineralogy. The LITA experience also suggests the terrestrial study of life and its distribution, particularly the fields of landscape ecology and ecohydrology, hold critical lessons for the search for life on other planets. Their applications to robotic sampling strategies on Mars should be further exploited.

Specific attention is paid to fossil energy technologies, nuclear and renewable energy technologies (RETs), as well as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and energy storage systems. Analysing up- and downstream processes and their associated GHG emissions, which arise upstream and downstream of the power plant (i.e., electricity generation stage), is important; otherwise, the GHG emissions resulting from electricity generation of the various fuel options are underestimated. For fossil fuel technology options upstream GHG emission rates can be up to 25% of the direct emissions from the power plant, whereas for most RETs and nuclear power upstream and downstream GHG emissions can account for way over 90% of cumulative emissions. In economies where carbon is being priced or GHG emissions constrained, this may provide an advantage to technologies with trans-boundary upstream emissions over technologies without significant life-cycle emissions arising outside the legislative boundaries of GHG mitigation policies. It is therefore desirable for GHG emissions under national, regional and international mitigation policies to be accounted for over its entire life-cycle. The results presented here indicate that the most significant GHG avoidance (in absolute terms) can be made from technology substitution. The introduction of advanced fossil fuel technologies can also lead to improvements in life-cycle GHG emissions. Overall, hydro, nuclear and wind energy technologies can produce electricity with the least life-cycle global warming impact. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Submicron particulate scattering (σsp), ozone (O3), and nitrogen oxides (NOy) were also measured and enhancement ratios for each chemical and aerosol species with CO were calculated. Events were categorized based on their source regions, which were determined by a combination of back trajectories, satellite fire detections, chemical and aerosol enhancement ratios, and meteorology. The mean Δ TAM / Δ CO values for each source region are: East Asian industrial (0.0046 ± 0.0013 ng m- 3 ppbv- 1, n = 10 events, 236 h), Pacific Northwest U.S. (PNW) biomass burning (0.0013 ± 0.008 ng m- 3 ppbv- 1, n = 7 events, 173 h), and Alaska biomass burning (0.0014 ± 0.0006 ng m- 3 ppbv- 1, n = 3 events, 96 h). The Δ TAM / Δ CO means from Asian long-range transport (ALRT) and biomass burning events are combined with previous estimates of CO emissions from Chinese anthropogenic, global biomass burning, and global boreal biomass sources in order to estimate the emissions of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) from these sources. The GEM emissions that we calculate here are: Chinese anthropogenic (620 ± 180 t y- 1), global biomass burning (670 ± 330 t y- 1), and global boreal biomass burning (168 ± 75 t y- 1), with errors estimated from propagating the uncertainty in the mean enhancement ratios and CO emissions. A comparison of our results with published mercury (Hg) emissions inventories reveals that the Chinese GEM emissions from this study are higher by about a factor of two, while our estimate for global biomass burning is consistent with previous studies. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Box 17660, Jackson, MS 39217, United States","Warming during late winter and spring in recent decades has been credited with increasing high northern latitude CO2 uptake, but it is unclear how different species and plant functional types contribute to this response. To address this, we measured net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at a deciduous broadleaf (aspen and willow) forest and an evergreen conifer (black spruce) forest in interior Alaska over a 3-year period. We partitioned NEE into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) components, assessing the impact of interannual climate variability on these fluxes during spring and summer. We found that interannual variability in both spring and summer NEE was greatest at the deciduous forest. Increases in spring air temperatures between 2002 and 2004 caused GPP to increase during the early part of the growing season (April, May, and June), with a 74% increase at the deciduous forest and a 16% increase at the evergreen forest. Re increased in parallel, by 61% and 15%, respectively. In contrast, a summer drought during 2004 caused GPP during August to decrease by 12% at the deciduous forest and by 9% at the evergreen forest. Concurrent increases in Re, by 21% and 2% for the two forests, further contributed to a reduction in net carbon uptake during the drought. Over the growing season (April-September) net carbon uptake increased by 40% at the deciduous forest and 3% at the evergreen forest in 2004 as compared with 2002. These results suggest that deciduous forests may contribute disproportionately to variability in atmospheric CO2 concentrations within the northern hemisphere and that the carbon balance of deciduous forests may have a greater sensitivity to future changes in climate. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluated soil microbial processes within a wetland in which areas dominated by a distinct plant species (cattail - Typha sp.; purple loosestrife - Lythrum salicaria L.; reed canarygrass - Phalaris arundinacea L.) co-mingled. We also established an experimental plot with plant shoot removal. The Phalaris area had more acidic soil pH (7.08 vs. 7.27-7.57), greater amount of soil organic matter (19.0% vs. 9.0-11.5%), and the slowest production rates of CO2 (0.10 vs. 0.21-0.46 μmol kg -1 s-1) and CH4 (0.040 vs. 0.054-0.079 nmol kg-1 s-1). Nitrogen cycling was dominated by net nitrification, with similar rates (17.2-18.9 mg kg-1 14 days -1) among the four sampling areas. In the second part of the study, we emplaced soil cores that either allowed root in-growth or excluded roots to evaluate how roots directly affect soil CO2 and CH4. The three plant species had similar amounts of root growth (ca 290 g m-2 year-1). Fungal biomass was similar in soils with root in-growth versus root exclusion, regardless of dominant plant species. Rates of soil CO2 production did not differ with root in-growth versus root exclusion, and added glucose increased CO2 production rates by only 35%. Root in-growth did lead to greater rates of CH4 production; albeit, addition of glucose had much greater effect on CH4 production (1.24 nmol kg-1 s-1) compared with controls without added glucose (0.058 nmol kg-1 s-1). Our data revealed relatively few subtle differences in soil characteristics and processes associated with different plant species; albeit, roots had little effect, even inhibiting some microbial processes.

HNO3 vertical profiles are retrieved from a set of high-resolution infrared spectra, measured by the nadir-viewing Interferometric Monitor for Greenhouse Gases (IMG) instrument onboard the ADEOS satellite. Ten successive days of IMG operation in April 1997 are analyzed, yielding quasi-global distributions. We show that the IMG measurements contain between 0.7 and 1.8 independent pieces of information on the HNO3 vertical distribution; the extent of which depends on the observed scene. In the tropics and the midlatitudes, tropospheric and stratospheric columns can be separated, whereas, in the colder polar regions, the total column is the most relevant quantity. A detailed error budget reveals that the accuracy on the profile measurements ranges from 5-15% in the stratosphere to about 20-30% in the middle troposphere, and as much as 60% in the lowermost troposphere where the measurements are less sensitive. The global distributions of tropospheric and stratospheric partial columns are presented and discussed. In the stratosphere we measure higher columns at both poles than in the intertropical belt, as expected for the period in April analyzed here. In the troposphere, the zonal distributions show elevated values nearby NOx source regions, such as central Europe, the Eastern coast of the United States, and the North-West of India. Typical profiles with mixing ratios up to 2 ppbv in the boundary layer and 1 ppbv in the free troposphere are identified. These novel results indicate a possible role of HNO3 in the long-range transport of active nitrogen and open promising perspectives for future space missions dedicated to atmospheric chemistry.

Although the majority of organic carbon in these ecosystems resides belowground, there is no consensus on how this change in land cover has affected soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) pools. The degree to which duration of woody plant occupation, climate, and edaphic conditions have mediated SOC and TN responses to changes in life-form composition are poorly understood. We addressed these issues at a desert grassland site in Arizona, USA, where the leguminous shrub velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina) has proliferated along an elevation/precipitation/ temperature gradient and on contrasting soil morphologic surfaces. On sandy loam complexes of mid-Holocene origin, mean SOC and TN of soils in the grassland matrix increased ∼68% and ∼45%, respectively, with increasing elevation. Soil organic carbon pools were comparable and TN pools were ∼23% higher in Pleistocene-aged clay loam complexes co-occurring with Holocene-aged soils at the upper elevation/climatic zone. Across the site, belowground resources associated with large Prosopis plants were 21-154% (SOC) and 18-127% (TN) higher than those in the grassy matrix. The variance in SOC and TN pools accounted for by Prosopis stem size (a rough surrogate for time of site occupation) was highest at the low- and mid-elevation sites (69-74%) and lowest at the upper elevation site (32-38%). Soil δ15N values ranged from 5.5‰ to 6.7‰ across the soil/elevation zones but were comparable in herbaceous and shrub-impacted soils and exhibited a weak relationship with Prosopis basal stem diameter (r2, 0.1) and TN (r2, 0.08). The SOC δ13C values decreased linearly with increasing Prosopis basal diameter, suggesting that size and isotopic composition of the SOC pool is a function of time of Prosopis site occupation. Isotopic mixture models indicate that encroachment of C3 woody plants has also promoted SOC additions from C4 plant sources, indicative of long-term herbaceous facilitation. Grassy sites in contrasting soil/elevation combinations, initially highly distinctive in their SOC pool size and δ13C, appear to be converging on similar values following ∼100 years of woody plant proliferation. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","13C; Carbon cycle; Carbon isotopes; Carbon sequestration; Mesquite; Prosopis velutina; Santa Rita experimental range, Arizona, USA; Soil nitrogen; Soil organic carbon; Sonoran desert; Woody plant encroachment","carbon isotope; carbon sequestration; dicotyledon; grassland; growth rate; isotopic composition; shrub; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; Arizona; North America; Santa Rita Experimental Range; Sonoran Desert; United States; Prosopis; Prosopis velutina; carbon; nitrogen; rain; article; climate; desert climate; Poaceae; Prosopis; soil; temperature; Carbon; Carbon Isotopes; Climate; Desert Climate; Nitrogen; Poaceae; Prosopis; Rain; Soil; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39049084972

Crop plants with increased lignin levels may lead to increased soil C sequestration. Grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) exhibiting lower lignin due to the naturally occurring brown midrib mutation (bmr) may allow an assessment of the potential of biotechnology to affect soil C sequestration by manipulating plant lignin levels. A 194-d laboratory microcosm experiment was conducted to investigate the mineralization of bmr and normal plant residue from four sorghum hybrids. Cross-polarization magic angle spinning 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance of the residue agreed with chemical analysis that the bmr residue contained altered lignin and less lignin per mass weight. Ground bmr or normal grain sorghum residue was added to soil, with or without an inorganic nitrogen (N) amendment. Initial C mineralization from microcosms receiving bmr residue was higher than from microcosms receiving normal residue, but the differences were not maintained through the 194-d experiment. Total residue C mineralization was not different between bmr or normal isolines, and accounted for only 26% of the originally added residue C. Greater variability was observed between sorghum lines than between bmr or normal isolines. The addition of N to soil resulted in increased soil C mineralization. With no added N, however, microcosm C mineralization was most strongly correlated with the lignin/N ratio. With added N, microcosm C mineralization was most strongly correlated with hemicellulose content. The soil microbial community, as assessed by phospholipid and neutral-lipid fatty acid analysis, was not affected by bmr or normal genotype, but the addition of N resulted in significant changes to the soil microbial community, most notably changes to the soil fungi.

Radiocarbon analyses indicate the age of the organic-rich sediment ranges from &gt; 44,000 to 29,100 14C yr BP, a time period with no fossil remains reported in this region of the Appalachians. Analyses of field observations, textural data, organic carbon content, and plant macrofossils indicate that the organic-rich sediments contain interbedded standing-water and debris-flow deposits. Up to 6 m of oxidized debris-flow sediments bury the organic-rich sediments. The presence of Rubus parviflorus (Thimble Berry) throughout the deposit indicates the site had a boreal environment from &gt; 44,000 to 29,100 14C yr BP. Plant macrofossil evidence indicates the uplands had stands of spruce/jack-pine forests while the valley contained ponds and associated wetlands. Three debris flows occurred at the site between approximately 38,000 and 29,000 14C yr BP, suggesting a recurrence interval for major storms of approximately 3000 yr, even though the apparent stability of the boreal environment implies a climate not conducive to catastrophic rainstorms. This conflicting combination of features suggests that during the middle Wisconsinan this area experienced generally cool climates, dominated by polar air masses, but was punctuated by relatively brief warm periods marked by incursions of tropical air masses. © 2007 University of Washington.","Boreal forest; Central Appalachians; Debris flows; Geomorphology; Late Pleistocene; Paleoclimate; Plant macrofossil","biota; Boreal; climate effect; debris flow; microfossil; organic carbon; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; radiocarbon dating; storm; upland region; wetland; Appalachians; North America; Cervidae; Mastodon; Rubus parviflorus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250628911

However, to date, these emissions have not been well-quantified for the entire United States. Daily emissions of Hg from fires in the lower 48 states of the United States (LOWER48) and in Alaska were estimated for 2002-2006 using a simple fire emissions model. Emission factors of Hg from fires in different ecosystems were compiled from published plume studies and from soil-based assessments. Annual averaged emissions of Hg from fires in the LOWER48 and Alaska were 44 (20-65) metric tons yr -1, equivalent to ∼30% of the U.S. EPA 2002 National Emissions Inventory for Hg. Alaska had the highest averaged monthly emissions of all states; however, the emissions have a high temporal variability. Emissions from forests dominate the inventory, suggesting that Hg emissions from agricultural fires are not significant on an annual basis. The uncertainty in the Hg emission factors due to limited data leads to an uncertainty in the emission estimates on the order of ±50%.

These emissions, however, are highly variable in both space and time. Additionally, CO2 emissions estimates from fires are very uncertain. The combination of high spatial and temporal variability and substantial uncertainty associated with fire CO2 emissions can be problematic to efforts to develop remote sensing, monitoring, and inverse modeling techniques to quantify carbon fluxes at the continental scale. Policy and carbon management decisions based on atmospheric sampling/modeling techniques must account for the impact of fire CO2 emissions; a task that may prove very difficult for the foreseeable future. This paper addresses the variability of CO2 emissions from fires across the US, how these emissions compare to anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and Net Primary Productivity, and the potential implications for monitoring programs and policy development. Results: Average annual CO2 emissions from fires in the lower 48 (LOWER48) states from 2002-2006 are estimated to be 213 (± 50 std. dev.) Tg CO2 yr-1 and 80 (± 89 std. dev.) Tg CO2 yr-1 in Alaska. These estimates have significant interannual and spatial variability. Needleleaf forests in the Southeastern US and the Western US are the dominant source regions for US fire CO2 emissions. Very high emission years typically coincide with droughts, and climatic variability is a major driver of the high interannual and spatial variation in fire emissions. The amount of CO2 emitted from fires in the US is equivalent to 4-6% of anthropogenic emissions at the continental scale and, at the state-level, fire emissions of CO2 can, in some cases, exceed annual emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel usage. Conclusion: The CO2 released from fires, overall, is a small fraction of the estimated average annual Net Primary Productivity and, unlike fossil fuel CO2 emissions, the pulsed emissions of CO2 during fires are partially counterbalanced by uptake of CO2 by regrowing vegetation in the decades following fire. Changes in fire severity and frequency can, however, lead to net changes in atmospheric CO2 and the short-term impacts of fire emissions on monitoring, modeling, and carbon management policy are substantial. © 2007 Wiedinmyer and Neff; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349136822

Such alterations in community composition must be underlain by changes in the population dynamics of component species. • Here, the impact of elevated CO2 (550 μmol mol -1) and warming (+2°C) on the population growth of four plant species important in Australian temperate grasslands is reported. Data collected from the Tasmanian free-air CO2 enrichment (TasFACE) experiment between 2003 and 2006 were analysed using population matrix models. • Population growth of Themeda triandra, a perennial C4 grass, was largely unaffected by either factor but population growth of Austrodanthonia caespitosa, a perennial C3 grass, was reduced substantially in elevated CO2 plots. Warming and elevated CO2 had antagonistic effects on population growth of two invasive weeds, Hypochaeris radicata and Leontodon taraxacoides, with warming causing population decline.

Although data are available for few bumblebee species at present and further tests are needed, the first result supports earlier suggestions that it is bumblebee species with narrower climatic niches that are most vulnerable to decline. The second result supports the suggestion that it is in areas nearer the edges of their climatic niches where these species are most vulnerable to decline, although this can be ameliorated locally by higher food-resource levels. This is not to say that all patterns of bumblebee decline have been influenced by climatic niche, particularly in North America.

Transport-related carbon emissions are rising and there is increasing consensus that the growth in motorised land vehicles and aviation is incompatible with averting serious climate change. The energy intensity of land transport correlates with its adverse health effects. Adverse health effects occur through climate change, road-traffic injuries, physical inactivity, urban air pollution, energy-related conflict, and environmental degradation. For the world's poor people, walking is the main mode of transport, but such populations often experience the most from the harms of energy-intensive transport. New energy sources and improvements in vehicle design and in information technology are necessary but not sufficient to reduce transport-related carbon emissions without accompanying behavioural change. By contrast, active transport has the potential to improve health and equity, and reduce emissions. Cities require safe and pleasant environments for active transport with destinations in easy reach and, for longer journeys, public transport that is powered by renewable energy, thus providing high levels of accessibility without car use. Much investment in major road projects does not meet the transport needs of poor people, especially women whose trips are primarily local and off road. Sustainable development is better promoted through improving walking and cycling infrastructures, increasing access to cycles, and investment in transport services for essential needs. Our model of London shows how increased active transport could help achieve substantial reductions in emissions by 2030 while improving population health. There exists the potential for a global contraction and convergence in use of fossil-fuel energy for transport to benefit health and achieve sustainability. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The innovation of this study's approach is to account for the losses of carbon within the fluvial system as well as fluxes at the catchment outlet. In order to make this assessment this study considers: the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) as a measure of the degradation of DOC; and the dissolved CO2 concentration of groundwater as calculated and apportioned into surface waters on the basis of Ca concentrations. The study shows that the best estimate of carbon export, via rivers, from England and Wales is 10.34 Mg C/km2/year, with 4.19 Mg C/km2/year of this going to the atmosphere. The mapping of the carbon export shows that there are regional hotspots of carbon export and in a small number of cases rivers could be net sinks of carbon due to their low dissolved CO2 content relative to the atmosphere. The flux calculated by this approach is probably still an underestimate of the carbon flux through fluvial systems but the scale of the export is greater than that previously reported and there is evidence that the fluvial flux of carbon is increasing on a decadal scale. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon; Dissolved CO2; DOC; POC; Rivers","biochemical oxygen demand; calcium; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; data set; dissolved organic carbon; river; England; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Wales; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548551489

The objectives of this study were to investigate the impacts of conventional tillage (CT), no tillage (NT), and wheat cropping sequences on the depth distribution of dissolved organic C (DOC), soil organic C (SOC), and total N in a central Texas soil after 20 years. Soil was sampled for six depth intervals ranging from 0 to 105 cm. Conventional tillage consisted of disking, chiseling, ridging, and residue incorporation into soil, while residues remained on the soil surface for NT. The depth distribution of DOC was similar to SOC. Tillage impacts on DOC, SOC, and total N were primarily observed in surface soil (0-5 cm) under continuous wheat but also in subsurface soil depth intervals down to 55 cm for more intensive cropping sequences. On average, NT increased SOC, DOC, and total N compared to CT by 28, 18, and 33%, respectively. Soil organic C and total N were highest at 0-5 cm and decreased with depth to 30-55 cm, below which few tillage or cropping sequence effects were observed. The depth distribution of SOC and total N indicated treatment effects below levels of the maximum tillage depth, while intensive cropping increased SOC and total N for NT compared to CT to a greater depth than for monoculture wheat. High intensity cropping sequences, coupled with NT, resulted in the highest soil organic matter levels in subsurface soils, demonstrating the importance of subsurface C and N storage for potential mitigation of greenhouse gases. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A reduction of emissions can be achieved by implementing alternative fuel chains. The objective of this study is to carry out an economic, environmental and energy (EEE) life cycle study on natural gas-based automotive fuels with conventional gasoline in an abundant region of China. A set of indices of four fuels/vehicle systems on the basis of life cycle are assessed in terms of impact of EEE, in which natural gas produces compressed natural gas (CNG), methanol, dimethylether (DME) and Fischer Tropsch diesel (FTD). The study included fuel production, vehicle production, vehicle operation, infrastructure and vehicle end of life as a system for each fuel/vehicle system. A generic gasoline fueled car is used as a baseline. Data have been reviewed and modified based on the best knowledge available to Chongqing local sources. Results indicated that when we could not change electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles into commercial vehicles on a large scale, direct use of CNG in a dedicated or bi-fuel vehicle is an economical choice for the region which is most energy efficient and more environmental friendly. The study can be used to support decisions on how natural gas resources can best be utilized as a fuel/energy resource for automobiles, and what issues need to be resolved in Chongqing.

Since the lifetimes of some important pollutants are long enough to be transported over long distance in the troposphere, regional control strategies for air pollution in downwind countries might be ineffective without considering the effects of long-range transport of pollutants from Asia. Field campaigns provide strong evidence for the intercontinental transport of Asian pollutants. They, together with ground-based observations and model simulations, show that the air quality over parts of North America is being affected by the pollutants transported from Asia.

Carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios of these muds tend to covary at the scale of the twelve 4th-order sequences that dominate the platform succession. The δ13C values of the slope muds range from + 0.5 to + 4‰ PDB and lie in the range of least-altered contemporaneous brachiopods from North America, indicating little resetting of carbon isotopes by diagenesis. There is an approximately 1 to 2‰ decrease in δ13C in the maximum flooding zone relative to the lowstand, followed by a positive shift upward in the highstand before becoming more negative toward 4th-order correlative conformities. Meteoric diagenesis might have reset some sediments just beneath a sequence boundary to lighter values; it cannot account for the observed shifts evident throughout the sequences. The 13C-enriched values in δ13C profiles could be due to increased productivity during glacial stages. The increased productivity during glacial stages was probably due to increased ocean circulation, coupled with shallowing, which brought the ramp top into waters with more 13C-enriched dissolved inorganic carbon, with the opposite effects occurring during deglaciation. The δ18O values of muds range from about - 2.2 to about - 4.6‰ PDB, falling within and beyond the lighter part of the range of contemporaneous North American brachiopods [Mii, H.S., Grossman, E.L., Yancey, T.E., 1999. Carboniferous isotope stratigraphies of North America; implications for Carboniferous paleoceanography and Mississippian glaciation. Geol. Soc. Am. Bull., 111, 960-973]. These values likely have been reset by burial diagenesis, and perhaps by some meteoric diagenesis just beneath correlative conformities. The sequences show negative excursions of 1 to 2‰ in δ18O in the maximum flooding zone relative to the lowstand, and then become more positive upward in the highstand, then decrease toward the correlative conformities. Some of the preserved signal could reflect ice-volume changes, although this would account for only 0.5 to 1‰ change. The ice-volume effect during lowstands, plus cooling of ramp-top waters and small increases in salinity due to increased aridity in the Appalachian Basin, could account for the remaining 0.5 to 1.5‰ of oxygen isotope excursions, with the opposite effect occurring during high sea levels. The δ18O and δ13C of the Appalachian ramp-slope facies lack the strong 3rd-order trends of the mid-continental United States and Europe. The remnant 4th-order carbon and oxygen isotope signal is similar in structure to Cenozoic deep-sea isotope profiles that are due in large part to 4th-order glacio-eustasy. This would be compatible with onset of Late Paleozoic glaciation of Gondwana. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The process is expected to reduce the emission of pollutants, especially heavy-metals and dioxins. In this paper, the combustible components of MSW and simulated MSW were gasified in a lab-scale fluidized bed at 400°C-700°C when the excess air ratio (ER) was between 0.2 and 0.8. The experimental results indicated that the MSW could be gasified effectively in a fluidized bed at approximately 600°C-700°C when excess air ratio was 0.2-0.4. The melting characteristics of two typical fly ash samples from MSW incinerators were investigated. The results indicated that fly ash of pure MSW incineration could be melted at approximately 1,300°C and that of MSW and coal co-combustion could be melted at approximately 1,400°C. When temperature was over 1,100°C, more than 99.9% of the dioxins could be decomposed and most of the heavy-metals could be solidified in the slag. Based on the above experiments, two feasible MSW gasification and melting processes were proposed for low calorific value MSW: (1) sieved MSW gasification and melting system, which was based on an idea of multi-recycle; (2) gasification and melting scheme of MSW adding coal as assistant fuel. © 2007 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag.","Dioxins; Gasification and melting; Heavy-metal; Low emission; Municipal solid waste (MSW)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36448941223

Namely, Pinus forest occupied most mountains around the studied area and the structure of vertical vegetational belt was simple between 2.780 and 2.729 Ma B.P., reflecting a relatively warm and dry climate. During 2.729. - 2608 Ma B.P., the areas of cold-temperate conifer forest (CTCF) and Tsuga forest increased and the structure of vertical vegetational belt became clear. According to percentages of tropical and subtropical elements growing in low-altitude regions rifely increased, we speculate that the increase of CTCF and Tsuga forest areas mainly resulted from strong uplift of mountains which provided upward expanding space and growing condition for these plants. Thus, the climate of the low-altitude regions around the basin was relatively warm and humid. Between 2.608 and 1.553 Ma B.P., P inus forest occupied most mountains around the studied area and forest line of CTCF rose, which reflects a moderately warm-dry climate on the whole. During 1.553. - 0.876 Ma B.P., the structure of vertical vegetational belt in mountains around the studied area became complicated and the amplitude of vegetational belts shifting up and down enlarged, which implies that the amplitude of climatic change increased, the climatic associational feature was more complex and the climate was moderately cold at a majority of the stage. During 0.876 - 0.252 Ma B.P., there were all vertical vegetational belts existing at present in mountains around the studied area. The elements of each belt were more abundant and complex than earlier. At different periods in the stage vertical vegetational belts occurred as expanding or shrinking, and alternated each other. The amplitude of vegetational belts shifting up and down was the maximum in the whole section. This change suggests that the amplitude of climatic change was evidently larger than earlier, but the frequency reduced and the climatic associational feature was more complex. From 0.252 Ma B.P. to the present, the most time was characteristic of the expanding of Pinus forest and semi-humid evergreen broad-leaved forest (SEBF) in mountains around the studied area, while expanding time of other vegetational belts was very short, which reflects a smaller amplitude of cold and warm fluctuation. On the basis of the six obvious cycles of vegetational and climatic changes, there were still many times of secondary vegetational successions and climatic oscillations. Based on the above analysis, the forcing mechanism of vegetational succession and climatic change in the Heqing Basin is further discussed. It is primarily considered that main influential factors were exterior factors such as orbital parameters, etc., but the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau played a very important function for environmental changes in the Heqing Basin at two times obvious increase of vertical vegetational belts and three climatic transitions. © Science in China Press 2007.","Climatic transition; Heqing Basin; Palaeoclimate; Palaeovegetation; Pollen record","Palaeoclimate; Palaeovegetation; Palynology; Pollen study; Climate change; Forestry; Landforms; Sediments; Softwoods; Vegetation; broad-leaved forest; climate change; climate forcing; climate oscillation; coniferous forest; deep drilling; lacustrine deposit; paleoclimate; palynology; vegetation; Biology; Climates; Forests; Mountains; Pinus; Plants; Pollen; Sediments; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Heqing; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Yunnan; Coniferophyta; Tsuga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447308190

In this paper, soil data from the Second State Soil Survey of China (SSSSC) conducted in the early 1980s and data published in the last 5 years were used to estimate the size of SOC stocks over the whole profile and their changes in China in last 20 years. Soils were identified as paddy, upland, forest, grassland or waste-land soils and an improved soil bulk density estimation method was used to estimate missing bulk density data. In the early 1980s, total SOC stocks were estimated at 89.61 Pg (1Pg = 103 Tg = 1015 g) in China's 870.94 Mha terrestrial areas covered by 2473 soil series. In the paddy, upland, forest and grassland soils the respective total SOC stocks were 2.91 Pg on 29.87 Mha, 10.07 Pg on 125.89 Mha, 34.23 Pg on 249.32 Mha and 37.71 Pg on 278.51 Mha, respectively. The SOC density of the surface layer ranged from 3.5 Mg ha-1 in Gray Desery grassland soils to 252.6 Mg ha-1 in Mountain Meadow forest soils. The average area-weighted total SOC density in paddy soils (97.6 Mg ha-1) was higher than that in upland soils (80 Mg ha-1). Soils under forest (137.3 Mg ha-1) had a similar average area-weighted total SOC density as those under grassland (135.4 Mg ha-1). The annual estimated SOC accumulation rates in farmland and forest soils in the last 20 years were 23.61 and 11.72 Tg, respectively, leading to increases of 0.472 and 0.234 Pg SOC in farmland and forest areas, respectively. In contrast, SOC under grassland declined by 3.56 Pg due to the grassland degradation over this period. The resulting estimated net SOC loss in China's soils over the last 20 years was 2.86 Pg. The documented SOC accumulation in farmland and forest soils could thus not compensate for the loss of SOC in grassland soils in the last 20 years. There were, however, large regional differences: Soils in China's South and Eastern parts acted mainly as C sinks, increasing their average topsoil SOC by 132 and 145Tg, respectively. In contrast, in the Northwest, Northeast, Inner Mongolia and Tibet significant losses of 1.38, 0.21, 0.49 and 1.01Pg of SOC, respectively, were estimated over the last 20 years. These results highlight the importance to take measures to protect grassland and to improve management practices to increase C sequestration in farmland and forest soils. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","China; Climate change; Forest; Grassland; Paddy; Soil organic carbon; Upland","agricultural soil; carbon sequestration; forest soil; grassland soil; organic carbon; soil organic matter; upland region; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548472186

Crop simulation results under climate change scenarios varied considerably between regions and years. Without the CO2 fertilization effect, China's maize production was predicted to suffer a negative effect under both A2 and B2 scenarios for all time slices, with greatest production decreases in today's major maize planting areas.

Based on the second national soil survey of China, the situation of SOC density in the plow layer of farmland was analyzed under different land use patterns. Results showed that SOC density in the plow layer was about 3.15 kg m-2 in average ranging from 0.81 to 12.68 kg m-2. The highest density was found in the southeastern region with an average of 3.63 kg m-2, while the lowest occurring in the northwestern region with an average of 3.00 kg m-2. The variation coefficient of SOC density in the plow layer of farmland was 57%, which was 35% lower than that of non-farmland soils. Compared to SOC density in the dry land, SOC density in paddy soils was 13% higher with a lower variation coefficient between different regions. In addition, the relationships between the climatic factors (annual average temperature and precipitation) and SOC density were lower in farmland than those in non-farmland soils, as well as lower in paddy soils than those in dry land of farmland. These results suggest that anthropogenic disturbances have great impacts on SOC density in farmland soils, especially in paddy soils, indicating that Chinese rice cropping may contribute greatly to the SOC stability and sequestration in paddy field. © 2007 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.","carbon sequestration; global change; land use pattern; organic carbon density; regional difference",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548502256

Reported correlations between Δ and grain yield however, differ highly according to the analyzed organ or tissue, the stage of sampling, and the environment and water regime. In a first experiment carried out in spring wheat during two consecutive seasons in the dry conditions of northwest Mexico (Ciudad Obregon, Sonora), different water treatments were applied, corresponding to the main water regimes available to spring wheat worldwide, and the relationships between Δ values of different organs and grain yield were examined. Under terminal (post-anthesis) water stress, grain yield was positively associated with Δ in grain at maturity and in leaf at anthesis, confirming results previously obtained under Mediterranean environments. Under early (pre-anthesis) water stress and residual moisture stress, the association between grain Δ and yield was weaker and highly depended on the quantity of water stored in the soil at sowing. No correlation was found between Δ and grain yield under optimal irrigation. The relationship between Δ and grain yield was also studied during two consecutive seasons in 20 bread wheat cultivars in the Ningxia region (Northern China), characterized by winter drought (pre-anthesis water stress). Wheat was grown under rainfed conditions in two locations (Guyuan and Pengyang) and under irrigated conditions in another two (Yinchuan and Huinong). In Huinong, the crop was also exposed to salt stress. Highly significant positive associations were found between leaf and grain Δ and grain yields across the environments. The relationship between Δ and yield within environments highly depended on the quantity of water stored in the soil at sowing, the quantity and distribution of rainfall during the growth cycle, the presence of salt in the soil, and the occurrence of irrigation before anthesis. These two experiments confirmed the value of Δ as an indirect selection criterion for yield and a phenotyping tool under post-anthesis water stress (including limited irrigation). © 2007 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Carbon isotope discrimination; Drought; Salinity; Spring wheat; Yield","carbon isotope; crop yield; drought; irrigation; moisture; water stress; water treatment; wheat; Triticum aestivum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348929985

Forest soils at various depths were sampled under a tropical rainforest and adjacent tea garden after clear-cutting, and under three temperate forests developed on a volcanic soil (e.g. Betula ermanii and Picea jezoensis, and Pinus koraiensis mainly mixed with Tilia amurensis, Fraxinus mandshurica and Quercus mongolica), to study soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) concentration and metabolic quotients (qCO2, CO 2-C/biomass-C). Soil MBC concentration and CO2 evolution were measured over 7-day and 21-day incubation periods, respectively, along with the main properties of the soils. On the basis of soil total C, both CO 2 evolution and MBC concentrations appeared to decrease with increasing soil depth. There was a maximal qCO2 in the 0-2.5 cm soil under each forest stand. Neither incubation period affected the CO2 evolution rates, but incubation period did induce a significant difference in MBC concentration and qCO2 in tea soil and Picea jezoensis forest soil. The conversion of a tropical rainforest to a tea garden reduced the CO2 evolution and increased the qCO2 in soil. Comparing temperate and tropical forests, the results show that both Pinus koraiensis mixed with hardwoods and rainforest soil at less than 20 cm depth had a larger MBC concentration relative to soil total C and a lower qCO2 during both incubation periods, suggesting that microbial communities in both soils were more efficient in carbon use than communities in the other soils. Factor and regression analysis indicated that the 85% variation of the qCO2 in forest soils could be explained by soil properties such as the C:N ratio and the concentration of water soluble organic C and exchangeable Al (P &lt; 0.001). The qCO2 values in forest soils, particularly in temperate volcanic forest soils, decreased with an increasing Al/C ratio in water-soluble organic matter. Soil properties, such as exchangeable Ca, Mg and Al and water-soluble organic C:N ratio, were associated with the variation of MBC. Thus, MBC concentrations and qCO2 of the soils are useful soil parameters for studying soil C availability and microbial utilization efficiency under temperate and tropical forests. © 2007 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.","Carbon availability; Metabolic quotient; Microbial biomass; Respiration; Temperate forest; Tropical forest; Volcanic","Betula ermanii; Fraxinus; Fraxinus mandshurica; Malvaceae; Picea; Picea jezoensis; Pinus koraiensis; Quercus mongolica; Tilia amurensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547560454

We previously reported that polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) in one-carbon pathway were associated with breast cancer risk in the population-based Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project. Herein, we systematically investigated putatively functional polymorphisms of seven other one-carbon-metabolizing genes in relation to the breast cancer risk in the same population. Except for a slight indication of increased risk of breast cancer associated with the double repeat (2R) allele in the thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 5′-untranslated region (UTR) (P, trend = 0.07), polymorphisms in the other six genes did not substantially modify the risk of breast cancer, or did they modify the risk associated with dietary intakes of folate and related B vitamins. However, we observed a significant multiplicative interaction between the MTHFR 677C>T and the TYMS 5′-UTR polymorphisms (P = 0.02). We used a recursive partitioning method, RTREE, in an attempt to tease out important or rate-limiting genes encoding these intricately related enzymes. Results from RTREE analyses indicate that MTHFR and TYMS are the two leading rate-limiting enzymes in the pathway, consistent with our epidemiological findings. Our findings underscore the importance of one-carbon metabolism in breast cancer etiology. Although the pathway is a network of interrelated enzymes, redundancy exists; evaluating the rate-limiting enzyme and its interaction with environment and other genes within the same pathway is critical in assessing breast cancer risk. © The Author 2007.

Computer simulations were conducted by randomly sampling ambient monitoring data collected in six Canadian cities at a variety of settings (e.g., population-based sites, near-roadway sites). The 5-yr (1998-2002) dataset consisted of hourly measurements of nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), coarse particulate matter (PM10), fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and CO. The strategy of randomly selecting one 2-week measurement per season to determine the annual or long-term average concentration yields estimates within 30% of the true value 95% of the time for NO2, PM10 and NOx. Larger errors, up to 50%, are expected for NO, SO2, PM2.5, and CO. Combining concentrations from 85 random 1-hr visits per season provides annual and 5-yr average estimates within 30% of the true value with good confidence. Overall, the magnitude of error in the estimates was strongly correlated with the variability of the pollutant. A better estimation can be expected for pollutants known to be less temporally variable and/or over geographic areas where concentrations are less variable. By using multiple sites located in different settings, the relationships determined for estimation error versus number of measurement periods used to determine long-term average are expected to realistically portray the true distribution.

The adsorption and dissociation of CH4, CO, CH4/CO2, and CH 4/O2 on nickel alumina catalysts were also extensively investigated by temperature-programmed hydrogénation (TPH) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). The phase structure and nickel oxidation states of Ni/Al2O3 samples were examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. XRD, TPR, and XPS results demonstrated that nickel is mainly present as NiO and NiAl2O4 in the as-prepared catalyst, while around 83%-90% nickel is Ni0 after the catalyst is reduced at 700°C. Methane pulse reactions and transient response analysis demonstrate that the methane oxidation mechanism changes as the nickel oxidation state changes over Ni/Al2O3 when there is no gaseous oxygen present. CH4 is efficiently oxidized into CO and H2 via a direct oxidation mechanism when Ni/Al2O3 is prereduced, while CH4 may be converted by a nonselective oxidation process over an oxidized Ni/Al2O3. CO pulse reaction results over the prereduced catalyst suggest that the CO disproportionation reaction occurs over NiAAl2O3 catalyst under operation conditions, while CH4 is generated through the hydrogenation of the surface carbidic species from CO disproportionation. TPD and TPH studies show that the decomposition of methane results in the formation of at least three kinds of surface carbon species on supported nickel catalysts. TPD and TPH results also prove CO is converted to CO2 and surface carbidic Cα through the disproportionation reaction. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Disproportionation reaction; Surface carbon species; Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD); Adsorption; Alumina; Mass spectrometry; Nickel; Phase structure; Transient analysis; Catalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38149049822

The gross N2O production curve of the soil sample (incubation with C 2H2) showed minor changes between the freeze-thaw treatment and the unfrozen control. However, kinetics analysis revealed that the initial production rate, an indicator of the population density of denitrifying communities, decreased (P=0.043) and the specific growth rate constant, an indicator of the activity of denitrifying communities, increased (P=0.039) as a result of the freeze-thaw cycles in five of six soil samples examined. The increase in the specific growth rate constant suggested the stimulation of the activity of denitrifying communities that survived after the freeze-thaw cycles and may explain the minor suppression on the gross N2O production in spite of decreasing the population density of denitrifying communities that was suggested by the initial production rate. The net N2O production curve of the soil sample (incubation without C2H2) showed a remarkable change in one out of six soil samples, and in that one soil sample, N2O release to the atmosphere was largely stimulated (7.6 times) by the freeze-thaw cycles. However, the stimulation of the N2O release by the freeze-thaw cycles was even observed in two other selected soil samples (4.6 and 1.8 times), suggesting that an imbalance in the N2O- producing and N2O-reducing activities of denitrifying communities might complementally explain the N2O release stimulated by the freeze-thaw cycles. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","C2H2 inhibition method; Denitrifying communities; Freeze-thaw cycles; N2O production; Soil","community response; denitrification; freeze-thaw cycle; growth rate; kinetics; nitrous oxide; population density",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34648816081

When CO2 storage is properly measured and taken into account, underestimations of NEE on calm nights can be greatly reduced. Using CO2 data from a 12-level profile at the Missouri Ozark flux site (an oak-hickory forest in central Missouri, USA), we demonstrate that the lower canopy layer (below the thermal inversion) is a disproportionately large contributor to the total CO2 storage. This is because time derivative of CO2 density (Δc/Δt) generally shows increasing magnitude of mean and standard deviation with decreasing heights at night and from sunrise to 1000 h in both growing and dormant seasons. Effects of resolution and configuration in a profiling system on the accuracy of CO2 storage estimation are evaluated by comparing subset profiles to the 12-level benchmark profile. It is demonstrated that the effectiveness of a profiling system in estimating CO2 storage is not only determined by its number of sampling levels but, more importantly, by its vertical configuration. To optimize a profile, one needs to balance the influence of two factors, Δc /Δt and layer thickness, among all vertical sections within a forest. As a key contributor to the total CO2 storage, the lower canopy requires a higher resolution in a profile system than the layers above. However, if the upper canopy is oversparsely sampled relative to the lower canopy, the performance of a profile system might be degraded since, in such a situation, the influence of layer thickness dominates over that of Δc/Δt. We also find that because of different level of complexity in canopy structure, more sampling levels are necessary at our site in order to achieve the same level of accuracy as at a boreal aspen site. These results suggest that in order to achieve an adequate accuracy in CO2 storage measurements, the number of sampling levels in a profile and its design should be subject to the site properties, e.g., canopy architecture and the resulted thermodynamic and flow structures. If CO2 density from a single profile is averaged in time and then used in assessing CO2 storage to reduce random errors, biases associated with this averaging procedure become inevitable. Generally, larger window sizes used in averaging CO2 density generate poorer estimates of CO2 storage. If absolute errors are concerned, it appears that the more significant the CO2 storage is during a period, the larger effects the averaging procedure has.

The top and bottom boundaries of the methane hydrate stability zone (MHSZ) and the actual methane hydrate zone (MHZ), and the top of free gas occurrence are determined by using numerical methods and the new steady state model developed in this paper. Numerical results show that the MHZ thickness becomes thinner with increasing the salinity, and the stability is lowered and the base of the MHSZ is shifted toward the seafloor in the presence of salts. As a result, the thickness of actual hydrate occurrence becomes thinner compared with that of the pure water case. On the other hand, since lower solubility reduces the amount of gas needed to form methane hydrate, the existence of salts in seawater can actually promote methane gas hydrate formation in the hydrate stability zone. Numerical modeling also demonstrates that for the salt-water case the presence of methane within the field of methane hydrate stability is not sufficient to ensure the occurrence of gas hydrate, which can only form when the methane concentration dissolved in solution with salts exceeds the local methane solubility in salt water and if the methane flux exceeds a critical value corresponding to the rate of diffusive methane transport. In order to maintain gas hydrate or to form methane gas hydrate in marine sediments, a persistent supplied methane probably from biogenic or thermogenic processes, is required to overcome losses due to diffusion and advection. © Science in China Press 2007.","Methane gas hydrate; Phase equilibrium; Salinity; Solubility; Stability of hydrate","Advection; Diffusion in gases; Mathematical models; Methane; Seawater; Solubility; Methane gas hydrate; Salinity; Steady state model; Gas hydrates; gas hydrate; marine sediment; methane; numerical model; phase equilibrium; salinity; seawater; solubility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35048854516

In this study, emissions of regulated (CO, THC, NO x) and unregulated air pollutants, including CO2, particulate matter (PM), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and BTEX (acronym for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene), were measured before and after conversion of nine gasoline-powered automobiles to LPG/gasoline dual-fuel retrofits. The tests were conducted on a standard chassis dynamometer in accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency FTP-75 test procedure, with the exception that all tests were conducted under hot-start driving conditions. The influences of LPG on air pollutant emission levels and carcinogenic potency were investigated and compared with gasoline. The results showed average emission factors of 0.14 g/km, 0.33 mg/km, 0.09 g/km, 0.44 g/km, and 197 g/km for CO, THC, NOx, PM, and CO2, respectively, for LPG/gasoline dual-fuel retrofits. Paired-sample t-test results indicated that the emissions of CO (p = 0.03), THC (p = 0.04), and CO2 (p = 4.6 × 10-8) were significantly reduced with the retrofit in comparison with gasoline-powered automobiles. The reduction percentages were 71%, 89%, and 14% for CO, THC, and CO2, respectively. The average total PAH emission factor for LPG was 217 μg/km, which is significantly lower than gasoline (863 μg/km; p = 0.05). The PAH corresponding carcinogenicities (BaPeq) were calculated via toxic equivalencies based on benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). Paired-sample t-test results for total BaPeq emissions showed no significant difference between gasoline (30.0 μg/km) and LPG (24.8 μg/km) at a confidence level of 95%. The discrepancy between PAH and BaPeq emissions resulted from the higher emission percentages of high molecular weight PAHs for LPG, which might be from lubricant oil. The average emission factors of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene were 351, 4400, 324, and 1100 μg/km, respectively, with LPG as fuel, which were all significantly lower than those for gasoline (95% confidence level).

The test biodiesel (B20) was blended with 80% diesel and 20% methyl ester derived from waste cooking oil. Emissions of regulated air pollutants, including CO, HC, NOx, particulate matter (PM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured at 20,000-km intervals. The identical-model engines were installed on a standard dynamometer equipped with a dilution tunnel used to measure the pollutants. To simulate real-world driving conditions, emission measurements were made in accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) FTP transient cycle guidelines. At 0 km of the durability test, HC, CO and PM emission levels were lower for the B20 engine than those for diesel. After running for 20,000 km and longer, they were higher. However, the deterioration coefficients for these regulated air pollutants were not statistically higher than 1.0, implying that the emission factors do not increase significantly after 80,000 km of driving. Total (gaseous+particulate phase) PAH emission levels for both B20 and diesel decreased as the driving mileage accumulated. However, for the engine using B20 fuel, particulate PAH emissions increased as engine mileage increased. The average total PAH emission factors were 1097 and 1437 μg bhp h-1 for B20 and diesel, respectively. For B20, the benzo[a]pyrene equivalence emission factors were 0.77, 0.24, 0.20, 7.48, 5.43 and 14.1 μg bhp h-1 for 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-ringed and total PAHs.

We determined the major pools of SOC in four sites representing major forest types in China: temperate forests at Changbai Mountain (CBM) and Qilian Mountain (QLM), and sub-tropical forests at Yujiang (YJ) and Liping (LP) counties. A 90-day laboratory incubation was conducted to measure CO2 evolution from forest soils from each site, and data from the incubation study were fitted to a three-pool first-order model that separated mineralizable soil organic carbon into active (Ca), slow (Cs) and resistant (Cr) carbon pools. Results indicate that: (1) the rate of SOC decomposition in the sub-tropical zone was faster than that in the temperature zone, (2) The Ca pool comprised ∼1-3% of SOC with an average mean residence time (MRT) of 219 days. The Cs pool comprised ∼25-65% with an average MRT of 78 yr. The Cr pool accounted for ∼35-80% of SOC, (3) The YJ site in the sub-tropical zone had the greatest Ca pool and the lowest MRT, while the QLM in the temperature zone had the greatest MRT for both the Ca and Cs pools. The results suggest a higher capacity for long-term C sequestration as SOC in temperature forests than in sub-tropical forests. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The morphologies and structural characteristics of the composites were investigated by FE-SEM, EDS and XRD measurements. It was found that tin exists inside EMCMB in the form of oxidation states (Sn(II) and Sn(IV)) after reduction at lower temperature (below 350 °C), and metallic tin exists both outside EMCMB and between carbon layers after reduction at higher temperature (450 °C). The electrochemical properties of the composites as negative electrode material for lithium-ion batteries were systematically investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests. The results showed that loading amount of tin or tin oxides and reduction temperature had large influences on the reversible capacity and cycle performance of these composites. Among them, the composite reduced at 230 °C with appropriate loading amount of tin oxides not only exhibited the high first reversible gravimetric capacity of 401 mAh g-1 and an excellent cyclability with only 0.2% capacity loss/cycle at lower current density, but also showed a stable cycle performance at higher current density due to its lower resistance. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Depositional systems analysis delineated five types of primary fluvial and lacustrine depositional cycles, which were grouped into three (high, intermediate, and low) orders. Semi-arid, subhumid, and humid climate types in terms of relative precipitation/evaporation ratio were interpreted and climate variability was identified at sub-cycle and high, intermediate, and low-order cycle scales. Early Kungurian climate fluctuated between subhumid to humid and middle-late Kungurian climate shifted gradually from subhumid/semi-arid to semi-arid. Roadian climate fluctuated widely from humid to semi-arid with strong precipitation seasonality at sub-cycle and high-order cycle scales. Wordian climate was dominantly humid with short subhumid intervals and ended with a peak semi-arid condition. Capitanian climate was mainly subhumid to humid, as the start of a long interval of dominantly humid, strongly wet-dry conditions into the Wuchiapingian time. The late Kungurian-Wordian semi-arid condition is incompatible with modern mid-latitude east-coast humid climate, suggesting different mechanisms operating in Pangea and Panthalassa.

The semi-arid region in northeastern China, located on northern margin of eastern Asian summer monsoon, is ideal for investigating the processes and mechanisms of desertification because of its very sensitive ecosystem. Using the Hunshandake Sandy Land of eastern Inner Mongolia, a former dormant dunes and wetlands environment, we monitored the variation of the desertified land and the wetlands in order to assess the climatic and human impacts on the processes of desertification. The research methods included digital image processing of LANDSAT data and ground checks. The remote sensing data from the last three decades show that the wetlands were larger in 1975 and 1992 than in 1989 and 2001. The variation of the extension of mobile dunes is in inverse proportion to that of wetlands. The main process of desertification is the reactivation of dormant sand dunes. The changes of wetlands and desertified lands correlate considerably well with the variations of local precipitation and temperature, suggesting that climate might be the key factor triggering desertification in the Hunshandake. In other sandy lands of China, however, human activities might be the key factor causing desertification and land degradation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this connection, three questions are addressed in this paper:1)How will forestry carbon sequestration land use policies affect regional sustainability prospects in rural China?2)How could carbon sequestration land use plans be better integrated into sustainable development strategies? and3)How can the IA approach assist Chinese government agencies in design effective forestry land use policies? The IA approach was applied in three rural sites of western China. These case studies are described in detail by following articles in this volume.

As a consequence of this, carbonation has become one of the most critical durability issues for concrete structures in urban environment. In this study, the climate scenario IS92a recommended by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is used for evaluating the effect of CO2 concentration on carbonation of concrete. A modified mathematical equation, based on Fick's 1st law of diffusion, is used to evaluate CO2 diffusion coefficient of concrete. The required cover depth of concrete is estimated by using the applicative methods of reliability and stochastic concepts to take microclimatic conditions into consideration. The tolerance of cover depth should be considered in order to prevent carbonation-induced corrosion. From the relationship between the weight loss of reinforcement and corrosion current density for a given time, the tolerance of cover depth to prevent carbonation-induced corrosion is suggested. It was observed that corrosion occurs when the distance between carbonation front and reinforcement bar surface (the uncarbonated depth) is &lt;5 mm. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This first step leads to a stochastic differential equations model that describes trends in carbon dioxide emissions on the basis of economic and demographic dynamics. As an example, we estimate the model parameters for the United States. We then use this framework to build a model for the assessment of the economic costs related to a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions for a country committed to respect an international agreement, such as the Kyoto protocol. In particular, we show that the adherence to an environmental treaty may be traced back to a problem of cost valuation and to a decision under risk.

To secure the contribution of renewables in the future energy supply, practical dynamic optimization strategies for CO2 conversion into methanol in a heterogeneous reactor are proposed. The conversion provides a solution to the problem of carbon dioxide emissions reduction and at the same time produces a readily storable and transportable fuel. The dynamic optimization is carried out on an industrial scale methanol reactor and considers shell temperature and inlet hydrogen mole fraction, separately and simultaneously, as optimization variables. The optimizations have been carried out in both steady- and unsteady-state modes. A heterogeneous model of the reactor has been used to obtain accurate optimization results. In the dynamic mode, a stagewise optimization for 4 years of reactor operation has been considered. The methanol production rate (MPR) has been selected as the objective function to find optimal profiles. In the steady-state case, the optimal input mole fractions of CO, CO2, and H2 have been investigated. The calculated concentration profiles are realistic and appropriate for the application of an industrial methanol reactor. The staged optimization suggests a new guideline for operating the reactor. For the optimization of input mole fractions, it was indirectly concluded that CO2 concentration adversely affects the overall process as compared to catalyst poisoning due to the presence of CO. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Gas emissions; Methanol; Optimization; Dynamic optimization; Emission reduction; Heterogeneous reactor; Methanol production rate; Energy conversion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348936067

Presently, it is uncertain how increasing atmospheric CO2 and O3 will alter plant N demand and the acquisition of soil N by plants as well as the microbial supply of N from soil organic matter. To address this uncertainty, we initiated an ecosystem-level 15N tracer experiment at the Rhinelander (Wisconsin, USA) free air CO2-O3 enrichment (FACE) facility to understand how projected increases in atmospheric CO2 and O3 alter the distribution and flow of N in developing northern temperate forests. Tracer amounts of 15NH4+ were applied to the forest floor of developing Populus tremuloides and P. tremuloides-Betula papyrifera communities that have been exposed to factorial CO2 and O3 treatments for seven years. One year after isotope addition, both forest communities exposed to elevated CO2 obtained greater amounts of 15N (29%) and N (40%) from soil, despite no change in soil N availability or plant N-use efficiency. As such, elevated CO2 increased the ability of plants to exploit soil for N, through the development of a larger root system. Conversely, elevated O3 decreased the amount of 15N (-15%) and N (-29%) in both communities, a response resulting from lower rates of photosynthesis, decreases in growth, and smaller root systems that acquired less soil N. Neither CO2 nor O3 altered the amount of N or 15N recovery in the forest floor, microbial biomass, or soil organic matter. Moreover, we observed no interaction between CO2 and O3 on the amount of N or 15N in any ecosystem pool, suggesting that O3 could exert a negative effect regardless of CO2 concentration. In a CO 2-enriched atmosphere, greater belowground growth and a more thorough exploitation of soil for growth-limiting N is an important mechanism sustaining the enhancement of NPP in developing forests (0-8 years following establishment). However, as CO2 accumulates in the Earth's atmosphere, future O3 concentrations threaten to diminish the enhancement of plant growth, decrease plant N acquisition, and lessen the storage of anthropogenic C in temperate forests. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","15N; Atmospheric CO2; Atmospheric O3; Betula papyrifera; Forest floor; Microbial immobilization; N cycling; Plant N uptake; Populus tremuloides; Root system size; Soil organic matter; Wisconsin, USA, developing forest","anthropogenic source; carbon dioxide; deciduous tree; forest ecosystem; forest floor; microbial activity; net primary production; nitrogen isotope; ozone; soil nutrient; soil organic matter; temperate forest; North America; Rhinelander; United States; Wisconsin; Betula papyrifera; Populus tremuloides; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; ozone; article; aspen; biomass; drug effect; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; plant root; soil; standard; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Isotopes; Ozone; Plant Roots; Populus; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34948839887

In addition to annual mean temperature and precipitation, as in the Miami Model, we chose more ecologically relevant climatic variables including growing degree-days, a soil moisture stress index, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).

With the development of computationally efficient reduced chemical kinetic models, the smaller number of scalar variables to be integrated can lead to a significant reduction in the computational time required for the simulation with limited loss of accuracy in the results. A general MATLAB-based automated procedure for the development of reduced reaction models is presented. Based on the application of the quasi-steady-state (QSS) approximation for certain chemical species and on the elimination of selected fast elementary reactions, any complex starting reaction mechanism (detailed or skeletal) can be reduced with minimal human intervention. A key feature of the reduction procedure is the decoupling of the QSS species appearing in the QSS algebraic relations, enabling the explicit solution of the QSS species concentrations, which are needed for the evaluation of the elementary reaction rates. In contrast, previous approaches mainly relied on an implicit solution, requiring computationally intensive inner iterations. The automated procedure is first tested with the generation of an implicit 5-step reduced reaction model for CH4/air flame propagation. Next, two explicit robust reduced reaction models based on ignition data (18-step) and on flame propagation data (15-step) are systematically developed and extensively validated for ignition delay time, flame propagation, and extinction predictions of C2H4/air, CH4/air, and H2/air systems over a wide range of equivalence ratios, initial temperatures, pressures, and strain rates. In order to assess the computational advantages of the explicit reduced reaction models, comparisons of the computational time required to evaluate the chemical source terms as well as for the integration of unsteady nonpremixed flames for each model are also presented. © 2007 The Combustion Institute.","Chemical kinetics; Ethylene; Explicit solution; Reduced reaction mechanism; Steady-state approximation","Approximation theory; Concentration (process); Ethylene; Mathematical models; MATLAB; Reaction kinetics; Reduced reaction mechanism; Steady-state approximation; Unsteady flow; ethylene; hydrogen; methane; Approximation theory; Concentration (process); Ethylene; Mathematical models; MATLAB; Reaction kinetics; Unsteady flow; air; air temperature; article; atmospheric pressure; chemical reaction; evaluation; mathematical model; mathematics; priority journal; reaction analysis; reduction kinetics; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249943287

Some of the simulations have been conducted with realistic analysis data, considering two heavy-precipitation cases that occurred in July and August 2005. Both cases were related to cyclonic northeasterly flow and exhibited a small-scale precipitation distribution differing substantially from the climatological mean. Most notably, a station lying on the southwestern flank of a major mountain massif recorded precipitation amounts far exceeding all surrounding stations in both cases, although its precipitation climatology does not show outstanding values. Despite some quantitative differences, all real-case simulations exhibit a precipitation pattern consistent with the observed one. They indicate that the small-scale precipitation variability, including the unusual local maximum, was dominated by the classical seeder-feeder mechanism combined with downstream drift of the precipitation hydrometeors. In addition, a large number of semi-idealized simulations have been performed, combining realistic topography with synthetic large-scale flow conditions. Their main purpose is a systematic investigation of the factors controlling the structure and amplitude of the small-scale precipitation variability. It is found that the ambient wind direction has the largest impact on the small-scale precipitation patterns. Selecting a 700 hPa wind direction that differs by about 60° from the actual one yields a precipitation pattern that is completely uncorrelated with the observed data. The pattern correlation with the observed data is also degraded when the ambient wind speed is moved away from its real value, but the impact is not as large as for the wind direction. A less systematic impact is found for temperature, or freezing level, but the most realistic precipitation pattern is still obtained when the specified values approximately match those observed in the real cases. Interestingly, when choosing large-scale flow conditions that approximately match the real ones, the pattern, correlation with the observed rain-gauge data becomes in both cases at least as high as for the best real-case simulation.

Little is known, however, about the interactive effects of irradiance and temperature on leaf R. We investigated whether growth irradiance affects the temperature response of leaf R in darkness (Rdark) and in light (R light) in seedlings of a broad-leaved evergreen species, Quercus ilex. Two hypotheses concerning Rdark were tested: (1) the Q 10 (i.e. the proportional increase in R per 10°C rise in temperature) of leaf Rdark is lower in shaded plants than in high-light-grown plants, and (2) shade-grown plants exhibit a lower degree of thermal acclimation of Rdark than plants exposed to higher growth irradiance. We also assessed whether light inhibition of Rlight differs between leaves exposed to contrasting temperatures and growth irradiances, and whether the degree of thermal acclimation of Rlight is dependent on growth irradiance. We showed that while growth irradiance did impact on photosynthesis, it had no effect on the Q10 of leaf R dark. Growth irradiance had little impact on thermal acclimation when fully expanded, pre-existing leaves were exposed to contrasting temperatures for several weeks. When Rlight was measured at a common irradiance, Rlight/Rdark ratios were higher in shaded plants due to homeostasis of Rlight between growth irradiance treatments and to the lower Rdark in shaded leaves. We also showed that Rlight does not acclimate to the same degree as Rdark, and that R light/Rdark decreases with increasing measuring and growth temperatures, irrespective of the growth irradiance. Collectively, we raised the possibility that predictive carbon cycle models can assume that growth irradiance and photosynthesis do not affect the temperature sensitivity of leaf Rdark of long-lived evergreen leaves, thus simplifying incorporation of leaf R into such models. © 2007 The Authors.","Acclimation; Plant respiration; Q10; Quercus ilex; Shade","acclimation; broad-leaved forest; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate change; concentration (composition); evergreen forest; growth rate; homeostasis; irradiance; Mediterranean environment; photosynthesis; physiological response; respiration; temperature profile; acclimatization; article; cell respiration; light; metabolism; microclimate; oak; photosynthesis; plant leaf; radiation exposure; Southern Europe; temperature; time; Acclimatization; Cell Respiration; Environment, Controlled; Light; Mediterranean Region; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Quercus; Temperature; Time Factors; Ilex; Quercus ilex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249796986

Since the problem having been considered at different spatial scales, it is recognised that the competing concepts of equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics need to be integrated. The present study assesses grazing influence in Mongolia's arid desert steppe at three spatial scale levels. At the landscape level, the investigation focused on the impact of grazing on vegetation-determining ecological factors and on the occurrence of grazing-mediated plant communities. At the community level, the total number of species, the total vegetation cover, the percentage of annual species, the cover of annual species, and the soil nutrient properties were assessed along gradients of grazing intensity. At the population level, the total number and weight of plants per plot, individual plant weight and the proportion of flowering plants of the dwarf semishrub Artemisia xerophytica were recorded along gradients of grazing intensity. The results show that grazing influence increases with decreasing spatial scale. At the landscape level, no grazing influence could be identified. At the community level, different vegetation parameters respond to grazing in different ways, and the responses of the same parameters vary between plant communities. At the population level, the results clearly reflect the grazing gradient in the way predicted by the equilibrium model. The study demonstrates that even arid desert steppes display equilibrial and non-equilibrial properties, depending on the observational scale.

Reporter gene assays revealed that only XRE4, XRE7, and XRE8 contributed to maximal TCDD-mediated induction of luciferase and that the contribution of each XRE to maximal induction was not equal. XRE4 and XRE7 were capable of functioning independently, while XRE8 alone could not support TCDD-mediated induction but was required for the ability of XRE4 and XRE7 to support maximal induction. These results were observed in cell lines derived from human, mouse and zebrafish. Mutagenesis of 3′ nucleotides flanking the non-functional XRE5, and functional XRE4 did not alter the function of these XREs in cell culture. In silico analyses revealed the presence of putative Sp1, AP2, CREB, and two HNF-3 transcription factor binding sites that were localized to common positions within the enhancer region of both the mouse and zebrafish CYP1A genes. In vitro mutagenesis of the binding sites showed that loss of the Sp1 or AP2 sites had minimal impact on TCDD-mediated gene induction while loss of the putative CREB site resulted in a modest decrease in basal and inducible activity and mutation of the HNF-3 reduced inducible activity by >90% of controls. Collectively, these findings suggest that the presence of XREs is not the sole determinant for regulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-mediated gene and do not function in an additive manner. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

University, Lubbock, TX 79409, United States","Certain plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), in the absence of physical contact with a plant stimulate growth via volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, through largely unknown mechanisms. To probe how PGPR VOCs trigger growth in plants, RNA transcript levels of Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to Bacillus subtilus (strain GB03) were examined using oligonucleotide microarrays. In screening over 26,000 protein-coded transcripts, a group of approximately 600 differentially expressed genes related to cell wall modifications, primary and secondary metabolism, stress responses, hormone regulation and other expressed proteins were identified. Transcriptional and histochemical data indicate that VOCs from the PGPR strain GB03 trigger growth promotion in Arabidopsis by regulating auxin homeostasis. Specifically, gene expression for auxin synthesis was up regulated in aerial regions of GB03-exposed plants; auxin accumulation decreased in leaves and increased in roots with GB03 exposure as revealed in a transgenic DR5::GUS Arabidopsis line, suggesting activation of basipetal auxin transport. Application of the auxin transport inhibitor 1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) restricted auxin accumulation to sites of synthesis thereby preventing GB03-mediated decreases in shoot auxin levels as well as thwarting GB03-mediated growth promotion. In addition, microarray data revealed coordinated regulation of cell wall loosening enzymes that implicated cell expansion with GB03 exposure, which was confirmed by comparative cytological measurements. The discovery that bacterial VOCs, devoid of auxin or other known plant hormones regulate auxin homeostasis and cell expansion provides a new paradigm as to how rhizobacteria promote plant growth. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Auxin transport; Bacillus subtilus GB03; Cell expansion; Plant growth promotion; Rhizobacterial signaling; Transcriptional profiling","indoleacetic acid derivative; Arabidopsis; article; Bacillus subtilis; cell enlargement; cell wall; gene expression regulation; growth, development and aging; homeostasis; metabolism; physiology; plant leaf; volatilization; Arabidopsis; Bacillus subtilis; Cell Enlargement; Cell Wall; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Homeostasis; Indoleacetic Acids; Plant Leaves; Volatilization; Arabidopsis; Bacillus (bacterium); Bacteria (microorganisms); Rhizobiales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548030184

Dynamically downscaled output from a regional atmospheric model, driven by global atmospheric reanalysis, is used to force a precipitation-temperature-area-altitude (PTAA) glacier mass balance model with daily maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation. The modeling system is verified by hindcasting the mass balances of Gulkana Glacier, a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) benchmark glacier in the Alaska Range, U.S.A., during a ten-year period from October 1994 to September 2004. The mass balances simulated with the atmosphere/glacier modeling system are comparable to the USGS measurements, and are also in good agreement with the meteorological station observation-forced PTAA simulations. The results suggest this is a promising approach for realistic estimation of the future mass balances of the glaciers of northwestern North America.

Industrial processes are the major sources of particles over all three size ranges, but residential biofuel use and transportation sources become increasingly important for PM10 and PM2.5. The industrialized coastal provinces, such as Shandong, Jiangsu and Hebei, are the major sources of particulate emissions. The industrialized and developing regions show different characteristic emission ratios of PM2.5/TSP, (BC+OC)/PM2.5 and (Ca+Mg)/TSP.

The conversions in this extensive semiarid region have produced adverse ecological consequences at local and regional scales (e.g., dust storms). An important research need is to understand the fundamental ecosystem processes, such as energy and material fluxes, associated with the land conversions. The carbon fluxes, including net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (RE), and gross primary production (GPP) in two contrasting land-use settings - a typical steppe and a crop field in Inner Mongolia - were measured in the growing season (May-September) of 2005 by deploying two eddy covariance flux towers. The diel amplitude of carbon fluxes varied substantially within the growing season, with the largest diel changes occurring in July. The daily maximum NEE of the two ecosystems occurred before noon, while maximum RE occurred around 16:00 pm. There was no difference in RE between the cropland and the steppe at night. Daytime RE in the steppe was higher than that in the cropland in July and August, but slightly lower in other months. GPP was similar between the two ecosystems, in June, but much higher in the cropland than in the steppe in July. The steppe was converted from a weak carbon sink in May to a weak source or carbon neutral in June because of the relatively low soil volumetric water content (VWC) and the relatively high temperature. With higher GPP and lower RE, the cropland ecosystem acted as a stronger sink in July than the steppe. Temperature and soil water content were the main factors controlling NEE in this semiarid agriculture-pasture transition region. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Jinan in northern China, with a temperate climate, and Baoan in southern China, with a subtropical climate were chosen as study areas. Spearman correlations and seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models were used to quantify the association between meteorological variables and dysentery. The Hockey Stick model was used to explore the threshold of the effect of temperatures. Results: Maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall, relative humidity and air pressure were significantly correlated with the incidence of dysentery in the both cities, with lag effects varying from zero to two months. In the SARIMA models, maximum and minimum temperatures were significantly associated with dysentery transmission. The thresholds for the effects of maximum and minimum temperatures were 17 °C and 8 °C, respectively, in the northern city. No thresholds were detected in the southern city. Conclusions: Climate variations have different impacts on the transmission of bacillary dysentery in temperate and subtropical cities in China.

M5S 1A4, Canada","We examined life cycle environmental and economic implications of two near-term scenarios for converting cellulosic biomass to energy, generating electricity from cofiring biomass in existing coal power plants, and producing ethanol from biomass in stand-alone facilities in Ontario, Canada. The study inventories near-term biomass supply in the province, quantifies environmental metrics associated with the use of agricultural residues for producing electricity and ethanol, determines the incremental costs of switching from fossil fuels to biomass, and compares the cost-effectiveness of greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions abatement achieved through the use of the bioenergy. Implementing a biomass cofiring rate of 10% in existing coal-fired power plants would reduce annual GHG emissions by 2.3 million metric tons (t) of CO2 equivalent (7% of the province's coal power plant emissions). The substitution of gasoline with ethanol/gasoline blends would reduce annual provincial light-duty vehicle fleet emissions between 1.3 and 2.5 million t of CO2 equivalent (3.5-7% of fleet emissions). If biomass sources other than agricultural residues were used, additional emissions reductions could be realized. At current crude oil prices ($70/barrel) and levels of technology development of the bioenergy alternatives, the biomass electricity cofiring scenario analyzed is more cost-effective for mitigating GHG emissions ($22/t of CO2 equivalent for a 10% cofiring rate) than the stand-alone ethanol production scenario ($92/t of CO2 equivalent). The economics of biomass cofiring benefits from existing capital, whereas the cellulosic ethanol scenario does not. Notwithstanding this result, there are several factors that increase the attractiveness of ethanol. These include uncertainty in crude oil prices, potential for marked improvements in cellulosic ethanol technology and economics, the province's commitment to 5% ethanol content in gasoline, the possibility of ethanol production benefiting from existing capital, and there being few alternatives for moderate-to-large- scale GHG emissions reductions in the transportation sector.

However, reconstructions of long-term rainfall histories are scarce because of the lack of reliable proxies. Here we document that iron oxide minerals, specifically the ratio of hematite to goethite (Hm/Gt), is a reasonable precipitation proxy. Using diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry, we measured samples from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) 1143 drilling site (9°21.72′N, 113°17.11′E, 2777 m water depth) for hematite and goethite, whose formation processes are favored by opposing climate conditions. In order to determine the content of hematite and goethite we produced a set of calibration samples by removing the iron oxides to generate the natural matrix to which hematite and goethite in known percentages were added. From these calibration samples we developed a transfer function for determining hematite and goethite concentration from a sample's spectral reflectance. Applying this method to ODP 1143 sediments (top 34 m of a 510 m core with sampling interval of 10 cm) we were able to reconstruct a continuous precipitation history for SE Asia of the past 600 kyr using the Hm/Gt ratio as a proxy of the precipitation variability of Asian monsoon. The reliability of this Hm/Gt proxy is corroborated by its consistency with the stalagmite δ18O data from South China. Comparing long-term Hm/Gt records with the surface temperature gradient of equatorial Pacific Ocean, we found that monsoon precipitation and El Niño are correlated for the last 600 kyr.

While it is unavoidable that China will take on commitments at some specific point of time in the future, this paper has argued that the proposal for joint accession by the U.S. and China is not a way forward. For various reasons, such a proposal is in the U.S. interest, but is not in the interest of China. Given the U.S. political reality and institutional settings on the one hand and China's over-riding concern about economic growth and poverty reduction on the other, the two countries are unlikely to take on emissions caps under an international regime, at least for the time being. Therefore, we need to explore the area where cooperation between the two countries to address climate change seems best. The research, development and deployment of clean technology is the area that is in the best interests of the two countries. The U.S. has adopted a technology-oriented approach to climate issues, and has launched the four multilateral initiatives on technology cooperation and the Asia Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate (APP). China has participated in all these U.S.-led initiatives, and is a partner to the APP. Strengthened technology cooperation between the two countries through these initiatives and the APP has led some tangible benefits. However, it should be pointed out that while technology is a critical ingredient in a climate policy package, efforts such as the APP can only be part of the solution. They alone cannot ensure that best available technologies are always deployed in the marketplace, and that new technologies will roll out at the pace and on the scale that we need. In order to have such technology-oriented approach to play a full role, we do need a coordinated policy framework agreed via the Kyoto Protocol or a follow-up regime or the parent United Nations Framework Convention. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Coastal areas are ideal sites for the application of seawater-source heat pump technology (SWHP) to provide district cooling and heating. The technical requirements and the scheme design in the context of marine climate are discussed. A government-commissioned feasibility study of a proposed district energy site in Dalian, with an estimated 68 MW heating load and 76 MW cooling load plant capacity is then described. The economic, energy and environmental impacts are analyzed. In order to get a better understanding of economic justification and benefits of two different systems, annual cost (AC) and net present value (NPV), are used. A series of sensitivity analyses are undertaken to investigate the magnitude of the effect of the parameters variation on cost calculation. The numerical simulations of seawater temperature field are performed by using a two-dimensional convection-diffusion equation model to evaluate environmental impacts. Study indicates that Dalian has great potential for applying SWHP system.

Our previous research showed that application of thiosulfate fertilizers at the soil surface may offer an effective and economical approach to reduce the emission of halogenated fumigants via a chemical remediation process. In this fumigant emission-reduction strategy, volatile 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) reacts with thiosulfate to generate a nonvolatile Bunte salt (thiosulfate derivative of 1,3-D). However, the decomposition of the Bunte salt may be associated with the production of perceptible odors. This study investigated the stability of this reaction product in different environmental media. Hydrolysis experiments demonstrated that the thiosulfate derivative was relatively stable in neutral and moderately acidic aqueous solutions. In contrast, the thiosulfate derivative was readily converted to a dialkyl disulfide via a base hydrolysis process in pH 10 buffer solution. In a strongly acidic solution, a mercaptan and a dialkyl disulfide compound were detected as two primary hydrolysis products. In soil, this initial reaction product underwent a series of biotic conversions to generate several volatile or semivolatile organic sulfur compounds. The formation and distribution of four volatile/semivolatile products in the air and soil were detected in different soils treated with the thiosulfate derivative of 1,3-D. This study indicated that odors occurring in soil treated with halogenated fumigants and thiosulfate fertilizers might arise from the generation and release of these and other volatile/semivolatile organic sulfur products. The environmental fate and effects of such volatile/semivolatile sulfur compounds should be considered in the application of sulfur-containing fertilizers in fumigated fields. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,"Fertilizers; Fumigation; Hydrolysis; Particulate emissions; pH effects; Solutions; Biotic conversions; Chemical remediation; Dichloropropene; Thiosulfate; Soil pollution control; buffer; disulfide; organosulfur derivative; thiol; thiosulfate; volatile agent; Fertilizers; Fumigation; Hydrolysis; Particulate emissions; pH effects; Soil pollution control; Solutions; anion; chemical compound; environmental fate; fertilizer application; fumigant; hydrolysis; remediation; volatile substance; aqueous solution; article; chemical reaction; hydrolysis; incubation temperature; pH; soil fumigation; Allyl Compounds; Insecticides; Models, Chemical; Molecular Structure; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Thiosulfates; Volatilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548802935

The former four kinds of stratification, whose maximal local equivalence ratios locate between the cylinder center and half of the cylinder radius, advance ignition timing, reduce the pressurerise rate, and retard combustion phasing. But the following three kinds of stratification, whose maximal local equivalence ratios appear between half of the cylinder radius and the cylinder wall, have little effect on the cylinder pressure.

Methane emission from enteric fermentation is estimated to have increased from 3.04 Tg in 1949 to 10.13 Tg in 2003, an averaged annual growth rate of 2.2%, and methane emission from manure management has increased from 0.16 Tg in 1949 to 1.06 Tg in 2003, an annual growth rate of 3.5%, while nitrous oxide emission from manure management has increased from 47.76 to 241.2 Gg in 2003, with an annual growth rate of 3.0%.

Afforestation and reforestation are promoted worldwide as an effective means of sequestering carbon. For its national interest and global concerns, China has made great efforts to protect its existing forests and develop programs of afforestation and reforestation. Based on two surveys recently conducted in Liping County, Guizhou province, this paper investigates the economic changes associated with the implementation of the ""Grain For Green"" policy. Based on the analytical framework of benefit cost analysis, this paper concludes that the implementation of the reforestation of sloping agricultural land policy would not be possible if there were no government subsidies for the peasants. The short term economic returns of land and labour from forestation are substantially lower than those generated from grain or cash crop production on the steep slope lands. The government subsidies provide great economic incentives for peasants to take part in the project. The subsidies in fact have elevated peasant income in rural Liping. The estimated potential economic returns of plantations over the long run indicate that the removal of the government financial subsidies would not create an economic crisis for the peasants if the current market conditions continue. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

An evaluation of the effectiveness of these measures may provide guidance for future vehicle emission control strategy development. In-use emissions from light-duty gasoline vehicles (LDGVs) were investigated at five sites in Beijing with remote sensing instrumentation. Distance-based mass emission factors were derived with fuel consumption modeled on real world data. The results show that the recently implemented aggressive control strategies are significantly reducing the emissions of on-road vehicles. Older vehicles are contributing substantially to the total fleet emissions. An earlier program to retrofit pre-Euro cars with three-way catalysts produced little emission reduction. The impact of model year and driving conditions on the average mass emission factors indicates that the durability of vehicles emission controls may be inadequate in Beijing.

It is found that the changes in low cloud amount associated with the 1997-1998 El Niño and the doubled CO2 induced climate change have different characteristics and are controlled by different physical processes. Most reduction in low cloud amount related to the 1997-1998 El Niño occurs in the eastern tropical Pacific associated with an upward large-scale motion and a weak atmospheric stability measured by the 500 hPa vertical velocity and the potential temperature difference between 700 hPa and the surface, and is negatively correlated to the local, SST anomaly. In addition to the other mechanisms suggested by the previous studies, our analyses based on the ISCCP observations indicate that the change in atmospheric convective activities in these regions is one of the reasons responsible for the change in low cloud amount. In contrast, most increase in low cloud amount due to doubled CO2 simulated by the NCAR and GFDL models occurs in the subtropical subsidence regimes associated with a strong atmospheric stability, and is closely related to the spatial change pattern of SST consistent with previous studies. The increase in low cloud amount appears to favor the location where SST is less increased. After removing the background mean SST increase due to doubled CO2, the results show a clear negative correlation between the change in low cloud and the SST change. An analysis based on the simple atmospheric mixed layer model demonstrates a thermodynamic reason for such a change. The increase in the above-inversion atmospheric stratification due to doubled CO2 tends to reduce the mixed layer depth in the areas with a small temperature increase, which helps to trap the moisture within the mixed layer, thus, favors low cloud formation.

(2) NPP increased by 24.2%, i.e. 0.76 petagram of carbon (Pg C) over 18 years in China. Changes in climate (with constant vegetation) directly contributed nearly 11.5% (0.36 Pg C). Changes in vegetation (with constant climate) contributed 12.4% (0.40 Pg C), possibly as a result of climate-vegetation feedbacks, changes in land use, and growth stimulation from other mechanisms. (3) Globally, NPP declined during all three major El Niño events (1982 to 1983, 1987 to 1988, and 1997 to 1998) between 1982 and 2000, but Chinese vegetation productivity responded differently to them because of the monsoon dynamics. In the first three events (1982 to 1983, 1987 to 1988, and 1992), Chinese vegetation NPP declined, while in the later two events (1993, 1997 to 1998) increasing obviously. © 2007 Science in China Press.","China; Climatic change; NDVI; Net primary productivity; Remote sensing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36849003982

The Late Permian coals are characterized by relatively high amount of sulphide, sulphate and carbonate minerals and by a high total content of trace elements (with respect to the Late Triassic coals) due to the marine influence on the depositional environment. The Late Permian Chongqing and the southeastern Hubei coals showed similar geochemistry and mineralogy. However, there were some differences due to the different source rock and magmatic influence on Hubei coals. The concentrations of most trace elements in the Late Triassic coal were relatively low when compared with the usual range of the worldwide concentrations. By contrast, the contents of Ta, Se, Nb, Sc, Hf, Tl, Bi, Cu, V and Zn in the Late Permian Chongqing and Southeastern Hubei coals were higher than the usual range. Differences in occurrence of major and trace elements were found between Late Permian Hubei and Chongqing coals. Thus, most of the trace elements investigated presented an aluminosilicate association, followed by sulphide-arsenide (Fe, S, As, Pb, Mo, Ni and Co, in most cases) and carbonate (Ca and Mg) affinities in both areas. However, there was an important phosphate and zircon association in the Chongqing coal, whereas the carbonate association was significantly influenced by magma in the coals from Hubei. In the Late Triassic coal most of the major and trace elements investigated occur in aluminosilicate associations, with the exception of S, Fe, Ca, Mn, Sr, Sn, Ba, Nb, Mo, Mg, Co and Ta, with carbonate, sulphate and sulphide affinities. © 2006.","China; Coal quality; Permian; Trace elements; Triassic","Coal quality; Magmatic influence; Source rock; Coal mines; Geochemistry; Mineralogy; Trace elements; Coal deposits; aluminosilicate; chemical composition; coal; coal mining; geochemistry; magma; mineralogy; Permian; source rock; trace element; Triassic; zircon; Asia; China; Chongqing; Eurasia; Far East; Hubei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247611803

Radioactive beams of 18Fg.s. and 18Fm nuclei were produced by nucleon transfer on a carbon production target and delivered to a secondary 197Au target for Coulomb excitation. Photons emitted in the vicinity of the 197Au target were detected in a large-solid-angle position-sensitive NaI(Tl) array, which allowed for the identification of the beam and target excited states populated by intermediate-energy Coulomb excitation. Two possible 18F ground-state excitations were identified, and B(Eλ↑) values were deduced. Upper limits were established for reduced transition probabilities B(E1↑) and B(E2↑) of several predicted transitions from the 18Fm isomeric state, 5+→4+, 4-, 3+, and compared with values inferred from γ-decay lifetimes. An indication of an enhanced in-flight isomer decay, possibly due to the Coulomb interaction with the target is observed and discussed.

For a small family car, the equivalent figures are 58 and 62%, thus a focus on diesel formulation and car propulsion would be more effective. In the US, a further 10 states have followed California in developing fuel economy standards that will cover some 35% of the country's total population. The FIA favors a progressive, upward convergence of car fuel efficiency standards at a global level and backs the development of a global fuel economy standard via the UN Economic Commission for Europe's World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations.
