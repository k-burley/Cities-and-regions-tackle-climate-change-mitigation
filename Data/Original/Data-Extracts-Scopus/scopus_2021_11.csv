In this study, we first updated the status of Costa Rican treefrogs and found that a total of 38% of treefrog species are threatened according to the most recent IUCN assessment in 2019. Additionally, 21% of Costa Rican treefrog species have a high vulnerability to extinction according to environmental vulnerability scores. Then, we predicted the historical climatic suitability of eight target species that we expected to have exhibited changes in their ranges in the last 20 years. We assessed the location of new occurrence records since 2000 to identify recovery, range expansion, or previously underestimated ranges due to methodological limitations. We also estimated the area of each species’ suitable habitat with two metrics: extent of suitable habitat (ESH) and area of minimum convex polygon (AMCP). Six declined species exhibited recovery (i.e., new occurrences across historical range after 2000), with the widest recovery found in Agalychnis annae. We also found that Isthmohyla pseudopuma appears to have spread after the decline of sympatric species and that the range of I. sukia was originally underestimated due to inadequate detection. We found that the ESH was 32–49% smaller than the AMCP for species that are slowly recovering; however, the ESH is similar or greater than the AMCP for species that are recovering in most of their ranges, as well as rare species with widespread ranges. Results of this work can be used to evaluate the risk of environmental threats and prioritize regions for conservation purposes. © 2021 by the authors.

In this case, a NOx concentration of 119 mg/m3 has been reached only by using new burner devices. It has been demonstrated that the applicable environmental legislation contains a set of measures having a considerable effect on the current and planned business activities of the thermal power industry and power machine building enterprises. A brief description of the boiler is presented. Challenging issues of its operation are considered, and the operating and investment expenditures are analyzed. The thermal design of the boiler is assessed. The available burner devices with ultralow emissions are considered, and their best option has been selected. It has been demonstrated that successful implementation of the project requires special engineering activities to be performed before replacing the burners in the boilers to optimize the design and parameters of the air path. To construct a model of the air path, on-site studies of the air ducts of the TPE-430 boiler were carried out. On the basis of the obtained data, a physical model of the air path was made of plexiglass air. It was blown with cold air whose flow was visualized using helium soap microbubbles. The results of the physical simulation were used to arrange the annular ducts from the manifold to the new burners and to determine location and size of structural members to be installed in air ducts and burner boxes to achieve the required uniformity of the air flow. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","boiler; burners; combustion chamber; ecology; flue gases; fuel; nitrogen oxides; physical model; production localization; reconstruction; standard emissions; thermal design calculations","Boilers; Flue gases; Gas emissions; Investments; Nitrogen oxides; Air ducts; Air paths; Design calculations; Localisation; Physical modelling; Production localization; Reconstruction; Standard emission; Thermal design calculation; Thermal designs; Combustion chambers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118723400

In this study, based on dust simulations from seven Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models, the spatial and temporal changes in dust activity over East Asia under a Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 global warming scenario were examined for the periods of 2016–2035 (P1), 2046–2065 (P2) and 2080–2099 (P3). The results show that the multimodel ensemble mean (MME) of the CMIP5 models largely captures the spatial distribution of dust emissions and dust optical depth (DOD) over East Asia during 1986–2005 (P0). The MME reproduces the increasing trend in dust emissions and DOD over dust sources in East Asia during P0. Accompanying emission reductions during P1 to P3, the DOD simultaneously decreases, and the evident DOD decline can also be found over downwind areas in eastern China and the Korean Peninsula. Simulations project increases in precipitation and the LAI (leaf area index). Simultaneously, the weakened East Asian trough leads to anomalous southerly winds and lower wind speeds at the surface. All these results indicate unfavorable conditions for dust emissions over the sources regions, resulting in a decreased DOD over East Asia during P1 to P3. © 2021, Korean Meteorological Society and Springer Nature B.V.","CMIP5; Dust activity; East Asia; Future projection",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099644900

Sustainability and quality of life are evolving to demanding actions in urban areas and public authorities have started to buy cleaner, greener vehicles in order to reforming their fleets. This paper presents and analyses a case study of the Traffic Police Division of Attica transition to a new vehicle fleet. It aims to examine how they managed to decrease the inefficiencies of their transport services in terms of both operational and environmental costs by achieving reduced fuel consumption as well as Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. It focuses on the impact on the environment due to the fuel consumption of vehicle fleet by using proper performance indicators (such as l/100 km for fuel consumption, g/km for CO, g/km for CO2). Overall, the performance of reforming the fleet of the Traffic Police Division of Attica is evaluated in terms of fuel consumption and GHG reductions following a proposed approach for estimating emissions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120541986

It has been hypothesized that axial coordination to the Co active site leads to an increase in the Co dz2 orbital energy, which increases the complex's nucleophilicity and facilitates CO2 coordination compared to the parent CoPc complex. The magnitude of the energy increase in the Co dz2 orbital should depend on the σ-donor strength of the axial ligand-a stronger σ-donating ligand (L) will increase the overall CO2RR activity of axially coordinated CoPc(L) and vice versa. To test this, we have studied a series of CoPc(L) complexes where the σ-donor strength of L is varied. We show that CoPc(L) reduces CO2 with an increased activity as the σ-donor ability of L is increased. These observed electrochemical activity trends are correlated with computationally derived CO2 binding energy and charge transfer terms as a function of σ-donor strength. The findings of this study support our hypothesis that the increased CO2RR activity observed upon axial coordination to CoPc is due to the increased energy of the dz2 orbital, and highlight an important design consideration for macrocyclic MN4-based electrocatalysts. © 2021 American Chemical Society","Absolutely localized molecular orbitals; Axial coordination; Charge transfer analysis; CO2 reduction reaction; Cobalt phthalocyanine; Density functional theory; Electrocatalysis; Sigma donor strength","Binding energy; Carbon dioxide; Charge transfer; Cobalt; Cobalt compounds; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Ligands; Molecular orbitals; Reduction; Absolutely localized molecular orbital; Axial coordination; Charge transfer analyse; CO 2 reduction; CO2reduction reaction; Cobalt phthalocyanine; Density-functional-theory; Donor strength; Localized molecular orbitals; Reduction reaction; Sigma donor strength; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118125497

Rock salt limits the infiltration of hydrogen into the storage cavern walls due to its favourable low permeability. However, pressure-driven percolation may create discrete pathways for the fluid and damage the cavern. Depicting this effect accurately in simulations may be crucial for assessing the long-term stability and integrity adequately. By introducing an extension to a deformation-dependent permeability model by Alonso, Olivella and Arnedo (2006) we can capture the non-linear feedback between salt deformation, permeability development and fluid migration using continuum models. Based on a quasi-isotropic arrangement of potential flow paths the model is able to reproduce pressure-driven percolation of hydrofrac experiments on rock salt specimens in terms of breakthrough pressure as well as preferential path orientation and locality.

This study establishes a co-aggregation index to explore spatio-temporal changes of the co-agglomeration between manufacturing and producer services in 30 provinces of China from 2004 to 2019. Furthermore, we use spatial Durbin model to analyze the impact of industrial co-agglomeration on air pollution reduction. We find that (1) the co-agglomeration index varies remarkably at spatio-temporal scale; (2) high co-agglomeration index is mainly distributed in eastern and central China, while low co-agglomeration index is mainly located in the western region; (3) the co-agglomeration index presents a cluster pattern among provinces, with the cluster of high value in eastern China and the cluster of low value in western China; and (4) the co-agglomeration between manufacturing and producer services is proven effetely to reduce air pollution, which is accompanied with spatial spillover effect.

Four sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) with SMFs of 0, 10, 45, and 75 mT were operated continuously for 110 days at 10 °C and the lowest N2O-Gas cumulative emission (5.50 mg N/day) and N2O conversion rate (4.28 %) in 45 mT SMF-SBR verified the existence of the “window” effect. In 45 mT SMF-SBR, nearly all enzymatic activities related to N2O reduction and corresponding functional gene abundances improved significantly. Metagenomic high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that Alicycliphilus denitricans, Paracoccus denitrificans, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Pseudomonas stutzeri, and Dechloromonas aromatica, as species related to N2O reduction, could be separately enriched by applying suitable SMF intensity. Gene functions annotation based on KEGG and CAZy databases indicated that SMF not only accelerated the rate of free ammonia into ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and electrons delivered to the corresponding denitrification reductases, but also enhanced the degradation of complex organic matter into smaller molecules, and thus reducing the production of N2O via nitrifier denitrification and incomplete denitrification pathways at 10 °C. These findings provided a guideline and presented a blueprint of ecophysiology for the future application of magnetic field to the reduction of N2O emission in wastewater treatment plants in the cold region. © 2021","Activated sludge; Enzymatic activity; Functional gene abundance; Gene function annotation; Metagenomic high-throughput sequencing technology; Microbial community structure","bioreactor; emission; enzyme activity; genomics; low temperature; magnetic field; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; pollutant removal; Alicycliphilus; Dechloromonas aromatica; Nitrosomonadales; Paracoccus denitrificans; Pseudomonas stutzeri; Rhodopseudomonas palustris; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; Betaproteobacteria; bioreactor; denitrification; magnetic field; nitrification; Rhodopseudomonas; sewage; temperature; Betaproteobacteria; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Magnetic Fields; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Rhodopseudomonas; Sewage; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111977072

Priority power generation (PPG), as a special type of power in the transitional period, is of great importance to incentivise power generation entities to participate in the market and promote power system reforms. However, the allocation of PPG currently relies excessively on the subjective decisions and experience of staff and lacks scientific basis and reasonable methods. Considering the case of Sichuan Province in China, this study proposed a PPG allocation method for reservoir power stations (RPSs) based on the principles of fairness, justice, and openness. First, RPSs were divided into categories based on the clustering results of many variable indicators that reflect the contribution and cost in aspects such as power generation, flood control, water supply, irrigation, emission reduction, grid peak shaving. Second, the random forest method was adopted to select the key indicators affecting the classification results. Then, the key indicators were weighted to obtain the priority index, and the PPG allocation was performed based on the priority index. Finally, the proposed method was used to allocate the PPG of RPSs in Sichuan in 2019. The results indicated that the allocation method based on the priority index is more conducive to increasing the market participation of RPSs than the original plan. In addition, it can save approximately 73 million yuan in electricity purchase costs for the grid. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Allocation; Cluster analysis; Priority power generation; Random forest; Reservoir power stations","Cluster analysis; Commerce; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Flood control; Reservoirs (water); Water supply; Allocation; Allocation methods; Competitive markets; Key indicator; Power; Power station; Power- generations; Priority power generation; Random forests; Reservoir power station; Decision trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115760404

The elucidation of NO3− formation pathways and sources would be very helpful for accurately modeling and controlling the particle pollution. In this study, the dual isotopic compositions (δ15N and δ18O) of size-segregated NO3− aerosols were measured at an urban site of Shanghai in the winter of 2018 and the late summer of 2019. The formation mechanisms and sources of NO3− in five size-modes and different seasons were explored by combining analyses of dual isotopes, ion concentrations, air mass back trajectories and the Bayesian isotopic mixing model. Our results showed that the δ18O-NO3− values in summer (62.1 ± 12.8‰) were generally lower than those in winter (80.1 ± 9.9‰) with the lowest values in Aitken (sub–0.1 μm) and condensation modes (0.1–0.56 μm, 48.6 ± 9.8‰). This suggested that NO2 + ∙OH pathway probably played a significant role in the NO3− formation in summer (56.1 ± 4.8%) especially in Aitken and condensation modes, while N2O5 heterogeneous and NO3 + RH/RSC (hydrocarbons/reduced sulfur compounds) pathways could be critical in winter (55.0 ± 12.6% and 28.3 ± 15.2%, respectively). The isotopic fractionation may play a critical role in the size distribution of δ15N-NO3−. Based on the formation pathways of NO3− and calculated fractionation factors εN, the contribution of major NOx sources to NO3− aerosols in Shanghai was estimated. It was found that diesel engine exhaust contributed to the highest percentages (39.3% and 32.1%) of NO3− aerosols followed by gasoline engine exhaust (30.9%) and coal combustion (29.4%) in summer and winter, respectively. The contribution of coal combustion was almost doubled in winter compared to summer whereas soil emission decreased. Our results suggest that the impact of diesel engine exhaust on particle pollution in eastern Chinese megacities should be emphasized. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Dual isotopes; Formation pathways; Nitrate; Size-segregated; Sources","Atmospheric aerosols; Coal combustion; Condensation; Diesel engines; Isotopes; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur compounds; Urban growth; Diesel engine exhaust; Dual isotope; Formation pathways; Megacities; Nitrate aerosols; Particle pollution; Secondary components; Size-segregated; Source; Urban areas; Nitrates; acetylene; alkene; coal; gasoline; halogenated hydrocarbon; nitrate; nitrogen 15; oxygen 18; volatile organic compound; xylene; aerosol; air mass; coal combustion; diesel engine; isotopic analysis; isotopic composition; megacity; nitrate; sulfur emission; Article; biomass; boundary layer; city; combustion; concentration (parameter); controlled study; diesel engine; fractionation; hydrolysis; photochemistry; seasonal variation; secondary organic aerosol; summer; vapor pressure; winter; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114431233

But the limited quantum yield and low-stability to thermal quenching have inevitably blocked their practical uses. Herein, the compositional adjustments including [Sr2+→Ba2+], [Y3+/La3+/Lu3+→Gd3+] and [Sb5+→Nb5+] equivalent cation substitution are employed. Such simple strategy can efficiently improve emission intensity and thermal stability of (Ba, Sr)2(Gd, La, Y, Lu)(Nb, Ta)O6:Mn4+ solid solution phosphors with double-perovskite structures. The optical change performance has been evaluated by variation in lattice structure and theoretical calculations. X-ray diffraction patterns and Rietveld refinement results reveal that perfect crystalline phase in terms of the same double-perovskite structure of Ba2GdNbO6 with cubic Fm-3 m space group can be formed at a high Y3+/Lu3+-doping (0 ≤ y ≤ 1.0) and Sb5+-doping (0 ≤ z ≤ 0.7) substitution ratio. Simultaneously, the incorporation of Sr2+ and La3+ will only keep the solid solution phase at a low substitution ratio at 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 0.3, respectively. The most significant increase of emission intensity in Sr2+-Lu3+-Sb5+ co-substituted case can reach as high as 291%. Its excellent stability to thermal quenching at LED working temperature is observed and the intensity has been elevated to 148.3%-198.7% across the 423–473 K relative to the unsubstituted sample. A slight wavelength-shift of Mn4+ is monitored in diverse cation-substituted samples and such fact is caused by the doping-induced alteration of Mn4+ local environments, which can be illuminated adequately by Tanabe–Sugano diagram. Based on packaging the composition-optimized phosphor onto a blue LED chip, a proof-of-concept LED device has been afforded. Its electroluminescence spectrum not only matches well with the absorption profiles of natural plants, but also exhibits high stability to different currents, which will be very favorable in the domain of high-power plant growth LEDs. The concept of cation-substitution in guiding design for cultivation purpose will open a new way in related optoelectronic devices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Energy conversion; Perovskite; Stability; Structure","Absorption spectroscopy; Barium compounds; Chemical stability; Convergence of numerical methods; Energy conversion; Gadolinium compounds; Light; Light emission; Light emitting diodes; Manganese compounds; Niobium compounds; Phosphors; Positive ions; Quenching; Rietveld refinement; Solid solutions; Solid state reactions; Structure (composition); Supercomputers; Thermodynamic stability; Cation substitutions; Double perovskite structures; Double perovskites; Emissions intensity; Energy; La$+3+$; Perovskite type; Photophysical studies; Red emissions; Thermal quenching; Perovskite; Barium Compounds; Cations; Light; Manganese Compounds; Phosphors; Quenching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107307655

But the precise supramolecular structure of chlorosome has still not been clearly identified and the simulation of its function with new alternatives will be a real challenge. It has been well accepted that blue and far-red light are responsible for photosynthesis and photomorphogenesis in the process of plant growth. In this work, a series of single-composition LiLa2SbO6 (abbreviated as LLSO): xBi3+, yMg2+, zMn4+ phosphors with double perovskite‐type structure and the evaluation as blue and far-red dual-emission light for plant growth light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been reported via a high-temperature solid-state reaction method. Under near ultraviolet-light (n-UV) excitation at 355 nm, intense blue emission (ranging from 360 to 500 nm, 3P1 → 1S0) from Bi3+ and far-red emission (650–750 nm, 2Eg → 4A2g) from Mn4+ are found in Bi3+-Mn4+ co-activated LLSO phosphors. To further optimize the photophysical properties, smaller Mg2+ has been incorporated into Li + site in Bi3+-doped LLSO phosphor to control blue emission of Bi3+. With the increase of Mg2+ content, an obvious red shift (~15 nm) of Bi3+ emission band has been detected in the blue region, which is almost overlapped with the absorbance of Chlorophyll-B (around 450 nm). Moreover, the photoluminescence (PL) emission intensity and decay lifetime of Bi3+ can be improved by substituting Mg2+ for Li+. These changes should be attributed to the combined effects of the crystal field splitting and the superior lattice rigidity. Finally, the temperature-dependent PL spectra of the composition-optimized phosphor are measured, and the excellent thermal-stable emission (up to 473 K) has been obtained. It has been observed that Bi3+ blue emission and Mn4+ far-red emission exhibit different temperature quenching effect and such phosphor can be considered as an ideal candidate in optical thermometry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Concentration quenching; Luminescence; Organic pigments; Spectral shift","Antennas; Bismuth compounds; Energy transfer; Excited states; High temperature applications; Lanthanum compounds; Light; Light emitting diodes; Lithium compounds; Perovskite; Phosphors; Quenching; Red Shift; Solid state reactions; Blue-emission; Concentration quenching; Li$++$; Light-harvesting; Mg$-2$; Mg$-2$/; Organic pigments; Plant growth; Red emissions; Spectral shift; Luminescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111173861

In view of the current situation, this paper designs a new type of Python-based parameter modeling software for turbine control systems, including the load selection module, data pre-processing module, parameter identification module, and result output module. To solve the problem that the primary frequency regulation parameters of the units operated at the deep peak shaving states change with the load, the software is designed to set key model parameters of different load segments of the units. The actual measurement results of a unit operated at the deep peak shaving state show that this developed software is convenient and friendly to operate, creates accurate parameter identification results, and has a wider range of applicability. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

It is of great practical importance to assess the impacts of climate-induced heat stress on labor productivity and to develop effective adaptation strategies. In this paper, an integrated optimization-based productivity restoration modeling framework is proposed for the first time to develop the optimal policies for adaptation to climate change. To address underlying uncertainties associated with climate and labor management systems, we take into account ensemble projections from five global climate models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) and inexact system costs. The system costs, including direct and indirect costs such as management costs, energy costs, and labor costs, are presented as interval numbers due to inherent uncertainty caused by population growth, technology development, and other social-economic factors. Uncertain information can be effectively communicated into the optimization processes in this study to generate optimal and reliable decision alternatives. We find that the increased Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) will lead to a large reduction in labor capacities over China except for the Tibetan Plateau under both RCPs by the end of the 21st century. The less developed regions tend to achieve the minimum system cost by having labor productivity recovered through working overtime due to the relatively low cost of overtime. This could result in more heat-related work injuries in the less developed regions. Since the less developed regions are not heat-prone areas in China, the changing climate would be a more dangerous threat and cause more damages to these regions where the residents are less acclimatized to heat stress.

Simulation program monitored the emission trajectories and velocities of sputtered atoms as well as the forces acting on them. Simulation results revealed that the preferential ejection of sputtered atoms along close-packed directions, which caused the formation of “Wehner spots”, resulted mainly from the regular interaction between sputtered atoms and their neighbor atoms. The formation mechanism of “Wehner spots” is that sputtered atom is first horizontally focused and then undergoes a ski-jump takeoff along close-packed direction. The generality of this mechanism was further verified by supplementary molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, this investigation demonstrated that local environment surrounding sputtered atom rather than simple collision processes transferring initial recoil energy to sputtered atom dominated the anisotropic sputtering of fcc (100) surface in low energy regime. © 2021","Anisotropic emission of sputtered atoms; Low-energy ion bombardment; Molecular dynamics; Sputtering; Surface","Anisotropy; Argon; Atoms; Ion bombardment; Sputtering; Anisotropic emission of sputtered atom; Close packed; Dynamics simulation; Formation mechanism; Ions bombardment; Low energy argon ions; Low energy sputtering; Low-energy ion bombardment; Metal surfaces; Sputtered atoms; Molecular dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112836509

China is the largest aquaculture producer globally; however, the magnitude of N2O emission from Chinese aquaculture systems (CASs) has not yet been extensively investigated. Here, we quantified N2O emission from the CASs since the Reform and Opening-up (1979-2019) at the species-, provincial-, and national-levels using annual aquaculture production data, based on nitrogen (N) levels in feed type, feed amount, feed conversion ratio, and emission factor (EF). Our estimate indicates that over the past 41 years, N2O emission from CASs has increased approximately 25 times from 0.67 ± 0.04 GgN in 1979 to 16.69 ± 0.31 GgN in 2019. Freshwater fish farming, primarily in two provinces, namely, Guangdong and Hubei, where intensive freshwater fish farming has been adopted in the past decades, accounted for approximately 89% of this emission increase. We also calculated the EF for each species, ranging from 0.79 ± 0.23 g N2O kg-1 animal to 2.41 ± 0.14 g N2O kg-1 animal. The results of this study suggest that selecting low-EF species and improving feed use efficiency can help reduce aquaculture N2O emission for building a climate-resilient sustainable aquaculture. © 2021 The Author(s).","Aquaculture; Climate change; Food production; Nitrous oxide","Aquaculture; Climate change; Fish; Greenhouse gases; Water; Aquaculture systems; Climate change mitigation; Emission factors; Fish farming; Food production; Freshwater fishes; Greenhouses gas; Nitrous oxide; Nitrous oxide emissions; Production sector; Nitrogen oxides; aquaculture; climate change; emission control; mitigation; nitrous oxide; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119653760

The potential to improve air quality depends on an actual reduction in both emissions and subsequent formation of secondary pollutants. In this study, the emissions in real-world traffic from Euro VI-compliant HDTs were compared to those from older classes, represented by Euro V, using high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Gas-phase primary emissions of several hundred species were observed for 70 HDTs. Furthermore, the particle phase and secondary pollutant formation (gas and particle phase) were evaluated for a number of HDTs. The reduction in primary emission factors (EFs) was evident (∼90%) and in line with a reduction of 28-97% for the typical regulated pollutants. Secondary production of most gas- and particle-phase compounds, for example, nitric acid, organic acids, and carbonyls, after photochemical aging in an oxidation flow reactor exceeded the primary emissions (EFAged/EFFreshratio ≥2). Byproducts from urea-selective catalytic reduction systems had both primary and secondary sources. A non-negative matrix factorization analysis highlighted the issue of vehicle maintenance as a remaining concern. However, the adoption of Euro VI has a significant positive effect on emissions in real-world traffic and should be considered in, for example, urban air quality assessments. © 2021 The Authors.

It plays an even more important role in investigating evergreen tree growth in regions with less distinct seasonal cycles. Subtropical evergreen forests have been studied in recent years for their sensitivity to climate change, but it remains unclear how xylem growth is driven by subtropical climates. To further understand the climate-growth response strategies of subtropical conifers, we micro-cored Cryptomeria fortunei and Cunninghamia lanceolata weekly in 2016 and 2017 at the humid subtropical Gushan Mountain in southeastern China. Our weekly growth monitoring showed that the vegetation periods of these two species were both approximately 2–3 months longer than trees in temperate and boreal forests. The growth of C. fortunei in 2016 and 2017 and C. lanceolata in 2017 showed a bimodal pattern of xylogenesis, which was induced by summer drought. The results also indicated that the earlier end of the xylem formation was related to the yearly drought stress. These findings provide more specific information about tree growth and evidence of how climate influences wood production at the cellular level in subtropical regions.

How to handle the stranded gas is a troublesome problem under the background of global “net-zero” emission efforts. On the other hand, the cost of water for hydraulic fracturing is high and water is not accessible in some areas. The idea of using stranded gas in replace of the water-based fracturing fluid can reduce the gas emission and the cost. This paper presents some novel numerical studies on the feasibility of using stranded natural gas as fracturing fluids. Differences in the fracture creating, proppant placement, and oil/gas/water flowback are compared between natural gas fracturing fluids and water-based fracturing fluids. A fully integrated equation of state compositional hydraulic fracturing and reservoir simulator is used in this paper. Public datasets for the Permian Basin rock and fluid properties and natural gas foam properties are collected to set up simulation cases. The reservoir hydrocarbon fluid and natural gas fracturing fluids phase behavior is modeled using the Peng-Robinson equation of state. The evolving of created fracture geometry, conductivity and flowback performance during the lifecycle of the well (injection, shut-in, and production) are analyzed for the gas and water fracturing fluids. Simulation results show that natural gas and foam fracturing fluids are better than water-based fracturing fluids in terms of lower breakdown pressure, lower water leakoff into the reservoir, and higher cluster efficiency. NG foams tend to create better propped fractures with shorter length and larger width, because of their high viscosity. NG foam is also found to create better stimulated rock volume (SRV) permeability, better fracturing fluid flowback with a large water usage reduction, and high natural gas consumption. The simulation results presented in this paper are helpful to the operators in reducing natural gas emission while reducing the cost of hydraulic fracturing operation. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there is a lack of knowledge about water vapor and Kc in tea plantation ecosystems. This study explored and determined the actual evapotranspiration (ETc) and Kc of two cultivars of tea (Camellia sinensis), clone variety Baiye1 (BY1) and Longjing43 (LJ43), based on lysimeter data. An estimation was made for both for ETc and adjusted ETc, and the corresponding Kc and adjusted Kc. The results showed that the adjusted ETc and Kc values revealed a minor fluctuation when compared to the ETc and Kc values during the experimental period, which indicated that the adjusted ETc and Kc values were more precise and practical to field conditions. The average adjusted Kc values were 0.71 (range of 0.43–1.02) for BY1 and 0.84 (range of 0.48–1.22) for LJ43. Additionally, heavy pruning can decrease ETc and Kc values, possibly due to the lower level of LAI after pruning. Moreover, it is clearly manifested that BY1 consistently had lower ETc and Kc values than those of LJ43 because of plant growth status differences between BY1 and LJ43. Overall, our study proposed a reliable reference of Kc in tea plantation, and illuminated the effects of pruning and plant growth differences on Kc, which could provide a strong basis for precise irrigation in tea plantations in a subtropical climate. © 2021 by the authors.

Moreover, the economic benefits of individual prosumers need to be quantified to motivate their participation in the sharing scheme. In this study, a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy sharing paradigm was formulated, consisting of hybrid solar-wind renewable systems, battery storages, grid-connected commercial prosumers (a high-rise office building and a high-rise hotel), and flexible energy management. Different sharing scenarios with/without storage sharing were studied for performance improvements. Case studies show that, compared to the traditional peer-to-grid operation, the proposed P2P sharing operation with storage sharing can promote the self-consumption from 0.591 to 0.795 and reduce the net cost from 80.4 to 52.7 HKD/m2·a by 34.5%. The formulated energy sharing strategies can also contribute to energy bill savings for each prosumer when considering the profit from transactive energy and grid feed-in tariff, whereas the storage sharing may shorten the battery service life.

The SUHII analysis was dependent on the definition of urban and rural boundaries, where a smaller rural buffering zone resulted in a weaker SUHI or surface urban cool island (SUCI) phenomenon and a larger urban area corresponded to a weaker SUHI or SUCI phenomenon as well. The LST of LCZs did not follow a fixed order, where in July and August, the LCZ-10 (Heavy industry) had the highest mean LST, followed by LCZ-2 (Compact midrise) and then LCZ-7 (Lightweight low-rise). In comparison, LCZ-7, LCZ-8 (Large low-rise) and LCZ-9 (Sparsely built) had the highest LST from October to May. The LST of LCZs varied with urban and rural contexts, where LCZ-7, LCZ-8 and LCZ-10 were the three built LCZs that had the highest LST within urban context, while LCZ-2, LCZ-3 (Compact low-rise), LCZ-8, LCZ-9 and LCZ-10 were the five built LCZs that had the highest LST within rural context. The suitability of the LCZ scheme for temperature differentiation varied with the month, where from July to October, the LCZ scheme had the strongest capability and in May, it had the weakest capability. Urban context also made a difference to the suitability, where compared with the whole study area (the combination of urban and rural areas), the suitability of built LCZs in either urban or rural contexts weakened. Moreover, the built LCZs had a higher level of suitability in an urban context compared with a rural context, while the land-cover LCZs within rural had a higher level of suitability. © 2021 by the authors.

Building operational energy consumption carbon emissions (BECCE) account for a substantial proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, crucially influencing global warming and the sustainability of urban socioeconomic development. As a foundation of building energy conservation, determination of refined statistics of BECCE is attracting increasing attention. However, reliable and accurate representation of BECCE remains lacking. This study proposed an innovative downscaling method to generate a gridded BECCE intensity benchmark dataset with 1 km2 spatial resolution. First, we calculated BECCE at the provincial level by energy balance table application. Second, on the basis of building climate demarcation, partial least squares regression models were used to establish the BECCE behavior equations for three climate regions. Third, Cubist regression models were built, retrieving down scale at the prefecture level to 1 km2 BECCE, which well-captured the complex relationships between BECCE and multisource covariates (i.e., gross domestic product, population, ground surface temperature, heating degree days, and cooling degree days). The downscaled product was verified using anthropogenic heat flux mapping at the same resolution. In comparison with other published pixel-based datasets of building energy usage, the gridded BECCE intensity map produced in this study showed good agreement and high spatial heterogeneity. This new BECCE intensity dataset could serve as a fundamental database for studies on building energy conservation and forecast carbon emissions, and could support decision makers in developing strategies for realizing the CO2 emission peak and carbon neutralization. © 2021 by the authors.

The state-of-the-art processes for the synthesis of methanol from COG possess several limitations such as poor utilization of hydrogen, low yields, and high energy consumption, leading to high production cost. The main technical issues are poor carbon supply and the need for energy intensification of the process. In this paper, we propose a new, more efficient method for the conversion of COG and pulverized coke (PC) into methanol and ammonia using chemical looping of hydrogen generation (CLHG), (PCCLHG-CGTMA). The PCCLHG-derived H2 and N2 are utilized for ammonia production. The new process has high adjustability in the production of methanol and ammonia. In order to obtain the best performance of carbon and hydrogen elements utilization efficiency, exergy and energy efficiency, several operational parameters and conditions have been optimized. Compared with different technologies for the conversion of COG to methanol or ammonia, the new system acclaims an excellent hydrogen element utilization efficiency of 88.8% and a high exergy efficiency of 78.7%. And the relative CO2 reduction ratio of this new system is 0.67. Considering the current market value and demands, 0.576 Mt/y COG and 0.175 Mt/y PC could be utilized in this process for the production of 0.44–0.86 Mt/y methanol and 0–0.36 Mt/y of ammonia. The present method offers exergy efficiency of 60.7–78.7% and energy efficiency of 54.4–70.1%.

The government actions significantly affected emissions of atmospheric pollutants and unintentionally created a nationwide emission reduction scenario. In order to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on fine particular matter (PM2.5) levels, we developed a “conditional variational autoencoder” (CVAE) algorithm based on the deep learning to discern unsupervised PM2.5 anomalies in Chines cities during the COVID-19 epidemic. We show that the timeline of changes in number of cities with unsupervised PM2.5 anomalies is consistent with the timeline of WHO's response to COVID-19. Using unsupervised PM2.5 anomaly as a time node, we examine changes in PM2.5 before and after the time node to assess the response of PM2.5 to the COVID-19 lockdown. The rate of decrease of PM2.5 around the time node in northern China is 3.5 times faster than southern China, and decreasing PM2.5 levels in southern China is 3.5 times of that in northern China. Results were also compared with anomalous PM2.5 occurring in Chinese's Spring Festival from 2017 to 2019, PM2.5 anomalies during around Chinese New Year in 2020 differ significantly from 2017 to 2019.

Therefore, it is advisable to identify the variations of future precipitation, hydrology and hydropower generation under the joint impact of global warming and the operation of local hydropower reservoirs. To this end, the ensemble mean of the bias corrected NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) climate projections downscaled from 10 global climate models (GCMs) was applied to seven precipitation indices proposed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) and the ensemble of two distributed hydrologic models (VIC and CREST) under the global warming of 1.5 °C and 2 °C. Reservoir operation based on actual operation rules and the hydropower optimization model were explicitly included in the routing module to represent the impact of the local hydropower reservoirs, respectively. The future natural runoff is likely to increase under RCP8.5, decrease under RCP4.5, and see a larger daily variability under both. The local hydropower reservoirs can effectively mitigate the negative climate impact on the basin hydrology, and the basin is expected to see increased dry-season runoff, decreased wet-season runoff, and lower daily variability of runoff under all scenarios as compared to the baseline period. The future hydropower generation of the YRB is consistent with the variation of future runoff, and reservoir operation with hydropower optimized rules can produce about 5% electricity more than the current actual operation rules, highlighting the potential need to adapt the current operation rules to future climate conditions. Our framework and findings are expected to provide instructive information for water resources management not only in the YRB but also in different regions worldwide. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Extreme precipitation; Global warming; Hydropower generation; Reservoir operation","Climate models; Earth (planet); Energy security; Global warming; Information management; NASA; Precipitation (meteorology); Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Watersheds; 'current; Actual operation; Extreme precipitation; Geological hazards; Hydro-power generation; Hydropower reservoirs; Operation rules; Public concern; Reservoir operation; Yalong river basins; Hydroelectric power; basin analysis; climate conditions; climate modeling; downscaling; future prospect; global climate; global warming; hazard assessment; hydroelectric power; hydrological modeling; hydrology; power generation; precipitation (climatology); rainfall-runoff modeling; China; Yalong Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111497964

A three-dimensional model consisting of a 100-m highway tunnel and four side-by-side gasoline vehicles (L × W × H = 4.5 m × 1.8 m × 1.5 m) was established in the STAR-CCM+ computational fluid dynamics software. The gasoline vehicles traveled simultaneously under different situations of three driving speeds of 60 km h-1, 40 km h-1, and 20 km h-1 during the simulation. Through data analysis and research, it was found that the coagulation process of particles is very complicated, especially at low speeds. When the vehicle speed is 20 km h-1, the variation in particle concentration at the vehicle wake near the tailpipe (at the vertical plane located 0.1 m behind the exhaust pipe) causes a large error if the coagulation action is not considered. The relative error of the average particle concentration at 0.5 s of the vertical section 0.1 m away from the exhaust pipe is as high as 193.51%. The relative error in the entire tunnel is only 2.82%, which is less than 5%. Thus, it is recommended that particle coagulation should be considered when analyzing particle dispersion in the near-wake region behind the vehicle and the breathing areas, especially when the vehicle travels slowly inside the tunnel. However, when evaluating the particle concentration and exposure levels for the entire tunnel, coagulation can be ignored without significant errors, especially at a high vehicle speeds. This study clarified the importance of coagulation in different areas and its influence on the diffusion of particulate matter. This is conducive to further analysis of the diffusion characteristics of particulate matter and can appreciably reduce the pollution degree in a tunnel by changing the coagulation efficiency of particulate matter in the future. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Coagulation; Dispersion; Dynamic mesh; Road tunnel; Ultrafine particle","algorithm; coagulation; concentration (composition); dispersant; dispersion; particulate matter; transport vehicle; tunnel; wake; air pollutant; algorithm; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; particle size; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Algorithms; Environmental Monitoring; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108825257

However, corrosion can easily occur since fire-drive tail gas usually contains corrosive gases, such as CO2 and O2. In this work, the corrosion behavior of several 35CrMo steel samples in a fire-drive tail gas environment was studied using weightlessness measurements, surface characterization techniques, and high temperature-pressure electrochemical tests. The research results show that the average corrosion rate of 35CrMo steel in a CO2–O2 coexisting environment is much higher than the average corrosion rate in a CO2-containing environment or O2-containing environment. The localized corrosion rate of 35CrMo steel in an O2-containing environment is higher than the localized corrosion rate in both the case of a CO2-containing environment or a CO2–O2 one. The pitting factor shows that 35CrMo steel exhibits a localized corrosion in an O2-containing environment.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) from co-cultivated intercropped plants may proliferate into the microsites and interact with soil microbes to reduce N2O emissions. Yet, the mechanisms by which or how mycorrhizal hyphae affect nitrifiers and denitrifiers in the legume residues remain ambiguous. Here, a split-microcosm experiment was conducted to assess hyphae of Rhizophagus aggregatus from neighbouring maize on overall N2O emissions from stubbles of nodulated or non-nodulated soybean. Soil microbes from fields intercropped with maize/soybean amended with fertilizer nitrogen (SS-N1) or unamended (SS-N0) were added to the soybean chamber only. AMF hyphae consistently reduced N2O emissions by 20.8%–61.5%. Generally, AMF hyphae promoted the abundance of N2O-consuming (nosZ-type) denitrifiers and altered their community composition. The effects were partly associated with increasing MBC and DOC. By contrast, AMF reduced the abundance of nirK-type denitrifiers in the nodulated SS-N0 treatment only and that of AOB in the non-nodulated SS-N1 treatment. Taken together, our results show that AMF reduced N2O emissions from soybean stubbles, mainly through the promotion of N2O-consuming denitrifiers. This holds promise for mitigating N2O emissions by manipulating the efficacious AMF and their associated microbes in cereal/legume intercropping systems. © 2021 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117386148

Based on the construction of a comprehensive population development index (PDI), this study adopts a decoupling model to explore the dependence between carbon emissions and PDI across 30 Chinese provinces from 2001 to 2017. Then, the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence and technology (STIRPAT) model is used to investigate the impact of population factors on carbon emissions. The results show that the decoupling relationship between carbon emissions and PDI has experienced a transformation from expansive negative coupling to expansive coupling and then to weak decoupling at the national level, while some provinces have experienced the same evolutionary process, but the decoupling state in most provinces is not ideal. Sending talent to western provinces and developing low‐carbon supporting industries will accelerate carbon decoupling. At the national level, incorporating environmental protection into the existing education system as part of classroom teaching could contribute to carbon decoupling. © 2021 by the authors.

Furthermore, by dividing China's 30 provinces into three regions, we further explore the potential regional heterogeneity in the effects between these two variables. The empirical results indicate that an increase in PSA can effectively mitigate the greenhouse effect in China. PSA increases CO2 emissions by improving economic scale; however, strengthening technology and knowledge spillover effects and optimizing industrial structure can alleviate CO2 emissions. Although PSA helps reduce CO2 emissions in all three regions, we find significant regional heterogeneity.

Since shorter retention time for hydrogen gas (H2) in conventional electrolytically produced hydrogen-rich water (HRW) limits its application, seeking a more suitable method to produce and maintain H2 level in HRW for longer time remain a challenge for scientific community. To solve above problems, we compared and concluded that the H2 in HRW prepared by ammonia borane (NH3·BH3) could meet above requirement. The biological effects of HRW prepared by NH3·BH3 were further evaluated in seedlings of rapeseed, the most important crop for producing vegetable oil worldwide. Under our experimental conditions, 2 mg/L NH3·BH3-prepared HRW could confer 3-day-old hydroponic seedlings tolerance against 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG; w/v), or 100 μM CdCl2 stress, and intensify endogenous nitric oxide (NO) accumulation under above stresses. The alleviation of seedlings growth stunt was confirmed by reducing cell death and reestablishing redox homeostasis. Reconstructing ion homeostasis, increasing proline content, and reducing Cd accumulation were accordingly observed. Above responses were sensitive to the removal of endogenous NO with its scavenger 2‐(4‐carboxyphenyl)‐4,4,5,5‐tetramethyl‐imidazoline‐1‐1‐oxyl‐3‐oxide (cPTIO; 100 μM), reflecting the requirement of NO functioning in the regulation of plant physiology achieved by NH3·BH3-prepared HRW. The application of 1 mM tungstate, an inhibitor of nitrate reductase (NR; an important NO synthetic enzyme), showed the similar blocking responses in the phenotype, suggesting that NR might be the major source of NO involved in above H2 actions. Together, these results revealed that HRW prepared by NH3·BH3 could enhance rapeseed seedlings tolerance against abiotic stress, thus opening a new window for the application of H2 in agricultural production. © 2021 The Authors","Ammonia borane; Brassica napus L.; Cadmium; Drought; Nitric oxide; Salinity","ammonia borane; borane derivative; cadmium; hydrogen; macrogol; nitrate reductase; nitric oxide; proline; sodium chloride; unclassified drug; water; agricultural production; ammonia; angiosperm; bioaccumulation; cadmium; drought; growth response; homeostasis; nitric oxide; salinity tolerance; seedling; water; abiotic stress; Article; cell death; concentration (parameter); controlled study; drought tolerance; ecotoxicity; enzyme activity; nonhuman; pH; phenotype; plant growth; plant physiology; rapeseed; retention time; salt tolerance; Brassica napus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112434219

However, large discrepancies between the two approaches have been noted in the heavily polluted environments of North China Plain (NCP). Herein, daily PM2.5 samples (n = 418) were collected at five urban cities across NCP during the winter of 2017–2018; the ionic species (e.g., NO3− and methanesulfonic acid: MSA) and the dual-isotopic signatures of NO3− were quantified. In this study, we revisited the O isotopic signatures of atmospheric O-bearing molecules, especially that of OH radical in accordance with the up-to-date field measurements conducted in NCP regions. In brief, the δ18O-OH was determined by the competition between the OH loss reaction rate and its isotopic equilibration reaction with H2O. Our improved isotopic results suggested that the daytime OH oxidation pathway was as important as the nocturnal channels in wintertime nitrate production in NCP (46.4% vs. 53.6%), whereas the exceedingly high loadings of NO3− in haze days were attributed to the heterogeneous chemistry of N2O5 hydrolysis. Chemical analysis also confirmed the importance of active photochemistry in secondary components production, as the MSA (a photooxidation product) linearly correlated with the NO3− (R2 = 0.86, p &lt; 0.05). Our preliminary results compared well with the recent model simulations (e.g., sophisticated 3D model and observationally constraint model). To alleviate the winter haze in NCP, future emission regulations should aim to reduce the photochemical oxidants, particularly their precursors of NOx and VOCs simultaneously. © 2021.

However, the response of soil CH4 uptake to future climate change in the alpine meadows remains poorly understood. We carried out an alpine meadow field experiments to determine how warming and altered precipitation (drought and wetness) affect CH4 uptake, as well as its underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that this mesic alpine meadow was a CH4 sink under all treatments (ranging from −311.4 to −487.1 mg m−2 CH4). Warming significantly increased CH4 uptake by an average of 18.14% of the annual cumulative CH4 uptake and by 48.68% of the non-growing season cumulative CH4 uptake. Drought enhanced the positive warming effect on CH4 uptake by decreasing soil water content, but wetness weakened this effect. Moreover, using high-throughput sequencing and GeoChip approaches, we found that warming stimulated CH4 uptake not only by increasing CH4 oxidation but also by decreasing CH4 production through changing the methanotroph community compositional structure. Further analysis revealed that the dynamics of daily CH4 uptake were mainly regulated by soil water content during the growing season, whereas daily CH4 uptake was strongly correlated with soil temperature during the non-growing season. Warming and altered precipitation influence soil CH4 uptake in different ways during the growing and non-growing seasons. Based on our results, we predict that Tibetan Plateau mesic alpine meadows will remain a net sink of CH4 under future climate warming and drought scenarios, but soil CH4 uptake will decrease if precipitation increases in future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Alpine meadow; Climate change; Methane uptake; Non-growing season; Soil temperature; Soil water content",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107629979

As a kind of clean and pollution-free renewable energy, solar energy has fully demonstrated its superiority and is receiving more and more attention. Reasonable use of solar energy can effectively save non-renewable energy, slow down the speed of global climate warming, and reduce environmental pollution. This article takes a kindergarten competition design as an example. Through thinking about green buildings and combining the use of renewable energy such as solar energy, this article explores how buildings can adapt to local conditions to improve the quality of buildings.

Usually, the spatiotemporal development of droughts is evaluated only via drought indexes based on simulated soil moisture. However, the physiological status of crops is key to accurately assessing the effect of drought, and hydrological models either do not consider crop physiological status or oversimplify it. In addition, the effects of reservoirs, irrigation, and crop rotation are generally not considered. To overcome the oversimplification of crop and irrigation modules in hydrological models, the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model was coupled with the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model. Irrigation and reservoir modules were introduced into the coupled hydrology-crop growth (CHC) model. The CHC model was built for the watershed upstream of Heilin hydrological station on the Qingkou River on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces, China. The model performance was compared with simulation results of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool and VIC, which showed that the CHC model was more accurate. The temporal variation of water consumption and demand of three crop rotations, namely spring peanuts, summer peanuts-winter wheat, and summer corn-winter wheat, in the study area was analyzed. Drought area data obtained from Junan County yearbooks were consistent with the simulated water deficit and drought index considering the effect of irrigation. Crop irrigation increased soil water content and evapotranspiration and decreased crop water deficit. Therefore, crop irrigation was considered in hydrological simulations. The CHC model reliably simulated crop water consumption, soil moisture, and drought index, and the model simulated data could be used as basic data for water resources management and drought mitigation measures. © 2021 The Authors.

However, it is unclear how it affects the ferrous iron-involved denitrification. Here, the influence of drying-rewetting cycles on ferrous iron-involved denitrification in paddy soil were studied with batch experiments. The dynamics of nitrate, ammonia, Fe2+, Fe3+ and total organic carbon (TOC), as well as nitrous oxide (N2O) were investigated using the iron-rich paddy soil in Jiangxi province, South China. Results demonstrated that the denitrification rate dropped while ammonia nitrogen content (NH4+-N) showed a rapid accumulation in the drying period. In the rewetting period, organic carbon played two-side roles. Organic carbon and ferrous iron together provided electron donors to denitrification, and organic carbon simultaneously reduced ferric iron under anaerobic environment. There were complex interactions among organic carbon, nitrate and Fe2+/Fe3+ under drying-rewetting cycles. Soil rewetting led to denitrification flush, especially after a moderately long drying period, while excessively frequent drying-rewetting alternation was not favorable to nitrate denitrification. © 2021 by the authors.

However, few studies have evaluated the effects of plant genotype, soil type, climatic factors, and their interactions on the rhizosphere microbiome of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here we used Illumina sequencing to investigate the bacterial community in the rhizosphere of two rice genotypes grown in three soil types (Albic, Black, and Chernozem) across three climatic regions in northeastern China. Results showed that soil type, followed by climate, was the primary factor in shaping the bacterial community structure, and their interactions significantly influenced α-diversity. Principal component analysis also revealed that the dispersion of bacterial community in albic soil was much lower than that in black and chernozem soils. Additionally, soil nutrients explained approximately 45% of the variation in bacterial communities, suggesting the effects of climate or genotype on the variation of bacterial communities are associated with soil nutrients. Network analysis revealed that the co-occurrence relationships in albic soil were loosened compared with black and chernozem soils. In three soils, the abundant taxa were more located in central positions within the network than the moderate or rare taxa. Moreover, the closeness centrality of abundant taxa displayed a significantly negative with organic matter, implying a more convergence communities in albic soil probably due to the loose co-occurrence relationship of abundant taxa by high organic matter. Our study revealed the underlying mechanism for the stability of bacterial communities in rice rhizosphere with rich organic matter, and provided a basis for improving the soil quality and maintaining the sustainable development of rice production via fertilization. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Abundant taxa; Illumina sequencing; Network analysis; Oryza sativa L.; Rhizosphere microbiome",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103946240

A novel green substrate was prepared by mixing SSAD and its biochar (SSBC) filled with perlite and quartz sand for plant growth, as a replacement of soil. We carried out pot experiment, measured ryegrass biomass, seedling survival rate, and evaluated the emission of greenhouse gas (GHG), NH3 volatilization. The results showed that the seedling survival rate and individual biomass of ryegrass in green substrate were 100% and 100.02 mg, which were 14.4% and 231.4% higher than those in only SSAD, but were 1.3% and 19.6% higher than those in soil. SSBC significantly reduced N2O and CO2 emission, inhibited the NH3 volatilization, but increased CH4 emission. However, the cumulative emission of N2O and CH4 was approximation to that in soil. Global warming potential of CH4 and N2O (GWP(CH4+N2O)) green substrate was 11,842.01 kg CO2·hm−2, which was 1.35-fold higher than that of soil. Microbial community structure analysis showed that fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaeal had a higher abundance in green substrate than in soil, which caused the different gas emission.

However, there is limited knowledge on global trends in urban vegetation and their relation to economic development and climate change. Here we studied 1,688 major cities worldwide and show that 70% (1,181) show an increase in vegetation derived from satellite observations (2000–2018). For 68% (1,138) of the cities studied, the increase in the urban vegetation is less strong as compared to the vegetation increase found in the surroundings of these cities. Overall, positive vegetation trends are widely observed in cities in Europe and North America, whereas negative vegetation trends in cities occur primarily in Africa, South America and Asia. Gross Domestic Product growth, population growth as well as temperature are found to be the main underlying drivers of the observed contrasts in changes in urban vegetation as compared to surrounding areas across continents.

This study analyzed the contents and δ34S values of different S forms (total S, carbon-bonded S, ester-bonded SO42-, SO42-, and total reduced inorganic sulfur [TRIS]), the δ34S values of stream SO42-, the δ13C values of soil organic carbon, and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) quantity in limestone soil and yellow soil profiles in a typical small karst catchment of Southwest China. The results showed that under the same acid deposition level, the limestone soil and yellow soil profiles are significantly different from the distribution of contents and δ34S values of different S forms and the number of SRB. At the same time, more than 70% of the SO42- in the stream water draining the sampling slopes came from soils at different depths in limestone soil and yellow soil profiles. These results indicate the different response of retention and output of S in the limestone soil and yellow soil to S deposition input. The organic S formation and dissimilatory SO42- reduction (DSR) to form TRIS are S retention processes that exist in both limestone soil and yellow soil profiles. There are processes of transport and accumulation of SO42- at the bottom layer in yellow soil profile; therefore, retaining S as absorbed SO42- is also a main S retention process in yellow soil. At present, the output of SO42- through stream water mainly comes from the deposited SO42- which undergoes DSR reaction driven by SRB, not from organic S mineralization and desorption of adsorbed SO42- in the limestone soil and yellow soil profiles.

We aimed to evaluate the health co-benefits of carbon neutrality under different technology pathways, which could help China to achieve the carbon neutrality goal, air quality goal, and Healthy China goal in a synergetic manner that includes health in the decision-making process. Methods: In this modelling study, we used Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 with no climate policy as the reference scenario, and two representative carbon neutrality scenarios with identical emission trajectories and different technology pathways—one was led by renewable energies and the other was led by negative emission technologies. We had three modules to analyse health co-benefits and mitigation costs for each policy scenario. First, we used a computable general equilibrium model that captures the operation of the whole economic system to investigate the carbon mitigation costs and air pollutant emission pathways of different technology portfolios. Second, we used a reduced complexity air quality model to estimate the concentrations of particulate matter in the atmosphere from the air pollutant emission pathways. Finally, we used a health impact evaluation model to estimate premature deaths, morbidity, and the resulting loss of life expectancy, then these health impacts were monetised according to value of a statistical life and cost of illness. We compared the monetised health co-benefits against the corresponding mitigation costs to explore the cost-effectiveness of different technology portfolios. A series of uncertainties embodied in carbon neutrality pathways and models were considered. Findings: In our models, sole dependence on improving end-of-pipe air pollution control measures is not sufficient for all Chinese provinces to meet the 2005 WHO PM2·5 standards (10 μg/m3) by 2060. Only a combination of strong climate and air pollution control policies can lead to substantial improvement of air quality across China. If the carbon neutrality pathway led by developing renewable energies was followed, the air quality of all provinces could meet the WHO guideline by 2060. With the realisation of carbon neutrality goals, the total discounted mitigation costs (discount rate 5%) from 2020–60 would range from 40–125 trillion Chinese yuan (CNY), and 22–50 million cumulative premature deaths could be avoided. China has the potential to increase the associated life expectancy by 0·88–2·80 years per person in 2060 versus the reference scenario. The health benefits are higher in the renewable energies-led scenarios, whereas the mitigation costs are smaller in the negative emission technologies-led scenarios. If the value of a statistical life is set higher than 12·5 million CNY (39% of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development value), the health co-benefits will be higher than mitigation costs, even when considering all included uncertainties, implying the cost-effectiveness of China's carbon neutrality goal. Interpretation: The life expectancy increase from the realisation of China's 2060 carbon neutrality goal could be equivalent to the past 5–10 years of life expectancy growth in China. Choosing an appropriate carbon neutrality pathway affects the health of China's population both today and in the future. Our findings suggest that, if China incorporates health co-benefits into climate policy making and puts a high value on people's health, it should choose a carbon neutrality pathway that relies more on developing renewable energies and avoid over-reliance on negative emission technologies.

The hourly average concentration of NH3 throughout the campaign was 15.4 ± 17.5 ppb. NH3 concentrations correlated well with NH4+ in PM2.5, indicating the dominant precursor role of NH3 on NH4+ formation. The diurnal profile indicated an increase in NH3 concentrations during the morning rush hours, which was likely due to vehicle emissions. The mean ammonium conversion ratio (NHR) was 0.26, with the highest value of 0.32 in the afternoon. Elevated NHR, nitrate oxidation ratio (NOR), and NH4+ coincided with the significant increase in O3 levels in the afternoon, indicating the large daytime formation of NH4NO3 via photochemical reactions. Moreover, higher NHR values occurred under higher relative humidity (RH &gt;60%) and lower temperature (0–10 °C). NHR increased during the nighttime and correlated well with RH, indicating the dominant role of heterogeneous reactions on gas-particle partitioning. The sulfate oxidation ratio (SOR) and NOR showed positive correlations with RH, which suggests that the conversions of SO2 to SO42− and NO2 to NO3− were sensitive to changes in RH. The sustained increase in SO42− concentrations at RH &gt;60% suggests that RH had a higher influence on SO42− formation than on NO3− formation. As the sole precursor of NH4+, NH3 significantly enhanced daytime NH4NO3 formation via homogeneous gas-phase reactions and also promoted sulfate formation via both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions. Moreover, the back trajectory results inferred a high contribution of southwestern air masses to atmospheric NH3 and NH4+ aerosol variations in Beijing. The result suggests the need for controlling the vehicle emissions to reduce the high levels of NH3 and alleviate PM2.5 pollution in winter in Beijing. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ammonia; Ammonium; Gas-to-particle conversion; NHR; Regional transport; Urban Beijing","aerosol; ammonia; concentration (composition); detection method; emission control; low temperature; relative humidity; spatiotemporal analysis; trace gas; urban site; winter; Beijing [China]; China; ammonia; ammonium derivative; aerosol; air pollutant; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Ammonia; Ammonium Compounds; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109007812

However, the short-term glacier movement with a single data source could not precisely and sufficiently demonstrate the response of glaciers to climate change. In order to extract the reliable signal corresponding to climate change, the long-term monitoring of glacier movement should be widely exploited. This paper presents the glacier movement distribution of the South Inylchek Glacier by the improving pixel tracking algorithm with both synthetic aperture radar and optical satellite images in 2007–2008 and 2017–2018. The analysis in spatiotemporal characteristics of the glacier velocity indicates that the South Inylchek Glacier remained almost stable in a ten-year interval with the average velocity of 32 cm/d, which are computed with quasi-synchronization multi-source imagery. And the consistency of the velocity results was also verified with both optical and SAR imagery during the same period. Therefore, it would be valuable in expanding the research temporal cycle of glacier movement by uniting multi-source data. And the long-term glacier movement should be exploited for further analysis in mass balance prediction and assessing the climate change effects in the High Mountain Asia. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Lacier velocity; Multi-source imagery; Pixel tracking algorithm; South Inylchek Glacier; Ten-year interval","Climate change; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Pixels; Radar imaging; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking (position); Activity analysis; Glacier movement; Lacier velocity; Multi-source imagery; Multi-Sources; Pixel tracking algorithm; South inylchek glacier; Surface velocity; Ten-year interval; Tracking algorithm; Velocity; algorithm; climate change; environmental indicator; glacier mass balance; mountain region; pixel; satellite imagery; temporal analysis; Inylchek Glacier; Kyrgyzstan; Ysyk-Kol; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118456992

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) employing inorganic electrode materials have dominated such markets over the past decades. However, inorganic materials are being faced with their inherent limitations in specific capacities, mineral resources, and mechanical fragileness as well as eco-sustainability and cost-efficiency. In the last years, carbonyl polymers as electrode alternatives for LIBs have attracted considerable attention due to their high capacities, fast redox kinetics, chain designability, abundant resources, processing compatibility, and mechanical flexibility. Herein, a timely and comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art knowledge is thoroughly summarized. Particular attention lies on the work principles, chain engineering strategies, carbonyl utilization, and electrochemical activities of carbonyl polymers. The structure-to-performance relationships concerning microstructures, topologies, and composites with nanocarbons are also scrutinized. Current challenges and future perspectives are finally proposed.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to figure out the characteristics of dust emission from mechanized peanut harvesting. To this end, the particulate matters of diameters ≤ 2.5 µm and ≤10 µm and the total suspended particles were sampled in real time during peanut harvesting in Henan Province, China, and the airborne particle concentrations and particle size distributions were measured. The dust particles discharged during the mechanized peanut harvesting were concentrated within the 2~30 µm size range. When the wind speed was reduced below the settling velocity of the largest particles, the more massive particles were carried in the downwind. The amount of free silica in the dust samples was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. Both the total dust and free silica concentrations exceeded the occupational exposure and threshold limits. To improve the characteristics of dust emission, the microstructure and dispersion of the dust were also investigated. Reducing the agricultural operations during periods of high wind speed, low crop-moisture content, and low air humidity is recommended for reducing the dust exposure of workers. The results will provide guidance and technical support for reducing the dust emissions of mechanized harvesting operations, improving air quality, and reducing the health hazards to operators. © 2021 by the authors.

We proposed the following new solutions to these problems: (i) constructing inter-regional network correlation models based on three key network topology parameters and (ii) subdividing large regions into sub-regions using the Girvan Newman (GN) algorithm. To test these methods, we applied them to a case study of China's provincial-level JPCAP areas using hourly air resource endowment (ARE) data obtained from 2013 to 2017. We found that the modularity (Q) values of ARE network partitioning in different seasons were approximately 0.5, indicating the well-structured association of the network constructed in this study. Seven areas were identified based on annual values, while eight, five, four, and six areas were classified for spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. The strength of the interconnectedness of the provinces in the region, as measured by the clustering coefficient (C˜) value, is ordered as follows: Autumn > winter > spring > summer.

In this paper, a simple method, which is based on low-carbon sustainability index, is developed. The overall urban low-carbon sustainability index is the weighted sum of 11 single indices, and each single index is defined as the indicator assessing the development level against the baseline. The baseline is often the criteria or the minimum requirement of low-carbon sustainability. Case studies in four Chinese cities have put this method into practice, and the results show that all four selected cities fail to pass the testing of sensible low-carbon sustainability rule and they are all in weakly low-carbon sustainable development. Although the four cities have made great progress in their capacity building on pollution control and their capacities on wastewater treatment, main pollutants’ removal and household and hazardous wastes treatment are enough to meet the needs of local development, they are all facing the great challenges on using of sustainable energy, offsetting of CO2 emissions and adoptions of nature-based solutions. The method developed by this research is a useful tool for decision makers identifying whether the local development is not on a low-carbon sustainable path. © 2021 by the authors.

Given the extensive use of gasoline-ethanol mixtures on light-duty vehicles, it is essential to discuss its effects on the atmospheric environment, especially the VOCs emissions and ozone forming potential (OFP) values of one typical formulation called the “match-blend.” In this paper, VOCs emission factors, VOCs distributions, specific reactivity (SR) values, and OFP values of a China-6 commercial gasoline and four E10 match-blend fuels used on seven China-6 vehicles were studied. Thirteen carbonyls detected by high-performance liquid chromatography along with seven VOCs detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were considered in the calculation of OFP and SR. Besides, the effects of test temperatures are discussed. Results show that ethanol increases VOCs emissions, OFP, and SR values at cold-start/room temperature, but behaves oppositely at cold-start/low temperature.

The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/C cathodes are obtained in the initial lithiation and delithiation process. It is found that the Nyquist plots of LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/C cathodes mainly consist of three parts in the lithiation and delithiation process, namely, high-frequency semicircle, middle-frequency semicircle, and low-frequency line. The above three parts are assigned to Schotty contact problem, charge transfer step, and lithium-ion solid-state diffusion process, respectively. A quantitative analysis of the variations of the resistance and barrier capacitance of Schotty contact with the polarization potential of the electrode and a reasonable explanation is given, as well as the resistance and space charge layer capacitance of charge transfer.

This paper addresses this question from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Using panel data from 30 provincial administrative regions of China from 2007 to 2016, we apply the fixed effect model and the gray correlation analysis method to examine the influence and its mechanism of green credit on China's environmental quality. The results show that green credit does improve China's environmental quality overall. Green credit can reduce environmental pollution through three mechanisms: improving enterprise performance, motivating enterprise innovation, and upgrading industrial structure. However, there are regional differences in the emission-reduction effect of green credit. Green credit improves the environmental quality in resource-based regions more than non-resource-based regions; the emission-reduction effect is significant in regions with developed financial markets, but not significant elsewhere. The results indicate that green credit policies should be regionally differentiated to more effectively achieve emission-reduction targets. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Environmental pollution; Fixed effect model; Gray correlation analysis; Green credit; Regional differences","credit provision; environmental economics; environmental fate; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; environmental quality; policy making; article; China; correlation analysis; financial market; intermethod comparison; theoretical study; China; environmental policy; industry; policy; pollution; prevention and control; China; China; Environmental Policy; Environmental Pollution; Industry; Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111954526

However, the response mechanism of NEP to climate change in the arid regions of Central Asia remains unclear. Therefore, this study combined the Carnegie–Ames–Stanford approach (CASA) and empirical models to estimate the NEP in Central Asia and quantitatively evaluate the sensitivity of the NEP to climate factors. The results show that although the net primary productivity (NPP) in Central Asia exhibits an increasing trend, it is not significant. Soil heterotrophic respiration (RH) has increased significantly, while the NEP has decreased at a rate of 6.1 g C·m–2·10 a–1 . Spatially, the regional distribution of the significant increase in RH is consistent with that of the significant decrease in the NEP, which is concentrated in western and southern Central Asia. Specifically, the NPP is more sensitive to precipitation than temperature, whereas RH and NEP are more sensitive to temperature than precipitation. The annual contribution rates of temperature and precipitation to the NEP are 28.79% and 23.23%, respectively. Additionally, drought has an important impact on the carbon source/sink in Central Asia. Drought intensified from 2001 to 2008, leading to a significant expansion of the carbon source area in Central Asia. Therefore, since the start of the 21st century, climate change has damaged the NEP of the Central Asian ecosystem. Varying degrees of warming under different climate scenarios will further aggravate the expansion of carbon source areas in Central Asia. An improved understanding of climate change impacts in Central Asia is critically required for sustainable development of the regional economy and protection of its natural environment.

Plant C:N:P stoichiometry patterns and response to soil salinity among organs (e.g., leaves, stems and roots) reflect plants’ trade-offs between access to resources and their adaptation strategies to different habitats. Common in marshes of arid middle-lower reaches of the Shule River Basin, China, Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. Ex Steud. (P. australis), is often the dominant species. The effects of soil salinity on the C:N:P stoichiometry among organs of P. australis were investigated in this study. The average N and P concentrations in leaves (19.09 ± 0.63 and 0.98 ± 0.05 g·kg−1, respectively) were significantly greater than those in roots (3.16 ± 0.16 and 0.76 ± 0.05 g·kg−1, respectively) and stems (3.80 ± 0.16 and 0.55 ± 0.05 g·kg−1, respectively) (P &lt; 0.05). However, the average C concentrations in leaves (406.47 ± 5.37 g·kg−1) were not significantly different from those in stems (405.63 ± 6.03 g·kg−1) and roots (402.83 ± 7.94 g·kg-1) (P &gt; 0.05). The N:P ratio in leaves (20.89 ± 0.81) was significantly greater than those in stems (8.95 ± 0.67) and roots (5.11 ± 0.49), while C:N and C:P ratios (22.33 ± 0.82 and 469.25 ± 26.81, respectively) were significantly lower than those in stems (114.56 ± 4.93 and 1014.49 ± 86.57, respectively) and roots (144.58 ± 8.25 and 693.00 ± 74.18, respectively) (P &lt; 0.05). N and P concentrations of leaves and C concentration of stems under high soil salinity were significantly lower than those in low and medium soil salinity, whereas C:P and N:P ratios of leaves and C:P ratio of stems were significantly greater than the others (P &lt; 0.05). Soil salinity played a dominant role in determining leaf's and root's C:N:P stoichiometry of P. australis. This indicated that plant in arid marshes adapt to soil salinity conditions by modulating the changes in solute penetration in leaves and roots. These lead to diverse stoichiometric response patterns of C:N:P stoichiometry among organs. The information helps to understand C:N:P stoichiometry patterns, nutrient utilization strategy and carbon allocation of dominant plants and its potential responses to global changes in the marsh wetland ecosystems of arid regions. © 2021 The Authors","C:N:P stoichiometry; Marshes; Phragmites australis; Shule River Basin; Soil salinity gradients",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116351475

However, the social inequality generated by the social-technical system will bring huge obstacles to the low-carbon consumption transformation. Scholars have studied the carbon emission reduction potential brought by DCI, but they have not paid attention to social inequality. The demand hierarchy of daily consumption activities reflects social inequality, providing a new perspective for the study of social inequality in low-carbon consumption. Therefore, we divided consumption activities into survival, development and luxury according to demand hierarchy, taking DCI as the core independent variable, and socio-economic factors as the control variable into the order logistics model to analyze its direct and interactive effects on low-carbon consumption, and further explore social inequality based on the above results. This study shows that DCI improves the low-carbon level of residents' survival and development consumption activities, but reduces the low-carbon level of luxury consumption activities. The driving force of low-carbon consumption is different between urban and rural areas. Urban residents are actively produced by environmental protection awareness, while rural residents are passively formed under the influence of economic conditions. Education and income are signs of social inequality. Residents with low education and high income tend to be green in survival consumption activities, but luxury consumption activities tend to be high-carbon.

Accurate prediction of natural gas consumption can provide reference for relevant departments to formulate the corresponding development plans and strategies. At present, there are many forecasting tools for processing and analysing natural gas consumption, but most of them have the disadvantages of complex modelling or low precision. In order to solve this problem, inspired by the polynomial regression prediction model and the discrete grey prediction model, a novel polynomial discrete grey prediction model with fractional order accumulation (abbreviated as FPDGM(1,1) model) is established in this paper. In order to find the optimal parameters of the FPDGM(1,1) model, three most popular intelligent algorithms are used to solve the parameters of the model, and then the optimal parameters from the three intelligent algorithms are selected in this paper. In addition, the advantages of the FPDGM(1,1) model over other four forecasting models are confirmed through two parts in this paper. First, the natural gas consumptions of four municipalities in China are used as cases to verify the effectiveness of the FPDGM(1,1) model in this paper. Subsequently, the FPDGM(1,1) model and several kinds of frequently used forecasting models are applied to analyse and predict China's natural gas consumption, and the FPDGM(1,1) model is used to predict China's natural gas consumption in the next 5 years. The results of these two parts indicate that the FPDGM(1,1) model shows the best predictive performance in all cases. Lastly, based on the predicted results of the FPDGM(1,1) model, some reasonable suggestions are put forward for China's natural gas development plan. © 2021","Discrete grey prediction model; Natural gas consumption; Optimization algorithm; Polynomial regression prediction model","Emission control; Forecasting; Gases; Polynomials; Development plans; Development trends; Discrete gray prediction model; Forecasting modeling; Grey prediction model; Intelligent Algorithms; Natural gas consumption; Optimal parameter; Optimization algorithms; Polynomial regression prediction model; Natural gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110470517

A challenge to understanding both growth and feedbacks from local to global scales is that many critical metabolic processes vary among species. An innovation in solving this challenge is the recognition that species can be lumped into “functional groups” based on metabolic similarity, and these functional groups can then be studied in computational models that simulate ecosystem function. Despite the vast resources devoted to functional group studies and the progress made by them, an important logical and biological question has not been formally addressed, “How do the groupings alter the results of modeling studies?” To what extent do modeling results depend on the choices made in aggregating taxa into functional groups. Here, we consider the effects of using different aggregation strategies in simulating the carbon dynamics of a deciduous forest. Understanding the impacts that aggregation strategy has on efforts to simulate regional-to-global-scale forest dynamics offers insights into both ecosystem regulation and model function and addresses this central problem in the study of carbon dynamics. © 2021 by the authors.

Low-carbon cities have attracted widespread attention for their attempts to coordinate the relationship between environmental protection and economic development. Using the panel data from 2006 to 2017 of prefecture-level cities in China, this study applied the difference-in-differences (DID) method to analyze the effects of LCC on the total factor productivity (TFP) of the cities and its possible transmission mechanism. The results show significantly positive effects on TFP, but the effects on each component of TFP are different. Although the LCC has promoted technical progress and scale efficiency, it has inhibited technical efficiency. The accuracy of the results has been confirmed by several robustness tests. Mechanism analysis showed that the pilot policy of low-carbon cities has promoted technical progress and scale efficiency by technological innovation and the upgrading of industrial structure, but resource mismatches among enterprises have been the main reason for reduced technical efficiency. Regional heterogeneity analysis showed that the effects on TFP in the eastern region have been more significant than in the central and western regions. In the eastern region, they have promoted technical progress, while in the central and western regions, they have promoted technical progress and scale efficiency but hindered technical efficiency. This paper presents our findings for the effects of LCC on economic development and provides insightful policy implications for the improvement of technical efficiency in low-carbon cities. © 2021 by the authors.

However, we have only incomplete knowledge about the seasonal and inter-annual variations observed among these microbes and about their methane regulation mechanisms with respect to glaciers, glacial melting, snow lakes and coastal marine water. This gap in our knowledge limits our understanding of the linkages between climate and environmental change. In the Arctic, there are large reservoirs of methane which are sensitive to temperature changes. If global warming intensifies, larger quantities of methane stored in deep soil and sediments will be released into the atmosphere, causing irreversible effects on the global ecosystem. Methane production is mainly mediated by microorganisms. Although we have some knowledge of microbial community structure, we know less about the methane-correlated microbes in different land types in the Svalbard archipelago, and we do not have a comprehensive grasp of the relationship between them. That is the main reason we have written this paper, in which current knowledge of microorganisms and methane-correlated types in High Arctic Svalbard is described.

In absolute values, nuclear energy has held steady, fossil energy contracted, and clean energy RD&D quadrupled. As a percentage of overall investments, both fossil fuel and nuclear investments contracted during the period. This review compares the energy innovation priorities of the world's largest economies using the metric of public expenditures on energy RD&D. China and India have become important global public investors in energy innovation, now among the top five globally. Priorities set by the Chinese and Indian governments will thus influence new energy technology breakthroughs in the coming years. The US and Chinese governments are now competing for first place in clean energy RD&D, depending on whether or not nuclear and cross-cutting technologies are included. India has dedicated substantial funding to indigenizing nuclear power technologies. Energy RD&D by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in major emerging economies remains skewed toward fossil fuels and nuclear. Reforming SOE expenditures to move away from fossil fuels could have a major impact on global energy technology trajectories, making a material difference in the quest to decarbonize the energy system.

To mitigate environmental problems, it is important to promote the accommodation of renewable energy with strong fluctuations through hosting capacity evaluation of the distribution network. A feasible region evaluation method is proposed to characterize an accurate region of renewable energy accommodation capacity in the distribution network on short-time scales. The evaluation model based on the optimal power flow model is established with the objective of minimizing the operating cost of the distribution network, satisfying the operational constraints. Through multi-parametric programming, the constraints of the optimal power flow model are projected onto the boundary of the feasible region. Each operation point (the renewable generator output) in the feasible region can be directly obtained, which can serve for real-time dispatch with safety. Simulation results show that the proposed method can accurately obtain the feasible region of renewable energy accommodation capacity and the computational efficiency has been greatly improved compared with the Monte Carlo method. © 2021 The Author(s)","Feasible region; Multi-parametric programming theory; Real-time dispatch; Renewable energy accommodation","Acoustic generators; Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Emission control; Monte Carlo methods; Energy and climate policies; Evaluation methods; Feasible regions; Multi-parametric programming; Multi-parametric programming theory; Optimal power flow model; Power; Real-time dispatch; Renewable energies; Renewable energy accommodation; Electric load flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120858291

Microbial life history strategies determine their responses to soil resource availability, thereby affecting soil nutrient cycling. However, our knowledge about microbial strategies under different management practices is limited. The objective of this study was to explore how microbial functional traits and life history strategies respond to different cropping patterns. We analyzed bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities as well as their functional traits under different cropping patterns in representative soybean (Glycine max) planting regions across China using high-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR data. Results showed that intercropping increased soil carbon and nitrogen pools, while rotation reduced soil carbon pool. By analyzing the shared species between keystones and indicators (keystone indicators), the selection of microbial communities by cropping patterns was observed at both taxonomic and functional levels. Intercropping harbored more bacterial and fewer fungal keystone indicators than rotation, which were characterized by special substrate preference in the two systems. Moreover, soil properties oppositely influenced bacterial and archaeal core functional traits, but did not limit fungal core functional traits. The ecological associations between soil properties and microbial functional traits illustrated that bacterial and archaeal life history strategies were affiliated to resource acquisition, while fungi adopted high yield strategy. Taken together, the results indicated that different soybean cropping patterns impacted trait-based microbial life history strategies by changing soil nutrients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Functional traits; Keystone indicators; Life history strategies; Microbial communities; Soil nutrient availability; Soybean cropping practices",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107642724

To date, there were few field experiments which investigated soil type effects on N2O emissions. Thus a 2-year field study was conducted to measure N2O emissions and soil environmental variables from three different soils that were formed from similar parental rock under the same climate. Seasonal N2O fluxes ranged from 0.18 to 0.40 kg N ha−1 for wheat seasons and 0.40 to 1.50 kg N ha−1 for maize seasons across different experimental soils. The intra- and inter-annual variations in N2O emissions were mainly triggered by temporal dynamics of soil temperature and moisture conditions. On average, seasonal N2O fluxes for acidic soils were significantly lower than for neutral and alkaline soils in cold-dry wheat seasons while significantly greater than for neutral and alkaline soils in warm-wet maize seasons. These determined differences of N2O emissions were mainly caused by differences of initial soil properties across different soils. Moreover, seasonal N2O fluxes were positively correlated with soil pH in wheat seasons, but negatively correlated in maize seasons. The temperature sensitivity coefficient (Q10) of soil N2O emissions for acidic soil (4.06) were significantly greater than those for neutral (1.82) and alkaline (1.15) soils. Overall, N2O emissions for acidic soils were not only higher than those for neutral and alkaline soils but also more sensitive to changing temperature. The present study highlights that soil type is needed to be carefully considered for regional estimate and proposing mitigation strategy of N2O emissions especially in subtropical mountain regions with inherent great heterogeneity of soil type. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","N2O emission; Soil type; Subtropical mountain area; Temperature sensitivity","Alkalinity; Crops; Landforms; Tropics; Acidic soils; Alkaline soils; Different soils; Mitigation strategy; N$-2$/O; N2O emission; Neutral soils; Soil types; Subtropical mountain area; Temperature sensitivity; Soils; acid soil; nitrogen dioxide; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; soil emission; soil type; temperature anomaly; article; climate; cold stress; field study; maize; moisture; nonhuman; season; soil acidity; soil temperature; temperature sensitivity; wheat; soil; nitrous oxide; Nitrous Oxide; Seasons; Soil; Triticum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111056283

Based on the fine-grained user energy consumption data obtained by load intelligent perception, this paper proposes a user energy efficiency evaluation method through fuzzy comprehension evaluation. First, the energy consumption characteristics at appliance level which can effectively represent energy consumption behaviour of users are designed and filtered, and then the energy efficiency evaluation strategy of appliances based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is established. The strategy adopts two-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. The first appliance-level fuzzy evaluation realizes the energy efficiency evaluation of the appliances.

The aim of these proposals is to avoid the economic decline and poverty of the Region. The first part, based on the literature and the best available practices, the proposals for the necessary environmental restoration of mine lands. Concerning the economic rehabilitation of the Region, a mix of actions referring to the whole production chain: from the primary to the tertiary sector of the economy, is proposed. The action that is expected to enhance the production potential of this region is the creation of branded products, under a single brand name, which will voluntarily bring together, in the context of synergies, the agri-food and manufacturing activities. Overall, it is estimated that the deadline set for de-lignification in 2023, is too early to start all those activities that will allow the economic transition of the Region, and to exclude the possibility of a massive wave of migration. For this reason, the extension of de-lignification, for a period of time within the European objectives to achieve the target of climate neutrality in 2050, are proposed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120564735

Three policies and two mixed policies, including improving the fuel economy of passenger cars, promoting electric vehicles (EVs), and promoting natural gas vehicles (NGVs), are analyzed in this study. The two groups of mixed policies are developed to analyze the interaction between the policies. The results indicate that all the policies will reduce TTW and WTW fuel consumption and GHG emissions from 2016 to 2035. During this period, promoting an NGV policy will have the smallest marginal abatement cost (MAC) but the smallest GHG reduction potential, and promoting an EV policy will have the largest MAC but the largest GHG reduction potential from TTW. However, considering the GHG emissions from upstream energy consumption, the GHG emission reduction from promoting the EV policy is reduced and that of improving the fuel economy via the motor vehicle policy will increase significantly, resulting in a larger MAC from WTW than from TTW. With the mixed policies, hedging effects impact fuel savings, GHG emission reductions, and MACs. We put forward some policy suggestions to provide a reference for the formulation and adjustment of China's urban road transportation policies to cost-effectively mitigate GHG emissions in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cost-effectiveness analysis; GHG emission Reduction; Low-carbon policy; Mixed policy; Road transportation","Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Emission control; Energy utilization; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Motor transportation; Natural gas; Natural gas vehicles; Roads and streets; Urban transportation; Wheels; Cost effectiveness analysis; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouse gas reductions; Low-carbon policies; Marginal abatement costs; Mixed policy; Reduction potential; Road transportation; Well-to-wheel; Cost effectiveness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115891248

However, exactly how intercropping and reduced nitrogen applications affect symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the roots and soils of intercropped maize/soybean plants cultivated in South China remains unknown. Thus, we evaluated the diversity, composition, and structure of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community in the roots, rhizosphere and the bulk soils of maize (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) with no nitrogen fertilization (N0), reduced nitrogen fertilization (N1), and conventional nitrogen fertilization (N2) in a sweet maize/soybean strip intercropping system (S2B4) and in monocultures (SB or SS) during a 4.5-year period (2013–2017, for a total of 9 cropping seasons). We classified 120 operational taxonomic units based on Miseq sequencing data, including one phylum, 7 families, 7 genera, and 25 virtual species. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonization was lower only in the roots of soybean associated with the intercropping system (S2B4) under no fertilization (N0) than in those in other treatments. Glomus was the most predominant genus in the roots and soil in both monocultures and intercropping systems among the N0, N1, and N2 groups. Significantly higher diversity and co-occurring species were observed in the N0 group than in the N1 and N2 groups, and significant differences in the community structure were found in all treatments. Moreover, the pH, soil organic matter, available nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and available phosphorus (AP) were the main driving forces shaping the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community in maize rhizosphere and bulk soils, whereas only the pH influenced the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community in soybean soils. In conclusion, both nitrogen application and intercropping influenced the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community composition and structure, but nitrogen application had a stronger influence than cropping pattern on the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community diversity in the maize/soybean strip intercropping systems; moreover, pH, NO3-N, and AP were the main factors driving the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community structure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Community structure; Maize/soybean strip intercropping; MiSeq platform; Nitrogen application",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104457507

Marine macroalgae (seaweeds) contribute to global primary production and by taking up CO2 they may ameliorate and regulate global climate change. Seaweeds also have direct and indirect economic importance by providing food and bioactive compounds for human benefit. Nonetheless, all these benefits could be jeopardized by the ongoing pressures, both local and global, on marine environments. In this study we examine the effects of dissolved CO2 and seasonal seawater temperature on the growth rates (measured weekly changes in biomass and expressed on a daily basis) of two model species, Ulva rigida (Chlorophyta) and Gracilaria conferta (Rhodophyta), which are common in the intertidal zone of the Israeli Mediterranean Sea, and cultivated by the local seaweed industry. The seaweeds were grown in land-based 40 L fiberglass tanks fertilized with sufficient N and P, supplied with running seawater and continuous air bubbling to keep equal exposure of the seaweeds to nutrients and light. The tanks were also provided with aeration with regular air (ambient CO2, ~ 400 ppm) or CO2-enriched air (~780 ppm). Seaweeds exposed to CO2–enriched seawater grew faster, 32.5 and 8.5% growth per day for U. rigida and G. conferta, respectively. Following calculations of productivity rates, market price, and input cost, we estimate production and show a quadratic production function with respect to temperature for each CO2 concentration. Thus, there is an optimal temperature that maximizes seaweed output. Based on the production function estimates and using market prices, maximal short-run profits were obtained at ca. 22.5 °C and 27.5 °C for U. rigida and G. conferta, respectively. These results may provide useful information for seaweed growers on what and where to grow seasonally, and how farming activities should adapt to external changes in temperature and CO2 concentration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 concentration; Growth; Photosynthesis; Production function; Profit","biomass; carbon dioxide; cultivar; cultivation; global climate; intertidal environment; macroalga; primary production; seawater; Mediterranean Sea; Chlorophyta; Gracilaria conferta; Rhodophyta; Ulva rigida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108453478

However, the high cost of production, operation, sun- tracking system, and the environmental sensitivity made them unprofitable for urban contexts. Lenses are more efficient and effective, but the complexity of manufacturing made them less used in sustainable architecture. This research proposes a liquid lens to be integrated into buildings' envelope and compared with a PTC based on the energy production and reduced CO2 emissions over a year. The output energy, temperature, and efficiency of concentrator are obtained by the physics of light equations, and Ray-tracing software simulation. The results show that water lenses are at least 6% more efficient, their output temperature is higher, their underneath greenhouse effect made them less sensitive to the environment, and are still productive in high latitudes where PTCs are not operative.

The pine stands of the comparable age (38–45 years old), and a similar structure, selected for research, is grown in the sanitary protection zone of the city of Lipetsk (Lipetsk Region, Russia) in the vicinity of the metallurgical combine (Novolipetsk Steel). Using atomic absorption spectrometry determined cadmium and zinc content in the soil, fine (< 1 mm) roots, annual shoots, and needles. In the impact zone, the Novolipetsk Steel releases significant contamination of the soil’s surface layers with cadmium and zinc. The present investigation identifies the changes in cadmium and zinc content in the soil that correlated (moderately and strongly) with acidity and humus in the ground. The pine fine roots in the impact zone take in these metals sufficiently, with zinc being absorbed more intensively than cadmium. As against the fine roots, it has been indicated that one-year needles and shoots actively cumulate zinc.

In this paper, a hybrid system of fuel cell-wind turbine was assessed based on energy. For a country region with a sustainable wind speed, the system was studied, and its benefits and limitations were evaluated. In this work, based on regional wind data, the specifications of the elements were determined, and a model was simulated, which can assess the power production of a power plant. In the case study region, Kohak Qazvin, by applying the model, wind turbine capacity increased about 2%, and wind turbines and fuel cells contributed 39% and 61% in demand supplying, respectively. Some undesirable environmental effects of renewable energy were evaluated in this paper, including changes in regional ecosystem, thermal pollution production, chemical pollution, and biological pollution due to the use of fuel cell systems and digestive power plants. This paper investigates the environmental effects of using a hybrid wind turbine system, electrolysis system, solid oxide fuel cell and gasifier. The results showed that the hybrid system reduced 34.62% of carbon dioxide production, compared to the single system.

In particular, we report about the pilot study on seismic, deformation, and pore pressure monitoring of the Mirandola hydrocarbon cultivation facility in Northern Italy. This site hosts the Cavone oil field that was speculated of possibly influencing the 2012 ML 5.8 Mirandola earthquake source. According to the guidelines, the monitoring center should analyse geophysical measurements related to seismicity, crustal deformation and pore pressure in quasi real-time (within 24–48 h). A traffic light system would then be used to regulate underground operations in case of detecting significant earthquakes (i.e., events with size and location included in critical ranges). For these 2-year period of guidelines experimentation, we analysed all different kinds of available data, and we tested the existence of possible relationship between their temporal trends. Despite the short time window and the scarce quantity of data collected, we performed the required analysis and extracted as much meaningful and statistically reliable information from the data. We discuss here the most important observations drawn from the monitoring results, and highlight the lessons learned by describing practical issues and limitations that we have encountered in carrying out the tasks as defined in the guidelines. Our main goal is to contribute to the discussion about how to better monitor the geophysical impact of this kind of anthropogenic activity. We point out the importance of a wider seismic network but, mostly, of borehole sensors to improve microseismic detection capabilities. Moreover, the lack of an assessment of background seismicity in an unperturbed situation -due to long life extraction activities- makes it difficult to get a proper picture of natural background seismic activity, which would be instead an essential reference information for a tectonically-active regions, such as Northern Italy.

Several temporal and spatial patterns of green technology have been adopted to reduce carbon emissions in different regions of China. In China, agriculture industries may have colossal importance for reducing carbon emissions. On the basis of the data from 1998 to 2018, the study uses the heterogeneous stochastic frontier model to quantify the carbon emission reduction potential of agricultural green technology progress in eastern, central, and western regions of China by using the heterogeneous stochastic frontier model. We also analyze the coefficient of variation and its spatial and temporal evolution pattern of carbon intensity decline potential index and explore the potential factors related to the agriculture green technology progress of China. The finding of the study revealed that the carbon emission rate in the agriculture industry of China is very high, whereas adopting green technology is slower because of economic and policy-related factors—the carbon emission of green technological progress. In terms of spatial variations, the changes in various regions were consistent with the overall fluctuating rate compared with the state of another country, but an increasing trend has been traced within the “east-central-west” regions. The overall regional differences are gradually trending, but differences between regions mainly cause them. The increase in the structure of the agricultural agriculture industry, the level of labor, and the increase in administrative environmental regulations will weaken the obstacles to the carbon emission reduction potential of green technological progress. The increase in urbanization, the level of the agricultural economy, and economic and environmental regulations will increase the carbon emission reduction potential of green technological progress. It is necessary to actively promote exchanges and cooperation in green agricultural technology and advanced management concepts, accelerate the optimization and upgrading of the industrial structure, and achieve the goal of peaking carbon emissions through regional coordinated development. Regionally, the overall external environment and the level of green technology progress in the western region need to be improved in all respects. The central and eastern regions need to focus on combining different policy tools to transform them from hindrance to promotion.

With the help of the carbon transfer mechanism, the study is designed to evaluate the ecological compensation of grain trade within urban, rural areas, and provinces in China. This current study applied the carbon footprint model of grain crops in various provinces and measures d the inter-provincial and urban–rural carbon transfer through a multi-objective optimization model. Obtained results show that the carbon footprint of crops for per-unit production of corn, wheat, and rice is higher in the southwest and northeast region than that of the northwest and southeast region, but across the regions, a net carbon sink trend was observed. The carbon footprint of wheat production in Inner Mongolia and rice in Shandong showed a net carbon emission effect and had negative externalities toward environmental protection. Carbon balance can be attained with a balance carbon payment system, but a proper carbon payment mechanism is not developed in China. Hence, concerning establishing a scientific and reasonable time-worthy carbon ecological compensation policy is urged by this current study. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon compensation; Carbon footprint; CHINAGRO model; Ecological prospects; Grain subsidy; Regional ecological inequity","carbon emission; carbon footprint; environmental economics; environmental protection; rural area; spatiotemporal analysis; trade-environment relations; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103660919

The demands of heat (e.g., pool water heating, domestic hot water, space and supply air heating) and electricity (e.g., Saunas, pool pumping and ventilation) in SHs are both very high, which indicates the high energy saving potentials. This paper comprehensively introduced and summarized the energy-saving potentials mainly for the heating system in SHs. After briefly introducing the global energy and building energy backgrounds, the energy system of SHs was firstly introduced, including its energy use and breakdown, ventilation demand, and heat losses. Then, renewable and sustainable energy sources applied in SHs were reviewed, especially solar energy application in terms of individual solar-assisted heating and hybrid solar-assisted heat pump systems, while geothermal and biomass and other energy applications were also introduced briefly. Furthermore, building energy management (BEM) strategies were introduced and summarized comprehensively, including waste heat utilization, prediction of energy demand and consumption, control and optimization of HVAC system, and demand response potentials of both electricity and district heat. In the discussion part, the recommendations of high-efficient or energy-saving technologies in SHs were given as well as the future development. Finally, suggestions were given for achieving energy efficiency and carbon reduction in SHs via using renewable energy sources (especially solar energy), optimizing the energy and HVAC systems, possible waste heat recoveries, and applying demand response of energy. In addition, establishing feasible and comprehensive energy indexes to evaluate energy use in SHs is also essential in the future. © 2021","Demand response; Energy efficiency and saving; Heating energy system; Solar energy utilization; Swimming halls; Waste heat recovery","Carbon; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Geothermal energy; Heat pump systems; Heating; Ventilation; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Demand response; Energy; Energy savings potential; Energy systems; Energy use; Heating energy system; HVAC system; Solar energy utilization; Swimming halls; Waste-heat recovery; Solar energy; air conditioning; energy efficiency; heating; public space; solar power; thermal power; ventilation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113371299

The spatial scale heterogeneity of influencing factors is explored by using the multiscale geographically weighted regression model to make the regression results more accurate and reliable. The results show that (1) SO2 emissions showed spatial clustering characteristics during the study period, decreased by 85.12% through pollution governance, and exhibited spatial heterogeneity of differentiation. (2) The spatial distribution direction of SO2 emissions’ standard deviation ellipse in cities was “northeast– southwest”. The gravity center of the SO2 emissions shifted to the northeast, from Zhumadian City to Zhoukou City in Henan Province. The results of hot spots showed a polarization trend of “clustering hot spots in the north and dispersing cold spots in the south”. (3) The MGWR model is more accurate than the OLS and classical GWR regressions. The different spatial bandwidths have a different effect on the identification of influencing factors. There were several main influencing factors on urban SO2 emissions: the regional innovation and entrepreneurship level, government intervention, and urban precipitation; important factors: population intensity, financial development, and foreign direct investment; secondary factors: industrial structure upgrading and road construction. Based on the above conclusions, this paper explores the spatial heterogeneity of urban SO2 emissions and their influencing factors, and provides empirical evidence and reference for the precise management of SO2 emission reduction in “one city, one policy”. © 2021 by the authors.

The poverty reduction that leads to popualtion structure and lifestyle changes would have an impact on GHG emission changes. However, few studies have assessed the historical and future impacts of the poverty allevation on China's emissions. Here by linking Chinese Multi-Regional Input Output (MRIO) database to the global MRIO database EXIOBASE, and using provincial household consumption data, we identified the distribution of Chinese household greenhouse gas footprints (HGFs) by income groups in 2015 at the national and provinical levels. Moreover, we focused on the historical impact of poverty alleviation on HGFs during 2010–2015, and developed four scenarios to project future HGFs changes due to poverty alleviation by 2030. We find that eradicating extreme poverty in the secanrio S2, i.e., bringing people to an income above $1.9 daily, does not cause a large emission impact with current technological level. However, lifting people from a higher poverty line of $5.5 per day in the sceanrio S4 results in a 1.6% increase in emissions compared with the scenario S1 without any poverty reduction goals. Furthermore, realizing a higher poverty reduction target will result in an increase of emissions contribution from internatioanl supply chains due to the differences in consumption patterns among different income groups. Our study highlights the conflict between the high poverty alleviaition goal and emission reduciton in China, and reminds us of the need to make more technological efforts for avoiding the large emissions embodied in international supply chains. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","China; Household GHG emissions; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Poverty reduction","Gas emissions; Supply chains; China; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouses gas; Household greenhouse gas emission; Income groups; Input-output; Input/Output analysis; Multi-regional input-output analyse; Poverty alleviation; Poverty reduction; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118739234

However, rare studies have considered to alleviate the SUHI from a network perspective, which was demonstrated by first building a SUHI network to identify the key nodes and links of a SUHI network and subsequently breaking this network to effectively mitigate SUHI. Here, a new approach to build SUHI network is proposed, which integrates morphological spatial pattern analysis and circuit theory. It includes: i) identification of stable and high-risk SUHI patches, ii) extraction of the “core” type, iii) evaluation of “core” importance, iv) construction of a friction map, and v) generation of links and pinch-points. Dongguan city was selected as case and the results showed: 1) 42 links were identified with 31 pinch points located in these links; 2) Most of these links and pinch-points were distributed in the southwestern and northwestern regions; 3) Cooling measures (patch-based) should be implemented in these specific areas to avoid connections between the links and nodes that could seriously aggravate the thermal environment of entire region.

NGHs account for one-third of the mobile organic carbon on Earth, acting as a carbon storage reservoir in the carbon cycle. Hydrate-based technologies including CO2 capture, CO2 separation, and natural gas storage and transportation can also be used to reduce greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4) emissions and have excellent application potential. However, the implications of the energy supply transition, NGH extraction, and hydrate-based technologies for future climate change mitigation have not been deeply recognized. This paper comprehensively discusses the global energy supply and environmental challenges and transitions, and NGHs and their role in the energy supply, carbon cycle, and historical and future climate change, and summarizes the state-of-the-art developments in hydrate-based technologies and NGH exploitation methods and their potential environmental impacts, thereby providing a perspective on the roles of NGHs and their related technologies in the future energy supply and climate change mitigation.

Plastic mulching is suspected to be a significant source of microplastics in terrestrial environments. Straw incorporation has many effects on the storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) and greenhouse gas emissions, but these effects have not been studied in the presence of microplastic pollution. In this study, 365-day soil incubation experiments were conducted to assess the effects of maize straw and polyethylene microplastics on SOC fractions and carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in two different soils (fluvo-aquic and latosol). Against the background of straw incorporation, microplastics reduced the mineralization and decomposition of SOC, resulting in a microbially available SOC content decrease by 18.9%. In addition, microplastics were carbon-rich, but relatively stable and difficult to be used by microorganisms, thus increasing the mineral-associated SOC content by 52.5%. This indicated that microplastics had adverse effects on microbially available SOC and positive effects on mineral-associated SOC. Microplastics also decreased coarse particulate SOC (&gt;250 μm), and increased non-aggregated silt and clay aggregated SOC (&lt;53 μm). Furthermore, microplastics changed microbial community compositions, thereby reducing the CO2 and N2O emissions of straw incorporation by 26.5%–33.9% and 35.4%–39.7%, respectively. These results showed that microplastics partially offset the increase of CO2 and N2O emissions induced by straw incorporation. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of microplastics on CO2 emissions in fluvo-aquic soil was lower than that in latosol soil, whereas the inhibitory effect on N2O emissions had the opposite trend. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Greenhouse gases; Plastic mulching; Soil organic carbon; Straw incorporation","Aggregates; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Microorganisms; Microplastic; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Soils; Agricultural practices; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouses gas; Inhibitory effect; Microplastics; N$-2$/O; Plastic mulching; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic carbon content; Straw incorporations; Greenhouse gases; agricultural practice; comparative study; greenhouse gas; inhibition; mulching; organic carbon; plastic waste; pollution effect; soil organic matter; soil pollution; straw; China; carbon; nitrous oxide; plastic; agriculture; China; greenhouse gas; soil; Agriculture; Carbon; China; Greenhouse Gases; Microplastics; Nitrous Oxide; Plastics; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110191895

The effect of soil moisture caused by eCO2 on soil microbial communities and functioning may be of high importance in water limited ecosystems. To address this knowledge gap, we measured the functional composition, structure, and functional processes of soil microbial communities under eCO2 and an irrigation treatment simulating water availability with eCO2 at two soil depths (0–5 cm and 5–15 cm) in a mixed-grass semiarid prairie. The overall functional diversity increased and the microbial composition and structure were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) altered in response to eCO2 and irrigation treatments. A greater number of key functional genes involved in soil, i.e. carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) cycling were stimulated under eCO2 than under irrigation treatment. Structural equation modeling (SEM) suggested that eCO2 significantly impacted soil microbial community structure by mediating both soil moisture and plant biomass, while irrigation influenced soil microbial community structure merely via regulation of soil moisture. Moreover, in this water-limited system, soil moisture mediated eCO2 effects on soil microbial functional structure were relatively more important than those mediated by plant activity. The present study further improves our understanding of how global climate change regulates soil microbial functional processes in a semiarid grassland ecosystem. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Elevated carbon dioxide; Functional genes; Irrigation; Semiarid grassland ecosystem; Soil microbial community","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Ecosystems; Forestry; Genes; Irrigation; Soil moisture; Water treatment; %moisture; Elevated carbon dioxide; Elevated CO$-2$; Functional genes; Irrigation treatments; Semi-arid grasslands; Semiarid grassland ecosystem; Soil microbial; Soil microbial community; Soil microbial community structure; Microorganisms; carbon dioxide; climate change; geodiversity; global climate; irrigation system; microbial community; semiarid region; soil microorganism; soil moisture; soil-vegetation interaction; species diversity; water availability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105694026

The structure of air pollution spillover varies with changes in season and space. Researching the spatial and seasonal characteristics of air pollution spillover is beneficial for determining air pollution prevention and control policies. First, this paper uses the GARCH-BEKK model to correlate the air pollution spillover among cities. Second, a complex network is constructed, and cities that have stronger spillover correlations are grouped into the same region. Finally, motifs are analyzed regarding the spillover relationships among regions. This paper also compares the structure of air pollution spillover during various seasons. This study determines that every season has a core region where the air pollution spillover exits the region. The core region in the spring is western East China, in the summer it is northern East China, in the autumn it is northern East China, and in the winter it is northern North China. These regions interact with most other regions. Furthermore, in spring and winter, the phenomena of air pollution spillover between regions are stronger than those in summer and autumn. We can weaken the air pollution spillover by controlling the air pollution in core regions. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the problem could not be solved by simply adding more power plants for various technical reasons, such as the unsuitability of using renewable energy as baseloads due to its intermittency. Furthermore, establishing the required cooperative systems for regionally distributed power adjustment is also tricky. Based on these backgrounds, this paper constructs an operation plan that minimizes CO2 emissions by correcting the generation and load patterns of the renewable energy of solar power, utilizing power generation from waste as a substitute for baseload power, and estimating the power demand of each facility. The result shows that by adjusting the operation plans, the model can reduce CO2 emission by 20.95 and 8.30% in weeks with high and low solar power generation surpluses, respectively. Furthermore, these results show that it is possible to reduce CO2 emissions in regions that have power sources with low CO2 emission coefficients by forecasting the amount of power generation and power load in the region and appropriately planning the operation in advance. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, China has initiated and implemented strict air pollution control measures over last several years to reduce impacts of air pollution. Monitoring data from Jan 2015 to Dec 2019 on six criteria air pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5, and PM10) at eight sites in southwestern China were investigated to understand the situation and analyze the impacts of transboundary air pollutants in this region. In terms of seasonal variation, the maximum concentrations of air pollutants at these sites were observed in winter or spring season depending on individual site. For diurnal variation, surface ozone peaked in the afternoon while the other pollutants had a bimodal pattern with peaks in the morning and late afternoon. There was limited transport of domestic emissions of air pollutants in China to these sites. Local emissions enhanced the concentrations of air pollutants during some pollution events. Mostly, the transboundary transport of air pollution from South Asia and Southeast Asia was associated with high concentrations of most air pollutants observed in southwestern China. Since air pollutants can be transported to southwestern China over long distances from the source regions, it is necessary to conduct more research to properly attribute and quantify transboundary transport of air pollutants, which will provide more solid scientific guidance for air pollution management in southwestern China. © 2021 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University","Air pollutants; Southwestern China; Transboundary transport","air quality; atmospheric pollution; developing world; pollutant; pollutant transport; pollution control; transboundary pollution; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107454490

First SiO2 NPs, prepared by the Stöber method, were dispersed in toluene. This dispersion was added to a PE solution in toluene. After heating (either in air or under Ar) a fluorescent mixture was obtained. After drying, PE films were obtained by compression molding, which showed strong blue fluorescence, attributed to CQDs. SiO2 NPs loading values varied between 0.5 and 4 wt %. Subsequent to isolation, the fluorescent CQDs were characterized by TEM, UV-vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy. TEM imaging unveiled a lattice spacing value of 0.21 nm of the isolated fluorescent particles which is typical for (100) graphite plane lattice spacing in CQDs. UV spectroscopy and fluorescence measurements show characteristic absorption and excitation spectra for the aromatic core and oxidized surface defects typically observed for CQDs. The emission maximum for PE/CQD samples increased from 394 to 408 nm when the reaction temperature was decreased from 110 to 90 °C, which is attributed to increasing oxygen content in the reaction mixture upon decreasing the reaction temperature. When the reaction was performed under Ar, the PE/CQD samples emitted in the ultraviolet region (286 nm). Finally, we demonstrated that PE samples marked with CQDs can be easily visually identified upon irradiating with 367 nm light. Thus, the marked PE can be used, for example, as a labeling ingredient in master batches for component identification and in recycling. ©","carbon quantum dots; fluorescence; optical markers; plastic sorting; polyethylene; silica nanoparticles","Fluorescence; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Mixtures; Nanocrystals; Polyethylenes; Semiconductor quantum dots; SiO2 nanoparticles; Surface defects; Synthesis (chemical); Toluene; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Carbon quantum dots; Facile synthesis; Fluorescent markers; Lattice spacing; Nanoparticle agglomerates; Optical markers; Plastic sorting; Reaction temperature; Silica nanoparticles; Synthetic approach; Silica nanoparticles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118620944

Theil–Sen median trend and geographic distribution analyses were conducted to characterize the spatiotemporal variations in regional PM2.5 concentrations. The results indicated that anthropogenic aerosol concentrations were much higher in the fast-growing and densely populated eastern and southern parts of China. Before 2000, PM2.5 concentrations varied little in most areas, and they only notably increased during 1990–1999 in southern China and South Korea. At that time, 88% of EA's population was exposed to lower levels of PM2.5 pollution (annual PM2.5 ≤ 35 μg/m3). From 2000 to 2009, the air quality substantially deteriorated over the entire study region, and the rates of increase of the population-weighted PM2.5 concentration reached 1.6 (1.1–1.9) μg/m3/yr in east China and 1.4 (1.1–1.6) μg/m3/yr in south China. Almost 50% of the population was exposed to the highest level (Level 5) of pollution (annual PM2.5 &gt; 35 μg/m3). To combat air pollution, the State Council of China promulgated the toughest-ever Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in 2013, which effectively decreased PM2.5 concentrations in the heavily polluted east and south China. As the air quality improved, the population exposed to annual PM2.5 concentrations of &lt;35 μg/m3 returned to 63.5% in 2018. An age-group analysis indicated that, even with decreasing levels of pollution, the older adult (≥65 years old) population exposed to Level 5 pollution peaked in 2019 at 83.1 million. This implies that, as the issue of population aging becomes increasingly important in EA, additional strict control of primary PM2.5 and precursor emissions will be required to help decrease the pollution-related health risks facing residents of EA. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","AOD; North China Plain; Population aging; Sulfate; Theil–Sen median","Air pollution control; Air quality; Geographical distribution; Health risks; Population statistics; AOD; East Asia; East China; Exposed to; Level 5; North China Plain; PM 2.5; Population aging; South China; Theil–sen median; Sulfur compounds; black carbon; fossil fuel; organic carbon; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; sulfuric acid; aerosol; age; aging; air quality; concentration (composition); estimation method; particulate matter; pollution exposure; trend analysis; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; Article; China; Chinese; combustion; controlled study; desert climate; economic development; geographic distribution; greenhouse gas; health hazard; particulate matter; particulate matter 2.5; PM2.5 exposure; population density; population exposure; remote sensing; South Korea; surface property; time series analysis; trend study; urbanization; vegetation; World Health Organization; China; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115798375

Identifying urban ventilation paths is helpful to save energy, reduce emissions, and improve the urban ecological environment. Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei, and it has a high urban built intensity and hot summers. Taking Wuhan city, with a size of 35 km ×50 km, as an example, the built environment was divided into grids of 100 m × 100 m and included the building density, floor area ratio, and average building height. The ventilation mechanism of the urban built intensity index has previously been explained. The decrease in building density is not the sole factor causing an increase in wind speed; the enclosure and width of the ventilation path and the height of the front building are also influential. Twelve urban built units were selected for CFD numerical simulation. The ventilation efficiency of each grid was evaluated by calculating the wind speed ratio, maximum wind speed, average wind speed, and area ratio of strong wind. The relationship between the urban built intensity index and ventilation efficiency index was established using the factor analysis method and the Pearson correlation coefficient; building density and average building height are the most critical indexes of ventilation potential. In addition, the layout of the building also has an important impact on ventilation. A suitable built environment is that in which the building density is less than 30%, the average building height is greater than 15 m, and the floor area ratio is greater than 1.5.

In order to further improve the luminescence of Ho3+, halogen ions (Cl, Br, I) were introduced to reduce the maximum phonon energy and phonon state density of the sample. At the same time, Nd3+ was introduced to transfer the energy to Ho3+ pumped with a 793 nm laser (Nd3+:4F5/2,4F3/2→Ho3+:5I6). The effect of different halogen ion on the luminescent properties of the fluoride halide glass was compared. The results show that the luminescent intensity of infrared increases with the introduction of different halogen ions. By comparison, it is found that the sample with I– has the strongest luminescence of 1064 nm, 2.0 μm and 2.9 μm. This is consistent with the calculated J-O intensity parameters. In addition, the 2.0 and 2.9 μm emission of Ho3+ pumped with a 450 nm laser will not disappear. A mid-infrared sample with multi-wavelength excitation and multi-wavelength emission can be obtained. Nd3+/Ho3+ co-doped fluoride halide glasses with 1064 nm, 2.0 μm and 2.9 μm luminescence were prepared by melt quenching method. The luminescent mechanism and the energy transfer process between the two ions of Nd3+/Ho3+ co-doped fluoride halide glass were studied. The J-O parameters, luminescence lifetime and absorption emission cross-sectional area of Ho3+ and Nd3+ were calculated, respectively. It is found that the value of Ω2 in the glass matrix increases with the introduction of different halogen ions, while Ω4 and Ω6 do not change obviously in different glass compositions. This is because the environment of the crystal field around the rare earth ions changes. The crystal phase and phonon energy of the sample were analyzed by X-ray diffraction pattern and a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, respectively. Based on the above spectra and data (phonon energy is 634.71 cm−1), it can be predicted that Nd3+/Ho3+ co-doped fluoride halide glass is a potential mid-infrared luminescent material. © 2021 The Authors","Energy transfer mechanism; Halogen ion substitution; Mid-infrared emission; Multi-wavelength tunable; Rare earth ion","Crystals; Energy transfer; Fluorine compounds; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Glass; Infrared devices; Metal ions; Phonons; Pumping (laser); Rare earths; Energy transfer process; Fourier transform infrared spectrometer; Luminescence lifetime; Luminescent intensity; Luminescent mechanism; Melt quenching method; Multi-wavelength emissions; Phonon state density; Luminescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098651460

As a low-pollution and low-consumption transportation organization mode, multimodal freight transport has been highly valued. Strengthening the organization and management of multimodal freight transport between seaports and inland areas is conducive to reducing carbon emission levels and logistics costs in the transportation industry. In the multimodal freight transport network, a reasonable hinterland for the main hub port can effectively avoid homogeneous competition, realize the optimal allocation of transport resources, and promote the integrated and coordinated development of the region. In constructing a multimodal freight transport network and arranging a reasonable organization mode, it is beneficial to divide the hinterland of main hub ports and promote energy conservation and emission reduction in the transportation industry. From the perspective of hinterland division and coordination of transportation organization methods, we construct a 0–1 planning model to minimize total cost, transportation time, and carbon emissions. By combining the nondominated ranking method and ideal point method, the algorithm sifts and reorganizes each transportation mode and path in different cities, thereby further overcoming the subjectivity of the weighting method and obtaining the nondominated Pareto optimal frontier solution set. Finally, the evaluation function is used to determine the optimal scheme. Taking the main hub port in the Yangtze River Delta region as an example to verify the validity of the model and algorithm, this research can provide decision support for departments when they formulate policies related to optimizing the regional transportation structure, can promote regional integration and coordinated development of coastal and inland areas, and has practical significance for the “dual carbon” goal. © 2021","Carbon emissions; Collaborative optimization; Inland hinterland; Multimodal freight transport; Sea hub port","Carbon; Decision support systems; Emission control; Pareto principle; Ports and harbors; Carbon emissions; Collaborative optimization; Freight transport; Inland hinterland; Multi-modal; Multimodal freight transport; Optimisations; Sea hub port; Transport networks; Transportation industry; Freight transportation; algorithm; carbon emission; energy conservation; freight transport; government; logistics; port operation; transportation mode; China; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116902353

This study examines possible energy planning pathways for the district through the development of a long-term optimization model and a range of energy scenarios until 2050. The scenarios explore different CO2 emission reduction strategies and technology mixes/parameters. Results suggest which low-carbon energy conversion technologies and efficiency measures should be adopted by the district alongside supportive local policies and targets. Photovoltaic (PV) and waste energy converters are two renewable energy technologies which are taken up at maximum possible rates in the evaluated scenarios to reduce long-term CO2 emissions. Once local renewable resources are exhausted, natural gas-based combined-cycle plants (CCP) and combined heat and power plants (CHP) are required to further reduce emissions, alongside efficiency measures in the built environment. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies also demonstrate the potential to drastically reduce emissions; however, local feasibility studies are needed to support their implementation. Study results prescribe renewable energy share and CO2 emission reduction targets until 2050 for the district.

This study investigated the above and below-ground biomass and soil carbon of a citrus-based intercropping system in six sites (subdivisions: Bhalwal, Kot Momin, Sahiwal, Sargodha, Shahpur and Silanwali) of District Sargodha, Southeast Pakistan. Tree biomass production and carbon were assessed by allometric equations through a non-destructive approach whereas, soil carbon was estimated at 0–15 cm and 15–30 cm depths. Above and below-ground biomass differed significantly, and the maximum mean values (16.61 Mg ha−1 &amp; 4.82 Mg ha−1) were computed in Shahpur due to greater tree basal diameter. Tree carbon stock fluctuated from 6.98 Mg C ha−1 to 10.28 Mg C ha−1 among selected study sites. The surface soil (0–15 cm) had greater bulk density, organic carbon, and soil carbon stock than the subsoil (15–30 cm) in the whole study area. The total carbon stock of the ecosystem ranged from 25.07 Mg C ha−1 to 34.50 Mg C ha−1 across all study sites, respectively.

Usually destructive methods require a lot of time and cost. And the non-destructive methods to repeatedly estimate the biomass of herbaceous plants across large scale environmental conditions are still limited. Leymus chinensis, as an important constructive species, constitutes a unique community type in the eastern Eurasian steppe across the semi-humid, semi-arid and arid areas in the middle temperate and warm temperate zones. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the driving factors and establish a unified estimation equation of the aboveground biomass (AGB) of L. chinensis across large scale. In this study, for the first time, we combined climatic factors and plant characteristics to analyze the individual AGB of L. chinensis in northern China, and established a non-destructive prediction model that can accurately quantify the AGB of L. chinensis across large scale in China. 33 sites across different climate conditions with L. chinensis as the constructive species in China were sampled to measure plant traits of L. chinensis individual, including leaf thickness (LT), stem diameter (SD), stem length (SL), plant height (PH), etc. We found that plant traits (PH,SD) were the main factors driving the AGB of L. chinensis individuals, and climate factors mainly affected AGB of L. chinensis individuals indirectly by affecting plant traits. Then, we established the AGB estimation equation of L. chinensis individuals across large scale for the first time. The equation was: AGB = −0.638 + 0.405*SD + 0.017*PH, which had a high predictive ability.

This paper utilizes the natural experiment of China's World Trade Organization accession to identify reductions in trade policy uncertainty (TPU) and constructs a difference-in-differences model to explore the effect of TPU reduction on the energy intensity of Chinese industrial firms. The empirical results reveal that (1) TPU reduction significantly decreases firm's energy intensity; (2) Export, innovation and technical progress are mechanisms to interpret the decline of energy intensity after the reduction of TPU; and (3) The energy-saving effect of TPU reduction is higher for foreign-funded and privately owned firms than for state-owned firms, higher for coastland firms than for inland firms, and higher for polluting firms than for others. In addition, the degree of marketization and absorptive capacity of technology transfer in regions can increase the effect of TPU reduction on energy intensity. These conclusions provide evidence that decreasing the degree of TPU can help achieve the targets of energy conservation and emission reduction. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Difference-in-differences; Energy intensity; Innovation; Technology progress; Trade policy uncertainty","Emission control; Energy conservation; Technology transfer; % reductions; Difference-in-differences; Differences-in-differences; Energy intensity; Innovation; Technology progress; Trade policies; Trade policy uncertainty; Uncertainty; Uncertainty reduction; International trade; industrial enterprise; innovation; technological development; technology transfer; trade policy; uncertainty analysis; World Trade Organization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116227690

However, the rational design of electrocatalysts with highly catalytic activity and product selectivity towards CO2 reduction remains a challenging task. Herein, the theoretical screening based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations was performed to design the two-dimensional single-atom catalysts (M@2D-FeS2) and to systematically investigate the catalytic activity of catalysts toward CO2 electroreduction. Co@2D-FeS2 shows superior catalytic activity and selectivity towards HCOOH production, and significantly suppresses the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The better HCOOH activity is associated with the lower d-band center and the localized charge distribution of transition metal atom. Ti@2D-FeS2 and V@2D-FeS2 exhibit good catalytic activity for CO production from CO2 electroreduction. Their overpotentials required for CO production are lower than that of the most active Au electrode. Ti@2D-FeS2 and V@2D-FeS2 serve as better catalysts to produce syngas. Cr@2D-FeS2 is a promising catalyst to produce CH4 from CO2 electroreduction. Cr@2D-FeS2 shows an exceptional performance for CH4 production, and outperforms the currently most active CO2RR-to-CH4 catalysts. Specifically, only a lower overpotential of 0.36 V is required to enable CO2 reduction to CH4. Cr@2D-FeS2 is also catalytically active towards C2H4 production due to the relatively lower overpotential of 0.64 V. The reduced overpotentials and excellent product selectivity could provide an encouraging motivation for experimental efforts to explore the advanced generations of highly-efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Density functional theory; Electrochemical reduction; FeS2; Single-atom catalysts; Two-dimensional material","Atoms; Boron; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Chromium compounds; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Product design; Pyrites; Titanium compounds; Transition metals; CH$-4$; CO$-2$/ reduction; Density-functional-theory; Electro reduction; Electrochemical reductions; FeS$-2$; Overpotential; Single-atom catalyst; Two-dimensional materials; ]+ catalyst; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107674756

The success of diffusion depends critically upon advanced intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and the level of infrastructure. Several studies have discussed the relationship between technology spillover and CO2 emissions. However, very few studies have addressed the impacts of socio-economic factors, particularly IPR protection and transportation infrastructure (TI) (the two concepts that are directly related to technology spillover), on this relationship. Therefore, this study used an extended Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) model to explore the relationship between technology spillover and CO2 emissions in China from 1997 to 2018. The study accounted for two threshold variables (IPR protection and TI) in a threshold model to explore the nonlinear effect of technology spillover on CO2 emissions. The findings revealed that: (1) when the IPR protection value was below 8.169, different forms of technology spillover had an optimal effect on CO2 emission reduction; (2) the scale of TI construction should be moderate and below the threshold value; otherwise, greater environmental pressure would occur; and (3) threshold points varied geographically. The results indicated that the level of IPR protection and TI should be adapted to the regional development characteristics to promote economic development and minimize environmental impacts. © 2021 The Author(s)","CO2 emission; Technology spillover; Threshold effect","Carbon dioxide; Curve fitting; Emission control; Environmental technology; Intellectual property; Laws and legislation; Regional planning; CO$-2$/ emission; Curve modeling; Economic development; Environmental Kuznet's curve; Intellectual property rights protections; Socioeconomic factors; Technology spillovers; Threshold analysis; Threshold effect; Transportation infrastructures; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105294211

Many characteristics of the climate system, including the surface temperature, ocean heat content (OHC), convective precipitation, total runoff, ground evaporation, soil moisture, sea ice extent, and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, did not fully return to their initial values when the historical or future natural and anthropogenic forcing agents were reversed. The surface temperature and OHC declines lagged behind the decline in greenhouse gases (GHGs). Reverses in other variables occurred in direct response to the decline in GHGs. The sea level increased, even after all of the forces returned to the original values. Furthermore, most of the climate variables did not return to their original values because of thermal inertial. The end states of variables, other than those related to thermal storage, mainly depended on the original state of the natural and anthropogenic forces, and were unaffected by the future growth rate of the GHGs. The climate policy implication of this study is that climate change cannot be completely reversed even if all the external forces are returned to their initial values. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115604945

However, this reaction typically suffers from moderate efficiency and uncontrollable H2/CO ratio. Herein, we report a general acetonitrile treatment approach to create nitrogen vacancies (NVs) on the surface of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) photocatalyst. The type and distribution of NVs are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, positron annihilation spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and element analysis. Results confirm that the NVs are mainly stemmed from the selectively breaking of surface N-(C)3 sites of PCN. In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and DFT calculations determine that the NVs can improve the activation and reduction of CO2, while considerably lowering the formation barrier of COOH* intermediates. Besides, the NVs modification can accelerate the separation and transfer kinetics of photogenerated charge carriers of PCN. As a result, the NVs-PCN exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity. The syngas production rate of the NVs-PCN is almost 10 times higher than that of the pristine PCN under visible light. Importantly, the syngas H2/CO ratio can be tuned between 0.24:1 and 6.8:1 by merely adjusting the concentrations of NVs. Furthermore, we found that this NVs engineering can also promote the visible-light harvesting of PCN, hence realizing efficient syngas production under visible light, even under low-energy red light irradiation (610 nm). Also, this defect implantation strategy can be further extended to synthesize other NVs-functionalized PCN for syngas production with high efficiency. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon nitride; CO2 reduction; Nitrogen vacancy; Photocatalysis; Visible light","Carbon nitride; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Light; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Photocatalysis; Synthesis gas; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; CO$-2$/ reduction; Element analysis; Magnetic elements; Nitrogen vacancies; Photocatalytic reduction; Resonance analysis; Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance; Syngas production; Visible light; X-ray photoelectrons; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108951770

Taking the Dongting Lake catchment as the study area, this study used spatial analysis, an ecosystem service value (ESV)-equivalent factor method, grid method, and other spatial analysis methods to explore land-use changes and the corresponding ecological service value response from 1990 to 2015, to provide an important theoretical reference for ecological service management, regional planning and ecological service function improvement in the Dongting Lake Basin. Our findings are as follows: (1) apart from a trend of notable expansion in construction land, the land-use types in the Dongting Lake catchment did not change significantly. (2) Grassland had the fastest transfer-out rate; forest land were cultivated land comparably transferred to each other with a larger area, where both were simultaneously and continuously transferred out as construction land; water areas, wetlands, and construction land were all transferred in, where construction land had the fastest transfer rate. (3) The total ESV of the watershed first increased and then decreased, but the overall change was small; spatially, the wetlands and water areas had a higher ESV, whereas construction land and cultivated land had lower ESVs. (4) Soil protection, gas exchange, climate regulation, biodiversity, and water conservation are always the main ecosystem service functions of a catchment, where the service function of the catchment ecosystem is greater than the productive function. The increase in construction land was the main factor for the increased differences between the spatial distributions of the soil, raw materials, biodiversity protection, and gas exchange. © 2021 by the authors.

Pore-scale investigation can enlighten the accurate REV (Representative Elementary Volume) scale simulation models to take heat transfer and mass transfer limitation into account for better recovery forecast. In this work, a pore-scale numerical model based on the lattice Boltzmann method was developed to couple the multicomponent multiphase flow, heat and mass transfer, heterogeneous reaction, and solid structure evolution during the dissociation of gas hydrates. Numerical simulation of the methane hydrate dissociation in an idealized square cavity and a realistic porous structure was studied to understand the influence of mass transport, water saturation, and heat transfer. This study distinguished the hydrate dissociation characteristics in the kinetics-limited and diffusion-limited regimes. The mass-transfer-limitation in the diffusion-limited regime indicated that the enriched methane on the hydrate-water interface decreased the hydrate dissociation rate with the increasing water saturation. The methane concentration gradient across the water layer varied with the water layer thickness and contributed to the decomposition nonuniformity. The decreasing temperature gradually reduced methane recovery efficiency and yield during the endothermic decomposition due to decreasing the equilibrium pressure and intrinsic kinetic rate. Some implications were addressed from the pore-scale understanding of the transfer and kinetics characteristics. The local thermal equilibrium at the solid–fluid interface implied that the one-temperature equation is sufficient to model the heat transfer at the REV scale. The present study proposed a corrected reaction model based on the equivalent water layer thickness and introduced the implementation procedure in the REV-solution to account for the mass-transfer-limitation on the hydrate dissociation rate. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Effective reaction rate model; Heat and mass transfer; Lattice Boltzmann method; Methane hydrate; Multiphase flow","Dissociation; Gas hydrates; Heat transfer; Hydration; Kinetic theory; Kinetics; Methane; Multiphase flow; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Phase interfaces; Recovery; Effective reaction rate model; Heat and mass transfer; Hydrate dissociation; Lattice Boltzmann method; Mass transfer limitation; Methane hydrate dissociation; Methane hydrates; Multiphases; Pore scale; Representative elementary volume; Mass transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105732490

Since green growth addresses both economic performance and environmental sustainability, it is necessary for sustainable development. To gauge the environmental impact of increased output, researchers use conventional measure of output growth. However, these measures are not adjusted for pollution and hence, do not reflect the true growth performance of the economy. For this purpose, this study aims to investigate the role of green growth in limiting carbon emissions in the USA for the period of 1990–2019. The authors further examine the role of globalization and renewable energy consumption in affecting CO2 emissions of USA. The results show that in the long run, green growth, output, renewable energies, and globalization are important factors in affecting CO2 emissions of USA. The results of frequency causality test show that there is unidirectional causal relationship from output renewable energy consumption, green growth, and globalization to CO2 emissions in the long run and medium run. This study suggests interesting policies for achieving targets of carbon neutrality. There is a dire need to take instant actions to control climate change and to mitigate greenhouse gases (GHGs). To achieve the target of carbon neutrality, a downward adjustment of economic growth is necessary, which will help the country to abate the pollution emissions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon neutrality; CO2 emissions; DOLS; Frequency causality test; Globalization; Green growth; Renewable energy consumption","carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; economic growth; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; econometric model; economic aspect; economic development; energy consumption; environmental impact; environmental policy; global change; greenhouse gas; human; productivity; renewable energy; seasonal variation; sustainable development; United States; greenhouse gas; United States; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Greenhouse Gases; Renewable Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112486709

In this paper, the density functional theory studied the energy band structure, charge transfer, and optical properties of graphene/ZnV2O6(001) heterojunction. The mechanism of performance enhancement of graphene/ZnV2O6(001) heterojunction is explored. The results state that the energy band structure of graphene/ZnV2O6(001) is reduced to 0.025eV due to graphene's hybridization. Under visible light irradiation, electrons transition from the top of the ZnV2O6 valence band to the conduction band and are excited to graphene due to the electrostatic field, which promotes electron–hole pairs' separation inhibit the recombination of carriers. The ground state interface electron transfer encourages the increase of surface electrons of graphene and accumulates a large number of holes on ZnV2O6(001). A good combination of ZnV2O6(001) and graphene is beneficial to charge transfer and improve photocatalytic efficiency. The calculated results show that the band structure of graphene/ZnV2O6(001) heterojunction has apparent advantages in improving the visible light photocatalytic efficiency, consistent with the present experimental observation.

However, severe air pollution episodes occurred frequently in Beijing. To explore the occurrence of severe air pollution during the quarantine period, the impacts of emission reductions, meteorological conditions, and regional transport on heavy air pollution were individually evaluated using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Observations showed that the more unfavorable meteorological conditions which occurred during the pandemic as compared to the corresponding 2019 levels, including higher temperature, relative humidity, and frequency of strong southerly winds, and lower HPBL, led to an increase in PM2.5 concentrations. The model results also showed that the meteorological conditions in February 2020 favored PM2.5 formation. The PM2.5 concentrations were mainly dominated by regional transport, which became more significant in the quarantine period than in 2019, suggesting the importance of joint control on regional sources for reducing heavy air pollution. This study highlights that, although the emissions in Beijing and surrounding regions were largely reduced during the quarantine period, severe air pollution in Beijing did not reduce due to the unfavorable meteorological conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

Amid these great benefits from urban green spaces, the cooling effects via shading and evapotranspiration can mitigate the urban heat island effect. The impact of urban green spaces (UGSs) on the urban thermal environment in Beijing was quantified as a case study of metacities using four metrics: Land surface temperature (LST), cooling intensity, cooling extent, and cooling lapse. Three hundred and sixteen urban green spaces were extracted within the 4th ring road of Beijing from SPOT 6 satellite imagery and retrieved LST from Landsat 8 remote sensing data. The results showed that the cooling intensity of green spaces was generally more prominent in the areas with denser human activities and higher LST in this metacity. Vegetation density is always the dominant driver for the cooling effect indicated by all of the metrics. Furthermore, the results showed that those dispersive green spaces smaller than 9 ha, which are closely linked to the health and well-being of citizens, can possess about 6◦ C of cooling effect variability, suggesting a great potential of managing the layout of small UGSs. In addition, the water nearby could be introduced to couple with the green and blue space for the promotion of cooling and enhancement of thermal comfort for tourists and residents. As the severe urban heating threatens human health and well-being in metacities, our findings may provide solutions for the mitigation of both the urban heat island and global climate warming of the UGS area customized cooling service. © 2021 by the authors.

The evaluation of the effectiveness of LCCP on haze pollution is greatly significant for air pollution prevention and control. Taking LCCP as the starting point, in this study we constructed DID, PSM-DID, and intermediary effect models to empirically test the impact and mechanism of LCCP on haze pollution, based on the panel data of 271 cities in China from 2005 to 2018. The findings show that (1) LCCP has significantly reduced the urban haze pollution, and the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in pilot cities decreased by 14.29%. (2) LCCP can inhibit haze pollution by promoting technological innovation, upgrading the industrial structure, and reducing energy consumption. Among these impacts, the effect of technological innovation is the strongest, followed by industrial structure, and energy consumption. (3) LCCP has significantly curbed the haze pollution of non-resource dependent cities, Eastern cities, and large cities, but exerted little impact on resource-dependent cities, Central and Western regions, and small and medium-sized cities. (4) LCCP has a spatial spillover effect. It can inhibit the haze pollution of adjacent cities through demonstration and warning effects. This study enriches the relevant research on LCCP and provides empirical support and policy enlightenment for pollution reduction. © 2021 by the authors.

This species’ capacities for carbon sequestration and sulfur mobilization make it a key player in oceanic biogeochemical cycles that influence climate on a planetary scale. Seasonal E. huxleyi blooms are abruptly terminated by viral epidemics caused by a clade of large DNA viruses collectively known as coccolithoviruses (EhVs). EhVs thereby mediate a significant part of material and energy fluxes associated with E. huxleyi population dynamics. In this study, we use spontaneous Raman microspectroscopy to perform label-free and non-invasive measurements of the macromolecular composition of individual virions and E. huxleyi host cells. Our novel autofluorescence suppression protocol enabled spectroscopic visualization of evolving macromolecular redistributions in individual E. huxleyi cells at different stages of EhV infection. Material transfer from E. huxleyi hosts to single EhV-163 virions was confirmed by combining stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments with Raman microspectroscopy. Inheritance of the host cells’ 13C-enriched isotopic signature was quantified based on red shifts of Raman peaks characteristic of phenylalanine’s phenyl ring. Two-dimensional Raman mapping of EhV-infected E. huxleyi cells revealed that the compact region producing an intense Raman DNA signal (i.e., the nucleus) in healthy E. huxleyi cells becomes diffuse during the first hours of infection. Raman DNA emissions integrated throughout individual cells decreased during the infection cycle. Our observations are consistent with EhV-163 degrading the host’s nuclear DNA, scavenging released nucleotides for its own genome replication, and shedding newly-produced virions prior to host lysis via budding.

However, a system analysis perspective is needed to ensure its sustainability. Life cycle assessment was used to estimate the environmental impacts of the production and use of two forest-based biofuels. These fuels, biodiesel and bioethanol, were derived from pulp and paper mills for use by marine shipping. They were compared to fossil fuels currently used by the marine shipping industry, those being Marine Gas Oil (MGO) and Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO). Future projection scenarios in 2030 and 2050 for estimating the environmental impacts of a transition from fossil fuels to biofuels in Arctic shipping were studied as well. The results indicate that a holistic view is very important for biofuel use. The production and use of forest-based bioethanol (BE) had a significantly lower impact on climate change (CC) potential, but had a higher impact on Human toxicity non-cancer effects (HTX), Human toxicity cancer effects (CE), Particulate matter (PM), Photochemical ozone formation (POF), Acidification potential (AP), Terrestrial eutrophication (TE), Freshwater Eutrophication (FE), Marine eutrophication (ME) and Freshwater Ecotoxicity (FEC). Replacing HFO with forest-based biodiesel reduced the potential AP by 55%. It also had a lower impact on the categories CC, PM, POF, TE, ME and FEC.

Gas fracturing, as a necessary and advantageous stimulation measure, can effectively achieve gas extraction from deep coal seams and ensure safe production in deep coal mines. In this study, a hydro-mechanical coupling model is established to analyze the damage characteristics of coal seams during gas fracturing. The model focuses on three aspects: (a). the fracture criterion of type-I fracture under the action of multiple stress states in the fracturing process; (b). the characteristics of post-peak strain softening of coal and its influence on coal permeability; (c). the influence of non-uniform stress state on directional compression deformation and directional permeability of coal. The difference between gas fracturing (nitrogen, CO2) and hydraulic fracturing is studied based on this coupling model. The development of fractures in coal seam gas reservoirs after gas fracturing is investigated, and the influences of the coal parameters of the gas extraction process after fracturing are determined. Results show that because of the different compression coefficients, viscosities of water and gas and the slippage effect, there are obvious differences in the fracturing pressure of gas and water. Under the same parameters, the hydraulic fracturing method needs larger fracture initiation pressure than the gas fracturing method (nitrogen, CO2). For two kinds of media (nitrogen, CO2) in gas fracturing, in addition to the parameter difference of gas itself, the adsorption of CO2 is also the main factor affecting the fracturing pressure. The increase of coal permeability and Biot's coefficient will reduce the fracture initiation pressure, and the increase of confining pressure will increase the fracture initiation pressure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Fracture criterion; Gas extraction efficiency; Gas fracturing; Hydro-mechanical coupling; Non-uniform stress","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal mines; Fracture; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydraulic fracturing; Metal recovery; Nitrogen; Coal seams; Coupling modeling; Fracture criterion; Fracture initiation pressures; Gas extraction efficiency; Gas extractions; Gas fracturing; Hydromechanical coupling; Non-uniform stress; Stress state; Extraction; coal mine; coal seam; gas production; hydraulic fracturing; hydromechanics; modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107437609

To cope with climate change, many countries have employed various policies and measures to reduce damage due to climate change. For individual residents, adaptation behaviour is vital for reducing individual welfare losses. This research analysed how psychological determinants and other external factors influence residents' intention to adapt to climate change. We proposed an extended protection motivation theory (PMT) model, developed a reliable scale and conducted a nationwide field survey. We interviewed 1402 residents in 29 provinces, and 874 valid questionnaires were collected, providing data that were used in a structural equation model. The results show that our model can serve as a reliable framework for analysing the determinants of residents' intention to adapt to climate change. Policy is the most important factor for stimulating the formation of residents' adaptation intention. Risk appraisals and adaptation appraisals have positive and significant impacts on the intention of residents to adopt climate change adaptation behaviour. Information and climate perception do not directly influence residents' behavioural intentions but indirectly affect their intentions through the process of risk appraisal and adaptation appraisal. Corresponding policy suggestions are made that may be helpful for the formulation of adaptation policies. © 2021","Behaviour; Climate change adaptation; Protective motivation theory; Structural equation model","Behavioral research; Climate models; Earth (planet); Risk perception; Surveys; Adaptation policies; Behavioural intentions; Climate change adaptation; Policies and measures; Protection motivation theory; Psychological determinants; Socio-economic factor; Structural equation modeling; Climate change; adaptation; behavioral response; climate change; field survey; perception; policy making; psychological phenomena; socioeconomic impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114121308

Biofertilizer application has been considered as an alternative option for agriculture sustainability and soil improvement. In this study, field trials were carried out to investigate the efficiency of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (BA) biofertilizer on alleviating ammonia volatilization in alkaline farmland soil and increasing crop yield and nitrogen utilization. Potential response mechanisms were investigated from soil enzyme, nitrogen cycle function genes and microbial community levels. Compared with conventional fertilization, BA biofertilizer application reduced the ammonia volatilization by 68%, increased the crop yield and nitrogen recovery by 19% and 19%, respectively. Soil enzyme activity analysis showed that BA biofertilizer inhibited the urease activity and enhanced the potential ammonia oxidation (PAO). In addition, BA biofertilizer application also increased the bacterial amoA gene abundance, while decreased the ureC gene abundance. BA biofertilizer also significantly altered the community structure and composition, and especially raised the abundance of ammonia oxidation bacteria (AOB), while no changes were observed in abundance of nitrite oxidation bacteria (NOB). Briefly, BA biofertilizer was approved to reduce the transformation of fertilizer nitrogen to NH4+-N, simultaneously accelerating NH4+-N into the nitrification process, thus decreasing the NH4+-N content remained in alkaline soil and consequently alleviating the ammonia volatilization. Thus, these results suggested that the application of BA biofertilizer is a feasible strategy to improve crop yields and reduce agricultural ammonia emissions. © 2021","Ammonia volatilization; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Biofertilizer; Microbial community; Nitrogen cycle functional genes","ammonia; fertilizer; nitrite; nitrogen; urease; ammonia; fertilizer; nitrogen; agricultural soil; ammonia; anthropogenic effect; bacterium; biofertilizer; community structure; crop yield; efficiency measurement; reduction; soil improvement; volatilization; agricultural land; alkalinity; Article; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; bacterial gene; community structure; controlled study; enzyme activity; harvest; microbial community; nitrification; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen utilization; nonhuman; oxidation; soil; soil acidity; soil fertilization; volatilization; agricultural land; agriculture; microbiology; volatilization; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Bacteria (microorganisms); Agriculture; Ammonia; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Farms; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Volatilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109818222

In this paper, a watershed scale framework that incorporates a CWS into a WPEPS is proposed for regional economic and ecosystem health sustainability. A strategy that integrates three allocation principles: per capita emissions, economic utility, and water quality contributions, is established for the initial CWS-incorporated WPEPS emissions permit allocations. To quantitatively verify the effectiveness of the CWS-incorporated WPEPS, a bi-level optimization model is formulated, in which fuzzy random variables are employed to describe the system uncertainties. The model is then applied to a practical case in the Chaohu watershed, China, to assess the effects of changing watershed management targets, from which practical insights are obtained on the initial emissions permit allocation strategies and the CWS coordination effects. It has proved that the integrated watershed management of the CWS-incorporated WPEPS is more able to rationally allocate the limited water pollution emissions permits and better balance the Chaohu watershed economic development to ensure ecological health sustainability. The CWS-incorporated WPEPS model under uncertainty can be used to guide local governments when formulating their sustainable watershed management strategies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bi-level optimization; Chaohu watershed; Constructed wetland systems; Fuzzy random uncertainty; Initial allocation; Water pollution emissions permit system","constructed wetland; economic development; emission; regional economy; resource allocation; sustainability; water pollution; water quality; Anhui; Chaohu Basin; China; Trachinotus falcatus; China; ecosystem; water pollution; water quality; wetland; China; Ecosystem; Water Pollution; Water Quality; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118811949

This paper describes the use of optimization consensus modeling to explore theoretical innovations regarding flexible carbon quota trading mechanisms, with basic allocation schemes provided within a closed-loop trading system by simultaneously taking revenue and fairness into account. A series of optimization consensus models are constructed from the perspective of maximizing the corresponding revenue, resulting in optimal/fair carbon quota allocation schemes that include detailed trading information, e.g., participating individuals, transferred quantities, and unit transaction prices. To solve these models, a relaxation method based on particle swarm optimization is proposed. The inability to conduct real-life GDM usually stems from conflicts of interest based on the decision-makers’ mutual competition, thus, two practical strategies are presented to deal with the resulting unfairness within the trading system. Finally, a numerical example incorporating five regions demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed trading mechanisms. The results show that sufficient interactions among decision-makers are of great significance in achieving fairness within a trading system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Allocation scheme; Carbon quota trading mechanism; Consensus; Group decision-making (GDM); Revenue and fairness","Commerce; Decision making; Mathematical programming; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Allocation scheme; Carbon quota trading mechanism; Closed-loop; Consensus; Consensus models; Group decision-making; Optimisations; Revenue and fairness; Trading mechanism; Trading systems; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113307924

Based on the single-regional input-output (SRIO), Tapio decoupling analysis (TDA), and structural decomposition analysis (SDA), this study investigated the dynamic variation feature and decoupling state of multi-sectoral carbon emissions, and revealed their driving factors of consumption-based emissions in Guangdong province from 2002 to 2017. The main discovery can be summarized as follows from results analysis. Firstly, electricity production sector and construction sector were the largest direct and embodied carbon emission sources, and capital formation was the most important factor with the contribution of approximately 100 % that led to embodied carbon emissions of construction. For most of the manufacturing and service sectors, the embodied carbon emissions caused by international export exceed 50 %. Secondly, the consumption structure, consumption per capita, and population effect promoted the embodied emissions during 2002–2012, while the emission intensity effect was the greatest offsetting factor for all sectors. Consumption structure effect was becoming a major driver to the increase of embodied carbon emissions for construction. Thirdly, agriculture, mining, energy transformation, and service sector showed the unsatisfactory decoupling relationship between direct carbon emissions and economic output. According to the decoupling states, the decoupling relationships in some secondary industries were overestimated under the situation of only considering direct carbon emissions. The obtained results and policy implications are expected to provide holistic reference for policymakers to promote the short-term carbon peak and long-term carbon neutrality of Guangdong province from the sectoral perspective. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions mitigation; Decoupling state; Guangdong province; Input-output model; Multiple sectors; Structural decomposition analysis","carbon; carbon; carbon dioxide; capital formation; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; emission control; input-output analysis; service sector; agriculture; analytic method; Article; carbon footprint; China; decomposition; decoupling analysis; economic development; electricity; energy; energy consumption; environmental planning; environmental sustainability; mining; socioeconomics; structural decomposition analysis; tapio decoupling theory; theory; time series analysis; economic development; industry; China; Guangdong; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112486308

In order to simultaneously study the evolution laws of fault sealing and structural stability evolution law under stress disturbance, the fault samples were first consolidated under previous effective stress (Ppre = 10 MPa) for 62 h to imitate the fault being under the ground stress; then, the effective stress (Pe) was reduced to 0.5 MPa and gradually changed to 20 MPa to imitate the stress disturbance. Permeability and strain were measured throughout the stress disturbance by the pressure pulse method and fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. In particular, high-precision FBG sensors were applied inside the fault to obtain the internal strains. The test results show that: (1) when Pe &lt; Ppre, the permeability rapidly decreased with increasing Pe, and a risk of leakage occurred. Conversely, when Pe &gt; Ppre, fault permeability changed little as Pe increased; but the permeability was still 4.91 times that of the undisturbed state. (2) The internal and external strain monitoring results revealed that the geometric centre of fault showed tensile strain, while other monitoring points showed compressive strain most of the time. The reason for this phenomenon is the end effect, which causes the gouge particles in the middle to move to both ends. (3) The normal deformation of fault gouge not only controls the fault volumetric strain but also controls the evolution of permeability. This study provides technical and theoretical support for the evaluation of fault sealing and structural stability when faults are disturbed in underground engineering development and construction.

We found that these smog-prone areas are often relatively a “local climate” and aim to explore this series of scientific problems. This paper uses remote sensing and data mining methods to study the correlation between haze weather and local climate. First, we select Beijing, China and its surrounding areas (East longitude 115◦ 20′ 11′′ –117◦ 40′ 35′′, North latitude 39◦ 21′ 11′′ –41◦ 7′ 51′′ ) as the study area. We collected data from meteorological stations in Beijing and Xianghe from March 2014 to February 2015, and analyzed the meteorological parameters through correlation analysis and a grey correlation model. We study the correlation between the six influencing factors of temperature, dew point, humidity, wind speed, air pressure and visibility and PM2.5, so as to analyze the correlation between haze weather and local climate more comprehensively. The results show that the influence of each index on PM2.5 in descending order is air pressure, wind speed, humidity, dew point, temperature and visibility. The qualitative analysis results confirm each other.

The regional biomass supply for a 20 MW bioelectricity facility is estimated using the Land Use and Resource Allocation (LURA) model. Results from LURA and data on regional forest management, harvesting, and processing are incorporated into the GHGs, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model for LCA. The results suggest that GHG emissions of mill residues-based pathways can be 15-52% lower than those of pulpwood-based pathways, with logging residues falling in between. Nonetheless, our analysis suggests that screening bioenergy projects on specific feedstock types alone is not sufficient because GHG emissions of a pulpwood-based pathway in one state can be lower than those of a mill residue-based pathway in another state. Furthermore, the available biomass supply often consists of several woody feedstocks, and its composition is region-dependent. Forest biomass-derived electricity is associated with 86-93% lower life-cycle GHG emissions than the emissions of the average grid electricity in the U.S. Key factors driving bioelectricity GHG emissions include electricity generation efficiency, transportation distance, and energy use for biomass harvesting and processing. © 2021 UChicago Argonne, LLC, Operator of Argonne National Laboratory.

In this paper, we assessed the total economic value of ES provided by UGI in the capital core area of Beijing by calculating the value of six types of ES related to high-density urban features: (1) climate regulation, (2) carbon sequestration and oxygen production, (3) water control and conservation, (4) air pollution reduction, (5) noise reduction (6) cultural services through the combination of replacement cost, carbon tax, shadow project, afforestation cost, and market price methods. The results showed that UGI generated economic benefits in the surveyed area of about CNY ¥ 1.56 billion (USD $ 240 million) per year or CNY ¥ 91.76 (USD $ 14) per capita. The largest share of ES came from carbon sequestration and oxygen production, amounting to about 46.32% of the total ES value. Our findings also revealed that the distribution of ES value patterns varied across communities.

And the models fail to provide quantized guidance for the operation of full-scale municipal solid waste incinerators. To address the problem, explainable Bayesian support vector regression (E-BSVR) has been established to generalized predict and maximumly reduce the PCDD/F emissions. First, forty-two PCDD/F samples were determined from a whole year experiment in a full-scale incinerator. Meanwhile, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene(1,2,4-TrCBz), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, oxynitride, particulate matter, fluoride, and hydrogen chloride were measured, as input features. Second, after box-cox transformation normalization, and hyperparameters tuning, the R-Squared and root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed method are 0.983 and 0.044, exhibiting high accuracy. The high accuracy (R-Squared = 0.992) and generalization are also proven on the dataset with high PCDD/F emissions. Then, the performances of BSVR are compared with kernel ridge regression, multiple linear regression, and unary linear regression, indicating afar smaller RMSE of BSVR. Finally, the optimal operating parameters are calculated through local interpretable model-agnostic explanations and the partial dependence plot. Results indicate that reducing the content of organic chlorine in municipal solid waste and inhibiting the deacon reaction are important methods for reducing PCDD/F emissions. The optimal operating parameters for the maximal reduction of PCDD/F emissions are 1,2,4-TrCBz &lt; 0.098 ug/m3, fluoride &gt; 0.452 mg/m3. As a whole, the E-BSVR method can be used as a reliable and accurate approach for the prediction and reduction of PCDD/F emissions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian algorithm; Model interpretation; Optimal operating parameters; PCDD/F; Support vector regression","Carbon monoxide; Chlorine compounds; Fluorine compounds; Forecasting; Mean square error; Municipal solid waste; Organic pollutants; Sulfur dioxide; Systematic errors; Bayesian; Bayesian algorithms; Dioxins and furans; Model interpretations; Operating parameters; Optimal operating parameter; Polychlorinated dibenzo- p - dioxins; Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and -furan; Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins; Support vector regressions; Linear regression; 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene; carbon monoxide; fluoride; hydrochloric acid; nitrogen derivative; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; sulfur dioxide; benzofuran derivative; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; algorithm; Bayesian analysis; emission; incineration; municipal solid waste; numerical model; PCDD; PCDF; prediction; regression analysis; algorithm; Article; Bayes theorem; chemical reaction; measurement accuracy; municipal solid waste; particulate matter; prediction; reduction (chemistry); support vector machine; air pollutant; Bayes theorem; environmental monitoring; incineration; Air Pollutants; Bayes Theorem; Benzofurans; Dibenzofurans, Polychlorinated; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorides; Incineration; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116399319

In order to achieve the seasonal characteristics and determine the potential sources of WSIIs in PM2.5 in Hangzhou, online systems were used to measure hourly mass concentrations of WSIIs (SO42−, NO3−, NH4+, Cl−, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+) as well as PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 at an urban site for one month each season (May, August, October, December) in 2017. Results showed that the hourly mass concentrations of PM2.5 during the whole campaign varied from 1 to 292 µg·m−3 with the mean of 56.03 µg·m−3. The mean mass concentration of WSIIs was 26.49 ± 20.78 µg·m−3, which contributed 48.28% to averaged PM2.5 mass. SNA (SO42−, NO3 − and NH4+) were the most abundant ions in PM2.5 and on average, they comprised 41.57% of PM2.5 mass. PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and WSIIs showed higher mass concentrations in December, possibly due to higher energy consumption emissions, unfavorable meteorological factors (e.g., lower wind speed and temperature) and regional transport. Results from PCA models showed that secondary aerosols and vehicle emissions were the dominant sources of WSIIs in the observations. Our findings highlight the importance of stronger controls on precursor (e.g., SO2 and NO2) emissions in Hangzhou, and show that industrial areas should be controlled at local and regional scales in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

The lack of easy, rapid methods for phenotyping epidermal cell traits have limited discoveries about the genetic basis of stomatal patterning. A high-throughput epidermal cell phenotyping pipeline is presented here and used for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in field-grown maize (Zea mays). The locations and sizes of stomatal complexes and pavement cells on images acquired by an optical topometer from mature leaves were automatically determined. Computer estimated stomatal complex density (SCD; R2 0.97) and stomatal complex area (SCA; R2 0.71) were strongly correlated with human measurements. Leaf gas exchange traits were genetically correlated with the dimensions and proportions of stomatal complexes (rg 0.39-0.71) but did not correlate with SCD. Heritability of epidermal traits was moderate to high (h2 0.42-0.82) across two field seasons. Thirty-six QTL were consistently identified for a given trait in both years. Twenty-four clusters of overlapping QTL for multiple traits were identified, with univariate versus multivariate single marker analysis providing evidence consistent with pleiotropy in multiple cases. Putative orthologs of genes known to regulate stomatal patterning in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were located within some, but not all, of these regions. This study demonstrates how discovery of the genetic basis for stomatal patterning can be accelerated in maize, a C4 model species where these processes are poorly understood. © 2021 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The microbiome of a karst river contaminated with antibiotics was studied. Through co-occurrence network analysis, six ecological clusters (MOD 1–MOD 6) with different distribution characteristics were determined, of which four were significantly correlated with antibiotics. The carbon fixation pathways in different ecological clusters were varied, and the dominant hydroxypropionate-hydroxybutyrate cycle and reductive acetyl-CoA pathway were negatively and positively correlated with antibiotics, respectively. Long-term antibiotic contamination altered the selection of carbonic anhydrase (CA) encoding genes in some of the CA-producing mineralization microorganisms. The selection of different carbon fixation pathways is a possible strategy for the microbial community to compensate for the adaptation costs associated with the pressure of antibiotics contamination and emergence of antibiotics resistance. Bayesian network analysis revealed that some carbon sequestration functions (such as β-CA and reductive acetyl-CoA pathway) surpassed certain antibiotic resistance genes in the regulation of environmental factors and microbial networks. An ecological cluster (MOD5) that possibly homologous to antibiotic contamination was the final node of the microbial community in karst river, which indicated that ecological clusters were not only selected by antibiotics, but were also regulated by multiple environmental factors in the karst river system. The carbon sequestration pathway was more directly reflected in the abundance of ecological groups than in the influence of CA. This study provides new insights into the feedback effect of karst system on typical pollutants generated from human activities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Antibiotics; Carbon fixation; Carbonic anhydrase; Environmental adaption; Karst river","Antibiotics; Bayesian networks; Carbon; Contamination; Ecosystems; Forestry; Genes; Landforms; Microorganisms; River pollution; Acetyl-CoA; Anhydrase; Carbon fixation; Carbon fixation pathway; Carbon sequestration; Environmental adaption; Environmental factors; Global carbon cycle; Karst river; Microbial communities; Rivers; antibiotics; carbon fixation; carbon sequestration; gene; karst hydrology; microbial community; pollutant; river pollution; antiinfective agent; carbon; Bayes theorem; carbon sequestration; China; human; microflora; river; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bayes Theorem; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; China; Humans; Microbiota; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111042960

It has caused cities to face problem of non-uniform distribution of urban climate parameters (e.g., temperature, velocity), may further leading to urban heat island (UHI) and increasing of building energy consumption etc. Thus, it is of great significance to explore the associated relationships between building height and urban climates from the urban scale by CFD simulation. There is almost a gap on urban scale simulation for both research and engineering because of the complex building diversity and expensive simulation cost. K-means clustering and low-dimensional method based on image recognition were utilized in this work to build the urban geometric model, further improving simulation efficiency. A case study of Nanjing city was selected (about 144 km2 containing 140 thousand buildings). The urban-scale simulation method was verified by experimental data. The numerical results show that the energy consumption of high-rise buildings (HRB) caused by UHI is about 1.2–4.5 %. The UHI intensity of HRB is 0–0.7 °C higher than that of middle-rise buildings (MRB) and low-rise buildings (LRB), while the velocities are similar around three different buildings height. In order to make the pedestrian area (at the height of 1.7 m from the ground) with pleasant urban climates in rapid urbanization process, it is suggested to set the building height between 19 and 50 m. The findings can be beneficial to alleviate the problems of UHI and energy consumption, which have important implications for urban optimization design. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Building height diversity; Energy consumption; K-means clustering; Urban design; Urban heat island; Urban-scale simulation","Atmospheric temperature; Cost engineering; Image enhancement; Image recognition; K-means clustering; Tall buildings; Building height; Building height diversity; Case-studies; Energy-consumption; K-means++ clustering; Urban climates; Urban design; Urban heat island; Urban scale; Urban-scale simulation; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113147171

The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical model for site selection decision of photovoltaic hydrogen production project (PVHPP) based on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, and take Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province as an example for analysis. Firstly, a set of evaluation criteria system including natural factors, economic factors, technical factors, social factors and environmental factors is constructed. Secondly, probabilistic hesitation fuzzy linguistic term set (PHFLTS) and trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy set (TIT2FS) are combined to describe the information of qualitative criteria. Then, the subjective and objective weights are calculated by using best-worst method (BWM) and criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC), and the comprehensive weights are obtained by using the idea of game theory. The multi-attribute boundary approximation regional comparison (MABAC) method is then used to sort the alternative plant sites. The ranking results show that A2 (Chongli District) performs the best, and A1 (Qiaodong District) is the second best. Finally, taking Zhangjiakou as an example, sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis are carried out to verify the validity and reliability of the model. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","BWM; CRITIC; MABAC; Photovoltaic hydrogen production project (PVHPP); Site selection","Decision making; Game theory; Hydrogen production; Linguistics; Photovoltaic cells; Reliability analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; BAD methods; Best-bad method; Boundary approximations; Criteria importance through intercriteria correlation; Decision framework; Multi-attribute boundary approximation regional comparison; Multi-attributes; Photovoltaic hydrogen production project; Photovoltaics; Selection decisions; Site selection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116856971

This study provides an explanation of the reasons for the decline in China's air pollution through theoretical model construction and simulation. Firstly, a DGE (Dynamic General Equilibrium) model, including time and space dimensions, is used to describe the mechanism for energy structure adjustment and environmental regulation affecting air pollution in China. Secondly, the parameters of the theoretical model are adjusted for simulation. The simulation results show that the government environmental control has positive policy effect, both in reducing air pollution and in promoting economic growth, while energy structure adjustment only works in curbing air pollution. Further simulations found that the effectiveness of government environmental control depends on whether there are regional differences in policy implementation and the choice of policy paths. Thirdly, panel data from 286 cities at prefecture level and above in China from 2010 to 2018 verified the simulation. The empirical results verified the availability of government environmental control and energy structural adjustment in improving air quality. From the analysis of heterogeneity, the government environmental control showed better air pollution control effect in big cities, and the policy effect of government environmental control was gradually improving over time. The following policy implications are proposed: research on alternative energy sources, adjustment of energy structure, and the coordinated development of government environmental control in various regions are the main strategies for improving air quality. Adopting the ""fast first and then slow"" governance policy, designing the ""north first and then south,"" and ""heavy first and lighter"" air pollution control measures can achieve better control effects. © 2021","Air pollution; DGE model; Energy structure; Environmental control; PM2.5","Air pollution control; Air quality; Economics; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Quality control; Air pollution in chinas; Dynamic general equilibrium; Dynamic general equilibrium model; Energy structure adjustments; Energy structures; Environmental control; General equilibrium models; PM$-2.5$; Policy effects; Theoretical modeling; Public policy; atmospheric pollution; computer simulation; environmental policy; general equilibrium analysis; numerical model; particulate matter; pollution policy; theoretical study; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110314429

Meanwhile, a high incidence of respiratory and circulatory diseases has been observed in Linyi. The relationship between air pollutants and the prevalence of respiratory and circulatory system diseases in Linyi is still unclear, and therefore, there is an urgent need to assess the human health risks associated with air pollutants. In this study, the number of outpatient visits and spatial distribution of respiratory and circulatory diseases were first investigated. To clarify the correlation between diseases and air pollutant emissions, the residential intake fraction (IF) of air pollutants was calculated. The results showed that circulatory and respiratory diseases accounted for 62.32% of the total causes of death in 2015. The incidence of respiratory diseases was high in the winter, and outpatient visits were observed for more males (60.9%) than females (39.1%). The spatial distribution suggested that outpatient visits for respiratory and circulatory diseases were concentrated in the main urban area of Linyi, including the Hedong District, Lanshan District, and Luozhuang District, and especially at the junction of these three areas. After calculating the IF combined with the characteristics of pollution sources, meteorological conditions, and population data, a high IF value was concentrated in urban and suburban areas, which was consistent with the high incidence of diseases. Moreover, high R values and a significant correlation (R > 0.6, p < 0.05) between outpatient visits and residential IF of air pollutants imply similar spatial distributions of outpatient visits and IF value of residents. The spatial similarity of air pollution and outpatient visits suggested that future air pollution control policies should better reflect the health risks of spatial hotspots. This study can provide a potentially important reference for environmental management and air pollution-related health interventions.

The Porter hypothesis emphasizes that environmental policies can create both environmental and economic dividends, building a win-win prospect for energy efficiency and economic growth, that is the Porter effect. However, the Porter effect of AJPC has not received the attention it deserves. Therefore, we empirically studied the short- term and long-term Porter effect of AJPC. Firstly, using the data of 283 prefecture-level cities, we studied the short-term Porter effect of AJPC by applying Propensity Score Matching Difference-in-Difference model (PSM-DID). Then, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used to estimate the potential Porter effect of AJPC, that is, the potential economic and environmental dividends of AJPC. In addition, we also calculated regional Global Malmquist Luenberger (GML) to observe variations in total factor productivity to observe the technology change caused by AJPC. Results showed that, AJPC policy has not realized Porter effect from the short-term perspective. In the long run, AJPC has environmental dividends but no economic dividends. In other words, there is no long-term Porter effect with AJPC. The implementation of AJPC policies can increase regional total factor productivity, in which technical efficiency is improved but technological progress remains unchanged. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution joint prevention and control policy; Porter effect; Propensity score matching difference-in-difference model (PSM-DID)","Air pollution control; Data envelopment analysis; Economics; Energy efficiency; Environmental protection; Productivity; Air pollution joint prevention and control policy; Control policy; Difference-in-differences models; Porter effect; Porter hypothesis; Prevention and controls; Prevention policy; Propensity score matching; Propensity score matching difference-in-difference model; Total factor productivity; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; economic growth; energy efficiency; policy implementation; pollution control; pollution policy; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116287307

Based on the analysis of the dual transmission mechanism of population flow and its effect on carbon emissions, this paper empirically studies the impact of population flow and other related factors on China’s carbon emissions through panel econometric regression and heterogeneity analysis with fixed effect model. The results show that, firstly, in the long or short term, China’s population flow can reduce the growth of carbon emissions. Secondly, the regional population aging and knowledge structure improvement caused by population flow are helpful to reduce carbon emissions, while the regional urbanization improvement caused by population flow is not significantly correlated with the growth of household miniaturization on carbon emissions. Thirdly, from the perspective of heterogeneous geographical divisions, population flow promotes the increase of carbon emissions in the northwest region of the Hu Huanyong Line (Hu Line), while it is opposite in the southeast region of Hu Line. Fourthly, China’s consumption level, per capita GDP, energy intensity, and energy consumption structure have contributed to the growth of carbon emissions, while carbon intensity has a negative effect on carbon emissions. Finally, this paper puts forward relevant suggestions from the perspective of coordinating population policy and energy conservation and emission reduction policy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emissions; Hu Line; Population flow; Population structure","carbon emission; energy conservation; population policy; regression analysis; urbanization; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; urbanization; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118909762

However, it remains uncertain how the inter-annual variation in soil microbial community corresponds well with resource availability in the changing environment. Here, we investigated soil microbial community structure and abundance, as well as the associated environmental variables from 2015 to 2017 under different plant detritus input manipulation treatments in a coniferous (Platycladus orientalis (Linn.) Franco) plantation forest ecosystem in subtropical China. Our results showed that the inter-annual variation in soil microbial community was more visible than that caused by detritus input manipulations, owing to the temporal alterations in microclimates and substrate availability. Both aboveground litter removal and root exclusion had more negative effects on the bacterial PLFAs than fungi except half a year after detritus input manipulations. While, soil microbial abundance increased only after three years of litter addition compared to control. Litter removal, especially the no input treatment significantly increased the fungi to bacteria (F:B) and Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria (GP:GN) ratios after one and two years of detritus input manipulations. Whereas, the litter addition treatment had minor effects on these parameters. A clear discrimination of microbial community structure among the different detritus input manipulations appeared after two and three years. Both the F:B and GP:GN ratios were positively related to the carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio, recalcitrance index of carbon (RIC) and nitrogen (RIN). Overall, our results reveal that the inter-annual variations in soil microbial community are clearly differentiated by the environmental variables and substrate availability that occur in different years and detritus input manipulations. Our results also suggest that due to the vital role of microorganisms in biogeochemical cycling, shifts in the microbial community structure with altered plant detritus input could profoundly affect ecosystem processes in the long run. © 2021","Detritus input manipulations; Environmental variables; Inter-annual variation; Microbial community structure","Bacteria; Carbon; Ecosystems; Forestry; Fungi; Nitrogen; Community IS; Detritus input manipulation; Environmental variables; Gram positive; Gram-negative bacteria; Interannual variation; Litter addition; Microbial community structures; Soil microbial community; Substrate availabilities; Soils; abundance; annual variation; community structure; forest ecosystem; microbial activity; microbial community; resource availability; soil carbon; soil microorganism; subtropical region; China; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria; Platycladus orientalis; Posibacteria; unclassified Gram-positive bacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111304920

Based on panel data from 30 provinces from 2006 to 2017 and 196 cities from 2011 to 2018 in China, this study utilizes the SBM (Slack-Based Measure) model to evaluate energy saving and emission reduction efficiency. The OLS, Spatial Durbin model, threshold model, mediating effect model, and DID (Difference in Difference) model are employed to study the direct effect, spatial spillover effect, nonlinear relationship, transmission mechanism, and policy effect of internet development on energy saving and emission reduction efficiency. The empirical results indicate that internet development has significantly promoted energy saving and emission reduction efficiency. This conclusion still holds after a series of robustness tests, including IV estimation, and the substitution of dependent and independent variables. The gradual DID model based on the quasi natural experiment of “Broadband China” further proves the causal relationship between internet development and energy saving and emission reduction efficiency. Internet development can improve the latter through technological progress, energy structure, human capital, and openness. Interestingly, the impact of internet development on the energy saving and emission reduction efficiency of adjacent areas also has a significantly positive spatial spillover effect, which still exists under the spatial weight matrix of different distances. There is also solid evidence that the impact of internet development on energy saving and emission reduction efficiency is non-linear under different levels of technological progress, energy structure, human capital, and openness. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","DID; Energy saving and emission reduction efficiency; Internet development; IV estimation; Spatial Durbin model; Threshold model","Emission control; Energy efficiency; Difference-in-differences; Difference-in-differences models; Differences-in-differences; Energy saving and emission reduction efficiency; Energy-saving and emission reductions; Internet development; IV estimation; Reduction efficiency; Spatial Durbin models; Threshold model; Environmental technology; emission control; energy conservation; environmental protection; estimation method; Internet; panel data; policy analysis; spatial analysis; substitution; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115754346

The main source of ammonia is the agricultural sector, and in Korea, 79% of the total ammonia emissions are emitted from the agricultural sector. Among them, there is high uncertainty about how to calculate emissions from ammonia discharged from fertilizer use, and inventory in the U.S. and Europe is borrowed, so inventory needs to be improved according to the situation in Korea. In this study, the ammonia inventory in the agricultural sector in Korea and abroad was examined, and additional activity data that can be used were reviewed. In addition, in order to improve the emission calculation method, the emission was calculated in three ways by different factors. As a result, it was confirmed that the amount of discharge varies depending on the type of soil use or whether cultivated crops are considered, and the possibility of excessive fertilizer top-dress by farmers was confirmed. In order to calculate the emission at a more detailed level based on this study, basic data such as fertilizer input method and regional distribution of crops should be systematically collected, and related follow-up studies should be conducted. © 2021 by the authors.

This requires simulation that is sensitive to the heterogeneity of buildings and climatic complications in dense urban settings. This paper provides a comprehensive review that documents and cross-compares the major methods to simulate building energy use at urban scale. The reviewed literature were acquired by using the search strings “urban-scale, city-scale or large-scale”, “building energy, energy use, electricity use, energy consumption or thermal load” and “simulation, forecast, modelling or mapping” in the Web of Science database from 2010 to 2021. The result highlighted major differences in strengths, limitations and field of application of different methods based on modelling inputs, outputs and approaches to incorporate urban environment to the modelling.

We account for LULCC and agricultural Nr emissions changes with consistent remote sensing products and new global emission inventories respectively estimating their impacts on global surface O3 and PM2.5 concentrations as well as Nr deposition using the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model. Over this time period, our model results show that agricultural Nr emission changes cause a reduction of annual mean PM2.5 levels over Europe and northern Asia (up to -2.1 μg m-3) while increasing PM2.5 levels in India, China and the eastern US (up to +3.5 μg m-3). Land cover changes induce small reductions in PM2.5 (up to -0.7 μg m-3) over Amazonia, China and India due to reduced biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions and enhanced deposition of aerosol precursor gases (e.g., NO2, SO2). Agricultural Nr emission changes only lead to minor changes (up to ±0.6 ppbv) in annual mean surface O3 levels, mainly over China, India and Myanmar. Meanwhile, our model result suggests a stronger impact of LULCC on surface O3 over the time period across South America; the combination of changes in dry deposition and isoprene emissions results in -0.8 to +1.2 ppbv surface ozone changes. The enhancement of dry deposition reduces the surface ozone level (up to -1 ppbv) over southern China, the eastern US and central Africa. The enhancement of soil NO emission due to crop expansion also contributes to surface ozone changes (up to +0.6 ppbv) over sub-Saharan Africa. In certain regions, the combined effects of LULCC and agricultural Nr emission changes on O3 and PM2.5 air quality can be comparable (>20 %) to anthropogenic emission changes over the same time period. Finally, we calculate that the increase in global agricultural Nr emissions leads to a net increase in global land area (+3.67×106km2) that potentially faces exceedance of the critical Nr load (>5 kg N ha-1 yr-1). Our result demonstrates the impacts of contemporary LULCC and agricultural Nr emission changes on PM2.5 and O3 in terms of air quality, as well as the importance of land system changes for air quality over multidecadal timescales. © 2021 Anthony Y.

Nevertheless, the internationalization of higher education demanding more technology utilization to enable transnational classes. This study provides a SWOT analysis of the online game-based learning (OGBL) method on clime change issues. Based on the PRISMA guidelines, this study concludes that OGBL has more strengths and opportunities than weaknesses and threats. Strength factors namely flexible, engaging, and enhance the learning process. Opportunities such as emerging academic community and events, developing new professions, and abundance of the development areas. However, game development is complex as a weakness.

In this way, bottom current patterns in the area are regulated by the regional climate, although the complex bathymetry of the fjords has a significant impact as well. To understand the potential interplay of climate, seafloor topography-and circulation patterns, we study the sedimentary infill of Aysén Fjord (~45°S) and reveal the first active sediment drifts in the region. These allow constraining the present-day circulation patterns in northern Patagonia and show an incoming (southward) as well as returning (northward) flow direction. While the general sedimentary evolution of the fjord (and thus also the sediment drifts) is climate-driven (i.e., it reflects variability in southern westerly wind strength), the onset of drift formation at ~3.7 ka does not seem to have originated from an abrupt change in regional climate. Instead, we propose that a megathrust earthquake described in paleoseismic records in the area could have resulted in subsidence of one (or more) of the many bathymetric highs in the Patagonian fjords, thus contributing to enhanced spilling of subantarctic water into the fjord. This study underscores the importance of multidisciplinary research to understand past and present bottom current circulation patterns and disentangle different possible feedback mechanisms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bottom current circulation; Climatic variability; Patagonia; Sediment drift; Tectonic control","Bathymetry; Ocean currents; Sedimentology; Sediments; Surface waters; Topography; Antarctic Circumpolar Currents; Circulation patterns; Feedback mechanisms; Megathrust earthquakes; Multi-disciplinary research; Sedimentary evolution; Southern westerly winds; Subantarctic waters; Climate change; bathymetry; bottom current; complexity; fjord; flow structure; Holocene; regional climate; seafloor; sedimentation; surface water; Antarctic Circumpolar Current; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113462989

Governing the sequestration of carbon are biogeochemical processes which are controlled largely by hydrology, which is influenced by the physical properties of the soils, such as bulk density, particle density, and porosity. Reliable values for these properties for peat can be found in the literature; however, values for Sphagnum litter, particularly particle density, are often not measured or reported. The values that do exist for Sphagnum litter rarely report the depth or any spatial differences within the peatland that might exist. Particle density of soil organic material (i.e., humus) is often assumed to be 1.4 g cm–3 and is used for litter. We sampled numerous hummocks of S. capillifolium (Ehrh.) Hedw. and S. magellanicum Brid. (now either S. divinum Flatberg &amp; Hassel or S. medium Limpr.) at a midlatitude continental peatland and determined the bulk density, particle density, and porosity at 5-cm intervals from the surface to 25-cm depth. Bulk density and porosity values were similar to values reported in the literature; difference between species and location within the peatland were observed, with the largest difference being found between Sphagnum growing in open and treed areas. Particle density, however, averaged 0.75 g cm–3, or nearly half that of the assumed value from the literature, suggesting strongly that assuming 1.4 g cm–3 is incorrect for Sphagnum litter and that peatland practitioners should use a locally obtained value, or 0.75 g cm–3 instead. © 2021 The Authors.

In 2011, China, the world's leading carbon emitter, introduced ETS pilots in seven cities/provinces. Subsequent studies have debated their effectiveness, especially in terms of their economic performance. This article investigates whether China's ETS pilots have successfully balanced carbon emission reductions and economic growth. For this, we apply an extended synthetic control method for multiple treated units that relaxes the parallel trends assumption required by the difference-in-differences estimation commonly used in the field The results show that overall CO2 emissions decreased by approximately 1,165.72 Mt from 2011 to 2015, representing 12.78% of the pilot regions’ total industrial CO2 emissions. As for the ETS pilots’ economic performance over this period, we find that there was a loss in the value of industrial output totalling approximately RMB5,608.88 billion. That said, the economic loss was short term in nature and decreased over time. Regions showed heterogeneous responses to the ETS pilots. Although all of them experienced a decline in CO2 emissions, Beijing and Shanghai showed the fastest reduction, while Guangdong showed the largest reduction. Losses in industrial output were concentrated in Guangdong (RMB7,416.66 billion; 4.64% of the region's total industrial output) and Shanghai (RMB701.28 billion; 4.08%); the other regions saw economic losses only in the first two years after ETS implementation. These findings suggest that policy makers should consider a gradual (rather than a radical) ETS policy and make firm subsidies part of their battery of instruments in the early stage of establishing a nationwide ETS. © 2021 The Authors","Carbon emissions; Economic growth; Emissions trading scheme; Synthetic control method",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107130566

Despite their record size, the resulting atmospheric signals are smaller than and obscured by climate variability in atmospheric transport and biospheric fluxes, notably that related to the 2019–2020 Indian Ocean Dipole. Monitoring CO2 anomalies and distinguishing human and climatic causes thus remain a new frontier in Earth system science. We show that the impact of short-term regional changes in fossil fuel emissions on CO2 concentrations was observable from space. Starting in February and continuing through May, column CO2 over many of the world’s largest emitting regions was 0.14 to 0.62 parts per million less than expected in a pandemic-free scenario, consistent with reductions of 3 to 13% in annual global emissions. Current spaceborne technologies are therefore approaching levels of accuracy and precision needed to support climate mitigation strategies with future missions expected to meet those needs.

Against the backdrop of the “Big Data Era,” social media is an appealing and promising tool for a timely and complete understanding of public perception and attitudes towards climate policies. This paper examines the public's spontaneous attention and awareness about carbon emissions trading (ETS). Tweets related to the EU-ETS, published between 2008 and 2019, were collected for multi-dimensional analysis. Empirical results show several important findings. First, public attention on the EU-ETS has increased significantly since 2011. Second, government officials and industry practitioners have a stronger influence in the discussions than the public and industrial enterprises. Third, topic followers mostly gathered in Belgium (16.65%), the UK (11.6%), and some non-regulated countries like the US and Australia. Fourth, the public mainly focused on the policies and legislation, allowance price, and allocation. The innovation of this study rests in the development of a social media data-based research framework to examine the public's cognition of climate policies, which integrates the advantages of public social media, social network analysis, and text topic analysis.

How to better integrate into the sustainable development model has become an important goal of macro-policy regulation in the transition period. Mining industry is a fundamental industry in China. Strengthening the incentive role of mining innovation is of great importance for ensuring China’s energy security, reducing emissions and promoting economic growth. However, whether environmental regulation can induce technological innovation ability, that is, the existence of Porter effect, is still controversial. It is helpful to study the influence of the Porter hypothesis on mining enterprises for their sustainable development. Based on the data of listed companies in China from 2003 to 2018, and against the background of the SO2 emission trading pilot policy implemented in 2007, this paper studies the incentive effect of the market-incentive environmental regulation on the technological innovation ability of mineral resource enterprises, tests the existence of Porter effect, and discusses the heterogeneity. The results show that the market-incentive environmental regulation has a significant incentive effect on the innovation of mining enterprises, and there is significant Porter effect on mining enterprises. The robustness test confirms the correctness of this conclusion. At the same time, this paper also discusses the variation of the characteristics of heterogeneous enterprises, and finds that enterprises with utility model patents, no low-carbon behavior, and non-provincial cities and regions with high environmental regulation are more sensitive to the SO2 emission trading pilot policy. This paper verifies the incentive effect of the market-incentive environmental regulation on the innovation ability of mining enterprises, and provides a reference for the formulation of innovation incentive policies for mining enterprises in China. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","DID; Market-incentive environmental regulation; Mineral resources; SO2 emission trading pilot policy; Technological innovation ability","economic development; economic growth; environmental management; environmental policy; heterogeneity; incentive; innovation; market system; mineral resource; regulatory framework; research work; sustainable development; China; mineral; China; economic development; industry; motivation; sustainable development; China; Economic Development; Industry; Minerals; Motivation; Sustainable Development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107758150

In this paper, CO2 emission regions were devided into urban area, industrial area and rural area in order to accurately calculate CO2 emissions. In addition, a more accurate calculation model for energy-related CO2 emissions was proposed through integrating nighttime light datasets and land use data. The maps of estimated CO2 emissions in different regions were compared and examined through using spatial dependence and grid overlay methods to understand the spatial distribution characteristics and spatiotemporal dynamics of CO2 emissions in China. The results showed that the model proposed in this study was appropriate and reliable for CO2 emissions not only in urban and rural areas but also in industrial areas. CO2 emissions in China were mainly concentrated in the coastal areas and the northern area, and the amount of carbon emissions increased rapidly from 2000 to 2018 in the Middle Yellow River.

And its applications as promising interlayer to hybridize with metal Li as composite anode for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) were systematically investigated and researched. The 3D interconnected porous skeleton with a high electrical conductivity and large surface area could reduce the local current density and endow the significantly enhanced interfacial compatibility between the interlayer and lithium electrode including a high lithium-loading capacity. Moreover, the lithiophilic ZnF2 nanoparticles formed in-situ during carbonization process could provide more active sites to trigger an analogous alloying reaction with Li to guide the Li plating/stripping more homogeneous. For the assembled Li||LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries with ZnF2-PCNFs, the optimal initial discharge capacity and capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1C were 142.70 mAh g−1 and 96.42%, respectively. The symmetric Li||Li batteries further showed that the ZnF2-PCNFs coating interlayer could hinder Li dendrite growth and improve the cycling stability. In addition, the obtained Li||S battery with ZnF2-PCNFs also delivered the outstanding cycle performance among the various samples based on the convenient transport channels of Li ions and the strong adsorption or captured ability of ZnF2-PCNFs to species. These facts demonstrated that the prepared ZnF2-PCNFs coating acting as interlayer between separator and anode could effectively enhance safety and electrochemical performance of LMBs. © 2021","Electro-blow spinning; Li dendrite; Lithium-ion battery and Lithium-sulfur battery; Porous carbon nanofibers; ZnF2 nanoparticles","Anodes; Carbon nanofibers; Carbonization; Coatings; Electric discharges; Lithium compounds; Lithium sulfur batteries; Nanoparticles; Porous materials; Separators; Carbonisation; Composite anodes; Electro-blow spinning; ITS applications; Li dendrite; Li$++$; Lithium metals; Lithium-ion battery and lithium-sulphur battery; Porous carbon nanofibers; ZnF2 nanoparticle; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106988271

However, there is a knowledge gap on dioxin distribution characteristics following China's implementation of MSW classification. To reveal the fate of dioxins under ultra-low emission standards in leading cities in China, a systematic investigation was carried out in a typical modern MSW incinerator in Shenzhen, China. The dioxin mass balance was built using improved models, which included expanded samples, e.g., the leachate, the raw gas and raw ash from boiler, and the chemicals and residuals from air pollution control devices (APCDs). The results indicated a positive dioxin balance of 0.88 μg I-TEQ/t MSW according to the conventional method containing fly ash, bottom ash, and stack gas. In the new model revealing dioxin characteristics after APCDs, a higher value of 0.89 μg I-TEQ/t MSW was found due to the leachate, slaked lime, and activated carbon-containing dioxins. The distribution of dioxins in output samples of fly ash, bottom ash, stack gas, and leachate were 149.0 %, 41.8 %, 1.6 %, and 0.6 % of MSW, respectively. For incineration itself, the balance was 0.85 μg I-TEQ/t MSW, which indicated the possible release owing to the “memory effect” for the other two methods.

However, there are a few challenges for algal fuels to compete with fossil fuels that need to be addressed. Therefore, this study reviews the R&D status of microalgae-based polyculture and biocrude oil production, along with wastewater treatment. Mixotrophic algae are free to some extent from light restrictions using organic matter and have the ability to grow well even in deep water-depth cultivation. It is proposed that integrating the mixotrophic microalgae polyculture and wastewater treatment process is the most promising and harmonizing means to simultaneously increase capacities of microalgae biomass production and wastewater treatment with a low land footprint and high robustness to perturbations. A large amount of mixotrophic algae biomass is harvested, concentrated, and dewatered by combining highly efficient sedimentation through flocculation and energy efficient filtration, which reduce the carbon footprint for algae fuel production and coincide with the subsequent hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) conversion. HTL products are obtained with a relatively low carbon footprint and separated into biocrude oil, solid, aqueous, and gas fractions. Algae biomass feedstock-based HTL conversion has a high biocrude oil yield and quality available for existing oil refineries; it also has a bioavailability of the recycled nitrogen and phosphorus from the aqueous phase of algae community HTL. The HTL biocrude oil represents higher sustainability than conventional liquid fuels and other biofuels for the combination of greenhouse gas (GHG) and energy return on investment (EROI). Deep water-depth polyculture of mixotrophic microalgae using sewage has a high potential to produce sustainable biocrude oil within the land area of existing sewage treatment plants in Japan to fulfill imported crude oil. © 2021 by the authors.

The farm sector in Poland, being the second largest contributor to the country’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and in the top fifth of farm sectors in the EU-27 countries, needs to undergo structural and technological transformations to contribute to the climate action goals. The article assesses the potential impacts of Po-land’s climate neutrality achievement path on the domestic farm sector in terms of its structure, output, income, and prices of agricultural products. The approach is based on complex economic modelling combining computable general equilibrium (CGE) and optimisation modelling, with the farm sector model consisting of farm, structural, and market modules. While the modelling results cover three GHG emission-reduction scenarios up to 2050, to understand the transformation impact within varying policy approaches, the study for each scenario of farm sector development also out-lines three policy options: carbon pricing, forced emission limit, and carbon subsidies.

Predicting and plotting appropriate potential habitats for such species is a rational method for monitoring and restoring their dwindling populations in expected territories. Ecological niche modelling (ENM) coalesces species existence sites with environmental raster layers to construct models that describe possible distributions of plant species. The present study is aimed to study the potential distribution and cultivation hotspots for reintroducing the high value, vulnerable medicinal herb (Rheum webbianum) in the Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh using population attributes and ecological niche modelling approach. Sixty-three populations inventoried from twenty-eight areas display a significant change in the phytosociological attributes on account of various anthropogenic threats. The current potential habitats coincide with actual distribution records and the mean value of Area Under Curve (AUC) was 0.98 and the line of predicted omission was almost adjacent to omission in training samples, thus validating a robustness of the model. The potential habitat suitability map based on the current climatic conditions predicted a total of 103760 km2 as suitable area for the growth of Rheum webbianum. Under the future climatic conditions, there is a significant reduction in the habitat suitability ranging from -78531.34 Km2 (RCP 4.5 for 2050) to -77325.81 (RCP 8.5 for 2070). Furthermore, there is a slight increase in the suitable habitats under future climatic conditions, ranging from +21.99 Km2 under RCP 8.5 (2050) to +3.14 Km2 under RCP 4.5 (2070). The Jackknife tests indicated Precipitation of Driest Month (BIO14) as the most contributing climatic variable in governing the distribution of R. webbianum. Therefore, scientifically sound management strategies are urgently needed to save whatever populations are left in-situ to protect this species from getting extinct. Present results can be used by conservationists for mitigating the biodiversity decline and exploring undocumented populations of R. webbianum on one hand and by policymakers in implementing the policy of conservation of species with specific habitat requirements by launching species recovery programmes in future on the other. © 2021 Wani et al.

Here we integrated the multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model and an atmospheric transport model to examine regional environmental inequality (REI) index induced by Pb emission transfers, and to evaluate the impacts of interprovincial trade on regional atmospheric Pb concentrations and dry deposition fluxes in China in 2012. In 2012, approximately 57.4% ~ 72.6% of Pb emissions in well-developed eastern regions (Beijing-Tianjin, Yangtze River Delta (YRD)) and the southern seaboard of China were embodied in other regions in China subject to the demands from these well-developed regions to industrial products and services. Our results, based on the net virtual flows of Pb emission and value-added, indicate that most provinces in the eastern seaboard of China outsource Pb emission and benefit from the interprovincial trade by reducing their Pb emissions. REI indexes show that the well-developed Guangdong province outsources its Pb emission but has low economic gains. Many less-developed provinces in central China enhance virtual Pb emission inflow but have high economic gains. Whereas, inland provinces in western China not only experience Pb emission increase, but also suffer from indirect economic loss due to trade with well-developed provinces to meet their increasing demands to Pb emission abundant industrial products from these provinces in eastern China which are mostly provided by less-developed but energy and mineral product abundant provinces in western China. For example, the province pair with highest REI index was Jiangsu-Inner Mongolia (REI = 2.47), which revealed that Jiangsu was the largest beneficiary which exported 37.2 t of net Pb emission and gained value-added of 521.4 billion RMB through trade with Inner Mongolia which suffered from both virtual Pb inflow and economic loss in 2012. As a result of interprovincial trade, Pb dry deposition in central and eastern China was decreased but increased in western China. Overall, interprovincial trade reduced 17.6% of atmospheric Pb dry deposition in China. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric transport modeling; Environmental inequality; Interprovincial trade; Lead","Atmospheric movements; Industrial emissions; Lead; Losses; Atmospheric transport model; Central chinas; Eastern China; Economic gains; Environmental inequality; Industrial product; Inner Mongolia; Interprovincial trade; Lead; Western China; Deposition; lead; mineral; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; concentration (composition); dry deposition; emission; lead; air pollutant; Article; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric transport; China; concentration (parameter); dry deposition; environmental protection; Inner Mongolia; pollution monitoring; river; simulation; air pollutant; human; Beijing [China]; China; Tianjin; Yangtze Delta; Air Pollutants; Beijing; China; Humans; Lead; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111064502

However, the high reactivity during formation of the σ-bond has limited a deeper investigation of its unique chemical properties. In this feature article, recent progress in kinetic stabilisation based on the “stretch effect” and the “solvent dynamic effect” induced by the macrocyclic system is summarised. Singlet diradicaloids S-DR4a/band S-DR4dcontaining macrocyclic rings showed much longer lifetimes at 293 K (14 μs for S-DR4aand 156 μs for S-DR4bin benzene) compared to the parent singlet diradicaloid S-DR2having no macrocyclic ring (209 ns in benzene). Furthermore, the dynamic solvent effect in viscous solvents was observed for the first time in intramolecular σ-bond formation, the lifetime of S-DR4dincreased to 400 μs in the viscous solvent glycerin triacetin at 293 K. The experimental results proved the validity of the “stretch effect” and the “solvent dynamic effect” on the kinetic stabilisation of singlet cyclopentane-1,3-diyl diradicaloids, and provided a strategy for isolating the carbon-carbon π-single bonded species (C-π-C), and towards a deeper understanding of the nature of chemical bonding. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Carbon; Chemical bonds; Solvents; Stabilization; Carbon carbons; Dynamic effects; High reactivity; Kinetic stabilization; Localised; Macrocyclic rings; Recent progress; Single bond; Solvent dynamics; Viscous solvents; Benzene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118440738

This study first builds a Propensity Score Matching–Difference-in-Differences (PSM-DID) model and empirically tests the impact of Energy-Consuming Right Trading policy on energy intensity in pilot areas based on inter-provincial panel data from 2010 to 2019. Then the policy mechanism was analyzed by further regression, and the spatial effects of the policy were explored by the Spatial Difference-in-Differences (SDID) model. The results show that: (1) The policy can reduce energy intensity by 6.4% to 10.2% in the pilot area. (2) The policy mainly achieves energy consumption reduction by optimizing the industrial structure and promoting scientific and technological input, while the resource tax intensity and the proportion of coal consumption also have synergistic and hindering effects on the policy. (3) There is a significant spatial spillover effect of the policy; it can reduce the energy intensity of the adjacent areas of the pilot by 5.3% and the areas with a high economic association with the pilot by 12%. The conclusion is that China’s Energy-Consuming Right Trading policy can effectively control energy consumption, and the policy shows an excellent positive external effect, worth nationwide implementation.

To better understand these effects in typical and fragile ecosystems like dry-hot valley regions, we quantified changes in soil properties (pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, phosphorus, microbial biomass carbon contents, activities of β-glucosidase, beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, acid phosphatase) and CO2 efflux before (degraded grassland) and after (mango plantation) land use change in a dry-hot valley region. Most soil chemical properties remained unaffected after conversion due to generally low regional nutrient levels. Principal component analysis revealed the decline of soil heterogeneity of the selected properties (pH, SOC, TN, TP, AP), which will be useful for future unified management. Compared to grassland, CO2 efflux in mango plantation increased by 20–69% after land use change, more factors and their interactions were responsible for CO2 efflux from soil in mango plantations. The temperature sensitivity (Q10: 0.68–1.98) of CO2 efflux in both land use types was low due to the low soil moisture at high temperatures. Soil water content was the primary factor affecting CO2 efflux in the dry-hot valley region, followed by microbial biomass carbon. In summary, the CO2 efflux increased shortly after the land use change (within first year), even though absence of significant quantitative change of soil properties, and low temperature sensitive (Q10) before and after conversion and its difference between land use types is opposite in dry and wet season. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural and ecological transformation; Carbon emission; Enzyme activities; Fragile ecosystems; Land use",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105837055

With a stochastic deep convection scheme implemented into two state-of-the-art global climate models (GCMs), a recent study found that aerosol burdens are increased globally by reduced climatological mean wet removal of aerosols due to suppressed light rain. Motivated by their work, a novel approach is developed in this study to detect what rainfall rates are most efficient for wet removal (scavenging amount mode) of different aerosol species of different sizes in GCMs and applied to the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) with and without the stochastic convection cases. Results show that in the standard CAM5, no obvious differences in the scavenging amount mode are found among different aerosol types. However, the scavenging amount modes differ in the Aitken, accumulation and coarse modes, showing around 10-12, 8-9 and 7-8 mm d-1, respectively, over the tropics. As latitude increases poleward, the scavenging amount mode in each aerosol mode is decreased substantially. The scavenging amount mode is generally smaller over land than over ocean. With stochastic convection, the scavenging amount mode for all aerosol species in each mode is systematically increased, which is the most prominent along the Intertropical Convergence Zone, exceeding 20 mm d-1 for small particles. The scavenging amount modes in the two cases are both smaller than individual rainfall rates associated with the most accumulated rain (rainfall amount mode), further implying precipitation frequency is more important than precipitation intensity for aerosol wet removal. The notion of the scavenging amount mode can be applied to other GCMs to better understand the relation between rainfall and aerosol wet scavenging, which is important to better simulate aerosols. © 2021 Yong Wang et al.",,"aerosol; concentration (composition); frequency analysis; precipitation intensity; size distribution; stochasticity; wet deposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119970688

Yet, the impacts of fertilizer types and other influencing factors on HONO emissions are unknown. As a result, the current state-of-the-art models lack an appropriate parameterization scheme to quantify the HONO impact on air quality after fertilization. Here, we report laboratory measurements of high HONO emissions from soils at a 75-95% water-holding capacity after applying three common fertilizers, which contrasts with previous lower predictions at high soil moisture. Urea use leads to the largest release of HONO compared to the other two commonly used fertilizers (ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium nitrate). The significant promotion effect of fertilization lasted up to 1 week. Implementation of the lab-derived parametrization in a chemistry transport model (CMAQ) significantly improved postfertilization HONO predictions at a rural site in the agriculture-intensive North China Plain and increased the regionally averaged daytime OH, O3, and daily fine particulate nitrate concentrations by 41, 8, and 47%, respectively. The results of our study underscore the necessity to include this large postfertilization HONO source in modeling air quality and atmospheric chemistry.

Along the way, we also offer our perspectives of and solutions to some of the problems likely to be encountered in implementing the PA. We note that a Party must possess consecutive inventories for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals to determine, communicate, and update its NDC. While there is little concern over the availability of GHG emission inventories, there remain gaps between the available information and what is needed for accounting forest-based actions. Improved measurement and monitoring is needed if the Party desires to include the C pools as part of the offsetting credits in its NDC accounting. Also, the jurisdictional governance means that actions taken by subnational and other entities should be nested within the NDC. As to the results-based payments scheme for REDD+, it will take time to be carried out at scale, because of the challenge of determining the baseline of an action and the failure to deliver the promised finance.

However, until now, the uptake of heat pumps has been much slower than fossil-fuel-based heating, particularly in the UK. To accelerate the use of heat pumps for national-scale heat decarbonisation, this study proposes new approaches to synthesise high-quality temporospatial energy datasets (e.g. hourly depth-dependent region-based ground source temperature), a new framework that facilitates national-scale cost analysis using synthesised datasets rather than individual location-based analysis, and forward-looking analysis and discussions on potential subsidy structures and R&D directions for facilitating the transition to low-carbon heat using heat pumps. The results suggest that currently Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) subsidised ground source heat pumps have the lowest levelised cost of heat (10–40% lower than gas boilers), benefiting from the high heating efficiency and the ‘feed-in-tariff’ style RHI subsidy. However, considering the change of future subsidies, required advances are analysed to improve the cash flow of owning heat pumps, improve heating efficiency,improve integration with low-cost power sources, and reduce heat demand via domestic energy efficiency improvements.

However, few studies have taken into consideration the spatial effects. This paper analyzes the effect of urbanization on pollutant emissions by utilizing panel data of 30 provinces between the years 2005–2017. Further, to clarify the underlying mechanisms of spatial spillover effects of pollutant emissions, this paper employs the spatial econometric model to empirically tests the influence of urbanization on pollutant emissions from both direct impacts and spatial spillover effects perspectives. The findings indicate that China's pollutant emissions have a significant positive autocorrelation from both global and local points of view, demonstrating the features of high- and low-value agglomeration. Moreover, we find that whereas the relationship of urbanization with pollutant emissions presents a U-shaped curve, that of economic development is an inverted U-shaped. Furthermore, urbanization, technology progress, foreign direct investment, economic development, and population show spatial spillover effects on pollutant emissions, but their influencing mechanisms vary substantially. Thus, some corresponding countermeasures and policy suggestions are proposed. © 2021 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Pollutant emissions; Spatial econometric model; Spillover effect; Urbanization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116544948

To explore the pathway of achieving carbon neutrality, we tried to use resources taxes and land reclamation deposits as compulsory ecological compensation (CEC). In order to test if CEC can affect CO2 emissions, energy intensity was selected as the intermediate variable. We found that the CO2 emissions trend in China is consistent with environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis and proved that CEC displayed a spillover effect on energy intensity. Likely, energy intensity presented a spillover effect on CO2 emissions. Therefore, CEC will spatially affect CO2 emissions. The generalized spatial two-stage least-squares estimate model was used to identify the impact mechanism of coal production on energy intensity with CEC as the instrumental variable. The results indicated that reducing coal production in neighboring regions may cause the mitigation of local CO2 emissions. Finally, regression analyses carried out by region suggested regional cooperation should be carried out in the process of carbon mitigation.

Endeavoring to capture all available excess renewable electricity, however, may require large energy storage capacities and costs. This study therefore investigates how much curtailment is cost-optimal to allow in developing fully decarbonized electricity systems, using compliance with California's Senate Bill 100 goal as a representative case study. We combine electric grid dispatch modeling with an optimization approach for selecting the composition of energy storage technologies to capture excess renewable electricity to minimize overall system costs. We found that overbuilding cheap wind and solar and allowing the curtailment of excess renewable electricity equivalent to 25–43% of the total annual electric load resulted in the lowest cumulative systemwide cost for a fully decarbonized electricity system of about $1.8 trillion, spent between 2020 and 2045. Allowing no renewable curtailment results in significant battery requirements and a cumulative systemwide cost of $5.2 trillion spent between 2020 and 2045. Therefore, allowing some curtailment reduced the cost of building a fully decarbonized electricity system by a factor of 3 when the portfolio of technologies to capture and manage excess renewable electricity is carefully chosen. © 2021 The Authors","Energy storage; Excess renewable electricity; Greenhouse gas reduction; Renewable curtailment","Climate change; Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Electric load dispatching; Renewable energy resources; Climate change mitigation; Electricity system; Energy; Excess renewable electricity; Greenhouse gas reductions; Optimal approaches; Renewable curtailment; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Zero carbons; Greenhouse gases; alternative energy; climate change; compliance; cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy storage; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111344444

However, few studies provide a comprehensive depiction of future cropland-N2O emissions on a national scale due to a lack of accurate cropland prediction data. Herein, we present a newly developed distributed land-use change prediction model for the high-precision prediction of national-scale land-use change. The high-precision land-use data provide an opportunity to elucidate how the changes in cropland area will affect the magnitude and spatial distribution of N2O emissions from China’s croplands during 2020-2070. The results showed a declining trend in China’s total cropland-N2O emissions from 0.44 ± 0.03 Tg N/year in 2020 to 0.39 ± 0.07 Tg N/year in 2070, consistent with a cropland area reduction from (1.78 ± 0.02) × 108ha to (1.40 ± 0.15) × 108ha. However, approximately 31% of all calculated cities in China would emit more than the present level.

By charging CCB, the thermal state in the BF upper part was significantly changed while it was not influenced in the BF lower part; the ore reduction was retarded before the temperature reached 1073 K and was prompted after and the local gas utilization tends to increase above the CZ. By the CCB reduction above the CZ, BF top gas temperature was decreased by 8 K, the BF top gas utilization was increased by 1.3%, the BF productivity was decreased by 17 tHM/day, the coke rate was decreased by 52.2 kg/tHM, and ore rate was decreased by 101 kg/tHM. Considering the energy consumption of sintering and coking, charging the CCB could have a significant energy-saving and CO2-emission-reducing effect for BF iron making. © 2021 by the authors.

We constructed a heat vulnerability index (HVI), quantified the population heat vulnerability in each county across China by a principal component analysis (PCA) of multiple factors, and assessed urbanization levels in each county using multisource data. Then, the HVI was validated using the heat-attributable fraction (heat-AF) of nonaccidental mortality based on death monitoring data and meteorological data from 95 counties across China. The results showed that our HVI was significantly positively associated with the heat AF of nonaccidental mortality. A negative correlation was observed between the urbanization level and the HVI. The HVI was generally higher in less urbanized western China and lower in the more urbanized eastern regions. The baseline mortality occupies the top position in the importance ranking of the heat-vulnerability indicators at all three urbanization levels, but the other indicators, including the aging rate, agricultural population rate, education, ethnic structure, economic status, air conditioner ownership rate, and number of hospitals, ranked differently among different urbanization levels. This finding indicates that to reduce population heat vulnerability, the most important approach is to improve the health status of the whole population and reduce baseline mortality; additionally, regional-specific measures and emphasis should be adjusted reasonably along with the process of urbanization according to the characteristics and key factors of local heat vulnerability. © 2021 The Authors","China; County-level; Heat vulnerability; Multiindicators; Urbanization","Air conditioning; Climate change; Economics; Population statistics; Principal component analysis; Risk assessment; China; County level; Heat vulnerability; Level model; Model study; Multiindicator; Policy making; Urbanization; Urbanization levels; Vulnerability index; Health risks; future prospect; health risk; heat source; population dynamics; urban development; urban policy; urbanization; vulnerability; aging; article; China; climate change; controlled study; economic status; education; health hazard; health status; heat; human; management; mortality; principal component analysis; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; urbanization; agriculture; China; epidemiology; China; Agriculture; China; Climate Change; Hot Temperature; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108945384

Demand-side energy-saving measures can reduce operational costs associated with energy usage. Most existing IES models, however, focus on supply-side optimization, while the demand-side energy-saving potential and its impacts on whole-system performance are still not clear. The increasing carbon tax makes it even more important to understand the interactions between supply and demand sides to achieve a sustainable system with a minimal carbon charge. Hence, this study proposes a co-optimization model to simultaneously optimize the supply and demand sides of an IES considering the impact of the carbon tax. A selection tree is developed to describe various demand-side envelope upgrading technologies, and a binary tree is established by generating a set of supply-side scenarios with corresponding probabilities. Based on these results, an improved two-stage stochastic programming model is proposed. The robustness of the modeling results was further validated by a simulation–optimization-based uncertainty analysis addressing price uncertainties. A case study in Shanghai indicates that the proposed co-optimization model achieves more cost-efficient solutions than supply-side-only optimization considering carbon tax. Introducing carbon tax can reduce the installed capacity of fuel-based energy technologies by up to 24% and greatly accelerate the penetration of renewables. The increasing carbon tax also promotes the adoption of more advanced energy-saving technologies. Uncertainty analysis reveals acceptable robustness of the optimal demand-side scheme and supply-side configuration with a deviation of less than 5% and a coefficient of variation of 7%. Overall, the observations of the proposed model and case study provide valuable insights for IES design considering an emerging charge of carbon tax. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon tax; Integrated energy system; Stochastic programming; Supply and demand-side co-optimization; Uncertainty analysis","Binary trees; Carbon; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Taxation; Carbon taxes; Co-optimization; Demand-side; Integrated energy systems; Optimisations; Stochastics; Supply and demand; Supply and demand-side co-optimization; Supply sides; Uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis; demand analysis; electricity supply; integrated approach; optimization; pollution tax; uncertainty analysis; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112527659

Exploiting new catalysts for tuning product selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation is important to improve the viability of this technology, where reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) and methanation as competitive reactions play key roles in controlling product selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation. So far, a series of metal-based catalysts with adjustable strong metal-support interactions, metal surface structure, and local environment of active sites have been developed, significantly tuning the product selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation. Herein, we describe the recent advances in the fundamental understanding of the two reactions in CO2 hydrogenation, in terms of emerging new catalysts which regulate the catalytic structure and switch reaction pathways, where the strong metal-support interactions, metal surface structure, and local environment of the active sites are particularly discussed. They are expected to enable efficient catalyst design for minimizing the deep hydrogenation and controlling the reaction towards the RWGS reaction.

Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2006 to 2017, this paper investigates the effect of narrowing the urban-rural income gap on carbon emission reduction and pollution control by using OLS method. The empirical results indicate that: the narrowing of the urban-rural income gap has a positive impact on pollution control, while there are regional differences in the impact on carbon emission reduction. In the perspective of the whole country and central and western regions, the narrowing of the urban-rural income gap is conducive to carbon emission reduction. However, the narrowing of the urban-rural income gap increases carbon emissions in the eastern regions where economic development is at high level.

Results showed that mosaic approach improved the simulation results of WS10 (surface wind speed at 10 m), T2 (temperature at 2 m), and RH (relative humidity) especially in nighttime in winter and were available for all stations with different percent of urban area. “MOS_TOPO” scenario, which coupled with mosaic approach and “topo-wind” schemes, obtained best simulation results of WS10 and T2 in January among six scenarios, with the lower average Root Mean Square Error of WS10 (1.18 m/s) and Mean Bias of T2 (0.55 °C) for all stations. Meanwhile, mosaic approach obtained lower |NMB| of PM2.5 than dominant approach in more than 69% cities in BTH region. Cities in southern Hebei province, especially Xingtai city, were identified as the most sensitive area for PM2.5 simulation affected by mosaic approach. Although the mosaic approach has improved the simulation results of meteorological parameters, especially the nighttime simulation results of WS10, there is still some deviation in the simulation results of PM2.5.

However, the mechanism of the impact of ICT investments on carbon dioxide is still unclear. Therefore, by employing the decoupling-factor model and Generalized Divisia Index Method, we explore the decoupling states of ICT investments and emission intensity, and the driving factors of ICT investments’ scale, intensity, structure, and efficiency effects on carbon emissions in 20 OECD economies between 2000 and 2018. The results indicate that the number of economies with an ideal state of strong decoupling rose to nine between 2009 and 2018 compared to no economies between 2000 and 2009. The emission intensity of ICT investments contributes to a significant increase of carbon emissions, and the structure and efficiency of ICT investments always restrain the growth of carbon emissions. Significant emissions changes caused by the driving factors are shown in many economies before and after the crisis, reflecting the differences in the strategic choices of ICT investments and the impact on emissions due to the crisis such as the COVID-2019 pandemic.

This paper takes Beijing, China’s political and economic center as well as a national pioneer in the energy transition, as a case to systematically analyze the co-mitigation of air pollution (PM2.5) and carbon emissions (CO2) achieved by the policy-driven natural gas-coal consumption substitution. Firstly, a qualitative analysis of the relationship of Beijing’s coal-to-gas policies and its air quality has been conducted. Then, VAR and ARDL models are employed to quantitatively analyze the impacts of coal-to-gas policies on PM2.5 and CO2, respectively. Results show that (i) an innovation of natural gas/coal consumption ratio will reduce PM2.5 concentrations, and the effect decreases over time; and (ii) an increase of 1% in natural gas/coal consumption ratio in Beijing will cause a decrease of 0.0784% in CO2 emissions in the long run. Therefore, the coal-to-gas policies do increase the usage of natural gas and improve Beijing’s air quality. The assessment methods and conclusions can be regarded as a reference for not only China’s policymakers, but also other countries, especially nowadays when air quality is becoming more valued and GHGs are being tightly controlled. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China; CO2 emissions; Coal-to-gas project; Environmental policy; PM2.5 concentrations","air quality; carbon emission; environmental economics; environmental quality; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; Beijing [China]; China; coal; air pollutant; air pollution; China; policy; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Coal; Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107493467

This paper develops a deep learning model for the fast and accurate recognition and classification of substrates and the dominant associated species in cold seeps. Considering the dense distribution of the dominant associated species and small objects caused by overlap in cold seeps, the feature pyramid network (FPN) embed into the faster region-convolutional neural network (R-CNN) was used to detect large-scale changes and small missing objects without increasing the number of calculations. We applied three classifiers (Faster R-CNN + FPN for mussel beds, lobster clusters and biological mixing, CNN for shell debris and exposed authigenic carbonates, and VGG16 for reduced sediments and muddy bottom) to improve the recognition accuracy of substrates. The model’s results were manually verified using images obtained in the Formosa cold seep during a 2016 cruise. The recognition accuracy of the two dominant species, e.g., Gigantidas platifrons and Munidopsidae could be 70.85 and 56.16%, respectively. Seven subcategories of substrates were also classified with a mean accuracy of 74.87%.

The results show that the ecological civilization demonstration zone has basically and effectively reduced air pollution, except for carbon monoxide and ozone. In addition, the spatial spillover effects of the ecological civilization demonstration zone on air pollution are not only basically supported among the treated cities, but also extremely established in the untreated cities neighboring the treated cities. Furthermore, no clear evidence supports the establishment of the political promotion tournament in China, while local cadres tend to cope with the assessment of higher officials passively rather than actively. Overall, this study sheds light on the coordination of economic development and ecological civilization from the perspective of the career concerns of local cadres. © 2021 by the authors.

As two or more fields are confined within the common electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) window, they directly disturb EIT dark state at the same time, which leads to the self- and cross-Kerr nonlinear interactions. Our scheme is different from the existed schemes based on three-level or multilevel systems only existing single type of nonlinear interactions. In the common EIT windows, the self- and cross-Kerr nonlinearities are established with suppressed linear absorption and our scheme can be generalized polychromatic Kerr nonlinearity. Because the atoms are almost trapped in the ground states and the atom population becomes unchanged, the scheme is robust to the atomic spontaneous emission. Our scheme is a promising avenue for preparation of squeezing and entanglement. © 2021","Dark state; Electromagnetically induced transparency; Multimode squeezing and entanglement; Polychromatic Kerr nonlinearity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117212167

Understanding the distribution patterns of biomass and C is the key to vegetation restoration in fragile ecosystems, however, there is limited understanding of the intraspecific biomass and C distributions of shrubs resulting from plant interactions in karst areas. In this study, three vegetation restoration types, a Dodonaea viscosa monoculture (DM), a Eucalyptus maideni and D. viscosa mixed-species plantation (EDP) and a Pinus massoniana and D. viscosa mixed-species plantation (PDP), were selected to determine the effects of plant interactions on the variations in the C distributions of D. viscosa among the three vegetation restoration types following 7 years of restoration. The results showed that: (1) plant interactions decreased the leaf biomass fraction. The interaction of P. massoniana and D. viscosa decreased the branch biomass fraction and increased the stem and root biomass fraction, but not the interaction of E. maideni and D. viscosa. Plant interactions changed the C concentrations of stems and roots rather than those of leaves and branches. (2) Plant interactions affected the soil nutrients and forest characteristics significantly. Meanwhile, the biomass distribution was affected by soil total nitrogen, clumping index and gap fraction; the C concentrations were influenced by the leaf area index and soil total phosphorus. (3) The C storage proportions of all the components correlated significantly with the proportion of biomass. Our results suggested that both the biomass distribution and C concentration of D. viscosa were affected by plant interactions, however, the biomass fraction not the C concentration determines the C storage fraction characteristics for D. viscosa. © 2021 Wang et al.

This study proposes a partnership of the CE, solar power plant (SPP) and coal-fired thermal power plant (TPP). Based on the tripartite evolutionary game model and current policies of China, the evolutionary processes are simulated and discussed. The results reveal that stable states can be achieved under different partnership modes. Effect evaluation results of typical parameters on the three participants show that on the premise of ensuring the participations of CE and SPP, properly reducing the prices of carbon emission share sold to the TPP will strengthen the participation willingness of TPP. The relatively reasonable selling price ranges of carbon emission share of the CE and SPP sold to the TPP are 6.0∼6.2 $/t and 5.3∼5.5 $/t, respectively. Higher zero carbon emission reward and higher carbon tax can strengthen the participation willingness of TPP and make the TPP achieve the carbon neutral. This study can provide a reference for the government and related industries to promote the carbon neutral development as well as the coordinated development of solar power and coal-fired thermal power. © 2021 The Author(s)","Carbon emission reduction; Carbon neutral; Carbon trading; Coal-fired thermal power plant; Solar power plant","Carbon; Coal; Game theory; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Thermoelectric power plants; Carbon emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Carbon exchange; Carbon neutrals; Carbon trading; Coal fired thermal power plants; Evolutionary games; Game-theoretic; Thermal power; Thermal-power plants; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119456567

With the extensive use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other forms of land-use change, anthropogenic activities have contributed to the ever-increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, causing global climate change. In response to the worsening global climate change, achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 is the most pressing task on the planet. To this end, it is of utmost importance and a significant challenge to reform the current production systems to reduce GHG emissions and promote the capture of CO2 from the atmosphere. Herein, we review innovative technologies that offer solutions achieving carbon (C) neutrality and sustainable development, including those for renewable energy production, food system transformation, waste valorization, C sink conservation, and C-negative manufacturing. The wealth of knowledge disseminated in this review could inspire the global community and drive the further development of innovative technologies to mitigate climate change and sustainably support human activities. © 2021 The Authors","carbon capture and utilization; carbon footprint reduction; carbon neutrality; carbon sequestration; climate change mitigation; renewable energy",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119622662

The social distancing requirement, with the aim of reducing contact risk in public transit, could exacerbate traffic congestion and emissions. We propose a simulation tool to evaluate the trade-offs between traffic congestion, emissions, and policies impacting travel behavior to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 including social distancing and working from home. Open-source agent-based simulation models are used to evaluate the transportation system usage for the case study of New York City. A Post Processing Software for Air Quality (PPS-AQ) estimation is used to evaluate the air quality impacts. Finally, system-wide contact exposure on the subway is estimated from the traffic simulation output. The social distancing requirement in public transit is found to be effective in reducing contact exposure, but it has negative congestion and emission impacts on Manhattan and neighborhoods at transit and commercial hubs. While telework can reduce congestion and emissions citywide, in Manhattan the negative impacts are higher due to behavioral inertia and social distancing. The findings suggest that contact exposure to COVID-19 on subways is relatively low, especially if social distancing practices are followed. The proposed integrated traffic simulation models and air quality estimation model can help policymakers evaluate the impact of policies on traffic congestion and emissions as well as identifying hot spots, both temporally and spatially. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Emissions; Pandemic; Public transit; Traffic congestion; Travel behavior","Economic and social effects; Open source software; Open systems; Quality control; Subways; Traffic congestion; Urban transportation; COVID-19; Emission; Manhattans; Pandemic; Public transit; Quality estimation; Trade off; Traffic emissions; Traffic Policies; Travel behaviour; Air quality; mobility; public transport; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic congestion; transportation development; transportation system; travel behavior; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116619525

This study aimed to explore the spatial and temporal patterns and driving factors of CO2 emissions in China. First, we constructed a conceptual model of the factors influencing CO2 emissions, including economic growth, industrial structure, energy consumption, urban development, foreign trade, and government management. Second, we selected 30 provinces in China from 2006 to 2019 as research objects and adopted exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) methods to analyse the spatio-temporal patterns and agglomeration characteristics of CO2 emissions. Third, on the basis of 420 data samples from China, we used partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to verify the validity of the conceptual model, analyse the reliability and validity of the measurement model, calculate the path coefficient, test the hypothesis, and estimate the predictive power of the structural model. Fourth, multigroup analysis (MGA) was used to compare differences in the influencing factors for CO2 emissions during different periods and in various regions of China. The results and conclusions are as follows: (1) CO2 emissions in China increased year by year from 2006 to 2019 but gradually decreased in the eastern, central, and western regions. The eastern coastal provinces show spatial agglomeration and CO2 emission hotspots. (2) Confirmatory analysis showed that the measurement model had high reliability and validity; four latent variables (industrial structure, energy consumption, economic growth, and government management) passed the hypothesis test in the structural model and are the determinants of CO2 emissions in China. Meanwhile, economic growth is a mediating variable of industrial structure, energy consumption, foreign trade, and government administration on CO2 emissions. (3) The calculated results of the R2 and Q2 values were 76.3% and 75.4%, respectively, indicating that the structural equation model had substantial explanatory and high predictive power. (4) Taking two development stages and three main regions as control groups, we found significant differences between the paths affecting CO2 emissions, which is consistent with China’s actual development and regional economic pattern.

The results show that compared with other provinces, Jilin, Zhejiang, and Guangdong have relatively higher industrial resource allocation efficiency. The provinces with higher carbon emissions are spatially adjacent, and the provinces with lower carbon emissions are also spatially adjacent. On a national level, the improvement of industrial resource allocation can reduce carbon emissions. On a regional level, the impact of industrial resource allocation efficiency on carbon emissions is somewhat different.

Seabed features of the cold seep site were described in detail and the scales and distribution patterns of these features displayed on the seabed were quantitatively analyzed. The cold seep site is characterized by irregular and hummocky topography on the seabed relief map and patches with high to medium backscatter intensities on side-scan sonar (SSS) images. Based on visual data, six kinds of seabed features related to cold seep activity were identified: gas flares, dense benthic chemosynthetic communities, mussel beds with low population densities, shells and/or shell debris areas, authigenic carbonate concretions, and reduced sediments. Spatially, these seabed features are distributed in an approximately zoned pattern with gas plumes and benthic communities in the innermost part of Site F and the reduced sediments in the outermost part. Based on the integrated acoustic and visual images and in-situ geochemical data, a conceptual model describing the cold seep fluid conduits within the shallow subsurface at Site F at the present is established. Briefly, favorable conduits have developed within the authigenic carbonate mound. The conduits channelize the cold seep fluids and result in relatively focused discharge of the seep fluids at the intersections of the conduits and the seabed, to sustain the dense communities there. Additionally, the authigenic carbonate concretions redirect some of the cold seep fluids to seeps at the periphery of the site, resulting in the reduced sediments. Integrated acoustic and visual investigations combined with in situ measurements are an effective way to quantitatively study the spatial extent of a cold seep site and can provide detailed information for further study of the cold seep system. © 2021 The Authors","Anaerobic oxidation of methane; Authigenic carbonate; Chemosynthetic communities; Cold seeps; Offshore southwestern taiwan","Backscattering; Carbonation; Population statistics; Sediments; Topography; Authigenic carbonates; Backscatter intensity; Benthic communities; Distribution patterns; Integrated applications; Population densities; Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV); Visual investigation; Remotely operated vehicles; acoustic data; benthos; carbonate; cold seep; discharge; remotely operated vehicle; sonar; topography; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Formosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114167912

However, the impacts of environmental regulations on economic activities and pollutant emissions have been under intense debates. In this paper, we attempt to empirically investigate the roles of economic development in the heterogeneous impacts of environmental regulations on green productivity in a panel of China's cities. To test the heterogeneous impacts, we use a partially linear functional-coefficient (PLFC) model which allows the effects of environmental regulation vary with economic development. This paper further constructs an alternative efficiency indicator to explore the orders of impacts on green productivity or solely reducing pollution. Based on the thresholds from PLFC, we divide the cities into 6 groups to discuss the priorities in environmental strategies. We find that economic development is the preconditions for environmental regulation to work. Only when the GDP per capita is higher than 42,142 RMB, can environmental regulations promote green productivity; while a higher GDP per capita over 51,586 RMB enables the goal of reducing pollution ahead of schedule. Our results demonstrate that environmental regulations in 9% of cities promote green productivity, and 40% could reduce pollution without hampering economic outputs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental regulations; GDP; Green productivity; Partially linear functional-coefficient model","Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Pollution; Economic activities; Economic development; Efficiency indicators; Functional-coefficient models; GDP; Green productivity; Linear functional; Partially linear functional-coefficient model; Per capita; Pollutants emissions; Productivity; economic development; environmental economics; environmental policy; Gross Domestic Product; pollution control; regulatory framework; China; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116333751

End-users should plan their investments accounting for future policies, such as incentives for system-oriented consumption, emission prices and hydrogen economy, to ensure long-term competitiveness. In this work, the utilization of variable renewable energy and flexibility potentials in a case study of an an aggregate industry, is investigated. An energy concept considering PV and battery expansion, flexible production, fuel cell electric trucks (FCEV) and hydrogen production is proposed, and analysed under expected techno-economic conditions and policies of 2030 using an energy system optimization model. Under this concept, total costs and emissions are reduced by 14% and 70%, respectively, compared to the business-as-usual system. The main benefit of PV investment is the lowered electricity procurement. Flexibility from schedule manufacturing and hydrogen production increases not only the self-consumption of PV generation from 51% to 80% but also the optimal PV capacity by 41%. Despite the expected cost reduction and efficiency improvement, FCEV is still not competitive to diesel trucks due to higher investment and fuel prices, i.e., its adoption increases the costs by 8%. However, this is resolved when hydrogen can be produced from own surplus electricity generation. Our findings reveal synergistic effects between different potentials and the importance of enabling local business models, e.g., regional hydrogen production and storage services. The SWOT analysis of the proposed concept shows that the pursuit of sustainability via new technologies entails new opportunities and risks.

A microcosm system of control (ambient Camb) and CO2 treatments [low partial pressure of carbon dioxide, PCO2 (Clow) = 35,094 µatm, and high PCO2 (Chigh) = 66,685 µatm)] was supplied with river water for 11 weeks. We measured zebra mussel settlement, juvenile native mussel (Lampsilis cardium and L. siliquoidea) growth and condition, and macroinvertebrate and periphyton community composition. Zebra mussels settled in all Camb tanks (n = 4) from early July through August compared to one mussel in a CO2 treatment tank over the same period. Native mussel growth, tissue condition, and shell condition were reduced in CO2, particularly in the highest treatment. Benthic biomass (excluding zebra mussels) was similar in Camb and Clow but was reduced in Chigh. Macroinvertebrate community composition differed among treatments due to greater abundance of Chironomidae in Clow and Oligochaeata in Chigh. Periphyton abundance and richness increased in both CO2 treatments and was driven by increases in Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta, and Chlorophyta. Our results indicate that efficacious levels of CO2 (~ 35,000 µatm PCO2) for reducing biofouling by dreissenids are tolerable to most freshwater benthic taxa. Chronic elevated CO2 infusion (&gt; 35,000 µatm PCO2) may reduce native mussel growth and condition and alter benthic invertebrate and periphyton community composition. Further refinement of CO2 application strategies is needed to determine minimum effective dose and duration to prevent dreissenid settlement and minimize effects on nontarget organisms. © Waller et al.","Biofouling; Dreissenid; Hypercapnia; Macroinvertebrate; Periphyton; Unionid mussel; Veliger",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121034071

The model considers the processes of excitation of high levels of Rb, ionization, ion-electron recombination, and heating of electrons, which affect the diffusion coefficient of Rb ions. Two types of Rb DPAL were studied: A low-power laboratory-scale device with pump power of several tens of watts and a high-power multi-kilowatt laser. Efficient operation of the Rb laser using pureHe as buffer gas can be achieved only in a large-scale laser with a pump beam cross-sectional area of several cm2.

A mixed-use district of 170,000 m2 floor area including office, residential, retail, education, etc. is studied under current and future climate conditions in Switzerland and Singapore. Our findings are consistent with previous studies, which indicate that DR generally leads to smaller system capacities due to peak shaving. We further show that in both the Swiss and Singapore context, cost and emissions of the MES can be reduced significantly with DR. Applying DR, the optimal area for BIPV placement increases only marginally for Singapore (~1%), whereas for Switzerland, the area is even reduced by 2-8%, depending on the carbon target.

When applied to soil, N fertilizers are subject to nitrification, where NH3–oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) oxidize NH3 to NO2–, NO2––oxidizing bacteria (NOB) oxidize NO2– to NO3−, and N oxides are produced from biotic and abiotic reactions. This study used soil microcosms to evaluate the properties of nitrification in response to the addition of N as digestate vs. NH4Cl in soils from the different climatic regions of the western Oregon coastal plain (CP) and eastern Oregon Columbia River basin (CRB). In each soil, properties of NH3 oxidation or N oxide accumulation did not differ when N was provided via digestate or NH4Cl over the normal temperature range; however, nitrification rates, communities, and products differed between soils. The average nitrification rate in CP soil was almost twofold higher than in CRB soil (P ≤.001), despite no significant differences in AOB activity or AOB amoA copy numbers. With N addition, AOA activity also increased in CP soil, where AOA amoA copy numbers were fivefold higher than CRB soil (P &lt;.002). Accumulation of NO2– only in CRB soil was likely due to NOB inhibition by high NH3 concentrations (∼560 μM) present at the high pH of CRB soil (8.5). Overall, nitrification was dictated by differences in edaphic properties, temperature, and nitrifier communities more than N source. © 2021 The Authors.

This study gives a detailed view to the changes in intracellular hydrocarbon chain saturation in response to different growth temperatures and osmotic stress, and the associated physiological effects in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We show that the ratio between the representative hydrocarbons, saturated heptadecane and desaturated heptadecene, is reduced upon transition from 38°C toward 15°C, while the total content is not much altered. In parallel, it appears that in the hydrocarbon-deficient ∆ado (aldehyde deformylating oxygenase) mutant, phenotypic and metabolic changes become more evident under suboptimal temperatures. These include hindered growth, accumulation of polyhydroxybutyrate, altered pigment profile, restricted phycobilisome movement, and ultimately reduced CO2 uptake and oxygen evolution in the ∆ado strain as compared to Synechocystis wild type. The hydrocarbons are present in relatively low amounts and expected to interact with other nonpolar cellular components, including the hydrophobic part of the membrane lipids. We hypothesize that the function of the aliphatic chains is specifically associated with local fluidity effects of the thylakoid membrane, which may be required for the optimal movement of the integral components of the photosynthetic machinery. The findings support earlier studies and expand our understanding of the biological role of aliphatic hydrocarbons in acclimation to low temperature in cyanobacteria and link the proposed role in the thylakoid membrane to changes in photosynthetic performance, central carbon metabolism, and cell growth, which need to be effectively fine-tuned under alternating conditions in nature.

However, mainstreaming agricultural emissions into a climate action agenda through integrative approaches, such as Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA), largely reinforces adaptation– mitigation dualism and pays inadequate attention to institutions’ linkage on the generation of externalities, such as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. This may undermine the effectiveness of local–global climate risk management initiatives. Literature data and a survey of small-scale farmers’ dairy feeding strategies were used in the simulation of GHG emissions. The effect of price risks on ecoefficiencies or the amount of GHG emissions per unit of produced milk is framed as a proxy for institutional feedbacks on GHG emissions and effect at scale. This case study on small-scale dairy farmers in western Kenya illustrates the effect of local-level and sectoral-level institutional constraints, such as market risks on decision making, on GHG emissions and the effectiveness of climate action. The findings suggest that price risks are significant in incentivising the adoption of CSA technologies. Since institutional interactions influence the choice of individual farmer management actions in adaptation planning, they significantly contribute to GHG spillover at scale. This can be visualised in terms of the nexus between low or non-existent dairy feeding strategies, low herd productivity, and net higher methane emissions per unit of produced milk in a dairy value chain. The use of the Sustainable Food Value Chain (SFVC) analytical lens could mediate the identification of binding constraints, foster organisational and policy coherence, as well as broker the effective mainstreaming of agricultural emissions into local–global climate change risk management initiatives. Market risks thus provide a systematic and holistic lens for assessing alternative carbon transitions, climate financing, adaptation–mitigation dualism, and the related risk of maladaptation, all of which are integral in the planning and implementation of effective climate action initiatives. © 2021 by the authors.

Transport is one of the key conditions for economic development and meeting the needs of countries, regions, and cities. However, transport must meet not only the physiological but also the social needs of society, one of which is environmental security. Urban transport accounts for around 40% of CO2 emissions and 70% of other pollutants from road transport. Thus, one of the most difficult issues for any city to address when building bypasses is the growing number of cars in the city, traffic congestion, and the reduction of all greenhouse gas emissions. The documents adopted in July 2020 aim to revitalise the EU’s economy by moving towards a green economy and sustainability. In addition to the systematic and comparative analysis of concepts published in the scientific literature, the article also presents an analysis of the concepts of the sustainable city and sustainable transport, as well as a study of the social impact of bypasses and the assessment of the security of the social environment in the Baltic capitals. The aim of the article is to assess the impact of the growing number of vehicles on the security of the city’s social environment. Research results show that the number of pollutants and a direct dependence between the number of pollutants and the driving speed were established. Therefore, it needs to make investments in the transport sector: improving roads, the construction of bypasses, and the technical parameters of purchased cars. © 2021 by the authors.

Karst. and Fagus sylvatica (L.) are important tree species in Europe, and the foreseen increase in temperature and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) could increase the vulnerability of these species. However, their physiological performance under climate change at temperate and productive sites is not yet fully understood, especially in uneven-aged stands. Therefore, we investigated tree-ring width and stable isotope chronologies (δ13C/δ18O) of these two species at 10 sites along a climate gradient in Central Europe. In these uneven-aged stands, we compared the year-to-year variability of dominant and suppressed trees for the last 80 years in relation to the sites' spatial distribution and climate. δ18O and δ13C were generally consistent across sites and species, showing high sensitivity to summer VPD, whereas climate correlations with radial growth varied much more and depended on mean local climate. We found no significant differences between dominant and suppressed trees in the response of stable isotope ratios to climate variability, especially within the annual high-frequency signals. In addition, we observed a strikingly high coherence of the high-frequency δ18O variations across long distances with significant correlations above 1500 km, whereas the spatial agreement of δ13C variations was weaker (~700 km). We applied a dual-isotope approach that is based on known theoretical understanding of isotope fractionations to translate the observed changes into physiological components, mainly photosynthetic assimilation rate and stomatal conductance. When separating the chronologies in two time windows and investigating the shifts in isotopes ratios, a significant enrichment of either or both isotope ratios over the last decades can be observed. These results, translated by the dual-isotope approach, indicate a general climate-driven decrease in stomatal conductance. This improved understanding of the physiological mechanisms controlling the short-term variation of the isotopic signature will help to define the performance of these tree species under future climate. © The Author(s) 2021.

Managing native vegetation in a rapidly expanding urban setting requires land management strategies that are cognizant of these impacts and how species and communities may adapt to a future climate. Here, we demonstrate how identifying climate refugia for threatened vegetation communities in an urban matrix can be used to support management decisions by local government authorities under the dual pressures of urban expansion and climate change. This research was focused on a local government area in New South Wales, Australia, that is undergoing significant residential, commercial and agricultural expansion resulting in the transition of native forest to other more intensive land-uses. Our results indicate that the key drivers of change from native vegetation to urban and agriculture classes were population density and the proximity to urban areas. We found two of the most cleared vegetation community types are physically restricted to land owned or managed by council, suggesting their long-term ecological viability is uncertain under a warming climate. We propose that land use planning decisions must recognize the compounding spatial and temporal pressures of urban development, land clearing and climate change, and how current policy responses, such as biodiversity offsetting, can respond positively to habitat shifts in order to secure the longevity of important ecological communities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Climate refugia; Land change modeler; Land-use change; Threatened plant communities","adaptive management; biodegradation; climate change; habitat loss; land use planning; local government; plant community; urban area; article; biodiversity; climate change; forest; government; habitat; human; longevity; New South Wales; plant community; population density; refugium; urban area; vegetation; warming; ecosystem; environmental protection; Australia; New South Wales; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112483923

Many urban inhabitants were confined to their homes during the lockdown. This had an impact air pollution, due to a reduction the number of vehicles being operated in cities. People also limited the number of visits to shopping centers; additionally, sports venues were closed and cultural events cancelled. The COVID-19 pandemic therefore had a positive impact on air pollution. Several studies from around the world confirm this. The research presented here is based on hourly measurements of PM10 and NO2 concentrations measured in background ambient air at a specific intersection located in Uherske Hradiste, Czech Republic. The aim of the paper is to confirm or exclude the hypothesis that the measured concentrations of PM10 and NO2 pollutants were lower during 2020 than in 2019, when states of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic were declared. The data were aggregated into monthly subsets and statistically analyzed. The data was graphically visualized and evaluated by means of exploratory data analysis. To compare the pollution levels in individual months, a parametric statistical analysis (two-sample t-test) was used. A statistically significant reduction was observed in the measured concentrations in 2020 compared to 2019 during periods when states of emergency were declared. © 2021 by the authors.

To reach the planned goals, the most promising approach is working both on ships improvement and ports redesign. The latter must enable the new green ships supply with sustainable electrical energy, by integrating shore connection systems, local renewables, and energy storage systems. In this paper, a methodology to obtain such an objective is proposed, capable of taking into account both ships’ and ports’ characteristics. The methodology workflow is explained through a case study, where two shore connection power sizes and two different operative approaches for recharging the ship onboard energy storage are considered. A discussion about the most suitable energy storage technologies is also provided. The case study shows how the methodology can be applied, as well as demonstrating that the port infrastructure has a direct effect on the ship environmental performance. © 2021 by the authors.

In recent years, bus operators have started focusing on the electrification of their fleet to reduce the air pollutants in cities, which has led to a growing interest from the scientific community. This paper presents an analysis of the BEB powertrain topology and the charging technology of BEBs, with a particular emphasis on the power electronics systems. Moreover, the different key technical requirements to facilitate the operation of BEBs are addressed. Accordingly, an in‐depth review on vehicle scheduling, charger location optimization and charging management strategies is carried out. The main findings concerning these research fields are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, potential challenges and required further developments are determined. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that an accurate energy consumption assessment of their BEBs is a must for bus operators, that real‐time, multi‐objective smart charging management strategies with V2X features should be included when performing large bus fleet scheduling and that synchronized opportunity charging, smart green depot charging, and electric bus rapid transit can further reduce the impact on the grid. This review paper should help to enable a smarter and more efficient integration of BEBs in cities in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

A multisite positive matrix factorization analysis was used to compare the source contributions between the two stations, while the trends for both the chemical species and source contributions were studied using the Theil–Sen trend estimator. Between 2009 and 2018, both stations showed a statistically significant decrease in PM2.5 concentrations, which was driven by the downward trends of levels of chemical species and anthropogenic source contributions, mainly from heavy oil combustion, mixed combustion, industry, and secondary sulfate. These source contributions showed a continuous decrease over the study period, signifying the continuing success of mitigation strategies, although the trends of heavy oil combustion and secondary sulfate have flattened since 2016. Secondary nitrate also followed a significant decreasing trend in BCN, while secondary organic aerosols (SOA) very slightly decreased in MSY. The observed decreasing trends, in combination with the absence of a trend for the organic aerosols (OA) at both stations, resulted in an increase in the relative proportion of OA in PM2.5 by 12% in BCN and 9% in MSY, mostly from SOA, which increased by 7% in BCN and 4% in MSY. Thus, at the end of the study period, OA accounted for 40% and 50% of the annual mean PM2.5 at BCN and MSY, respectively. This might have relevant implications for air quality policies aiming at abating PM2.5 in the study region and for possible changes in toxicity of PM2.5 due to marked changes in composition and source apportionment. © 2021 The Authors","Multisite PMF; PM2.5; SOA; Source apportionment; Time-series analysis","Air quality; Air quality standards; Chemical analysis; Crude oil; Factorization; Heavy oil production; Sulfur compounds; Time series analysis; Barcelona; Chemical compositions; Chemical sources; Multisite PMF; Organic aerosol; PM$-2.5$; Secondary organic aerosol; Source apportionment; Source contributions; Time-series analysis; Aerosols; calcium sulfate; magnesium sulfate; nitrate; oil; sodium nitrate; sodium sulfate; sulfate; nitric acid derivative; aerosol; chemical composition; particulate matter; source apportionment; time series analysis; trend analysis; urban atmosphere; aerosol; air quality; Article; biomass; chemical composition; combustion; environmental management; high performance liquid chromatography; particulate matter; Spain; time series analysis; trend study; urban rural difference; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; Spain; Barcelona [Barcelona (PRV)]; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrates; Particulate Matter; Spain; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109702296

In this work a test bed with a compression ignition engine has been used to measure emissions when using a ternary fuel blend between diesel, biodiesel and ethanol together with exhuast gas recirculation (EGR) and different fuel delivery techniques. EGR with biofuels have the potential to significantly reduce NOx over conventional diesel combustion. The fuel used, B2E9 achieves a 10% renewable content as set out in the UK government’s Renewable Energy Directive. Most studies reported in the literature evaluates emissions reduction technologies by only changing one factor-at-a-time at steady state conditions. This paper addresses these issues and presents a methodology utilising a Central Composite Design (CCD) analysis to optimise four engine parameters which include EGR percentage, main injection SOI, pilot injection SOI and pilot injection open duration over a transient drive cycle (WLTP) which makes the results more applicable to real world driving conditions. The optimisation of the CCD showed that NOx emissions decreases by 25% when the maximum exhaust gas recirculation is set to 45%, the main injection is retarded by 2 CADs, the pilot injection dwell time is set to 21 CADs and 24% of the fuel is delivered through the pilot injection. CO emissions increase by approximately 47% as a result of the decrease in NOx emissions. © IMechE 2020.","Biofuel; design of experiment; EGR; engine emission; pilot injection; WLTP","Biofuels; Combustion; Diesel engines; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Central composite designs; Compression ignition engine; Emissions-reduction technology; Engine manufacturers; Exhuast gas recirculation; Real-world drivings; Steady-state condition; Transient conditions; Exhaust gas recirculation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096568026

The annealed RGO film at 1100 °C (designated as RGO1100) exhibited a low sheet resistance (1250 Ω.cm−2) with a wide bandgap of 2.82 eV. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) experiments in 1 M H2SO4 solution under solar simulation light (1.5 AM) showed photocurrent densities of 48 and 70 μA.cm−2 for non-annealed RGO (72.5% sp2 fraction) and RGO1100 (87% sp2 fraction) respectively, equivalent to an increase of 45.8% for RGO1100. The bandgap widening as well as electrical conductivity increase of RGO1100 were closely interpreted on the basis of sp2 domain restoration, electronic and molecular orbital structures obtained from extensive experimental data as well as elaborated Geometry, Frequency, Noncovalent Extended Tight-binding (GFN2-xTB) and simplified Tamm-Dancoff density functional theory (sTD-DFT) calculations. The correlation between the electronic structure and the PEC performance of the RGO was also evaluated when the impact of the spatial distribution of oxidation and reduction regions on the recombination rate between photogenerated electrons and holes had been taken into account. The findings shed light on the structure-PEC relationship of RGO1100, which will definitely assist in designing and tailoring RGO-based, highly active materials for PEC applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Electrical conductivity; Enlarged bandgap; Photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties; Reduced graphene oxide (RGO); sp2 domain; Theoretical calculations; Thermal annealing","Annealing; Density functional theory; Electric conductivity; Electronic structure; Graphene; Hydrogen; Molecular orbitals; Oxide films; Photoelectrochemical cells; Electrical conductivity; Enlarged bandgap; Graphene oxide films; Photoelectrochemical properties; Photoelectrochemicals; Reduced graphene oxide; Reduced graphene oxides; Sp2 domain; Theoretical calculations; Thermal-annealing; Energy gap",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116284085

Remotely sensed fire severity is traditionally evaluated using the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) derived from multispectral imagery. This spectral index is based on bi-temporal differenced reflectance changes caused by fires in the near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral regions. Our study aims to evaluate the spectral sensitivity of the dNBR using hyperspectral imagery by identifying the optimal bi-spectral NIR SWIR combination. This assessment made use of a rare opportunity arising from the pre-and post-fire airborne image acquisitions over the 2013 Rim and 2014 King fires in California with the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) sensor. The 224 contiguous bands of this sensor allow for 5760 unique combinations of the dNBR at a high spatial resolution of approximately 15 m. The performance of the hyperspectral dNBR was assessed by comparison against field data and the spectral optimality statistic. The field data is composed of 83 in situ measurements of fire severity using the Geometrically structured Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI) protocol. The optimality statistic ranges between zero and one, with one denoting an optimal measurement of the fire-induced spectral change. We also combined the field and optimality assessments into a combined score. The hyperspectral dNBR combinations demonstrated strong relationships with GeoCBI field data. The best performance of the dNBR combination was derived from bands 63, centered at 0.962 µm, and 218, centered at 2.382 µm. This bi-spectral combination yielded a strong relationship with GeoCBI field data of R2 = 0.70 based on a saturated growth model and a median spectral index optimality statistic of 0.31. Our hyperspectral sensitivity analysis revealed optimal NIR and SWIR bands for the composition of the dNBR that are outside the ranges of the NIR and SWIR bands of the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 sensors.

Municipalities in dense, urban areas are challenged with facilitating this transition with limited space and energy resources, and with future uncertainties. One important aspect of the transition is the adoption of electric vehicles, which includes the adequate design of charging infrastructure. Another important goal is a modal shift in transportation. This study investigated over 80 urban mobility policy measures that are in the policy roadmap of two of the largest municipalities of the Netherlands. This analysis consists of an inventory of policy measures, an evaluation of their environmental effects and conceptualizations of the policy objectives and conditions within the mobility transitions. The findings reveal that the two municipalities have similarities in means, there is still little anticipation of future technology and policy conditions could be further satisfied by introducing tailored measures for specific user groups. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, they are increasingly linked to the initiative of calculating their carbon footprint (CF), which is a tool to assess sustainability from the perspective of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The aim of this study is to carry out a systematic review of the current situation of CF assessment in academic institutions by analysing different key elements, such as the time period, methodologies and practises, calculation tools, emission sources, emission factors and reduction plans. The review protocol considered articles published until March 2021. Of the articles reviewed, 35 are aimed specifically at calculating the CF of HEI, while the remaining articles consist of review, activity-specific CF assessment or GHG emission reduction articles. Clear differences have been identified when results are compared for the normalised CF (average of 2.67 t CO2e/student, ranging from 0.06 to 10.94) or the percentage of carbon offsetting, only considered in 14% of the studies and ranging from 0.09 to 18%. The main reason for this is the lack of standardisation as regards the time metric (year, semester), functional unit (student, employee, area) and data collection boundary (scope 1, 2, 3), the emissions sources and emission factors, mainly for scope 3 (water consumption and treatment, waste treatment, office, ICT and laboratory consumables, commuting and travel, construction materials, canteens, etc.), and the inclusion or not of the effect of carbon offset projects to offset the CF (aim of the project and absorption sources and factors). However, despite the differences, a reduction over time is clearly observed. Therefore, CF in HEI requires further improvements and solutions to a number of challenges, including the definition of representative emission sources, the creation of a robust emission factor database and the development of tools/methodologies that cover all the needs of this type of organisation.

According to UNESCO, geoparks should define management policies addressed to increasing the awareness of local people and tourists about Earth’s dynamics to reduce the impact of climate change and natural disasters. With this aim in mind, we tried to provide a solid scientific approach to geotourism that could be useful to the development of a geotourism strategy in the Cilento, Vallo di Diano and Alburni (CVDA) Geopark, in Southern Italy. Starting from the official inventory of the CVDA Geopark, we defined the potential Education Value (EV) and potential Touristic Value (TV) of each of the 160 sites listed by applying the Brilha method. Then we selected 20 geosites and geomorphosites with high values of both the EV and TV, and we included them in two geoitineraries. The two geoitineraries move in the inner sector of the Geopark (i.e., from the Paestum archaeological area to the Vallo di Diano basin) and along a portion of the coastal stretch (i.e., from Punta Telegrafo cape to the Lambro and Mingardo rivers’ mouths). Selected sites are representative of several geoscience disciplines (e.g., geomorphology, structural geology, quaternary geology, hydrogeology), thus suggesting that the CVDA Geopark is an ideal place where dissemination of geoscience concepts may be carried out. The latter point enhances the high geotourism potential of the area. This kind of approach was not tried before in the CVDA Geopark and can be a useful example of how to promote touristic development strategies in the area. © 2021 by the authors.

This challenge is particularly onerous when there is a coincidence between this variability and congestion of the tie-lines. Renewable generation spillage often leads to constraints being placed on the output of renewable energy sources. This situation causes a significant cost for electricity system operators due to the need for constraint payments to be made to renewable generations. These increased costs will ultimately be recovered from energy customers. Maintaining the balance in the aforementioned decarbonization, security of supply and affordability is a challenge that constitutes the energy trilemma. The integration of electric power systems with other energy infrastructures, e.g., natural gas, could be a promising solution for achieving a balanced performance in the energy trilemma, controlling the fluctuation of renewable energy sources, and increasing the flexibility of the integrated systems. Considering this, a hybrid bridging-operational framework based on the vector-bridging system concept is proposed. Also, a day-ahead integrated scheduling model is proposed that optimizes the integrated operation by considering the constraint payment costs in a linear optimization model. Simulation results on a large test system indicated that the hybrid bridging-operational framework could reduce the total cost of the congested system by 65% and release up to 10% of the pipeline capacities while harvesting the wind generation and removing constraint payments to wind generators. © 2021 The Authors","Constraint payment; Integrated gas and electricity networks; Power-to-gas; Vector-bridging system; Wind power","Costs; Decarbonization; Electric power systems; Linear programming; Natural resources; Bridging systems; Constraint payment; Decarbonisation; Electricity System Operators; Energy; Integrated gas and electricity network; Power; Power-to-gas; Renewable energy source; Vector-bridging system; Wind power; alternative energy; electrical power; electricity industry; electricity supply; energy resource; operations technology; power generation; strategic approach; supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110668983

A bottom-up approach was utilized to model the characteristics of individual reference buildings. First, reference designs and practices were developed for climatic regions across the United States to capture spatial variation in energy demand, building codes, and structural performance. Then, the results were scaled up to regional networks (at county and state levels) and finally to the entire country. Given the fact that mitigation strategies can vary by region and building type, we explored the key drivers of impacts in the buildings sector and prioritized which strategies should be applied in different regions and building types. To meet deep decarbonization goals, we will need to pursue strategies for GHG emissions reductions in both the embodied and operational phases of the building life cycle. We found there will be no meaningful reduction in building GHG emissions in the Western US and New England regions under current projected technology and code improvements because they are on the leading edge of emissions reduction strategies. However, there is much more opportunity to lower life cycle GHG emissions in the Midwest and central US regions because they are further behind the implementation of reduction strategies. A number of interventions—chiefly to the electricity grid, appliances, and lighting—could nearly halve the emissions of new buildings constructed between 2016 and 2050. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Embodied and operational impacts; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment; Mitigation strategies; Residential and commercial buildings","Emission control; Gas emissions; Life cycle; Office buildings; Structural analysis; Building types; Buildings sector; Commercial building; Embodied and operational impact; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Mitigation strategy; Region types; Regional variation; Residential building; Greenhouse gases; bottom-up approach; demand analysis; emission control; greenhouse gas; mitigation; prioritization; regional climate; residential energy; strategic approach; Midwest; New England; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112277690

Using 761 household interviews and 33 focus group discussions (FGDs) with smallholder farmers from six districts, data was collected on how smallholder farmers in the region experience climate change, what CA practices they had adopted, and benefits and challenges associated with CA practice. Results show that men and women farmers had similar experiences of climate change, namely late onset of a shortened rainy season, intra-seasonal drought and higher temperatures. Farmers' perceptions of gender-mediated effects of climate change had important nuances. The three most cited effects of climate change on women mentioned by women were lower crop yields, outbreaks of armyworms and reduced livestock fodder. The men thought women were most affected by increased hunger, lower crop yields and reduced domestic water sources. According to the women FGDs, men were most affected through reduced crop yields, increases in livestock diseases and increased hunger. The men self-reported reduced crop yields, reduced water for livestock and outbreaks of armyworms. Both men and women saw CA as having climate change adaptation benefits. For the women, men most benefitted from CA through the high moisture holding capacity of basins, higher crop yields and reduced labor requirements through use of oxen ripping. The men most appreciated the high crop yields, improved soil fertility and reduced costs as less fertilizer is used. The women cited the high moisture holding capacity of basins, high crop yields and improved soil fertility as benefits they most commonly derived from CA, while the men thought the women most benefitted from CA through the higher crop yields, improved soil fertility and crop tolerance to droughts. The study concludes that there is room for CA to serve as a climate smart agricultural system for both men and women smallholder farmers in Eastern Zambia. However, this will require addressing important challenges of high weed pressure, high labor demands, and low access to manure, and CA farming implements. The CA package for Zambia should include access to timely climate information and climate informed crop choices.

Best-fit regional probability distribution out of five 3-parameter distributions is selected and estimated using L-moment statistical technique. For joint distribution, the best-fit Gumbel-Hougaard copula is selected based on graphical and numerical statistical tools. The selected copula has the property to measure upper-tail dependence which is highly important in drought risk assessment. Potential drought risks are estimated and compared through univariate and bivariate joint return periods at selected years. The drought duration and severity increase with an increase in return periods. The contour lines for combinations of drought duration and severity at selected return periods are graphed. Most of the combinations in the regions are near the lines of lower return periods and have smaller interarrival times while some with larger interarrival times.

Conservation of seagrass requires identification of the main pressures contributing to loss and the regions most at risk of ongoing loss. Here, we model trajectories of seagrass change at the global scale and show they are related to multiple anthropogenic pressures but that trajectories vary widely with seagrass life-history strategies. Rapidly declining trajectories of seagrass meadow extent (>25% loss from 2000 to 2010) were most strongly associated with high pressures from destructive demersal fishing and poor water quality. Conversely, seagrass meadow extent was more likely to be increasing when these two pressures were low. Meadows dominated by seagrasses with persistent life-history strategies tended to have slowly changing or stable trajectories, while those with opportunistic species were more variable, with a higher probability of either rapidly declining or rapidly increasing. Global predictions of regions most at risk for decline show high-risk areas in Europe, North America, Japan, and southeast Asia, including places where comprehensive long-term monitoring data are lacking. Our results highlight where seagrass loss may be occurring unnoticed and where urgent conservation interventions are required to reverse loss and sustain their essential services. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Through understanding past changes we can better predict the response of peatlands to future climate change. We use a multi-proxy approach to reconstruct the surface wetness and carbon accumulation of the Mukhrino mire (Western Siberia), describing the development of the mire since peat formation in the early Holocene, around 9360 cal. year BP. The mire started as a rich fen which initiated after paludification of a spruce forest (probably in response to a wetter climate), while the Mukhrino mire progressed to ombrotrophic bog conditions (8760 cal. year BP). This transition coincided with the intensive development of mires in Western Siberia and was associated with active carbon accumulation (31 g m−2 year−1). The ecosystem underwent a change to a tree-covered state around 5860 cal. year BP, likely in response to warming and possible droughts and this accompanied low carbon accumulation (12 g m2 year−1). If the future climate will be warmer and wetter, then regional mires are likely to remain a carbon sink, alternatively, a reversion to the wooded state with reduced carbon sink strength is possible. © 2021, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","Carbon content; n-Alkanes; Peat humification; Peatland development; Plant macrofossils; Testate amoebae","boreal forest; carbon sink; climate change; Holocene; ombrotrophic environment; paludification; peatland; Siberia; carbon sequestration; ecosystem; Russian Federation; soil; taiga; Carbon Sequestration; Ecosystem; Siberia; Soil; Taiga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103669859

In transplanted rice production systems, two opportunities exist for implementing localized micro-dose fertilization: Micro-dosing the nursery bed at sowing and dipping seedling roots at transplanting. Previous studies have focused on the individual effects of these management options, whereas none have identified how a combination of these techniques affect rice yields and fertilizer use efficiencies. Herein, we examined the effects of nursery bed micro-dosing combined with dipping seedling roots in an N-enriched solution (N-dipping) and P-enriched slurry (P-dipping) at transplanting. On-farm experiments were conducted at three sites with nutrient-poor soils in the central highlands of Madagascar. The results demonstrated that phosphorus is a key element for localized micro-dose fertilization, while single and sequential N applications could hinder initial growth and grain yields in severely and moderately P-deficient fields. Grain yields were significantly improved by nursery bed N and P micro-dosing (16 %–23 %) and by P-dipping at transplanting (33 %–46 %), except for nursery bed micro-dosing in a relatively high-yielding and less P-deficient site. The effect of these treatments were independent, and thus the yield additively increased by 55 %–67 % in the severely and moderately P-deficient sites. Moreover, the nursery bed micro-dosing and P-dipping additively shortened the number of days to heading by 17–21 days in these sites, which reduced the risk of cold-induced stress at the reproductive stage. We conclude that the combination of N and P nursery bed micro-dosing and P-dipping at transplanting can be recommended for improving yields while reducing the risk of climate-induced stress for lowland rice production under low-input and P-deficient soils. © 2021 The Author(s)","Cooling degree days; Improved nutrient management; Micro-dosing; Oryza sativa; P-dipping; Phosphorus deficiency; Seedling vigor","climate change; crop production; crop yield; phosphorus; rice; risk assessment; seedling; slurry; Madagascar; Oryza sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114341958

The reaction pathways studied start with the ""real""catalytic species [Re(en)(CO)3], [Re(en)(CO)3]- and/or [Re(en)(CO)2Cl]- generated from the excited triplet T1 state upon single and double reductive quenching by a TEOA sacrificial electron donor or photodissociation of a CO ligand. The first step in all the catalytic cycles investigated involves the capture of either CO2 or the oxidized R2NCH2CH2O radical. In the latter case, the CO2 molecule is captured (inserted) by the Re-OCH2CH2NR2 bond forming stable intermediates. Next, successive protonations (TEOA also acts as a proton donor) lead to the release of CO either from the energy consuming 2e- reduction of [Re(en)(CO)4]+ or [Re(en)(CO)2Cl]+ complexes in the CO2 capture pathways or from the released unstable diprotonated [R2NCH2CH2OC(OH)(OH)]+ species regenerating TEOA and the catalyst. The CO2 insertion reaction pathway is the favorable pathway for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 → CO catalyzed by the [Re(en)(CO)3Cl] complex in the presence of TEOA manifesting its crucial role as an electron and proton donor, capturing CO2 and releasing CO.

However, electricity and heat are economically produced from other renewables and advanced fertilizers are needed to avoid leaching and boost nutrients capture. Hence, AD seeks new opportunities to support circular bioeconomy. The overall objective of this review is to present state-of-the-art resource recovery routes for upcycling the AD streams to reduce carbon footprint and formulate alternative products to increase sustainability. Technical barriers and integrated systems to upcycle AD streams through biological means are presented. New technologies and methods to capture CH4, CO2 and nutrients from the digested residual resources are presented, as a) methanotrophs cultivation to be used as feed ingredients; b) CO2 conversion and micro-nutrients capturing from microalgae to be valorized for a wide range of applications (e.g. biofuels, food and feed, fertilizers, bioactive compounds); c) CO2 transformation to biodegradable plastics precursors (e.g. Polybutylene succinate, Polyhydroxyalkanoate); d) digestate valorization for biochar production to support efficient agricultural usage. Moreover, the environmental factors and life cycle assessment perspectives of the novel biorefinery routes are revised highlighting the need for regionalized models or assessments that can reveal the most sustainable routes based on local conditions and requirements. Despite AD poses some positive characteristics related to environmental benefit and emissions reduction, the present work reveals that the novel routes can further enhance sustainability metrics supporting circular bioeconomy. © 2021 The Authors","Added value molecules; Biogas; Circular economy; Digestate; Residual resources upcycling","Anaerobic digestion; Biodegradable polymers; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Cultivation; Emission control; Fertilizers; Life cycle; Nutrients; Sustainable development; Added value molecule; Added values; Circular economy; Digestate; Electricity production; Heat production; Renewables; Residual resource; Residual resource upcycling; State of the art; Biogas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114346089

With time-series Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and Taiwan Climate Change Estimate and Information Platform (TCCIP) gridded monthly climatic data, their vertical dynamics were investigated by employ-ing the Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) algorithm, Pearson’s correlation analysis, and the Durbin–Watson test. The vertical differences in NDVI values presented three breakpoints and a consistent trend from positive (1982 to 1989) to negative at varied rates, and then gradually increased after 2000. In addition, a positive rainfall trend was discovered. Average and maximum temperature had similar increasing trends, while minimum temperature showed variations, especially at higher altitudes. In terms of regional variations, the vegetation growth was stable in the north but worse in the central region. Higher elevations revealed larger variations in the NDVI and temperature datasets. NDVI, along with average and minimum temperature, showed their largest changes earlier in higher altitude areas. Specifically, the increasing minimum temperature direction was more prominent in the mid-to-high-altitude areas in the eastern and central regions. Seasonal variations were observed for each region. The difference between the dry and wet seasons is be-coming larger, with the smallest difference in the northern region and the largest difference in the southern region. Taiwan’s NDVI and climatic factors have a significant negative correlation (p < 0.05), but the maximum and minimum temperatures have significant positive effects at low altitudes below 500 m. The northern and central regions reveal similar responses, while the south and east display different feedbacks. The results illuminate climate change evidence from assessment of the long-term dynamics of vegetation and climatic factors, providing valuable references for estab-lishing correspondent climate-adaptive strategies in Taiwan. © 2021 by the authors.

We use conservative estimates of vehicle electrification and grid decarbonisation to focus specifically on information and communication technology (ICT) interventions. In doing so, we develop a smart mobility framework focusing on more efficient road networks and driving behaviour enabled by rapid ICT deployment. Our scenarios suggest that a combination of ambitious policy measures aimed at smoothing traffic speeds as well as improving driver behaviour in urban areas could reduce carbon emissions for cars ∼29% saving ∼7 MtCO2 and for vans ∼33% saving ∼3 MtCO2 by 2050. Potential reductions in nitrogen oxides and particulate matter 2.5 for cars are ∼22% and vans ∼10% and ∼16% respectively. We use human toxicological classification of air pollution (HCA) to assess the potential damage on human health and our scenarios suggest an upper range of ∼23% and ∼30% reductions in HCA by 2050 for cars and vans respectively. Using conservative cost values, we estimate damage costs could be avoided from car emissions range from ∼42-130 million and vans ∼89-163 million per year. However, our baseline projections indicate that emissions and damage costs avoided from passenger cars could be partially offset by growing demand for urban van delivery and freight services that are currently outpacing improved fuel and emissions performance of the vehicle stock. This may reflect broader lifestyle and consumer trends towards on-line shopping, food and delivery services, which warrants further investigation. © 2021 The Author(s).

In this study, a county-based atmospheric emission inventory of particulate matter (PM), PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NOx, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) from industrial boilers over mainland China in 2017 was developed for the first time, based on county-level activity data from ~61,000 coal-fired industrial boilers (CFIBs), ~44,000 biomass-fired industrial boilers (BFIBs), ~71,000 gas-fired industrial boilers (GFIBs) and ~9300 oil-fired industrial boilers (OFIBs), updated emission factors (EFs) and air pollution control device (APCD) efficiencies. The total national PM, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NOx, OC and EC emissions from industrial boilers in 2017 were estimated to be 1,240, 347, 761, 1,648, 1,340, 13.1 and 15.8 kilotons (kt), respectively. Intensive air pollutant emissions from industrial boilers of more than 1000 kg/km2 were predominantly in north-eastern, northern and eastern China. CFIBs contributed the most (77.6–94.0 %) to air pollutant emissions because of their high air pollutant EFs and the large amounts of coal consumed. BFIBs were the second-highest contributor to national air pollutant emissions, with the contribution of BFIBs to PM2.5, OC and EC emissions in central and southern China reaching up to 42.1 %, 61.7 % and 45.5 %, respectively. There were seasonal peaks in monthly air pollutant emissions in heating regions. The overall uncertainty realting to the new emission inventory was estimated as −25.9 %–22.7 %. Significant air pollutant emission reductions were obtained from 2017 to 2030, and by 2030 the PM, PM10, PM2.5, SO2 and NOx emissions were forecast to decrease by 40.1–84.0 %, 41.6–84.3 %, 44.5–75.2 %, 44.5–75.2 % and 19.5–46.8 % compared to 2017, respectively, under four proposed scenarios. The results of this study showed that differentiated industrial boiler management measures should be developed according to the actual emission characteristics.

Compared with the previous generation CMIP5-forced Fish-MIP ensemble, the new ensemble ecosystem simulations show a greater decline in mean global ocean animal biomass under both strong-mitigation and high-emissions scenarios due to elevated warming, despite greater uncertainty in net primary production in the high-emissions scenario.

Understanding their response to future climate is often drawn from their acclimation potential in short laboratory experiments, thereby limiting our understanding of migration, species replacement, and adaptive potential. To overcome this challenge, we examine two species of benthic foraminifera from a thermally polluted field site mimicking future warming. This site and a control station cover 13-36°C causing both warm and cold stress to the local species. Computer Tomography reveals that under heat stress, even with acclimation, Lachlanella significantly reduced its shell volume. In contrast, Pararotalia calcariformata did not reduce its shell volume but reduced the relative amount of calcite with respect to shell volume and changed its reproduction cycle from twice to once per year. Raman spectroscopy indicates that thermal conditions alter the chemical composition of the calcite shells of both species. Calcification during thermal stress creates alterations in the crystal structure that are unexpectedly more prominent under cold stress than warm stress indicating warming might positively affect the shell's protective function. Supported by previous laboratory experiments and observations from the geological record, our results provide new perspective to the effect of warming on benthic foraminifera. © 2021 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2021.","Benthic foraminifera; Calcification; Dwarfism; Field experiment; Raman spectroscopy; Thermal stress; Warming","benthic foraminifera; biological production; carbonate system; environmental stress; shell",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121125563

In this study, bioaugmentation was applied in a pilot-scale oxidation ditch with the aerobic denitrifying bacteria strain PCN-1 immobilized on polyurethane biocarriers, which demonstrated effective N2O mitigation. Microbial community analysis suggested that the bioaugmentation facilitated a symbiotic relationship of the bacterial populations between the activated sludge and the biocarriers. The denitrifying bacteria with well-known N2O reducing capabilities predominated on the biocarriers. Correspondingly, the increases of denitrifying genes and NO and N2O reductase provided evidence for the enhanced genetic potential for NO and N2O reduction.

Forms of international co-ordination include: harmonising carbon prices (e.g. through linking carbon markets), extending the coverage of pricing schemes, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, developing international sectoral agreements, and establishing co-ordination mechanisms to mitigate carbon leakage. All forms of international co-operation on carbon pricing could deliver benefits, both economic (e.g. lower mitigation costs) and environmental (e.g. reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon leakage). There is scope to considerably increase the coverage of carbon pricing, since until 2021 only around 40% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 44 OECD and G20 countries face a carbon price. There is also significant scope to improve international co-ordination on carbon pricing: moving from unilateral carbon prices to a globally harmonized carbon price to reach the 1st round of NDC targets for 2030 can reduce global mitigation cost on average by two thirds or $229 billion. Benefits tend to be higher with broader participation of countries, broader coverage of emissions and sectors and, more ambitious policy goals. Extending carbon pricing to non-CO2 GHG could reduce global mitigation costs by up to 48%. Absolute cost savings from harmonized carbon prices increase by almost 70% in 2030 for reductions in line with the 2 C target. Most, but not all, countries gain economic benefits from international co-operation, and these benefits vary significantly across countries and regions. Complementary measures outside co-operation on carbon pricing (e.g. technology transfers) could potentially ensure that co-operation provides economic benefits for all countries. © 2021 The Author(s).

This paper characterizes the personal PM2.5 exposure and protocol compliance measured with a wearable sensor. The MicroPEM™ collected personal continuous and integrated measures of PM2.5 exposure and compliance data on 272 children. PM2.5, black carbon (BC), and brown carbon tobacco smoke (BrC-ETS) exposure was measured from the filters. We per-formed a multivariate analysis of woodstove presence and other factors that influenced PM2.5, BC, and BrC exposures. We collected valid exposure data from 258 of the 272 participants (95%). Children wore the MicroPEM for an average of 46% of the 72-h period, and over 80% for a 2-day, 1-night period (with sleep hours counted as non-compliance for this study). Elevated PM2.5 exposures oc-curred in the morning, evening, and overnight. Median PM2.5, BC, and BrC-ETS concentrations were 8.1 μg/m3, 3.6 μg/m3, and 2.4 μg/m3. The combined BC and BrC-ETS mass comprised 72% of the PM2.5. Woodstove presence, hours used per day, and the primary heating source were associated with the children’s PM2.5 exposure and air filters were associated with reduced PM2.5 concentrations. Our findings suggest that woodstove smoke contributed significantly to this cohort’s PM2.5 expo-sure. The high sample validity and compliance rate demonstrated that the MicroPEM can be worn by young children in epidemiologic studies to measure their PM2.5 exposure, inform interventions to reduce the exposures, and improve children’s health. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the linkage between PM and human health in this area is underreported. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between PM and outpatient department (OPD) visits for respiratory diseases among children aged 0–14 years in BMR. OPD visit data were obtained from the National Health Security Office from January, 2015 to December, 2018. Air pollution data, including particulate matter with aerometric diameter up to 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and 10 μm (PM10), as well as meteorological data were obtained from the Pollution Control Department during the same period. Two-stage approach was used to investigate the association between PM and OPD for respiratory disease among children in BMR. In the first stage, time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression model was used to examine province-specific estimate. In the second stage, the province-specific estimate was pooled to derive BMR estimate using random-effect meta-analysis through maximum likelihood estimation. Odds ratio of respiratory OPD among children in BMR per 10 µg/m3 increase in PM10 and PM2.5 was 1.0256 (95% CI: 1.0160, 1.0325) and 1.0338 (95% CI: 1.0091, 1.0585), respectively. This finding suggests that an increase of PM10 and PM2.5 was associated with increased risk of OPD for respiratory disease among children in BMR. Therefore, local government should develop and improve the existing air pollution control strategies to reduce PM concentration. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Bangkok; Children; Outpatient department visit; Particulate matter; Respiratory disease","air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; child health; health risk; local government; meta-analysis; metropolitan area; particulate matter; public health; respiratory disease; Bangkok; Central Region [Thailand]; Krung Thep Mahanakhon; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107460769

Monthly learning community (LC) meetings allow AGEP participants to create dialogues across disciplines through informal oral presentations about current research. The learning communities also offer opportunities to share key information regarding graduate school success and experience; thus providing a social network that extends beyond the academic setting. At MSU, AGEP also provides an interdisciplinary and multigenerational environment that includes graduate students, faculty members, post-docs and prospective graduate students. Using monthly surveys over a 4-year period, we evaluated the impact of this AGEP initiative focusing on the utility of the program, perceptions of departmental climate, career plans and institutional support. Findings indicate that AGEP participants consider their experiences in the program as vital elements in the development of their professional identity, psychological safety, and career readiness. Experiences that were identified included networking across departments, focus on career placement, involvement in minority recruitment and professional development opportunities. Additionally, AGEP community participants resonated with the “sense of community” that is at the core of the MSU AGEP program legacy. In this article, we proposed a variation of Tomlinson’s Graduate Student Capital model to describe the AGEP participants’ perceptions and experiences in MSU AGEP. Within this 4-year period, we report over 70% graduation rate (completing with advanced degrees). More than half of Ph.D. students and almost 30% of master’s degree students decided to pursue academia as their careers. In addition, we found a high satisfaction rate of AGEP among the participants. Our analysis on graduate student capital helped us identify motivating capital development by years spent at MSU and as an AGEP member. These findings may provide some insight into which capitals may be deemed important for students relative to their experiences at MSU and in AGEP and how their priorities change as they transition toward graduation.

However, implementation of policy targeting SDG delivery can be driven off track by external factors. There is a pressing need for rapid, adaptable modelling approaches to support policy development against a background of dynamic changes in environmental and political conditions. An example is the imminent departure of the UK from the EU (Brexit), which requires responsive inputs of robust evidence to inform decision making. We combine existing agri-economic modelling with well-tested environmental models, driven by farm survey and landscape data in an adaptive, participatory approach to assess potential agricultural sector responses to Brexit. We explore potential Brexit impacts on land use, environmental outcomes and agricultural jobs in Wales, UK, where agriculture is dominated by animal production on grassland systems. Three potential post-Brexit trade agreements scenarios are considered: EU Deal; No Deal; and Multilateral Free Trade Agreements. For each scenario potential changes in animal numbers in livestock systems in Wales are converted to predicted land use change at field and farm scale and combined with national data sources and models to explore consequences for the environment and jobs. Potential changes in grazing animal numbers range between − 30% (sheep for No Deal and MFTA) and + 53% (No Deal dairy), affecting 3% (EU Deal) to 17% (No Deal) of agricultural land and creating potential losses of 700 (EU Deal) to 7000 (MFTA) full time jobs. Environmental outcomes are mixed, with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (− 1% EU deal to − 16% MFTA) and variable impacts on pollutant loads to water (N ranges + 3% for No Deal to − 14% for MFTA) across all scenarios. Air pollution is most scenario dependent (+ 11% No Deal to − 12% MFTA), and biodiversity showed a mixed response to each scenario. The findings of this study support Welsh government in developing programmes to manage the Brexit transition proactively, mitigating risks to the environment, rural communities and agricultural sector. © 2021 The Authors","Agriculture; Air quality; Biodiversity; GHG; Water quality; Woodland","ammonia; agricultural land; agricultural management; agricultural worker; air pollution; Article; biodiversity; carbon footprint; environmental impact; environmental policy; forest; government; grazing; greenhouse gas; land use; livestock; risk assessment; rural population; sustainable development; Wales; water pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114053918

In India, the population is very high and the number of houses is few to accommodate. Generally, construction work consumes more money. So, building houses for low-income families poses a great challenge. Constructing own house is still a dream for LIG and middle-class peoples. To reduce this, the Low-Cost Housing concept is introduced. Low-Cost Housing is a new concept which deals with effective budgeting and following of techniques which helps in reducing the cost construction through the use of locally available materials along with improved skills and technology without sacrificing the Strength, Performance and life of the structure. It provides us a challenge to use the natural materials to reduce the wastage obtained from industries and environment pollution. And also using this cost-effective technology will not only save money but also reduce co2 emission, save time and faster construction. In this study, Low-cost building materials available are discussed and potential for the materials to be used as alternative building materials was discussed. © 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

An overall reduction of water clarity over the twentieth century could be observed in measurements, and more recent analysis suggests that these trends continue. Inorganic sediment is often named one of the driving factors in these changes and it has been shown to locally increase. With 20 years' worth of satellite-derived sediment data, we were able to conduct basin wide investigations of the temporal dynamics of the biogeochemical state of the North Sea. To identify the impact of inter-annual and seasonal changes in sediment, we fed from two different remote sensing sources (GlobColour & IFREMER) into a 3D coupled hydrodynamic and biological model. The light scheme in the Carbon Silicon Nitrogen Ecosystem model (CoSiNE) was modified to account for sediment specific attenuation. We performed a total of five numerical experiments for the period of 2000–2017. The main two experiments were conducted using monthly averaged data. Additionally, as controls, one experiment with annually averaged and one with a 20 years average of sediment, as well as a fifth one without sediment were performed. Our model showed a clear relation between changes in sediment and water clarity. Phytoplankton biomass was reduced only in areas with high nutrient availability. © 2021.

Despite growing evidence of its significance to both regional and global CH4 budgets, the drivers and mechanisms of stem CH4 emission in wetlands are not fully understood. To clarify the environmental drivers of stem CH4 emission, we conducted chamber-based flux measurements for mature Alnus japonica and Fraxinus mandshurica trees in a forested wetland in northern Japan over four snow-free seasons, as well as a short-term flooding experiment and an isotopic analysis of stem-emitted and soil porewater CH4. Stem CH4 fluxes varied seasonally and annually. The highest flux, exceeding 10,000 µg CH4 m−2 h−1, occurred in August 2016 following a record-breaking rainfall. Soil temperature and water-table depth had significant effects on stem CH4 flux. Artificial flooding remarkably increased stem CH4 flux more than tenfold within 4 days and elevated fluxes persisted for at least 1 day after the floodwater receded. Stem-emitted CH4 was depleted in 13C by an average of 2–3‰ relative to porewater CH4, implying isotopic fractionation of CH4 by diffusion and/or oxidation along its emission pathway. Belowground environmental conditions exhibited considerable control over stem CH4 emissions in forested wetlands; the biogeochemical and biological mechanisms of this influence should be further explored. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Greenhouse gas; Methane (CH4); Plant-mediated emissions; Stable isotopes; Tree stem methane fluxes","carbon emission; environmental conditions; methane; seasonal variation; soil temperature; street vendor; temperate forest; tree; wetland; Japan; Alnus japonica; Fraxinus mandshurica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113696865

A practical case study is described with scenarios enabling different signal coverage on a university campus. These scenarios are based on technical requirements, including number of access points, budget link, and access duration. Four hundred tons of GHG can be reduced each year if solar Wi-Fi is deployed in solar campuses, which represents 5.5 × 10−5 percent of the total GHG produced by the telecommunications sector. A direct relationship between the number of access points and coverage signal quality on the one hand and energy consumption on the other hand is established. We use this case study to forecast the potential GHG mitigation if a wider deployment of the community Wi-Fi is achieved.

At the most recent SDG summit held in 2019, Member States recognized that the achievements accomplished to date have been insufficient to achieve this mission. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of 227 documents contextualizing outdoor lighting with SDGs, showing its potential to resolve some existing issues related to the SDG targets. From a list of 17 goals, six SDGs were identified to have relevant synergies with outdoor lighting in smart cities, including SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), SDG 14 (Life below water) and SDG 15 (Life on land). This review also links efficient lighting roles partially with SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy) and SDG 13 (Climate action) through Target 7.3 and Target 13.2, respectively. This paper identifies outdoor lighting as a vector directly impacting 16 of the 50 targets in the six SDGs involved. Each section in this review discusses the main aspects of outdoor lighting by a human-centric, energy efficiency and environmental impacts. Each aspect addresses the most recent studies contributing to lighting solutions in the literature, helping us to understand the positive and negative impacts of artificial lighting on living beings. In addition, the work summarizes the proposed solutions and results tackling specific topics impacting SDG demands. © 2020 by the authors.

The importance of peatlands is owing to their ability to 1) sequester a considerable amount of terrestrial carbon, 2) store freshwater, and 3) regulate floods during the rainy season. Nowadays, extensive peatland degradation occurs because of peatland utilization for agriculture purposes, causing severe environmental consequences such as carbon emission, loss of biodiversity, risk of flooding, and peat fire. Meanwhile, local planners and decision makers tend to overlook the long-term strategic function of peatlands for carbon storage and hydrological regulation, preferring peatland utilization for short-term economic benefits. The objective of our study is to quantify the total ecosystem services (except biodiversity) of a tropical peatland landscape in various peat-utilization scenarios to help build awareness among local planners and decision makers on the strategic tradeoff between peatland utilization and restoration. Studies on the total ecosystem services in a tropical peatland landscape involving hydrological regulation are still rare. Based on the net present value calculation, provisioning services, carbon regulation, and hydrological regulation in our study area account for 19, 70, and 11% of the total ecosystem services, respectively. Based on uncertainty analysis, at any combination of the social cost of carbon emission (within a range of USD 52.7–USD 107.4) and discount rate (within a range of 5–10%), the enrichment of peatlands with paludiculture crops (e.g., jelutong) shows superior ecosystem services compared to other peatland-utilization scenarios. Conversely, planting peatlands with monoculture crops, which are associated with peatland drainage, shows a rapid decrease in the total ecosystem services. The fluvial carbon export in our study, which is often neglected in a peatland carbon budget, increases the estimate of the total carbon budget by 8%. Restoring undrained peatlands with paludiculture crops such as jelutong contributes positively to carbon sequestration and potentially reduces carbon emissions by 11%. These quantitative findings can help local planners and decision makers in understanding the tradeoff between the long-term benefits of peatland restoration and the short-term economic benefits of peatland utilization for monoculture crops.

The fight against climate change, which began more than 50 years ago, was marked by the adoption in 2015 of the Paris Agreement on Climate [1] within the framework of the UN Framework Convention [2] and was further developed in Europe - the climate program Fit for 55 was adopted in the European Union [3]. According to the provisions of this program, it is assumed that the climate policy will be toughened by 2030 and 2050. It is planned to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, create an updated system for trading greenhouse gas emissions and introduce cross-border taxes on carbon dioxide emissions starting from 2023 for the supply of goods to the EU countries. Extensive development and lack of modernization of existing isolated energy supply systems will negatively affect the economic attractiveness of the extracted minerals due to increased costs of electricity generated and a tangible cross-border tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

Enabling policies for this system include low-interest government loans of approximately $20 billion for pipeline construction and an extended 20-year Section 45Q tax credit, or similar longer-term carbon price incentive. Additional policy support will be needed to enable initial construction of pipelines and early-mover power generators, such as cost-sharing, governments assuming future demand risk, or increased subsidies to early movers. The proposed system will provide reliable, dispatchable, flexible zero-emission power generation, complementing the intermittent generation by renewables in a decarbonized U.S. power sector.

However, empirical studies regarding this subject are few. To address this research gap, this study investigated the impact of market failure and strategic behaviors of firms on pollution reduction using China's sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions trading policy as a quasi-natural experiment. Based on the micro-data matching the Chinese Industrial Firm and the Chinese Industrial Firm Pollution Emission databases, the difference-in-difference-in-differences method was employed to determine if the implementation of the policy can promote emission reduction and identify its specific influencing mechanism. The benchmark regression results indicated that the tradable discharge permit policy significantly reduced SO2 emissions in regions with high degrees of marketization. Furthermore, the mechanism analysis showed that firms would take strategic behaviors to deal with the emission reduction requirements of environmental policies under an imperfect market environment. Moreover, the heterogeneity analysis revealed that the discharge permit policy exhibited a distinct emission reduction effect due to market failure and strategic behaviors of firms. This study suggests that the Chinese government should establish systematic permit trading laws and regulations, actively build a permit trading platform, formulate a clear trading mechanism, and strengthen information disclosure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","China; Difference-in-Difference-in-Differences Method; Market Failure; Pollution Reduction; Tradeable Discharge Permit","emission control; emissions trading; government; heterogeneity; industrial emission; market system; policy implementation; trade-environment relations; China; Trachinotus falcatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112400161

Given the high degree of intraspecific trait variability in plants, it has been hypothesized that genetic shifts within plant species yield a large potential to control the response of plant-microbe interactions to climate change. Here we examined if sea-level rise and plant genotype interact to affect soil microbial communities in an experimental coastal wetland system, using two known genotypes of the dominant salt-marsh grass Elymus athericus characterized by differences in their sensitivity to flooding stress-i.e., a tolerant genotype from low-marsh environments and an intolerant genotype from high-marsh environments. Plants were exposed to a large range of flooding frequencies in a factorial mesocosm experiment, and soil microbial activity parameters (exo-enzyme activity and litter breakdown) and microbial community structure were assessed. Plant genotype mediated the effect of flooding on soil microbial community structure and determined the presence of flooding effects on exo-enzyme activities and belowground litter breakdown. Larger variability in microbial community structure, enzyme activities, and litter breakdown in soils planted with the intolerant plant genotype supported our general hypothesis that effects of climate change on soil microbial activity and community structure can depend on plant intraspecific genetic variation. In conclusion, our data suggest that adaptive genetic variation in plants could suppress or facilitate the effects of sea-level rise on soil microbial communities. If this finding applies more generally to coastal wetlands, it yields important implications for our understanding of ecosystem-climate feedbacks in the coastal zone. © 2021 Hao Tang et al.",,"carbon cycle; ecosystem function; ecosystem response; genotype; grass; plant; sea level change; soil microorganism; wetland; Elymus athericus; Hymenachne",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120980343

Additional analysis suggests that when a city's air pollution is comparatively worse than other cities', a firm in the highly polluted city: 1) has tighter financial constraints, which leads it to invest less in research and development or to increase its environmental investment (crowding-out effect), and 2) attracts fewer technical, highly educated, and foreign-experienced employees (human capital effect).

In the real-life flexible open-shop manufacturing environments, the workpieces generally need frequent transport between machines so that the limitation of the transport resource is non-negligible. Joint scheduling is a better way to achieve global optimum than sequential scheduling due to the interactive relationship between production and transport. However, owing to the extreme complexity, joint scheduling has received little attention over the past years. In this paper, the low-carbon joint scheduling in flexible open-shop environment with constrained automatic guided vehicle (LCJS-FOSCA) is investigated. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is formulated with the objectives to minimize the total carbon emission and makespan. Facing the extreme complexity of LCJS-FOSCA, an enhanced multi-objective particle swarm optimization (EMOPSO) is developed. In EMOPSO, several improvement strategies including the initialization method for high-quality solutions, chaotic position updating and mutation for global exploration, and problem-knowledge-based neighborhood search for local exploitation, are proposed. Finally, the following results are obtained through a comprehensive case study: (1) the proposed strategies make significant promotion on the convergence and comprehensive quality, and EMOPSO is verified to be effective for solving LCJS-FOSCA; (2) compared with the two sequential scheduling methods, the makespan obtained by joint scheduling is reduced by approximately 27.7% and 25.5%, and the total carbon emission is reduced by 3.3% and 4.2%; (3) the optimal numbers of AGV in various scales of transport time are provided based on the analysis of optimization results. This work presents a significance on promoting cleaner production of the modern manufacturing industry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Constrained automatic guided vehicle; Enhanced multi-objective particle swarm optimization; Flexible open-shop environment; Low-carbon joint scheduling","Automatic guided vehicles; Carbon; Integer programming; Knowledge based systems; Manufacture; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Pollution control; Scheduling; Comprehensive qualities; Improvement strategies; Initialization methods; Interactive relationships; Manufacturing environments; Manufacturing industries; Mixed integer programming model; Multi objective particle swarm optimization; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110416295

This research aims to evaluate projections of hydro-climatic change of the Johor River Basin (JRB) in southern Peninsular Malaysia between 1985 to 2015 and 2021 to 2050, focusing on uncertainty quantification of hydrological outputs from low (&gt;1◦), medium (0.5◦ to 1◦) and high (≤0.5◦) horizontal resolution models. These projections show future increases in annual precipitation of 0.4 to 3.1%, minimum and maximum temperature increases of 0.8 to 0.9◦ C and 0.9 to 1.1◦ C, respectively. These projected climate changes lead to increases in annual mean streamflow of 0.9% to 7.0% and surface runoff of 7.0% to 20.6% in the JRB. These annual mean changes are consistent with those during the wet period (November to December), e.g., streamflow increases of 4.9% to 10.8% and surface runoff of 28.8 to 39.9% in December. Disagreement in the direction of change is found during the dry seasons, (February to March and May to September), where high resolution models project a decrease in future monthly precipitation and streamflow, whilst increases are projected by the medium-and low-resolution models. © 2021 by the authors.

Currently, ultrahigh methane deliverable capacity is required for use in heavy-duty vehicles and long-haul transportation under industrially and economically feasible working conditions. Herein, we show that control over interpenetration in MOFs can serve as a realistic strategy for boosting methane deliverable capacity without altering the underlying topology. Specifically, a new MOF, termed ST-150 (ST = ShanghaiTech University), is demonstrated to possess an high volumetric deliverable capacity of 244 cmSTP3 cm-3, which stands at a ∼70% improvement over its interpenetrated counterpart-MOF-150. Due to the control over interpenetration, ST-150's deliverable capacity surpasses that of an empty compressed natural gas tank by 20% at 298 K and 5.8-200 bar.

Among potential materials, single-atom catalysts (SACs) serve as a model to study the mechanism behind the reduction of CO2 to CO, given their well-defined active metal centers and structural simplicity. Moreover, using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as supports to anchor and stabilize central metal atoms, the common concern, metal aggregation, for SACs can be addressed well. Furthermore, with their turnability and designability, MOF-derived SACs can also extend the scope of research on SACs for the eCO2RR. Herein, we synthesize sulfurized MOF-derived Mn SACs to study effects of the S dopant on the eCO2RR. Using complementary characterization techniques, the metal moiety of the sulfurized MOF-derived Mn SACs (MnSA/SNC) is identified as MnN3S1. Compared with its non-sulfur-modified counterpart (MnSA/NC), the MnSA/SNC provides uniformly superior activity to produce CO. Specifically, a nearly 30% enhancement of Faradaic efficiency (F.E.) in CO production is observed, and the highest F.E. of approximately 70% is identified at -0.45 V. Through operando spectroscopic characterization, the probing results reveal that the overall enhancement of CO production on the MnSA/SNC is possibly caused by the S atom in the local MnN3S1 moiety, as the sulfur atom may induce the formation of S-O bonding to stabilize the critical intermediate, *COOH, for CO2-to-CO. Our results provide novel design insights into the field of SACs for the eCO2RR. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","eCO2RR; metal-organic framework; operando spectroscopy; single-atom catalysts; sulfurization; XAS","Atoms; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Manganese; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organometallics; Sulfur; Central metals; Characterization techniques; Electroreduction of CO2; Energy systems; Faradaic efficiencies; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Potential materials; Spectroscopic characterization; Manganese compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111182382

The impact of OFDI on carbon emissions is investigated from the dual perspectives of the urbanization threshold and the mediating path by using panel data from China’s 30 provinces during the period of 2003–2015 and considering both population and land. The results show that there is a significant impact from interprovincial OFDI on CO2 emissions with the double threshold effect of urbanization, and that OFDI expansion will increase CO2 emissions with urbanization; however, the different stages of urbanization show in-verted U-shaped characteristics that first rise and then fall. The optimization of industrial structures has not passed the mediating effects test during the sample period, while the rationalization of the industrial structure provides a mediating effect in the primary stage of urbanization and a suppressing effect in the high level stage of urbanization. Import dependence only shows a masking effect in the intermediate stage of urbanization, while the technical level shows an intermediary effect in the primary stage of urbanization and a masking effect in the intermediate stage. The intensification of OFDI has brought different effects on economic and social production in various regions of China under urbanization, which has further affected regional carbon emissions. Discussing these effects would help to provide constructive suggestions for the regional coordination of development, new urbanization construction and urban low carbon transformation. © 2021 by the authors.

Objective: To assess the impact of reducing gestational PM exposure on body mass index (BMI) at two years of age. Methods: In this single-blind, parallel group randomized controlled trial in Ulaanbaatar Mongolia, we randomly assigned 540 pregnant women to receive 1–2 portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter air cleaners or no air cleaners. We measured height and weight when children were a mean age of 23.8 months. Our primary outcome was age- and sex-specific BMI z-score based on the World Health Organization 2007 Growth Charts. Secondary outcomes included age- and sex-specific weight z score, overweight/obesity (defined as BMI z-score > 2.00), and catch-up growth (defined using various cut-offs to identify children with relatively low birth weight for sex and gestational age and relatively high age- and sex-specific weight in childhood). We imputed missing outcome data using multiple imputation with chained equations and our primary analysis was by intention to treat (ITT). We estimated intervention effects on continuous and binary outcomes using linear and logistic regression, respectively. Results: After excluding known miscarriages, still births, and neonatal deaths our analysis included 480 children (235 control and 245 intervention). The mean (SD) child BMI z score was 0.79 (1.0); 9.8% of children were overweight or obese. The mean BMI z score of children who were randomly assigned to the intervention group was 0.16-units lower (95% CI: −0.35, 0.04) than children in the control group. The intervention was also associated with reductions in overweight/obesity (odds ratio = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.31, 1.12). Catch-up growth occurred less frequently in the intervention group, but effect estimates varied depending on the specific definition of catch-up growth and confidence intervals consistently spanned no effect.

That is, humankind is not making enough progress to exclude a possibly catastrophic climate scenario. Protecting the climate is difficult because of free-riding: emissions abatement costs are largely national but the benefits from climate stability are global. Dealing with this problem needs to be at the core of a new climate strategy. This article argues that both technological and political conditions are now ideal to establish a new climate club, in which members commit to stronger domestic climate measures and agree on the coordinated introduction of carbon border adjustment measures. On the technology side, there have been stunning clean technology cost reductions. This will underpin the climate club: as abatement costs fall, club stability can be more easily achieved. On the political side, we now see the United States, European Union and China – representing half of global greenhouse gas emissions – sharing for the first time a common climate ambition while popular support in all economies is also high for substantial climate actions. These two changes make a climate club more likely stable as the benefits from deviating from the club have diminished. A relatively weak penalty, such as carbon border adjustment measure, may then suffice for club stability. This climate club would also create incentive for other countries to join the club, thus making it a catalyst for tougher climate action worldwide. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon border adjustment; Climate change; Decarbonisation; Energy transition","Climate change; Cost reduction; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Carbon border adjustment; Climate scenarios; Climate stability; Condition; Decarbonisation; Emissions abatement costs; Energy transitions; Free-riding; Greenhouse gas emissions; Technological conditions; Carbon; abatement cost; carbon emission; climate change; environmental policy; environmental protection; European Union; greenhouse gas; China; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114436795

Here, we present the first data on the contribution of benthic foraminiferal inorganic carbon to the sediments of three Norwegian fjords. Our study shows that calcareous foraminifera, which are among the most abundant calcifying organisms in the modern global oceans, can constitute between 15% and 33% of inorganic carbon accumulated in the sediments of the two studied southern Norwegian fjords (Raunefjorden and Hjeltefjorden). In a northern Norwegian fjord (Balsfjorden), the contribution of calcareous foraminifera to the inorganic carbon pool is smaller (<1%) than the one observed in southern fjords. We also found that the amount of foraminifera-derived carbon is primarily dependent on the species composition of the foraminifera community. Large calcareous foraminifera species, despite a lower number of individuals, constitute, on average, 13%–29% of the inorganic carbon in the two southern Norwegian fjords, while the contribution of small, highly abundant species does not exceed 4% of the inorganic carbon pools in the sediments. Calcareous foraminifera species that are indicative of dysoxic conditions have been found to have low inorganic carbon contents per specimen compared to other analysed similar-sized calcareous foraminifera species. This relationship most likely exists due to the thin test walls of these foraminifera species, which may facilitate gas exchange. The results of our case study suggest that the climate-driven formation of near-bottom low-oxygen zones may lead to the dominance of foraminifera associated with dysoxic conditions and, in consequence, to the decrease of foraminifera-derived inorganic carbon. However, to properly analyse the contribution of carbon from thin-walled foraminifera to the sedimentary carbon pool, further studies analysing a broader range of these species is needed. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon burial; fjords; foraminifera; inorganic carbon; pool; sedimentary carbon","calcareous alga; carbon cycle; dominance; fjord; foraminifera; gas exchange; geoaccumulation; inorganic carbon; organic matter; Arctic Ocean; Norwegian Sea; Foraminifera; carbon; environmental monitoring; estuary; foraminifer; human; sediment; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Estuaries; Foraminifera; Geologic Sediments; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108189859

The primary objective of the presented research was to propose a method to adjust emission inventories (emission fluxes) using tropospheric NO2 columns observed by OMI and SCIAMACHY instruments. Modified emission fluxes were used in a chemical weather model GEM-AQ. The GEM-AQ model results were compared with the monthly averaged satellite-derived column amount of NO2 over Europe for the 2008–2010 observing period. It was shown that the observed and modelled spatial distribution of high values of the NO2 column is highly correlated with the distribution of major anthropogenic sources in the modelling domain. The presented findings highlight the importance of the anthropogenic sources in the overall budget of NO2 in the polluted troposphere. Regions for which modelling results showed underestimation or overestimation compared with observations were constant for the whole analysis period. Thus, the NO2 column observations could be used for correcting emission estimates. The proposed emission correction method is based on the differences in modelled and satellite-derived NO2 columns. Modelling was done for 2011 using the original and adjusted emission inventories and compared with observed NO2 columns. The analysis was extended to compare modelling results with surface NO2 observations from selected air quality stations in Poland. A significant improvement in modelling results was obtained over regions with large overestimations in the control run for which the original emission fluxes were used. © 2021 by the authors.

Following the expected impacts of climate change on the hydrological regime, adaptation measures in the water sector are being prepared as part of strategic plans. This contribution studies the uncertainty propagation of climate scenarios in hydrological data, which are then used to assess the reliability of water resources and to design appropriate adaptation measures. The results are being discussed for a case study in the deficit area of Rakovnický stream and Blšanska river basins, which are among the driest areas in the Czech Republic. Research of the impact of climate change on the reliability of water resources has been prepared using ensembles of selected regional climate models. This approach has allowed a probabilistic assessment of the impact on the hydrology regime and the reliability of water supply from reservoirs for various time horizons of climate change. In view of the relatively large variance of potential impacts on water resources, options for further strategic planning in the water management area are being discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

The tumor stroma of ACCs includes cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) expressing Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP), a new target for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Here we describe the value of PET/ computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging using 68Ga-labelled FAP-Inhibitors (68Ga-FAPI-PET/CT) and their clinical potential for staging and radiotherapy planning in 12 ACC patients (7 primary, 5 recurrent). MATERIALS/METHODS: Patients underwent contrast enhanced CT (ceCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (ceMRI) before 68Ga-FAPI - PET/CT. PET-scans were acquired 10, 60 and 180 minutes after administration of 150-250 MBq of 68Ga-labelled FAPI tracers. SUVmax and SUVmean values of ACCs and healthy organs were obtained using a 60% of maximum iso-contour. FAP and alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) immunohistochemistry was performed in 13 cases (3 with and 10 without 68Ga FAPI-PET/CT). Staging and radiotherapy planning based on 68Ga-FAPI-PET/CT versus ceCT/MRI alone were compared. RESULTS: We observed elevated tracer uptake in all ACCs. Immunohistochemistry showed FAP-expressing CAFs in the tumor. Compared to conventional staging, 68Ga-FAPI-PET/CT led to upstaging in 2/12 patients and to detection of additional metastases in 3 patients, thus in total 42% of patients had their staging altered. Moreover, 68Ga-FAPI PET improved the accuracy of target volume delineation for radiotherapy, as compared to CT and MRI. CONCLUSION: 68Ga-FAPI-PET/CT is a promising imaging modality for ACC, providing additional information for staging and leading to altered radiotherapy planning compared to CT and MRI.

However, these unique yet fragile ecosystems are subject to deforestation and degradation due to forest fires and land conversion. Peat swamp forests are well known for their ecosystem services related to global climate mitigation because they store carbon inside and are very vulnerable to forest fires. Another direct function is providing various needs for the indigenous people livelihoods who live close to and in the areas. This study was conducted qualitatively to assess the forest utilization and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihoods of indigenous people. The study results show that the Dayak Ngaju Communities utilize the forest for timber, non-timbers, medicinal plants, foods, and religious culture. There is no significant impact of COVID-19 on forest product collection activities, but the pandemic impacts the marketing and sales of forest products. The marketing of fish and other non-timber forest products has been negatively affected due to decreased demand and limited transportation. On the contrary, the use, need, and demand for medicinal plants for the traditional medicine of COVID-19 is increasing significantly and improving local livelihoods. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120447589

Presently, weed control through tillage has virtually disappeared as cropland management systems have transitioned largely to continuous cropping, with zero to minimal soil disturbance. Research was undertaken to examine what was driving this land management transition. A carbon accounting framework incorporating coefficients derived from the Century Model was used to estimate carbon sequestration in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The results quantify the transition from farmland being a net carbon emitter to being a net carbon sequesterer over the past 30 years. This evidence confirms the correlation between genetically modified, herbicide‐tolerant crops and glyphosate use is a driver of the increased soil carbon sequestration. The removal of tillage and adoption of minimal soil disturbances has reduced the amount of carbon released from tillage and increased the sequestration of carbon through continuous crop production. Countries that ban genetically modified crops and are enacting legislation restricting glyphosate use are implementing policies that Canadian farm evidence indicates will not contribute to increasing agricultural sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

Increasing evidence suggests that, similar to their low-mass counterparts, high-mass stars form through a disk-mediated accretion process. At the same time, formation of high-mass stars still necessitates high accretion rates, and hence, high gas densities, which in turn can cause disks to become unstable against gravitational fragmentation. Aims. We study the kinematics and fragmentation of the disk around the high-mass star forming region AFGL 2591-VLA 3 which was hypothesized to be fragmenting based on the observations that show multiple outflow directions. Methods. We use a new set of high-resolution (0′′.19) IRAM/NOEMA observations at 843 μm towards VLA 3 which allow us to resolve its disk, characterize the fragmentation, and study its kinematics. In addition to the 843 μm continuum emission, our spectral setup targets warm dense gas and outflow tracers such as HCN, HC3N and SO2, as well as vibrationally excited HCN lines. Results. The high resolution continuum and line emission maps reveal multiple fragments with subsolar masses within the inner ~1000 AU of VLA 3. Furthermore, the velocity field of the inner disk observed at 843 μm shows a similar behavior to that of the larger scale velocity field studied in the CORE project at 1.37 mm. Conclusions. We present the first observational evidence for disk fragmentation towards AFGL 2591-VLA 3, a source that was thought to be a single high-mass core. While the fragments themselves are low-mass, the rotation of the disk is dominated by the protostar with a mass of 10.3 ± 1.8 M? . These data also show that NOEMA Band 4 can obtain the highest currently achievable spatial resolution at (sub-)mm wavelengths in observations of strong northern sources. © S.

Recent years, rapid advances have been gained in this attractive research field, and numerous electrocatalysts have been exploited. However, its conversion efficiency is still far behind the requirement of industrial applications owing to the breakage of the N≡N triple bond, which is an energetically challenging kinetically complex multistep reaction and the strong competing reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction. Recently, main group metal-based catalysts have been demonstrated promising application prospect for ammonia production, significantly boosting their further application in this field. However, a comprehensive review of main group metal-based catalysts towards electrochemical ammonia production applications is still lacking. In this review, the fundamentals of N2 reduction, such as the reaction pathways, the reaction potential and the challenges of N2 reduction have been comprehensively discussed. And then, the role, mechanism, and effect of each main group element-based catalysts used for N2 reduction (Li, K, Al, Ga, Sn, Sb, Bi, and their compounds) are systematically summarized. Finally, several state-of-the-art strategies to promote their NRR catalytic performance, as well as the existing problems and prospects are put forward. This review is expected to guide the design and establishment of more efficient electrocatalytic N2 reduction systems based on main group metal elements in the future. © 2021 Science Press","Challenges and strategies; Main group; Metal elements; N2 reduction","Ammonia; Bismuth compounds; Electrocatalysts; Industrial research; Reduction; % reductions; Ambient conditions; Challenge and strategy; Electrocatalytic; Electrochemicals; Main group; Main group metals; Metal elements; Metal-based catalysts; N2 reduction; Metals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104381448

Wind power is an essential source of renewable energy, and improving the efficiency of wind power generation will contribute substantially to China’s ability to achieve its energy-saving and emission reduction goals. This paper measured the wind power efficiency of provinces in China from 2012 to 2017 using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method. Moran’s I index and the spatial Durbin model were applied to analyse the spatial distribution of the wind power efficiency and the spatial effects of influencing factors. The results show obvious differences in the spatial distribution of wind power efficiency in China; specifically, the wind power efficiency in the eastern and western regions is higher than that in the central areas. Moreover, wind power efficiency has a significant positive spatial correlation between regions: the eastern and western regions show certain high-high clustering characteristics, and the central area shows certain low-low clustering characteristics. Among the influencing factors, the fixed asset investment and carbon emission intensity of the wind power property have a negative impact on the efficiency of regional wind power production, while the urbanization process and carbon emission intensity have significant spatial spillover effects. The optimization of the economic structure, technological innovation and the construction of energy infrastructure are expected to improve the regional wind power efficiency. The results present a new approach for accurately identifying the spatial characteristics of wind power efficiency and the spatial effects of the influencing factors, thus providing a reference for policymakers. © 2021 by the authors.

The majority of the extant studies on the drivers of PM2.5 in China have adopted an econometric approach, but lack the analysis of industrial, regional, and temporal heterogeneity. This study integrates the advantages of index decomposition and production-theory decomposition to analyse the determinants of energy consumption related PM2.5 in different regions and industries in China. The decomposition results indicate that factor substitution and technological progress make the largest contribution to the reduction in the PM2.5 intensity in China, whereas the cumulative effect of technical efficiency is negative. The emission reduction potential is lower in developed regions but higher in heavy industrial provinces.

Thus, assessing the effect of future climate change on urban flooding and adopting effective flood management measures is becoming increasingly important. In this study, an urban rainstorm model and a scenario simulation method were applied to central Shanghai, China. We first examined the risks of flooding in the study area under the impact of future climate change using a simulation with different rainfall return periods. We then evaluated the benefits of traditional drainage system adaptation measures and Low Impact Development (LID) practices on alleviating the current urban flood hazard. Finally, we explored the effectiveness of using an integrated flood management scheme to adapt to climate change. The results show that the urban flood volume increases non-linearly with increasing rainfall intensity under climate change. The maximum flooding area also increases accordingly, and is much more sensitive to smaller rainfall events. Both traditional drainage system adaptation measures and LID practices can effectively alleviate flooding, while an integrated flood management scheme that emphasizes the combination of the two methods is shown to be the most effective in reducing flooding under future climate change. © 2021","Climate change; Flood mitigation measures; Scenario simulation; Urban flooding",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114723266

If this trend is not curbed as soon as possible, the efforts made for carbon emission reduction will be wasted. Although the effect that the energy consumption structure brought to carbon emissions has been studied in pieces of literature, the limit is that they all take the ratio of coal consumption (CS) as the index of energy consumption structure. With the optimization of energy consumption structure, the index they use is no longer convincing. Shannon–Wiener diversity index (SWI) is an index used to investigate the diversity within the local flora of a plant community, and in this paper, it is innovatively used to reflect the structure of the energy consumption. To test the superiority of the new index in the study of carbon emissions, the Autoregressive Distribution Lag model (ARDL) was used, and we find out the effect of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Urbanization Rate (UR), Trade Structure (TS) and energy consumption structure on carbon emissions in China through the data from 1985 to 2016. The results show:(1) the R2 of the carbon emission model constructed by SWI is as high as 0.9938, which means the model is stable;(2)During the research period, we found the relationship between the environmental quality and the squared term of GDP per capita is a U-shaped curve, so the Environment Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis is not applicable in China;(3)The results also show that the inflexion point of the U-shaped curve is delayed;(4) Urban development and the promotion of trade structure will bring the increase of carbon emissions, while the optimization of energy consumption structure will slow it down.

The result shows that the number of hotspots in East Nusa Tenggara less than in Kalimantan and Sumatra for the same forest fire area. The forest fires in East Nusa Tenggara do not harm the atmospheric environment significantly. East Nusa Tenggara dominantly consists of savanna areas with no peatland, hence, the forest biomass burning produces less smoke and CO. Furthermore, the forest fire in East Nusa Tenggara has not an impact on decreasing visibility and increasing CO total column, in contrast, visibility in Sumatra and Kalimantan has fallen to 6 km from the annual average, and CO total column rise three times of normal condition during peak fire. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120903669

This paper reviews various types of renewable energy technologies and their status, potential for adoption, relationship to climate change, and mitigative and adaptive roles in Nepal. Nepal has installed micro-hydro projects, solar power, improved cooking stoves, biogas technology, improved water mills, and wind energy to mitigate and adapt to climate change. There is a growing potential for renewable energy development in Nepal, such as hydropower, solar, wind energy, biogas, and improved cooking stoves. Roughly 70% of Nepal's energy consumption is generated from traditional energy sources while renewable energy accounts for approximately three percent. The gradual increase in the use of renewable energy has reduced greenhouse gas emissions and enhanced carbon sequestration. By adopting renewable energy technologies, Nepal has reduced emissions by 221,129 tCO2e from 2017 to 2018. Nepal's second Nationally Determined Contribution targets a 15% increase in national energy use from renewables with a reduction of 23% of CO2 emissions by 2030 using biogas and improved cooking systems. Furthermore, a significant increase in the adoption of renewable energy has become a pivotal strategy in adaptation to climate change in social, health, and economic sectors resulting in time savings, alternative income sources, improved health and educational status, local job opportunities, and the promotion of social capital. The benefits of adapting to climate change and mitigating CO2 emissions via renewable energy are significant at the local, national, and international levels. This study recommends that the government of Nepal focus work on energy policy reviews to address local energy demand and climate change issues by utilizing renewable energy resources at the local level, which has global implications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Mitigation; Nepal; Renewable energy technologies","Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Solar energy; Wind power; Adaptation; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; CO$-2$/ emission; Energy; Improved cooking stoves; Mitigation; Nepal; Renewable energies; Renewable energy technologies; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111259403

Canopy differences also co-vary with terrain feature effects, hampering the detection of key drivers of carbon cycling in this threatened habitat. We carried out seasonal measurements of ecosystem functions (soil respiration and leaf area index), microclimate and soil variables as well as terrain features along transects for 3 years in poplar groves and the surrounding grasslands. We found that the terrain features and the canopy differences co-varyingly affected the abiotic and biotic factors of this habitat. Topography had an effect on the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon content. Canopy structure had a strong modifying effect through allocation patterns and microclimatic conditions, both affecting soil respiration rates. Due to the vegetation structure difference between the groves and grasslands, spatial functional diversity was observed. We found notably different conditions under the groves with high soil respiration, soil water content and leaf area index; in contrast, on the grasslands (especially in E-SE-S directions from the trees) soil temperature and vapor pressure deficit showed high values. Processes of aridification due to climate change threaten these habitats and may cause reduction in the amount and extent of forest patches and decrease in landscape diversity. Owing to habitat loss, reduction in carbon stock may occur, which in turn has a significant impact on the local and global carbon cycles. © Author(s) 2021.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119152169

Herein, the monitoring data of air pollutants were thoroughly analyzed together with meteorological parameters to explore the impact of human activity on the multi-time scale changes of air pollutant concentrations in Guiyang city, located in Southwest China. The results show that the COVID-19 lockdown had different effects on the criteria air pollutants, i.e., PM2.5 (diameter ≤ 2.5 µm), PM10 (diameter ≤ 10 µm), sulfur dioxide (SO2 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3 ) concentrations. The lockdown caused a significant drop in NO2 concentration. During the first-level lockdown period, the NO2 concentration declined sharply by 8.41 µg·m−3 (45.68%). The decrease in NO concentration caused the “titration effect” to weaken, leading to a sharp increase in O3 concentration. Although human activities resumed partially and the “titration effect” enhanced certainly during the second-level lockdown period, the meteorological conditions became more conducive to the formation of O3 by photochemical reactions. Atmosphere oxidation was enhanced to promote the generation of secondary aerosols through gas–particle transitions, thus compensating for the reduced primary emission of PM2.5 . The implication of this study is that the appropriate air pollution control policies must be initiated to suppress the secondary generation of both PM2.5 and O3 . © 2021 by the authors.

For decades, biotic and abiotic denitrification in estuarine sediments has been regarded as the major ways to remove reactive nitrogen, but they occur at the expense of releasing greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). However, how these pathways respond to acidification remains poorly understood. Here we performed a N2O isotopocules analysis coupled with respiration inhibition and molecular approaches to investigate the impacts of acidification on bacterial, fungal, and chemo-denitrification, as well as N2O emission, in estuarine sediments through a series of anoxic incubations. Results showed that acidification stimulated N2O release from sediments, which was mainly mediated by the activity of bacterial denitrifiers, whereas in neutral environments, N2O production was dominated by fungi. We also found that the contribution of chemo-denitrification to N2O production cannot be ignored, but was not significantly affected by acidification. The mechanistic investigation further demonstrated that acidification changed the keystone taxa of sedimentary denitrifiers from N2O-reducing to N2O-producing ones and reduced microbial electron-transfer efficiency during denitrification. These findings provide novel insights into how acidification stimulates N2O emission and modulates its pathways in estuarine sediments, and how it may contribute to the acceleration of global climate change in the Anthropocene. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","acidification; bacterial denitrification; fungal denitrification; microbial community; N2O emission; nitrogen isotopes","acidification; Anthropocene; climate change; denitrification; estuarine sediment; global climate; greenhouse gas; microbial community; nitrogen isotope; nitrogen oxides; nitrous oxide; ocean acidification; Bacteria (microorganisms); nitrogen; nitrous oxide; sea water; bacterium; denitrification; genetics; pH; Bacteria; Denitrification; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114183099

Maize has high water requirements, and precipitation fluctuations can impact its yield. In this study, we used the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model to simulate maize yields in eight northeastern U.S. states. We used precipitation fluctuations and the coefficient of variation (CV) of yield as indicators to construct a vulnerability curve for the CV of yield and precipitation fluctuations. We then evaluated the vulnerability of maize yields under precipitation fluctuations in the region. We obtained the following results: (1) the fitted vulnerability curves were classified into three categories (positive slope, negative slope, and insignificant fit), of which the first category accounted for about 92.7%, indicating that the CV of maize yield was positively correlated with precipitation fluctuations in most parts of the study area; and (2) the CV of maize yield under 11 precipitation fluctuation scenarios was mapped to express the CV at the spatial level, and the maize yield in Connecticut and Maryland proved to be the most sensitive to precipitation fluctuations. This study provided a theoretical and experimental basis for the prevention of maize yield risk under fluctuating precipitation conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

To reduce polluting emissions and improve social and environmental performance, local government agencies should choose adequate cleaner space-heating technologies based on diverse local conditions. This implies that all cleaner heating solutions should be considered, including low-emissions fossil fuel district heating and low-emissions fossil fuel decentralized heating as transitional technologies, as well as biomass and electricity-driven heat pumps as long-term solutions. However, stakeholders such as policy makers, equipment manufacturers, and house owners, often lack necessary information to assess the feasibility for installing adequate heating solutions at the local level. It is therefore necessary to establish a systematic method to evaluate each heating solution in various geolocations of China. This paper reviews the current heating situation in China and proposes a spatial system analysis method as a tool for heating-solution feasibility evaluation. By applying the spatial system analysis method, a qualitative investigation on the choice of heating solution in different regions of China is provided. © 2021 by the authors.

Most nations' emissions-reduction policies and actions do not seem to reflect this long-term threat, as collectively they point toward widespread permanent inundation of many developed areas. Using state-of-the-art new global elevation and population data, we show here that, under high emissions scenarios leading to 4 °C warming and a median projected 8.9 m of global mean sea level rise within a roughly 200- to 2000-year envelope, at least 50 major cities, mostly in Asia, would need to defend against globally unprecedented levels of exposure, if feasible, or face partial to near-total extant area losses. Nationally, China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam, global leaders in recent coal plant construction, have the largest contemporary populations occupying land below projected high tide lines, alongside Bangladesh. We employ this population-based metric as a rough index for the potential exposure of the largely immovable built environment embodying cultures and economies as they exist today. Based on median sea level projections, at least one large nation on every continent but Australia and Antarctica would face exceptionally high exposure: land home to at least one-tenth and up to two-thirds of current population falling below tideline. Many small island nations are threatened with near-total loss. The high tide line could encroach above land occupied by as much as 15% of the current global population (about one billion people). By contrast, meeting the most ambitious goals of the Paris Climate Agreement will likely reduce exposure by roughly half and may avoid globally unprecedented defense requirements for any coastal megacity exceeding a contemporary population of 10 million. © 2021 The Author(s).

In global models, which encompass the whole world, this can be implemented via learning curves. In regional models, which typically span a country or continent, it can however be challenging to reconcile global cost reductions with local investments. We propose a new approach to account for global cost developments in endogenous regional energy system models. Moreover, we show how this approach can be implemented using either a MILP formulation or discretized investment packages.

Four scenarios of solar power plant installation are analyzed. The methodology relies on nature-inspired optimization. The evolutionary multiobjective genetic algorithm is applied. The optimization is based on the costs of electricity production, encompassing not only the costs of technology, but also the costs of environmental protection and sustainable development. These costs are included in the model and the objectives are formulated accordingly. The objectives are based on maximization of electricity production up to the level of demand, minimization of total electricity costs and minimization of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, grid losses as well as other limitations and constraints of the electric power system are included into the model. The loss distribution is calculated in proportion to the distance between the supplier and the end user. The solar power plant losses equal zero, because it is assumed that the plant is located in a local community, close to consumers. The results show that the emissions and costs are higher without an introduced solar power plant. Introduction of solar capacities reduces the costs and emissions to a certain level. The developed model may be useful as a decision-support system generator. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Electric power system; Environment; Nature-inspired optimization model; Solar energy integration; Sustainability","Artificial intelligence; Biomimetics; Costs; Decision support systems; Electric power systems; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Solar power plants; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Electric power; Energy; Environment; Minimisation; Nature-inspired optimization model; Optimisations; Power; Power plant integration; Solar energy integration; Solar energy; decision support system; electricity industry; genetic algorithm; greenhouse gas; numerical model; optimization; power plant; solar power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109554373

Per fission event, in our simulations, the neutron and statistical γ-ray emissions change the spin of the fragment by 3.5-5h, with a large standard deviation comparable to the average value. Such wide angular momentum removal distributions can hide any underlying correlations in the fission fragment initial spin values. Within our model, we reproduce data on spin measurements from discrete transitions after neutron emissions, especially in the case of light FFs. The agreement further improves for the heavy fragments if one removes from the analysis the events that would produce isomeric states. Finally, we show that while in our model the initial FF spins do not follow a sawtoothlike behavior observed in recent measurements, the average FF spin computed after neutron and statistical γ emissions exhibits a shape that resembles a sawtooth. This suggests that the average FF spin measured after statistical emissions is not necessarily connected with the scission mechanism as previously implied. © 2021 American Physical Society.",,"Angular distribution; Angular momentum; Gamma rays; Neutrons; Average values; Discrete transitions; Emission change; Fission fragment; Heavy fragments; Light fission; Spin measurement; Spin value; Standard deviation; Usual assumptions; Fission reactions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121281251

The albedo of melt ponds is a key component of the surface energy balance. For this reason, various melt pond schemes have been developed for climate models. These schemes require assumptions on the physical processes governing melt ponds as well as a knowledge of the atmospheric state, which are not perfectly known. In this study, we investigate the effects of the sources of uncertainty from the prescribed atmospheric surface state, the melt pond scheme definition and the refreezing formulation of melt ponds on the simulated Arctic sea ice and melt pond properties with the NEMO-LIM3 ocean–sea ice general circulation model. We find that the simulated melt pond state is largely controlled by the freezing point of melt ponds. The representation of melt ponds is in better agreement with observations when using the freezing point of −0.15°C compared to the value of −2.00°C, in our model set-up. All the simulations feature positive trends in melt pond area fraction over the past decades. However, only 3 out of 8 simulations have significant positive trends in melt pond volume per sea ice area. This suggests an influence of the sea ice state for melt ponds over the last 30 years. Overall, we find that the simulated sea ice state, and in particular sea ice volume, is more affected by changes in the prescribed atmospheric forcing than by changes in the prescribed melt pond scheme or refreezing formulation. Including explicit melt pond schemes in large-scale sea-ice models offer the possibility to improve the representation of the surface energy balance in climate general circulation models. Our results underline that, in parallel to these efforts in model developments, improved estimates of surface atmospheric conditions will be required to achieve more realistic sea ice states. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Albedo; Arctic climate; Atmospheric reanalysis and forcing; Melt ponds; Ocean general circulation model; Sea ice model","Climate models; Energy balance; Freezing; Interfacial energy; Ponds; Sea ice; Atmospheric conditions; Atmospheric forcing; Freezing point; General circulation model; Model development; Physical process; Sea ice models; Sources of uncertainty; Lakes; albedo; arctic environment; atmospheric forcing; energy balance; general circulation model; melt; sea ice; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; surface energy; Arctic Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115067477

This study provides new insight into the method of deposition, chemical state of Pd and oxygen storage capability of transition metal ions and their effects on the catalytic reactivity of supported catalysts for the combustion of methane. The catalyst with nominal composition La(Co0.8Ni0.1Fe0.1)0.85Pd0.15O3 was supported on SiO2‐modified/γ‐alumina using two synthetic procedures: (i) aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition (U‐AACVD) and (ii) wet impregnation (Imp). A comparative analysis shows that a higher catalytic activity is established for supported catalyst obtained by wet impregnation, where the PdO‐like phase is well dispersed and the transition metal ions display a high oxygen storage capability. The reaction pathway over both catalysts proceeds most probably through Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. The supported catalysts are thermally stable when they are aged at 505 °C for 120 h in air containing 1.2 vol.% water vapor. Furthermore, the experimentally obtained data on La(Co0.8Ni0.1Fe0.1)0.85Pd0.15O3—based catalyst, supported on monolithic substrate VDM®Aluchrom Y Hf are simulated by using a two‐dimensional heterogeneous model for monolithic reactor in order to predict the performance of an industrial catalytic reactor for abatement of methane emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

Power supply on ships is traditionally based on engines thermal generators, which use fossil fuels, diesel, or natural gas. Due to the continuous operation of thermal generators in ships, this ends up increasing polluting gas emissions for the environment, mainly CO2 . A combination of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) with traditional ship thermal engines can reduce CO2 emissions, resulting in a ‘greener’ interaction between ships and the environment. Due to the varying power needs for ship operation, considering the varying nature of load demands during long distance travels and during harbor entry, the use of RES must be evaluated. This paper presents a new control method to balance LNG ship load demands and power generation from RES, based on an accurate model and solution in real conditions. The Energy Management System (EMS) is designed and implemented in a Finite State Machine structure using the logical design of state transitions. The results prove that the reduction of consumption of fossil fuels is feasible, and, if this is combined with RES, it reduces CO2 emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the corresponding non-linear and lagged effects of those variables on PM concentration remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the effect of meteorological variables and fire hotspot counts on PM concentration in the northern part of Thailand using the two-stage approach. In the first stage, combination of log-linear regression model and distributed lag non-linear model was used to estimate province-specific effect of meteorological factors and fire hotspots on PM2.5 and PM10 adjusting by confounders. In the second stage, the multivariate meta-analysis was applied to pool province-specific estimate, and the results showed that the negative associations of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfall with PM2.5 and PM10 were observed, while air pressure and fire hotspot was positively associated with PM. Moreover, the effects of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and fire hotspot on PM2.5 and PM10 were lasted for 5–8 days, whereas those of air pressure were peaked at lag 7 days and become attenuated toward the null afterward. In conclusion, results from this study could contribute a better understanding on the effects of meteorological variables and fire hotspots on PM concentration and induce the development of more tailored air pollution mitigation strategies depending on weather conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Air pollution; Distributed lag non-linear model; Meteorological variable; Particulate matter","ambient air; atmospheric pollution; climate effect; concentration (composition); estimation method; meteorology; particulate matter; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110820462

In the 1980s, the Hellenic Public Power Corporation (HPPC) started the rehabilitation of lignite post-mining areas in Northwest Greece by planting mainly black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.). Today, these plantations occupy about 2570 ha, but the accumulation of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and deadwood has not been assessed to date. Therefore, we aimed at estimating these biomass pools by calibrating an allometric model for AGB, performing an inventory for both pools and predicting the spatial distribution of AGB. 214 sample plots of 100 m2 each were set up through systematic sampling in a grid dimension of 500 × 500 m and tree dbh and height were recorded. AGB was estimated using an exponential allometric model and performing inventory measurements and was on average 57.6 t ha−1 . Kriging analysis reliably estimated mean AGB, but produced errors in the prediction of high and low biomass values, related to the high fragmentation and heterogeneity of the studied area. Mean estimated AGB was low compared with European biomass yield tables for black locust. Similarly, standing deadwood was low (6–10%) and decay degrees were mostly 1 and 2, indicating recent deadwood formation. The overall low biomass accumulation in the studied black locust restoration plantations may be partially attributed to their young age (5–30 years old), but is comparable to that reported in black locust restoration plantation in extremely degraded sites. Thus, black locust successfully adapted to the studied depositions of former mines and its accumulated biomass has the potential to improve the carbon footprint of the region. However, the invasiveness of the species should be considered for future management planning of these restoration plantations. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, we aimed to estimate the costs of healthy and sustainable diets around the world. Methods: In this modelling study, we used regionally comparable food prices from the International Comparison Program for 150 countries. We paired those prices with estimates of food demand for different dietary patterns that, in modelling studies, have been associated with reductions in premature mortality and environmental resource demand, including nutritionally balanced flexitarian, pescatarian, vegetarian, and vegan diets. We used estimates of food waste and projections of food demand and prices to specify food system and socioeconomic change scenarios up to 2050. In the full cost accounting, we estimated diet-related health-care costs by pairing a comparative risk assessment of dietary risks with cost-of-illness estimates, and we estimated climate change costs by pairing the diet scenarios with greenhouse gas emission footprints and estimates of the social cost of carbon. Findings: Compared with the cost of current diets, the healthy and sustainable dietary patterns were, depending on the pattern, up to 22–34% lower in cost in upper-middle-income to high-income countries on average (when considering statistical means), but at least 18–29% more expensive in lower-middle-income to low-income countries. Reductions in food waste, a favourable socioeconomic development scenario, and a fuller cost accounting that included the diet-related costs of climate change and health care in the cost of diets increased the affordability of the dietary patterns in our future projections. When these measures were combined, the healthy and sustainable dietary patterns were up to 25–29% lower in cost in low-income to lower-middle-income countries, and up to 37% lower in cost on average, for the year 2050. Variants of vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns were generally most affordable, and pescatarian diets were least affordable. Interpretation: In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, dietary change interventions that incentivise adoption of healthy and sustainable diets can help consumers in those countries reduce costs while, at the same time, contribute to fulfilling national climate change commitments and reduce public health spending. In low-income and lower-middle-income countries, healthy and sustainable diets are substantially less costly than western diets and can also be cost-competitive in the medium-to-long term, subject to beneficial socioeconomic development and reductions in food waste. A fuller accounting of the costs of diets would make healthy and sustainable diets the least costly option in most countries in the future.

Several methods for performance-based weighting exist that have the potential to increase the robustness of the change signal. Here we use future projections of an ensemble of three hydrological models forced with climate datasets from the Coordinated Downscaling Experiment - European Domain (EURO-CORDEX). The experiment is set-up for nine river basins spread over Europe that hold different climate and catchment characteristics. We evaluate the ensemble consistency and apply two weighting approaches; the Climate model Weighting by Independence and Performance (ClimWIP) that focuses on meteorological variables and the Reliability Ensemble Averaging (REA) in our study applied to discharge statistics per basin. For basins with a strong climate signal, in Southern and Northern Europe, the consistency in the set of projections is large. For rivers in Central Europe the differences between models become more pronounced. Both weighting approaches assign high weights to single General Circulation Models (GCMs). The ClimWIP method results in ensemble mean weighted changes that differ only slightly from the non-weighted mean. The REA method influences the weighted mean more, but the weights highly vary from basin to basin. We see that high weights obtained through past good performance can provide deviating projections for the future. It is not apparent that the GCM signal dominates the overall change signal, i.e., there is no strong intra GCM consistency. However, both weighting methods favored projections from the same GCM.

Since water shortage is one of the key risks for the future of agriculture, exploring the capability of crop species to grow with limited water is therefore fundamental. By using chlorophyll fluorescence analysis, we evaluated the responses of wild tomato accession Solanum pennellii LA0716, Solanum lycopersicum cv. M82, the introgression line IL12-4 (from cv. M82 X LA0716), and the Greek tomato cultivars cv. Santorini and cv. Zakinthos, to moderate drought stress (MoDS) and severe drought stress (SDS), in order to identify the minimum irrigation level for efficient photosynthetic perfor-mance. Agronomic traits (plant height, number of leaves and root/shoot biomass), relative water content (RWC), and lipid peroxidation, were also measured. Under almost 50% deficit irrigation, S. pennellii exhibited an enhanced photosynthetic function by displaying a hormetic response of electron transport rate (ETR), due to an increased fraction of open reaction centers, it is suggested to be activated by the low increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A low increase of ROS is regarded to be beneficial by stimulating defense responses and also triggering a more oxidized redox state of quinone A (QA), corresponding in S. pennellii under 50% deficit irrigation, to the lowest stomatal opening, resulting in reduction of water loss. Solanum pennellii was the most tolerant to drought, as it was expected, and could manage to have an adequate photochemical function with almost 30% water regime of well-watered plants. With 50% deficit irrigation, cv. M82 and cv. Santorini did not show any difference in photochemical efficiency to control plants and are recommended to be cultivated under deficit irrigation as an effective strategy to enhance agricultural sustainability under a global climate change. We conclude that instead of the previously used Fv/Fm ratio, the redox state of QA, as it can be estimated by the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter 1-qL, is a better indicator to evaluate photosynthetic efficiency and select drought tolerant cultivars under deficit irrigation. © 2021 by the authors.

While knowledge about the impacts of climate change in cetacean's species is still scarce, practitioners and policymakers need information about the species at risk to guide the implementation of conservation measures. To assess cetacean's vulnerability to climate change in the biogeographic region of Macaronesia, we adapted the Marine Mammal Climate Vulnerability Assessment (MMCVA) method and applied it to 21 species management units using an expert elicitation approach. Results showed that over half (62%) of the units assessed presented Very High (5 units) or High (8 units) vulnerability scores. Very High vulnerability scores were found in archipelago associated units of short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), namely in the Canary Islands and Madeira, as well as Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) in the Canary Islands. Overall, certainty scores ranged from Very High to Moderate for 67% of units.

Although the function of reducing particulate matter (PM) in the city is known, research into the reduction of PM according to the type and structure of various forests is still needed. It is essential to study the characteristics of PM concentration in urban riparian forests, which are frequently used for outdoor walks in the COVID-19 era. In this study, the diurnal and seasonal changes in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were analyzed in urban forests with different structures in the riparian forests located in central Seoul. The PM concentration was found to be high regardless of the time of the day in forests with a developed canopy layer. Similar results were found before and after leaf emergence compared with the seasonal PM concentration. The results of this study highlight the need for planned and periodic management of the canopy layer and underground vegetation to prevent the PM trapping effect to ensure the safe use of riparian forests in cities. © 2021 by the authors.

Wind energy generation contributes to the attainment of the Union's objectives because it is a mature and cost-effective national investment. Moreover, wind energy is part of the transition towards a circular economy primarily by producing clean renewable energy with a low environmental impact. The appropriate selection of both materials and sites is critical to ensure efficiency and low local impact. The selection of a wind farm installation site is a spatially complex decision-making problem that aims to evaluate alternative locations using planning and environmental restrictions. This paper introduces a new decision-making framework that combines geographic information systems (GIS) technology and PROMETHEE II, a multi-attribute decision making (MADM) method, to enable the GIS-assisted wind farm suitability analysis. The proposed framework can be used as a strategic planning tool that can help energy planners, wind developers, and decision and policy makers at the national and regional levels to accurately determine and predict the most efficient locations for wind farm development. The framework is illustrated through a case study of the Thrace region of north-eastern Greece. © 2021","Geographic information systems (GIS); Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA); PROMETHEE II method; Suitability analysis; Wind farm siting","Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Decision theory; Electric utilities; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Information systems; Information use; Investments; Site selection; Wind power; Energy; Geographic information; Geographic information system; Multicriterium decision analyse; Onshore winds; PROMETHEE II method; PROMETHEE-II; Suitability analysis; Wind farm; Wind farm siting; Decision making; alternative energy; economic system; European Union; GIS; multicriteria analysis; wind farm; wind power; Greece; Thrace",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113502747

While soil maps exist in Saskatchewan, they are at coarse scales (1:100,000), which are not always suitable for detailed soil management. One emerging technique for predictive soil mapping is the use of bare soil composite imagery derived from multi-temporal satellite imagery. This study focused on using bare soil composite imagery along with legacy soil data (1958–1998) with high location uncertainty to predict soil organic carbon, clay, and cation exchange capacity. The bare soil composite images were created from Landsat 5 imagery (1985 to 1995) using Google Earth Engine. Predictive models were built using a Random Forest model for each parameter and evaluated using a 75–25 train-test split. The soil organic carbon model had an R2 value of 0.55 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.67 percent, with the near infrared and visible light bands being the most important features in the model. The clay predictive model has an R2 of 0.44 and a RMSE of 5.0 percent, with the shortwave infrared bands being most important. The cation exchange capacity model had an R2 of 0.50 with a RMSE of 5.7 meq 100 g−1, with the shortwave and near infrared bands as the most important predictors. Based on these results, bare soil composite imagery represents a valuable covariate for predictive soil mapping in the Canadian Prairies. This work also illustrates that for regions with extensive adoption of conservation farming practices, satellite imagery should be obtained for time periods before these practices were adopted from the months of the year where crop residues have decomposed. By combining historical soil survey data with historical imagery, maps of legacy soil properties can be generated to make comparisons against with modern data for applications such as monitoring soil organic carbon change over time. © 2021","Bare Soil Composite; Predictive Soil Mapping; Remote Sensing; Soil Organic Carbon","Agricultural wastes; Agronomy; Decision trees; Land use; Mapping; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Positive ions; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Soil conservation; Soil surveys; Soil testing; Bare soil composite; Bare soils; Cation exchange capacities; Predictive soil mapping; Remote-sensing; Root mean square errors; Soil mapping; Soil organic carbon; Soil property; Survey data; Soils",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108639365

Based on the panel data of 29 manufacturing industrial sectors in China’s 30 provinces from 2006 to 2015, using a model that includes the year, province, and industry fixed-effect, this paper fills the gap by exploring whether and how industrial policy affects carbon emission in Chinese manufacturing. The result shows that industrial policy significantly increases carbon emission in supported industries by 10.3%, which is achieved by increasing industrial energy consumption, relaxing government environmental regulation, and encouraging enterprises to invest more in fixed assets. Further, the effects of industrial policy on carbon emission are heterogeneous in many aspects. In the central and western regions, technology-intensive industries, industries with stronger government intervention, industries with higher exports, industries supported by both central and local governments, and during the 12th Five-Year Plan, the industrial policy will increase carbon emissions more. Our findings for the first time indicate the negative impact of industrial policies on carbon emission reduction in the Chinese manufacturing industry, which implies that traditional selective industrial policies in developing countries like China need a paradigm shift to achieve green development. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emission; China; Industrial policy; Manufacturing","carbon emission; data set; industrial enterprise; industrial policy; manufacturing; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; industry; policy; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Industry; Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118815466

To effectively reduce heat health risk, a better understanding of where and what risk factors should be targeted for intervention is necessary. However, little research has examined how different risk factors for heat-related mortality operate at varying spatial scales. Here, we present a novel application of the multiscale geographically weighted regression (GWR) approach to explore the scale of effect of each underlying risk factor using Hong Kong as a case study. We find that a hybrid of global and local processes via multiscale GWR yields a better fit of heat-related mortality risk than models using GWR and ordinary least squares (OLS) approaches. Predictor variables are categorized by the scale of effect into global variables (i.e., age and education attainment, socioeconomic status), intermediate variables (i.e., work place, birth place and language), and local variables (i.e., thermal environment, low income). These findings enrich our understanding of the spatial scale-dependent risk factors for heat-related mortality and shed light on the importance of hierarchical policy-making and site-specific planning processes in effective heat hazard mitigation and climate adaptation strategies. © 2021","Extreme heat; Geographically weighted regression (GWR); Heat health planning; Heat-related mortality; Multiscale","Health risks; Heating; Extreme heat; Geographically weighted regression; Heat health planning; Heat-related mortalities; Human mortality; Multiscale; Risk factors; Spatial scale; Sustainable cities; Regression analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111052399

Submerged arc furnaces are also used to upgrade ilmenite by producing pig iron and a titania‐rich slag. Metal containing resources are smelted in this furnace type using fossil carbon as a reducing agent, which is responsible for a large amount of direct CO2 emissions in those processes. Instead, renewable bio‐based carbon could be a viable direct replacement of fossil carbon currently investigated by research institutions and companies to lower the CO2 footprint of produced alloys. A second option could be the usage of hydrogen. However, hydrogen has the disadvantages that current production facilities relying on solid reducing agents need to be adjusted. Furthermore, hydrogen reduction of ignoble metals like chromium, manganese and silicon is only possible at very low H2O/H2 partial pressure ratios. The present article is a comprehensive review of the research carried out regarding the utilization of bio‐based carbon for the processing of the mentioned products. Starting with the potential impact of the ferroalloy industry on greenhouse gas emissions, followed by a general description of bio‐based reducing agents and unit operations covered by this review, each following chapter presents current research carried out to produce each metal. Most studies focused on pre‐reduction or solid‐state reduction except the silicon industry, which instead had a strong focus on smelting up to an industrial‐scale and the design of bio‐based carbon for submerged arc furnace processes. Those results might be transferable to other submerged arc furnace processes as well and could help to accelerate research to produce other metals. Deviations between the amount of research and scale of tests for the same unit operation but different metal resources were identified and closer cooperation could be helpful to transfer knowledge from one area to another. Life cycle assessment to produce ferronickel and silicon already revealed the potential of bio‐based reducing agents in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, but was not carried out for other metals until now. © 2021 by the authors.

An abyssal benthic rover was developed to make long time-series measurements of seafloor processes related to organic carbon remineralization and sequestration. Benthic Rover II (BR-II) is an autonomous dual-tracked vehicle that measures bottom water temperature and oxygen concentration, current velocity, and sediment community oxygen consumption (SCOC; respiration). BR-II is programmed to transit with low surface-contact pressure across the seafloor, photograph bottom conditions, and stop regularly to occupy respirometer incubation sites, with deployment periods up to 1 year. Now, continuously operational at a 4000-m station in the northeast Pacific over 5 years, substantial weekly, seasonal, annual, and episodic events have been recorded, which are critical to assessing the deep-ocean carbon cycle. There was a significant increase in phytodetritus cover (P < 0.01) arriving on the seafloor from the overlying water column between 2015 and 2020 that was negatively correlated with bottom water dissolved oxygen concentration (P < 0.01). Over the continuous 5-year monitoring period from November 2015 to November 2020, SCOC was positively correlated with phytodetritus cover (P < 0.01) and increased significantly from 2015 to 2020 (P < 0.01). These results show important influences of biological processes on the carbon cycle. The demonstrated success of BR-II now creates opportunities to expand the long-term monitoring of the deep sea to resolve the coupling of water column and benthic processes key to understanding the oceanic carbon cycle on a planet engulfed in a changing climate.

In response, they are developing climate action plans that also support their sustainable development goals, but conventional adaptation approaches such as hard flood defenses can be expensive and unsustainable. Nature-based solutions (NbS) could provide cost-effective options to address these challenges but policymakers lack evidence on their effectiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we focused on Bangladesh, which is exceptionally vulnerable to cyclones, relative sea-level rise, saline intrusion, floods, landslides, heat waves and droughts, exacerbated by environmental degradation. NbS have been implemented in Bangladesh, but there is no synthesis of the outcomes in a form accessible to policymakers. We therefore conducted a systematic review on the effectiveness of NbS for addressing climate and natural hazards, and the outcomes for other sustainable development goals. Research encompasses protection, restoration and participatory management of mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, as well as conservation agriculture and agro-forestry, but there is an evidence gap for urban green infrastructure. There is robust evidence that, if well-designed, these NbS can be effective in reducing exposure to natural disasters, adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions while empowering marginalized groups, reducing poverty, supporting local economies and enhancing biodiversity. However, we found short-term trade-offs with local needs, e.g. through over-harvesting and conversion of ecosystems to aquaculture or agriculture. To maximize NbS benefits while managing trade-offs, we identified four enabling factors: support for NbS in government policies; participatory delivery involving all stakeholders; strong and transparent governance; and provision of secure finance and land tenure, in line with international guidelines. More systematic monitoring of NbS project outcomes is also needed. Bangladesh has an opportunity to lead the way in showing how high quality NbS can be deployed at landscape scale to tackle sustainable development challenges in low to middle income countries, supporting a Green Economic Recovery. Our evidence base highlights the value of protecting irreplaceable natural assets such as mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, and the non-market benefits they deliver, in national planning policies.

In the current scientific literature and in the public debate, there are contrasting views on how forests should be managed to maximize total climate benefit, including the use of products and changes in carbon pools. Three major factors influence the conclusions in different studies: (a) time horizon, (b) site productivity, (c) substitution calculations. Here we show the dependency among these factors by an analysis of four harvest scenarios: 95%, 60%, 40% and 0% of growth, which are compared to a business as usual scenario (80%). The analyses are made for five counties in Sweden, which covers a wide range in forest productivities, from 2.5 m3 ha−1 yr−1 (north) to 11.5 m3 ha−1 yr−1 (south). The results show: (a) Reduced harvest levels provide increased climate benefits on short time scales (at least 50 years). (b) Increased harvesting from current level is counterproductive on both short and long term. (c) The potential effect on the carbon balance of a no-harvest scenario in the five counties, is larger (1.1-16 times) than the expected emissions from all other anthropogenic activities until 2045. (d) Short-term climate benefits of reduced harvesting are largest in highly productive forests. Smaller but more long-lasting benefits can be obtained by aiming at harvest reductions in less productive forests. (e) Strategies focused on short-term benefits need to be adapted to the future development of substitution factors and forest growth. If substitution effects become higher, increased harvest levels will be beneficial after 2050 in high productive forests. However, if future substitution effects decrease, which is a plausible and desired development, low harvest strategies are preferred in both short- and long-term time perspectives.

We evaluate here our understanding of the links between these emissions changes and corresponding changes in concentrations and health outcomes using a chemical transport model, the Particulate Matter Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (PMCAMx), for 1990, 2001, and 2010. The use of the Particle Source Apportionment Algorithm (PSAT) allows us to link the concentration reductions to the sources of the corresponding primary and secondary PM. The reductions in SO2 emissions (64%, mainly from electric-generating units) during these 20 years have dominated the reductions in PM2.5, leading to a 45% reduction in sulfate levels. The predicted sulfate reductions are in excellent agreement with the available measurements. Also, the reductions in elemental carbon (EC) emissions (mainly from transportation) have led to a 30% reduction in EC concentrations. The most important source of organic aerosol (OA) through the years according to PMCAMx is biomass burning, followed by biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA). OA from on-road transport has been reduced by more than a factor of 3. On the other hand, changes in biomass burning OA and biogenic SOA have been modest. In 1990, about half of the US population was exposed to annual average PM2.5 concentrations above 20μgm-3, but by 2010 this fraction had dropped to practically zero. The predicted changes in concentrations are evaluated against the observed changes for 1990, 2001, and 2010 in order to understand whether the model represents reasonably well the corresponding processes caused by the changes in emissions. © 2021 Ksakousti Skyllakou et al.",,"air quality; concentration (composition); emission control; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120437691

In 2010–2013, more than 73 thousand hectares of fire-prone peat-lands were rewetted in the Moscow Region (the hitherto largest rewetting program in the Northern Hemisphere). As the Russian Federation has no national accounting of rewetted areas yet, this paper presents an approach to detect them based on multispectral satellite data verified by ground truth-ing. We propose that effectively rewetted areas should minimally include areas with wet grasslands and those covered with water (cf. the IPCC categories “rewetted organic soils” and “flooded lands”). In 2020, these lands amounted in Moscow Region to more than 5.3 and 3.6 thousand hec-tares, respectively. Assuming that most rewetted areas were former peat extraction sites and using IPCC default GHG emission factors, an overall GHG emission reduction of over 36,000 tCO2-eq yr−1 was calculated. We furthermore considered the uncertainty of calculations. With the example of a 1,535 ha large rewetted peatland, we illustrate the estimation of GHG emission reductions for the period up to 2050. The approach presented can be used to estimate GHG emission reductions by peatland rewetting on the national, regional, and object level. © 2021 by the authors.

The corresponding particulate matter (PM) emissions are not included or are seriously underestimated in urban emission inventories. However, several field studies suggest that cooking organic aerosol (COA) can be an important component of the organic PM in urban areas. In this study we propose and evaluate a methodology for the simulation of the COA concentration and its variability in space and time in an urban area. The city of Patras, the third biggest in Greece, is used for this first application during a typical late summer period. The spatial distribution of COA emissions was based on the exact location of restaurants and grills, while the emission rates on the per person meat consumption in Greece. We estimated COA emissions of 0.6 g d−1 per person that corresponds to 150 kg d−1 for Patras. The temporal distribution of COA emissions was based on the known cooking times and the results of past field studies in the area. We estimated that half of the daily COA is emitted during dinner time (21:00–0:00 LT), while approximately 25% during lunch time (13:00–16:00 LT). The COA is simulated using the Volatility Basis Set approach and is treated as semivolatile and reactive. Its volatility distribution is based on laboratory measurements of COA from meat grilling. The chemical transport model PMCAMx predicts that the COA concentration reaches values up to 15 μg m−3 during the nights of the simulated summertime period in an area with high restaurant density. The average predicted COA concentration is around 1.2 μg m−3 in the center and 0.1–0.2 μg m−3 in the suburbs of the city. COA has a distinct daily profile that peaks during lunch (13:00–15:00 LT) and dinner (21:00–23:00 LT) periods. The local production of secondary COA is predicted to be slow and it represents just a few percent of the total COA. The model reproduces well the average PM2.5 concentrations at the outskirts of Patras and its overall performance for hourly PM2.5 values is rated as good. A 50% uncertainty of the reported COA emissions is estimated based on the results of the sensitivity tests and the observations in the city core. The emissions can be further constrained and the corresponding uncertainty can be further reduced with measurements focusing on COA and not on total PM2.5 as was the case in this study. These should take place in different areas of the city, selected based on the model predictions, to also improve our estimates of the spatial distribution of the emissions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric aerosol; Cooking; Emissions; PMCAMx; Volatility basis set","Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Aerosol concentration; Aerosol emissions; Basis sets; Emission; Field studies; Organic aerosol; Particulate Matter; PMCAMx; Urban areas; Volatility base set; Uncertainty analysis; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission inventory; particulate matter; simulation; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal distribution; urban area; urban pollution; adult; aerosol; article; clinical article; female; field study; Greece; grilling; human; male; meat consumption; night; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; restaurant; simulation; summer; uncertainty; urban area; Achaea; Greece; Patras; Western Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115087840

Using primary data from Kolkata, India, the simulator estimates the fleet size, the average distance traveled per order, the average number of orders delivered and the average idle time spent by a delivery worker, at varying order volumes. The negative externalities estimated are the emissions per order and the spatio-temporal parking demand generated by the delivery fleet. The results show that at an order volume of 2100, on average, the distance traveled per order is 5.85 km, the orders delivered per worker is 15, the idle time spent is 59.2% and each delivery results in the emission of 163.08 gm CO2. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based simulation; Freight emissions; Gig work; On-demand meal delivery; Parking demand; Platform economy","Economics; Simulation platform; Agent based simulation; Food delivery; Freight emission; Gig work; Local foods; On demands; On-demand meal delivery; Parking demands; Platform economy; Workers'; Decision making; computer simulation; decision making; food market; freight transport; parking; service provision; spatiotemporal analysis; India; Kolkata; West Bengal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116512439

Gibbs free energy analysis was conducted to establish which reaction pathways for fuel reforming were dominant and how these reactions are influencing H2 and CO yield. To obtain engine exhaust temperature and mass flow maps for several steady-state engine operation conditions, an engine model was created in AVL CRUISE M and validated with real GDI engine data. A methodology was developed to couple the thermodynamic reactor results and engine model results to compute waste exhaust heat recovery by accounting limited available exergy in exhaust and optimising reforming reactor's operational parameters to maximise exergy recovery and reforming efficiency in the reformer. Under steady state engine operation, iso-pentanol was more effective overall due to its high hydrogen content by weight (8.3% and 4.3% higher than methanol and ethanol respectively), high energy density of 34.6 MJ/kg (42.2%, 22.3% 13.2% and 4.3% higher than C1-C4 alcohols respectively), high reforming endothermicity and the versatility for heat recovery under all engine operation conditions with heat recovery of at-least 2% of engine power even under low-load conditions. Subsequently, the engine model was evolved into a full AVL CRUISE M vehicle model and was studied over a duty-cycle to evaluate the fuels further. Iso-pentanol and iso-propanol were most effective concerning average heat recovery over the duty cycle. For the high-speed regions of the cycle, up-to 9% of waste heat recovery is observed for C4 and C5 bio-alcohols. In terms of vehicle's carbon emissions, iso-pentanol, n-butanol, and ethanol exhibited maximum CO2 reduction of 8.4%, 7.7% and 7.1% respectively.

This raises questions about how such a state might arise, and how it might persist long enough to represent the population of massive clumps. In an effort to reexamine the origins of this conclusion, we use ammonia line data from the Green Bank Ammonia Survey and Planck-calibrated dust emission data from Herschel to estimate the masses and kinetic and gravitational energies for dense clumps in the Gould Belt clouds. We show that several types of systematic error can enhance the appearance of low kinetic-to-gravitational energy ratios: insufficient removal of foreground and background material; ignoring the kinetic energy associated with velocity differences across a resolved cloud; and overcorrecting for stratification when evaluating the gravitational energy. Using an analysis designed to avoid these errors, we find that the most massive Gould Belt clumps harbor virial motions, rather than subvirial ones. As a by-product, we present a catalog of masses, energies, and virial energy ratios for 85 Gould Belt clumps. © 2021. The American Astronomical Society.

The results showed a great degree of discomfort (78.8% of the sample). On average, air temperatures ranged between 29.0 °C and 30.2 °C. The calculations of the Opening (OP) – confirmed the negative impact of the renovations on comfort and health, since the originally delivered housing units underwent great reductions in OP in 47.5% of the sample while 17.2% increased the OP original values. Due to the removal of window openings (45.5%), unplanned expansions often led to confined or unbearably hot environments, and the need for continuous use of fans (87.9%). The worrying post-use scenario indicates that thermal comfort losses are only felt after the physical adaptations have been made. Residents will live in unhealthy and highly uncomfortable environments and will be forced to use adaptive strategies to minimize discomfort, however, with increasing energy consumption. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Low income; Low-cost housing; Post-use; Thermal comfort; User satisfaction","Costs; Energy utilization; Health; Housing; Field research; Hot and humid climate; Low incomes; Low-cost housings; Northeast regions; Post-use; Social housing; Study samples; Thermal; Users' satisfactions; Thermal comfort; air temperature; humid environment; indoor air; low income housing; ventilation; Brazil; Joao Pessoa; Paraiba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111611256

The COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the worst of its kind in the last century with regard to global deaths and, in the absence of any effective treatment, it led to governments worldwide mandating lock-down measures, as well as citizens voluntarily reducing non-essential trips and activities. In this study, the influence of decreased activity on CO2 emissions and on the economy was assessed. The US, EU-28, China and India, representing almost 60% of anthropogenic carbon emissions, were considered as reference entities and the trends were extrapolated to estimate the global impact. This study aimed to deduce initial estimates of anthropogenic CO2 emissions based on the available economic and industrial outputs and activity data, as they could not be directly measured. Sector-wise variations in emissions were modeled by assuming proportionality of the outputs/activities and the resulting emissions. A decline in road traffic was seen up to March 2020 and then a steady growth was observed, with the exception of China where road traffic started to recover by the end of January. The vast majority of passenger flights were grounded and, therefore, global air traffic plummeted by 43.7% from January to May 2020. A considerable drop in coal power production and the annual industrial growth rate was also observed. The overall economic decline led to a drop of 4.9% in annual global gross domestic product (GDP) for Q2 2020. The total global CO2 emissions reduction for January through April 2020 compared to the year before was estimated to be 1749 Mt. CO2 (14.3%) with a maximum contribution from the transportation sector (58.3% among total emissions by sector). Like other previous crises, if the economy rebounds as expected the reductions will be temporary. Long-term impacts can be minimized considering the business as well as lifestyle changes for travel, utilizing virtual structures created during this crisis, and switching to sustainable transportation. © 2021","CO2 emissions; COVID-19; Economy; Industry; Power generation; Transportation","Drops; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Industrial economics; Roads and streets; Anthropogenic carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide emissions; China and India; CO$-2$/ emission; COVID-19; Economy; Global climate changes; Non essential; Power- generations; Road traffic; Carbon dioxide; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; COVID-19; environmental assessment; local government; pollution monitoring; power generation; traffic emission; air pollution; Article; carbon footprint; China; coal power; coronavirus disease 2019; economic aspect; economic crisis; gross national product; growth rate; human; India; industrial production; industrial waste; lifestyle modification; pandemic; traffic and transport; United States; communicable disease control; pandemic; China; Europe; India; United States; carbon dioxide; Carbon Dioxide; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109466071

Several researches reported that the hydrological regime of these Himalayan rivers is vulnerable to climate change. In order to understand the hydrologic response of their headwaters and examine the climate change impacts on streamflow, a hydrological modelling study is carried out in the upper part of the Satluj river basin in western Himalaya by using a temperature index based SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) model. The model performed well for both calibration (years 1986–2000) and validation (2001–2005) periods against the observed daily streamflow at Rampur (R2 ≈ 0.9 and NSE ≥ 0.85). The study reveals that having a larger snow covered area, the snowmelt runoff is the major contributor to the Satluj river discharge at Rampur that comes out to be about 68–71% of the average annual water yield of about 600 mm. The actual evapotranspiration comes out to be about 14% of precipitation. The water yield of the basin is about 50% of the precipitation, for which the major part is generated in early summer. Further, to study the climate change impact on future streamflow, the downscaled data of CORDEX CCSM4 under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios are used. The bias correction is applied at point level to remove biases from future time series of downscaled data and subsequently loaded into the SWAT model to simulate the future streamflows at the end of the century. The future climate variability in terms of precipitation and temperature exhibited that the climate in the region would become wetter and warmer. A 14% to 21% of increase in annual precipitation is predicted towards the end of the century from the current average annual precipitation of about 420 mm under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. Similar to precipitation, the temperature will also be increased by 2.18 °C to 5.71 °C (in both the RCPs) than the current temperature values. The changed climate conditions in future are transformed into the possible range of stream flows using the SWAT model and found that the future climate would increase the streamflow by over 11%–19% at the end of the century under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The outcome of this study can be used to develop the suitable strategies for sustainable water management in the region. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Satluj Rivers; Streamflow; SWAT hydrological modelling; Water balance; Western Himalaya","Climate change; Climate models; Hydrology; Potable water; Rivers; Runoff; Snow; Snow melting systems; Stream flow; Water supply; 'current; Climate change impact; Himalayan rivers; Hydrological models; Satluj river; Soil water assessment tool; Soil water assessment tool hydrological modeling; Tool models; Water balance; Western himalayum; Soil moisture; climate change; future prospect; glacier flow; hydrological modeling; scenario analysis; snow; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; water budget; Sutlej River; snow; climate change; human; hydrology; ice cover; river; Climate Change; Humans; Hydrology; Ice Cover; Rivers; Snow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109576584

Crysophogan zizanioides, a.k.a vetiver grass, is a densely tufted grass from Poaceae family of giant grasses. These grasses are known for its tolerance to extremely high levels of heavy metals and can grow in tropical and temperate regions around the world. Hence, the present study attempts to utilize the barren manganese dumps around the Dongri Buzurg mine area in central India as a carbon sink patch by vegetating vetiver grass. It was found that the nutrient content of the hangwall and footwall of the existing dump was lacking in N (29.33kg/acre) and P (58.73 kg/acre) for sustaining the potential growth of plant species, also the organic carbon content was found to be around 0.10% which should ideally be around 1.12%. As the dump requires longer roots compared to its shoots, for providing stability and control of soil erosion, the study focuses on this aspect of vetiver growth. It was observed that as the percentage vermicompost increases than shoot/root (S/R) ratio decreases. The study on the control sample indicated a ratio of 3.33 over a period of 60 days indicating poor root growth without any vermicompost supplement on the other hand a 50% vermicompost sample indicated a ratio of 1.24 over the same period of time. This study developed an empirical formula using statistical analysis tools to determine the optimum S/R ratio at different per cent vermicompost. © 2021, Books and Journals Private Ltd..

We examine the US impacts of emission changes on several factors that are affected by both climate and air quality responses. Nationwide benefits through midcentury stem primarily from air quality improvements, which are realized rapidly, and include human health, labor productivity, and crop yield benefits. Benefits from reduced heat exposure become large around 2060, thereafter often dominating over those from improved air quality. Monetized benefits are in the tens of trillions of dollars for avoided deaths and tens of billions for labor productivity and crop yield increases and reduced hospital expenditures. Total monetized benefits this century are dominated by health and are much larger than in previous analyses due to improved understanding of the human health impacts of exposure to both heat and air pollution. Benefit-cost ratios are therefore much larger than in prior studies, especially those that neglected clean air benefits. Specifically, benefits from clean air exceed costs in the first decade, whereas benefits from climate alone exceed costs in the latter half of the century. Furthermore, monetized US benefits largely stem from US emissions reductions. Increased emphasis on the localized, near-term air quality-related impacts would better align policies with societal benefits and, by reducing the mismatch between perception of climate as a risk distant in space and time and the need for rapid action to mitigate long-term climate change, might help increase acceptance of mitigation policies. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

This study aims to develop new insights into environment-related stranded assets by extracting the US stock market view of how collective climate action may impact the value of fossil fuel stocks. To this aim, it adopts a forward-looking method in which an observed stock price is expressed as a probability-weighted average of its business-as-usual (BAU) and non-BAU values. It then expands the information set by options prices to recover the implied probability of climate action and estimate non-BAU and BAU values of stocks ex-ante. Overall, market estimates show a modest decrease in the price of fossil fuel shares at 4% on average, limited to a maximum loss of USD 100 billion. The reasons the potential loss is smaller than widely expected may include (i) investment horizon and ease of exit, (ii) the low probability of collective climate action and discounted-cash-flow impacts, (iii) the ownership of remaining reserves, (iv) the policy environment in the US.

Here we project the pollutants emissions in China based on a carbon neutrality roadmap and clean air policies evolution; national and regional PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in 2030 (the target year of carbon peak), 2035 (the target year of “Beautiful China 2035” launched by the Chinese government to fundamentally improve air quality) and 2060 (the target year of carbon neutrality) are then simulated using an air quality model. Results showed that compared with 2019, emissions of SO2, NOx, primary PM2.5, and VOCs are projected to reduce by 42%, 42%, 44%, and 28% in 2030, by 57%, 58%, 60%, and 42% in 2035, by 93%, 93%, 90% and 61% in 2060 respectively. Consequently, in 2030, 2035, and 2060, the national annual mean PM2.5 will be 27, 23, and 11 μg m−3; and the 90th percentile of daily 8-h maxima of O3 (O3-8h 90th) will be 129, 123, and 93 μg m−3; 82%, 94%, and 100% of 337 municipal cities will reach the current national air quality standard, respectively. It's expected that the “Beautiful China 2035” target is very likely to be achieved, and about half of the 337 cities will meet the current WHO air quality guideline in 2060. In the near future, strict environmental policies driven by “Beautiful China 2035” are needed due to their substantial contribution to emission reductions. By 2060, the low-carbon policies driven by the carbon neutrality target are expected to contribute to larger than 80% of reductions in PM2.5 and O3-8h 90th concentrations relative to the 2020 levels, implying that more attention could be paid to low-carbon policies after 2035.

Based on occurrence records, national meteorological data and the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model (a species distribution model), we investigated for the first time the interdecadal variations in climate-suitable areas of cotton with changing climate in China from 1961 to 2017. Then, the gravity center and concentration index were employed to investigate the spatial-temporal variations of cotton production. The results revealed the dominant meteorological predictors affecting climate suitability of cotton to be ≥ 28℃ accumulated maximum temperature from April to October, average temperature in the warmest month, continuous days with daily average temperature ≥15 ℃ and annual precipitation days. The climate optimum areas were generally distributed in the eastern and northern parts of the Huanghe Valley and Northwest Inland cotton regions, respectively. The climatic suitability of cotton has increased in China in recent decades. In particular, the areas of improved climatic suitability of cotton encompassed 38.08 % of the whole country from the 1960s to 2010s. This increase was concentrated in the Huanghe Valley and Northwest Inland cotton regions. The distribution of climate-suitable areas moved northward and expanded westward. Meanwhile, the gravity center of the cotton production moved to the northwest at a distance of approximately 1283 km from 1985 to 2015. Although both the production and distribution of climate-suitable areas of cotton shifted towards the northwest, the proportions of inconsistency between planting areas and climate-suitable areas increased from 22.76 % in the 1980s to 32.38 % in the 2010s.

The study adopted a cross-sectional design to collect survey data from 825 full-time insurance agents employed in life insurance companies in Karnataka state in South India. We found a positive relationship between misselling and ethical climate, indicating that salespeople’s perceptions might be changed by ethical codes, policies, or training but not their ethical behavior. Moreover, high-self monitors acting opportunistically to corner the sales by adopting dishonest sales practices indicated an instrumental ethical dimension. We also showed that competitive intensity positively influenced agents to exhibit financial misselling. Also, financial misselling increased when insurance companies designed varieties of complex products and exerted too much supervisory pressure on agents to amplify sales. Therefore, the working environment should enforce and promote a code of ethics that fosters an ethical attitude and hampers high self-monitors from pursuing individual interests at customers’ expense. There is a need to manage ethical and competitive climate and supervisors’ actions in reducing ethical conflicts and improving sales performance. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

Physical scientists are trained to produce numbers and to draw general, abstract conclusions. In general, however, people relate much better to stories and to events they have experienced, which are inevitably contingent and particular. Sheila Jasanoff has argued elsewhere that the process of abstraction in climate science “detaches knowledge from meaning”. Perhaps useable climate science is, then, meaningful climate science. We argue here that the development of meaningful climate science can be achieved by adopting a storyline approach to climate variability and change. By ‘storyline’ we mean a physically self-consistent unfolding of past events or of plausible future events or pathways. Storylines represent a combination of qualitative and quantitative information, where the qualitative element represents a packaging or contextualization of the quantitative aspects, which ensures that data can be meaningfully interpreted. Viewed from this perspective, we show that physical climate storylines can be aligned with several well-established vehicles for translation of knowledge between diverse communities: narratives, boundary objects, and data journeys. They can therefore be used as a ‘pidgin language’ to enrich the set of tools available to climate scientists to bring meaning to climate knowledge. “And what is the use of a book”, thought Alice, “without pictures or conversations?” (Lewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland). © 2021, The Author(s).","Boundary objects; Climate change; Climate science; Data journeys; Narratives; Storylines","Uncertainty analysis; Best estimates; Boundary objects; Climate science; Climate variability and change; Data journey; Narrative; Science community; Storylines; Uncertainty; Unfoldings; Climate change; climate change; language; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120156305

Our work extracted respective productive for economic growth and reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and further evaluated the decoupling relationship at the efficiency level for China's provinces during 2005–2017. Economic growth efficiency showed a downward trend, whereas the efficiency in the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions showed a slight improvement in the whole of China, which was consistent with China's strong negative decoupling. All three geographic regions in China had an enormous division between efficiency and its decoupling status. In particular, the eastern provinces had the highest efficiency, but the central region exhibited the highest decoupling. Furthermore, the overall performance of the two efficiency indices declined gradually from the eastern provinces to the western provinces and, over time, more provinces improved their decoupling relationship.

The purpose of this analysis was to investigate the impacts that meeting Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.2 (i.e., ending open defecation by 2030) would have on SDG 13 (i.e., combatting climate impacts). The current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change GHG estimation methodology was used as the basis for calculations in this analysis, augmented with improved emission factors from collected data sets for all types of on-site sanitation infrastructure. Specifically, this assessment focused on the three different service levels of sanitation (i.e., improved, unimproved and no service) as defined by UNICEF and WHO as they pertain to three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. This analysis considered the 100-year global warming potential values in carbon dioxide equivalents of methane and nitrous oxide that can be emitted for each scenario and decentralized sanitation technology. Ultimately, six scenarios were developed for various combinations of pathways and sanitation technologies. There was significant variability between the scenarios, with results ranging from 68 Tg CO2eq/year to 7 TgCO2eq/year. The main contributors of GHG emissions in each scenario were demonstrated to be septic tank systems and pit latrines, although in scenarios that utilized improved emission factors (EFs) these emissions were significantly reduced compared with those using only standard IPCC EFs. This analysis demonstrated that using improved EFs reduced estimated GHG emissions within each SSP scenario by 53% on average. The results indicate that achieving SDG sanitation targets will ultimately increase GHG emissions from the current state but with a relatively small impact on total anthropogenic emissions. There is a need for the continued improvement and collection of field-based emission estimations to refine coarse scale emissions models as well as a better characterization of relevant biodegradation mechanisms in popular forms of on-site sanitation systems. An increase in the understanding of sanitation and climate change linkages among stakeholders will ultimately lead to a better inclusion of sanitation, and other basic human rights, in climate action goals. © 2021 by the authors.

Understanding and quantifying the sources (and sinks) of atmospheric methane is integral for climate change mitigation and emission reduction strategies, such as those outlined in the 2015 UN Paris Agreement on Climate Change. There are ongoing international efforts to constrain the global methane budget, using a wide variety of measurement platforms across a range of spatial and temporal scales. The advancements in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology over the past decade have opened up a new avenue for methane emission quantification. UAVs can be uniquely equipped to monitor natural and anthropogenic emissions at local scales, displaying clear advantages in versatility and manoeuvrability relative to other platforms. Their use is not without challenge, however: further miniaturization of high-performance methane instrumentation is needed to fully use the benefits UAVs afford. Developments in the models used to simulate atmospheric transport and dispersion across small, local scales are also crucial to improved flux accuracy and precision. This paper aims to provide an overview of currently available UAV-based technologies and sampling methodologies which can be used to quantify methane emission fluxes at local scales.

This study uses modelled ozone flux values (POD3IAM; phytotoxic ozone dose above 3 nmol m−2 s−1, parameterised for integrated assessment modelling) for 2015, together with species-specific flux-effect relationships, spatial data on production and growing season dates to quantify the impact of ozone on the production of common wheat (Triticum aestivum) and common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). A case study for South Africa was also done using detailed data per province. Results suggest that ozone pollution could decrease wheat yield by between 2 and 13%, with a total annual loss of 453,000 t across SSA. The impact on bean production depended on the season; however, estimated yield losses were up to 21% in some areas of SSA, with an annual loss of ~300,000 t for each of the two main growing seasons. Production losses tended to be greater in countries with the highest production, for example, Ethiopia (wheat) and Tanzania (beans). This study provides an indication of the location of areas at high risk of crop losses due to ozone. Results emphasise that efforts to reduce ozone precursors could contribute to reducing the yield gap in SSA.

Using quantile-on-quantile regressions, this research examines the relationship between disaggregated sources of renewable energy (biomass, biofuel, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar, wind, wood, and waste) and CO2 emissions in the USA during the period from 1995 to 2017. Our findings support the deployment of various types of renewables in combating CO2 emissions for each quantile. In particular, a negative effect of renewable energy consumption on CO2 emissions is observed for the lower quantiles in almost all types of renewables. The effect of all the renewable energy sources taken together is significant for the lower and upper quantiles of the provisional distribution of CO2 emissions. The effect of renewable energy becomes stronger and more significant in the middle quantiles, where a pronounced causal effect of return and volatility is detected for the lower and upper middle quantiles. At the same time, heterogeneity in the findings across various types of renewable energy sources reveals differences in the relative importance of each type within the energy sector taken as a whole. Future US initiatives in renewable energy deployment at both the federal and the state levels should take into consideration the relative importance of each type, so as to maximize the efficacy of renewable energy policies in combating CO2 emissions. © 2021, Crown.","CO2 emissions; Energy deployment; Quantile regressions; Renewables","alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy efficiency; energy policy; fossil fuel; United States; biofuel; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; biomass; economic development; policy; renewable energy; Biofuels; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Fossil Fuels; Policy; Renewable Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107499979

Unlike past studies, this study investigates the combined influence of energy prices and non-linear fiscal decentralization on carbon emissions in the presence of institutional quality and gross domestic product in the model. It employed advanced econometric panel techniques on data from 1990 to 2018 for the top seven fiscally decentralized Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations, including Spain, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Australia, and Canada. The main outcomes are as follows: first, a cointegrating equilibrium link is existent among the study variables. Second, the linear term of fiscal decentralization promotes carbon emissions, while the non-linear term mitigates it. It verified the inverted U-shaped curve between fiscal decentralization and carbon emissions. Third, increasing energy prices for non-renewable energy decrease carbon emission due to a substitution effect. Among other explanatory variables, improvement in the quality of institutions decreases carbon emissions, while the gross domestic product increases it. These findings suggest strengthening fiscal decentralization, lowering non-renewable energy prices, and improving institutional quality to check the deteriorating environmental quality in the study sample and other worldwide regions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Combined influence; Energy prices; Fiscal decentralization; Institutional quality; Non-linear effect","Costs; International cooperation; Sustainable development; Carbon emissions; Combined influence; Decentralisation; Energy prices; Environmental quality; Fiscal decentralization; Gross domestic products; Institutional qualities; Non linear; Nonlinear effect; Carbon; carbon emission; decentralization; econometrics; energy market; environmental economics; environmental management; environmental quality; fiscal reform; mitigation; OECD; sustainability; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; tracking; Australia; Austria; Belgium; Canada; Germany; Spain; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109489618

This study aims to recycle plastic waste by manufacturing wood-plastic composites and to improve its mechanical properties by using additives, coupling agents, and lubricants. These composites are prepared by mixing 40–70% of wood flour with 20–25% of a polymer matrix. Wood was degraded at 220◦C, and then the composites were processed at 50◦C. The manufacturing process carried out in the study involved wood waste meshing, drying, shredding, drying, trimming, filling, blending, compounding, and extrusion moulding. The compounding of composites was accomplished in twin-screw extruders. Once the mixture was uniformly mixed, its final shape was given by a two-step extrusion moulding. Previously, researchers aimed at enhancing the mechanical properties of the composites, but our research focus was to improve their durability for different industrial applications. The results suggest that the impact strength is 17 MPa with 50% of wood powder ratio while the maximum value for the tensile strength is 32.5 MPa. About 50% of an increase in wood powder resulted in 8.1% bending strength increase from 26.1 to 32.8 MPa. Reducing the plastic matrix and the wood-particles water swelling ratio resulted in better mechanical properties. The wood species also affected the mechanical properties with their excellent dimensional stability and less variability. A high proportion of wood fibre tends to increase its steady-state torque and viscosity. The mechanical properties against different wood-flour proportions indicate that composite materials exhibit superior water swelling behaviour and extrusion quality. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, the significant risk analysis of climate changes is essential for planning urban cities’ support systems. In earlier, most of the recent literature mainly focused on the effect of global variation but failed to validate the risk level of climate variation on an urban scale. Thus, the risk analysis of climate change in urban systems has tended to become highly challenging. For this reason, this article creates a potential literature review on the urban planning support system under climate change risk analysis. The review of this article is classified into different categories of investigations such as the landscape as well as urban planning, formation methods, adaptation methods, urban policies, and performance analysis towards the urban system risk calculation. The performance analysis of urban support system strategies is investigated and compared for validation in terms of resilience, reliability, sustainability, and vulnerability. On this basis, the investigation summarizes the efficient research developments and discusses the main problem to be overcome for the climate change impact in the urban planning system. From this, future guidelines can afford to the modern numerical estimation of urban system climatic variation risk, which is emphasized with the novel enhancing methodologies for climatic variation influence on urban and exploring finest process to the climate risk facility in urban cities. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Climate change; Mitigation; Policies; Strategies adaptation; Urban planning","climate change; detection method; global climate; sustainability; urban agriculture; urban area; urban planning; urban policy; vulnerability",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117468291

However, reduction in both substrate uptake rate and metabolic activity in the production phase are an underlying problem for upscaling. Here, we used CRISPR interference to repress growth in lactate-producing Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Carbon partitioning to lactate in the production phase exceeded 90%, but CO2 uptake was severely reduced compared to uptake during the growth phase. We characterized strains during the onset of growth arrest using transcriptomics and proteomics. Multiple genes involved in ATP homeostasis were regulated once growth was inhibited, which suggests an alteration of energy charge that may lead to reduced substrate uptake. In order to overcome the reduced metabolic activity and take advantage of increased carbon partitioning, we tested a novel production strategy that involved alternating growth arrest and recovery by periodic addition of an inducer molecule to activate CRISPRi. Using this strategy, we maintained lactate biosynthesis in Synechocystis for 30 days in a constant light turbidostat cultivation. Cumulative lactate titers were also increased by 100% compared to a constant growth-arrest regime, and reached 1 g/L. Further, the cultivation produced lactate for 30 days, compared to 20 days for the non-growth arrest cultivation. Periodic growth arrest could be applicable for other products, and in cyanobacteria, could be linked to internal circadian rhythms that persist in constant light. © 2021","Cyanobacteria; Stress response; Synthetic biology; Two-stage production","Biochemistry; Carbon; Metabolic engineering; Metabolism; Molecular biology; Substrates; Carbon partitioning; Cyanobacterium; Growth arrest; Growth phase; Growth phasis; Production phase; Stresses response; Substrate uptake; Synthetic biology; Two-stage production; Synthetic biology; 2 oxoglutaric acid; adenosine triphosphate; arginine; aspartic acid; carbon; carbon dioxide; chlorophyll a; citrate synthase; glutamic acid; glycogen; heat shock protein 17; lactic acid; nitrogen; phosphoenolpyruvate; phycocyanin; proteome; small heat shock protein; transcriptome; unclassified drug; Article; bacterial growth; bacterium culture; biomass; biosynthesis; carbon partitioning; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; comparative study; controlled study; glycogen analysis; growth curve; growth disorder; homeostasis; hydrolysis; light intensity; nonhuman; oscillation; physical chemistry; physiological stress; promoter region; protein synthesis; proteomics; RNA sequencing; stoichiometry; supernatant; Synechocystis sp.

In response to China's blue skies protection campaign, effective NH3 reduction measures need to consider both mitigation efficiency and food security. In this context, we conducted a meta-analysis (including 2980 observations from 447 studies) to select effective measures based on absolute (AV) and yield-scaled (YSAV) NH3 volatilization reduction potential, with the aim of establishing a comprehensive NH3 mitigation framework covering various crop production sectors, and offering a range of potential solutions. The results showed that manipulating crop density, using an intermittent irrigation regime for paddy field rice, applying N as split applications or partially substituting inorganic fertilizer N with organic N sources could achieve reductions in AV and YSAV reduction of 10–20 %; adopting drip irrigation regimes, adding water surface barrier films to paddy fields, or using double inhibitor (urease and nitrification), slow-release or biofertilizers could achieve 20–40 % mitigation; plastic film mulching, applying fertilizer by irrigation or using controlled-release fertilizers could yield 40–60 % reduction; use of a urease inhibitor, fully substituting fertilizer N with organic N, or applying fertilizer by deep placement could decrease AV and YSAV by over 60 %. In addition, use of soil amendments, applying suitable inorganic N sources, or adopting crop rotation, intercropping or a rice-fish production model all had significant benefits to control AV. The adoption of any particular strategy should consider local accessibility and affordability, direct intervention by local/government authorities and demonstration to encourage the uptake of technologies and practices, particularly in NH3 pollution hotspot areas. Together, this could ensure food security and environmental sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Enhanced-efficiency fertilizer; Mitigation options; NH3 volatilization","Ammonia; Crops; Cultivation; Environmental technology; Fertilizers; Food supply; Irrigation; Soils; Sustainable development; % reductions; Enhanced-efficiency fertilizer; Food security; Irrigation regimes; Mitigation options; NH$-3$; NH3 volatilization; Organics; Paddy fields; Systems management; Efficiency; ammonia; crop production; mitigation; soil emission; volatilization; China; ammonia; fertilizer; nitrogen; agriculture; animal; China; meta analysis; Oryza; soil; Agriculture; Ammonia; Animals; China; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Oryza; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111528315

Energy efficiency measures (EEMs) have been identified as the best strategy to reduce air pollution and maximize social benefits. However, their adoption has been slow. The objective of this article is to investigate household preferences for financial incentives needed to promote private investments in EEMs in Central-Southern Chilean households and study the role of energy savings and the uncertainty about potential savings in the investment decision, with the aim of finding solutions to increase the adoption of these technologies. We use a choice experiment to explore the trade-off between the investment costs, financial instruments, energy savings, and the uncertainty about achieving the theoretical savings provided by engineering and architectural models. The results show that financial instruments play the most important role in this decision, followed by the savings achieved by the retrofit. Householders prefer to finance their investments with a mix of their personal resources and medium-term credits, trying to avoid long-term commitments. Although uncertainty was found to be a significant variable, it seems to play a small role in the investment decision. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Chile; Choice experiments; Energy efficiency; Energy savings; Financial instruments; Retrofits; Uncertainty","Cost engineering; Economic and social effects; Heating; Investments; Pollution; Retrofitting; Chile; Choice experiments; Efficiency measure; Energy savings; Energy transitions; Energy-savings; Financial instrument; Investment decisions; Quality of life; Uncertainty; Energy efficiency; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy use; experimental study; finance; household energy; incentive; investment; strategic approach; trade-off; uncertainty analysis; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118182956

To fill this gap, we propose a novel method that combines several sources of information (stratigraphic data, hydrodynamic modelling and atmospheric modelling), to identify the sources and fates of Hg emitted from coal-fired power plants. The stratigraphic record from Lake Macquarie (Australia) shows that mercury deposition increased up to 7-times since the 1950s, which is when coal-fired power plants were commissioned in the catchment. The stratigraphy also shows a decrease in Hg deposition with power plant retrofits. Using results from multiple models (statistical modelling, hydrodynamic modelling, particle density modelling and atmospheric emissions modelling), we found that ash dams contribute little Hg to Lake Macquarie. Instead, most of the Hg contamination in the lake is a result of atmospheric emissions from the power plants, and these power plants are also depositing Hg in the urban areas to the west of the lake. Our results demonstrate that the multi-proxy approach demonstrated in the paper can be used to provide clues as to the source of Hg, so that appropriate mitigation strategies and regulatory frameworks can be implemented. © 2021","Bituminous coal; CAPULFF; Hunter valley; Hydrological model; Iron; Power plants","Bituminous coal; Catchments; Coal fueled furnaces; Deposition; Hydrodynamics; Lakes; Mining; Stratigraphy; Atmospheric emission; Atmospheric model; Australia; CAPULFF; Coal-fired power plant; Hunter valley; Hydrodynamic modeling; Hydrological models; Mercuries (Hg); Power; Fossil fuel power plants; iron; mercury; organic matter; coal; mercury; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; bituminous coal; catchment; coal-fired power plant; emission; environmental fate; hydrodynamics; hydrological modeling; iron; lake pollution; mercury (element); air pollution; air pollution control; Article; atmosphere; Australia; chronology; coal power; electric power plant; environmental impact; hydrodynamics; lake; model; sediment; statistical model; stratigraphy; trend study; urban area; air pollutant; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; hydrodynamics; Australia; Air Pollutants; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Hydrodynamics; Mercury; Power Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110080886

While their use continues to spread across the field of atmospheric chemistry, the air quality monitoring community, and for commercial and private use, challenges remain in ensuring data quality and comparability of calibration methods. This study introduces a seven-step methodology for the field calibration of low-cost sensor systems using reference instrumentation with user-friendly guidelines, open-access code, and a discussion of common barriers to such an approach. The methodology has been developed and is applicable for gas-phase pollutants, such as for the measurement of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) or ozone (O3). A full example of the application of this methodology to a case study in an urban environment using both multiple linear regression (MLR) and the random forest (RF) machine-learning technique is presented with relevant R code provided, including error estimation. In this case, we have applied it to the calibration of metal oxide gas-phase sensors (MOSs). Results reiterate previous findings that MLR and RF are similarly accurate, though with differing limitations. The methodology presented here goes a step further than most studies by including explicit transparent steps for addressing model selection, validation, and tuning, as well as addressing the common issues of autocorrelation and multicollinearity. We also highlight the need for standardized reporting of methods for data cleaning and flagging, model selection and tuning, and model metrics. In the absence of a standardized methodology for the calibration of low-cost sensor systems, we suggest a number of best practices for future studies using low-cost sensor systems to ensure greater comparability of research. ©",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; autocorrelation; calibration; data quality; instrumentation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119700327

Furthermore, we observe spin-dependent photon emission from unpolarized surface and bulk states at Γ¯. The size and sign of the spin asymmetry depends on experimental parameters such as the direction of the electron spin polarization and the photon detection angle.

Especially during heatwaves, street canyons are both producers and sufferers of air pollution and urban heat island (UHI) effects, with severe risks on public health. To better design mitigation measures, it is important to consider both the microclimate behaviors as well as the perceptions of the local population. Therefore, this study examined pedestrian perceptions and microclimate modelings to understand outdoor thermal comfort conditions and air pollution dispersion in the case study neighborhood of Dortmund Marten, Germany. A field survey with measurement points at two street canyons for climatic variables and questionnaires on subjective thermal comfort and air pollution was conducted on a hot day during the heatwave period in August 2020. As a cost-effective method for modeling input generation, we extracted spatial and spectral data like albedo, roof materials and tree locations out of remote sensing imageries. Finally, we compared the modeling results of the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) index, particulate matter concentrations and air temperatures with empirical field measurement data and the questionnaire responses. Results indicate that during hot summer days with light winds from the east, the north-south orientated street canyon with tree arrangements tends to act as a tunnel for particulate matter accumulation. Coincidently, pedestrians show less thermal discomfort than calculated PET values in that particular area during morning and daytime, which underlines the dichotomy of such places. On the other hand, the low rise east-west orientated street canyon shows higher PET votes than predicted by the model. However, particulate matter concentrations were considerably underestimated by the model, while air temperature predictions provided meaningful results. The proposed workflow shows the potential to accelerate future preparations of input data for microclimate modelings, while the results can enhance wind-sensitive planning procedures and heat stress resilience in mid-latitude urban neighborhoods. © 2021 The Authors","Air pollution; ENVI-met; Field measurements; Heatwaves; Outdoor thermal comfort; Urban planning","Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Cost effectiveness; Forestry; Health risks; Particles (particulate matter); Physiological models; Remote sensing; Surveys; Thermal pollution; Thermal stress; Trees (mathematics); Urban planning; Air temperature; ENVI-met; Field measurement; Heat stress; Heat waves; Outdoor thermal comfort; Particulate Matter; Physiological equivalent temperatures; Street canyon; Thermal; Thermal comfort; air quality; air temperature; atmospheric pollution; computer simulation; concentration (composition); health risk; heat island; heat wave; microclimate; particulate matter; pedestrian; remote sensing; street canyon; urban planning; urban society; air pollution; air quality; air temperature; article; city planning; comfort; field study; Germany; heat stress; heat wave; human; human experiment; imagery; latitude; Martes; microclimate; neighborhood; nonhuman; particulate matter; pedestrian; perception; prediction; questionnaire; remote sensing; simulation; spectroscopy; summer; workflow; city; heat; heat shock response; microclimate; perception; remote sensing; Dortmund; Germany; North Rhine-Westphalia; Martes; Air Pollution; Cities; Heat-Shock Response; Hot Temperature; Humans; Microclimate; Pedestrians; Perception; Remote Sensing Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109173514

Especially, the current surge of individual car use is worrying and the question remains which users might be able and willing to substitute public transport by cycling. This effect is interesting to study for the case of Hanover Region, because of the well-developed biking infrastructure that makes biking a viable alternative to individual car use. In this paper, we analyze survey data from June 2020 on the use of transportation modes before and during the pandemic in the Hanover Region. We ask if and how the over 4.000 participants substitute public transport and what characterizes those who chose biking over individual car use. We use multivariate regression models and find evidence that Stadtbahn (local light rail) and bus are substituted by bike, car and working from home, while train use is not significantly replaced by car and seems to be positively related to bike use. The data also shows that women have a higher level of fear of infection than men have during public transport use and therefore reduce public transport use more. Moreover, income displays a positive effect on increased car use while cycling is independent of socio-economic indicators but instead driven by the eco-consciousness of users. Surprisingly, we find that car use was increased in particular by residents of Hanover city, while it was decreased by residents of less densely populated urban areas in the region. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Covid 19; Public transport; Spatial embeddedness; Substitutability; Transport disruption; Travel behavior","Automobiles; Economic analysis; Regression analysis; Car use; Covid 19; Embeddedness; Pollution emissions; Public transport; Spatial embeddedness; Substitutability; Transport disruption; Transport sectors; Travel behaviour; Bicycles; bus transport; car use; COVID-19; cycle transport; public transport; railway transport; regression analysis; spatial analysis; travel behavior; Germany; Hannover; Lower Saxony",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115634620

In this way, we ask if triggering ""Anthropocenes""of the kind humanity is experiencing might be a generic feature of planet-civilization evolution. This question has direct consequences for both the study of astrobiology and the sustainability of human civilization. Furthermore, if Anthropocenes prove fatal for some civilizations then they can be considered as one form of a ""Great Filter""and are therefore relevant to discussions of the Fermi Paradox. In this study, we focus on the effects of energy harvesting via combustion and vary the planet's initial chemistry and orbital radius. We find that in this context, the most influential parameter dictating a civilization's fate is their host planet's climate sensitivity, which quantifies how global temperatures change as CO2 is added to the atmosphere. Furthermore, this is in itself a function of the planet's atmospheric CO2 level, so planets with low levels of CO2 will have high climate sensitivities and high probabilities of triggering climate change. Using simulations of the coupled nonlinear model combined with semi-analytic treatments, we find that most planets in our initial parameter space experience diminished growth due to climate effects, an event we call a ""climate-dominated Anthropocene."" © 2021.

Nonetheless, criteria to select the most suitable plant communities for agroecosystems diversification facing contrasting environmental constraints need to be refined. Here, we compared the impacts of 24 different plant communities on soil fertility across six tropical agroecosystems: either on highly weathered Ferralsols, with strong P limitation, or on partially weathered soils derived from volcanic material, with major N limitation. In each agroecosystem, we tested several plant communities for diversification, as compared to a matching low diversity management for their cropping system. Plant residue restitution, N, P and lignin contents were measured for each plant community. In parallel, the soil under each community was analyzed for organic C and N, inorganic N, Olsen P, soil pH and nematode community composition. Soil potential fertility was assessed with plant bioassays under greenhouse controlled climatic conditions. Overall, plant diversification had a positive effect on soil fertility across all sites, with contrasting effects depending on soil type and legumes presence in the community. Communities with legumes improved soil fertility indicators of volcanic soils, which was demonstrated through significantly higher plant biomass production in the bioassays (+18%) and soil inorganic N (+26%) compared to the low diversity management. Contrastingly, communities without legumes were the most beneficial in Ferralsols, with increases in plant biomass production in the bioassays (+39%), soil Olsen P (+46%), soil C (+26%), and pH (+5%). Piecewise structural equation models with Shipley's test revealed that plant diversification impacts on volcanic soil fertility were related to soil N availability, driven by litter N. Meanwhile, Ferralsols fertility was related to soil P availability, driven by litter P. These findings underline the importance of multifactorial and multi-sites experiments to inform trait-based frameworks used in designing optimal plant diversification in agroecological systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","C-N-P cycling; Functional traits; Legumes; Nematodes; Plant diversification; Tropical soils","Biomass; Ecosystems; Sustainable development; Tropics; Volcanoes; Agro-ecosystems; C-N-P cycling; Ferralsol; Functional traits; Legume; Nematode; Plant communities; Plant diversification; Soil fertility; Tropical soils; Soils; agricultural ecosystem; agroforestry; carbon cycle; crop rotation; functional response; legume; nematode; nitrogen cycle; phosphorus cycle; soil fertility; soil type; sustainability; Biomass; Diversification; Ecosystems; Fertility; Legumes; Plants; Soil; Tropics; Embryophyta; Fabaceae; Nematoda; animal; biomass; Fabaceae; microbiology; nematode; soil; Animals; Biomass; Fabaceae; Nematoda; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110001151

This research attempts to revisit the relationship between income and anthropogenic emissions in the context of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) theory by considering electric power consumption, urbanization, and democratic accountability index in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. It employs annual frequency panel data from 1990 through 2019 and three alternative advanced econometric estimation techniques. The main findings are as follows: Firstly, the EKC results for the whole sample strongly support the proposition of an inverse U-shaped connection between anthropogenic emissions and affluence in the long run. Secondly, the country-specific results confirm EKC only in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, while the remaining countries demonstrate a U-shaped connection. Thirdly, the democratic accountability promoted anthropogenic emissions implying that it failed to contribute to environmental protection. It means that democratic setup in the GCC region performs poorly in accomplishing climate change mitigation and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Fourthly, electric power consumption and urbanization impart positive and negative impacts on anthropogenic emission, respectively. These findings are found robust across the fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), bias-corrected LSDV (least squares dummy variable) (LSDV), and pooled mean group (PMG) estimators. Finally, Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality shows that (i) income and urbanization establish a two-way causality with the anthropogenic emissions. (ii) However, a unidirectional causal connection is revealed from electric power consumption and democratic accountability index to anthropogenic emissions. The findings suggest that the GCC region should prioritize environmental protection and SDGs across the political aims’ recipe since it would direct the region on the path of climate change mitigation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Democratic accountability index; Electric power consumption; Environmental Kuznets curve; Gulf Cooperation Council; Sustainable Development Goals; Urbanization","anthropogenic source; climate change; cross section; electrical power; environmental protection; environmental quality; heterogeneity; Kuznets curve; urbanization; Bahrain; Saudi Arabia; carbon dioxide; democracy; economic development; income; urbanization; Carbon Dioxide; Democracy; Economic Development; Income; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109296742

Changes in rainfall patterns and fluctuations in temperatures cause a greater frequency of extreme events, increased pests, and crop diseases, which even lead to food insecurity in communities that depend on self-production for survival. This is why strategies need to be developed to face this new scenario. Two cases of adaptation experiences to the effects of climate variability in rural communities in Chile (Araucanía Region) and Colombia (Cauca Department) were analyzed on this paper. For this, a mixed methodological approach was adopted that included the analysis of climate data, socioeconomic, and productive characterization of the communities, and a characterization of adaptation practices for both cases. The results show various ways of adapting mainly to changes in the availability and access of water for the development of agriculture and for domestic use. Likewise, it is shown that in order to be successful, the measures for facing climate variability must be part of coordinated strategies under a community-based adaptation approach and not developed in isolation. © 2021 by the authors.

These changes can affect tropical forest structure, dynamics and diversity. While numerous studies have focused on diversity metrics, other aspects of forest function, such as long-term biomass dynamics, are often less considered. We evaluated plant community structure change (i.e., abundance, diversity, composition, and aboveground biomass) in a 2.25 ha forest dynamics plot located within a ~ 365 ha reserve in southern Costa Rica. We censused, mapped and identified to species all plants ≥ 5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) in three surveys spanning 2010–2020. While there were no changes in late-successional species diversity, there were marked changes in overall species composition and biomass. Abundance of large (≥ 40 cm DBH) old-growth dense-wooded trees (e.g., Lauraceae, Rosaceae) decreased dramatically (27%), leading to major biomass decline over time, possibly driven by recent and recurrent drought events. Gaps created by large trees were colonized by early-successional species, but these recruits did not make up for the biomass lost. Finally, stem abundance increased by 20%, driven by increasing dominance of Hampea appendiculata. While results suggest this reserve may effectively conserve overall plant diversity, this may mask other key shifts such as large aboveground biomass loss. If this pattern is pervasive across tropical forest reserves, it could hamper efforts to preserve forest structure and ecosystem services (e.g., carbon storage). Monitoring programs could better assess carbon trends in reserves over time simply by tracking large tree dynamics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Gap dynamics; Pioneer species; Tree turnover; Wood density","aboveground biomass; abundance; community structure; diameter; ecology; ecosystem; plant community; Costa Rica; Hampea appendiculata; Lauraceae; Rosaceae; biomass; ecosystem; forest; human; tree; tropic climate; Biomass; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans; Trees; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116511728

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that lifestyle changes are now necessary to stay within the limit. We reviewed a range of NDCs and national climate change strategies to identify inclusion of low-carbon lifestyles. We found that most NDCs and national climate change strategies do not yet include the full range of necessary mitigation measures targeting lifestyle change, particularly those that could reduce indirect emissions. Some exceptional NDCs, such as those of Austria, Slovakia, Portugal and the Netherlands, do include lifestyle changes, such as low-carbon diets, reduced material consumption, and low-carbon mobility. Most countries focus on supply-side measures with long lag times and might miss the window of opportunity to shape low-carbon lifestyle patterns, particularly those at early stages of development trajectories. Systemic barriers exist that should be corrected before new NDCs are released, including changing the accounting and reporting methodology, accounting for extraterritorial emissions, providing guidance on NDC scope to include the menu of options identified by the IPCC, and increasing support for national level studies to design demand-side policies. © 2021 by the authors.

This is the first study to investigate the relationship between economic growth and energy consumption at the state level for the U.S. from 2000 to 2016. As opposed to country-level studies, a focus on states within a country allows for comparisons across more homogeneous entities. The four known hypotheses are tested: growth, conservative, feedback, and neutral, differentiating between renewable and non-renewable energy consumption. In order to address endogeneity, two strategies are developed: (1) a static analysis for 2016 where key policy covariates are gradually added to the model, and (2) a dynamic analysis using different generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators. The model is augmented using socioeconomic, regulatory and climatic variables, which allows for the evaluation of policies while facilitating a transition to renewable energy use.

Different virtual campus scenarios are developed: online classes only, working-from-home only, and a hybrid of both. In the case of AEVs, alternative penetration rates for levels 2 and 5 are considered. A total of 50 scenarios are tested using a sub-area transport simulation model for UBCO, which is extracted from the regional travel demand forecasting model. The results suggest that a 40% AEV penetration rate coupled with fully in-person classes reduces GHG by ~36% compared to the 2018-level, which will help UBCO to achieve their 2030 emission reduction target and be aligned with the provincial target. The 50% AEV and 10% hybrid virtual campus reduces emissions by ~48%, which is aligned with the 2040 provincial target. A fully virtual campus will help to reach the 2050 provincial target by reducing GHG by ~76%. The results further demonstrate that level 5 AEVs produce lesser emissions than level 2 at a lower AEV penetration rate for the fully in-person campus scenario. At higher penetration rates, level 5 performs better only if it is coupled with 10% of students, faculties and staffs attending virtual campus scenario. © 2021 by the authors.

To this aim, scientific evidence and multidimensional feasibility analysis have been employed for making the narrative around hydrogen clear in public and policy discourse so that choices towards acceleration of efforts can begin for paving the way for the future hydrogen economy and society. This can come from natural gas and petroleum-related skills, technologies, experience, and infrastructure.

In 2015, the first fully electric ferry, the MF Ampere, started operating in Western Norway. Since then, 60 electric or hybrid-electric ferries are in operation or scheduled to be by the end of 2021. With a few exceptions the literature on energy transitions sees transitions as disjointed and slow. Through this case study—based on 13 semi-structured interviews, two focus groups, as well as seminars, conferences and workshops with industry experts, public sector stakeholders, and project managers—we show how the Norwegian ferry case is an example showing that, under the right circumstances, energy transitions can however be politically accelerated, even in what is widely deemed a hard-to-decarbonize sector. This is one of the first attempts at analyzing the politics of accelerated transitions within the maritime sector. It is also one of few studies of the electrification of ferries, and at the end of which we suggest a set of success criteria for accelerated transitions. We propose four main explanatory factors: First, what we label the Norwegian ferry innovation system was instrumental in providing an environment conducive to electrification. Second, the Norwegian state acted entrepreneurially, by moving beyond merely being a de-risker through playing an active role in market creation and transformation through public agencies and support schemes. Third and fourth, we argue that the relative lack of strong opposing vested interests combined with an oil shock to create favorable conditions for structural change. © 2021 The Authors","Accelerated transitions; Climate policy; Electric ferries; Maritime sector",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114673838

The importance of electron-deficient (n-type) conjugates, however, has inspired a number of strategies for suppressing the emission-quenching effects of the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group. Here, we demonstrate how such strategies yield fluorescent nitroaryl derivatives of dipyrrolonaphthyridinedione (DPND). Nitro groups near the DPND core quench its fluorescence. Conversely, nitro groups placed farther from the core allow some of the highest fluorescence quantum yields ever recorded for nitroaromatics. This strategy of preventing the known processes that compete with photoemission, however, leads to the emergence of unprecedented alternative mechanisms for fluorescence quenching, involving transitions to dark nπ* singlet states and aborted photochemistry. Forming nπ* triplet states from ππ* singlets is a classical pathway for fluorescence quenching. In nitro-DPNDs, however, these ππ* and nπ* excited states are both singlets, and they are common for nitroaryl conjugates. Understanding the excited-state dynamics of such nitroaromatics is crucial for designing strongly fluorescent electron-deficient conjugates. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Electrons; Fluorescence quenching; Electron-deficient; Electronwithdrawing; Emission quenching; Fluorescence quantum yield; Fluorescence quenching; Nitro group; Nitro-aromatics; Quenching effect; Singlet state; Triplet state; Excited states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118168698

To address this gap, a new procedure has been developed with a five-step optimization process relevant to examining urban forms with buildings density constraints, window-to-wall ratio, incident solar radiation and energy production potential in façades. Factors analyzed include floor space intensity (FSI), building height (H), spatial daylight autonomy (sDA), annual sun exposure (ASE) and the effect of façade tilt angles on efficiency targets in cold climates. A myriad of parametric functions has been incorporated in the process through Grasshopper, DIVA, ArchSIM, and evolutionary algorithms in Galapagos. The study revealed effective results of energy production across prominent façade design options. Increasing FSI was found to decrease sDA, for a fixed H. In contrast, increasing H for a fixed FSI decreased sDA with an insignificant magnitude of 4%. The ratio of increase in glazing to increase in sDA was in the order of 1:1.47. Overall, the findings showed novelty in optimizing each façade panel to achieve best performance demonstrated by different urban densities with low/mid/high-rise building conditions. Energy production reached 13 kWh/m2 with integrated photovoltaics, as a renewable source. High-rise buildings showed the best conceivable energy improvement as opposed to other height conditions.

Additionally, a comparison study of carbon ions versus protons is performed considering current best solutions in commercial TPS. Methods: All treatment plans were optimized and calculated using the RayStation TPS (RaySearch, Sweden). The dose distributions calculated with the TPS were compared with measurements using a 24-pinpoint ionization chamber array (T31015, PTW, Germany). Tissue-like inhomogeneities (bone, lung, and soft tissue) were embedded in water, while a target volume of 4 x 4 x 4 cm3 was defined at two different depths behind the heterogeneities. In total, 10 different test cases, with and without range shifter as well as different air gaps, were investigated. Dose distributions inside as well as behind the target volume were evaluated. Results: Inside the target volume, the mean dose difference between calculations and measurements, averaged over all test cases, was 1.6% for carbon ions. This compares well to the final agreement of 1.5% obtained in water at the commissioning stage of the TPS for carbon ions and is also within the clinically acceptable interval of 3%. The mean dose difference and maximal dose difference obtained outside the target area were 1.8% and 13.4%, respectively. The agreement of dose distributions for carbon ions in the target volumes was comparable or better to that between Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations and measurements for protons. Percentage dose differences of more than 10% were present outside the target area behind bone–lung structures, where the carbon ion calculations systematically over predicted the dose. MC dose calculations for protons were superior to carbon ion beams outside the target volumes. Conclusion: The pencil beam dose calculations for carbon ions in RayStation were found to be in good agreement with dosimetric measurements in heterogeneous geometries for points of interest located within the target. Large local discrepancies behind the target may contribute to incorrect dose predictions for organs at risk. © 2021 The Authors.

The Southern Ocean is a region where these feedbacks can be largest and differ most among Earth system model projections of twenty-first-century climate change. To improve our mechanistic understanding of these feedbacks, we develop an automated procedure that tracks changes in the positions of Southern Ocean water masses and their carbon uptake. In an idealized ensemble of climate change projections, we diagnose two carbon–concentration feedbacks driven by atmospheric CO2 (due to increasing air–sea CO2 partial pressure difference, dpCO2, and reducing carbonate buffering capacity) and two carbon–climate feedbacks driven by climate change (due to changes in the water mass surface outcrop areas and local climate impacts). Collectively these feedbacks increase the CO2 uptake by the Southern Ocean and account for almost one-fourth of the global uptake of CO2 emissions. The increase in CO2 uptake is primarily dpCO2 driven, with Antarctic Intermediate Waters making the largest contribution; the remaining three feedbacks partially offset this increase (by ~25%), with maximum reductions in Subantarctic Mode Waters. The process dominating the decrease in CO2 uptake is water mass dependent: reduction in carbonate buffering capacity in Subtropical and Subantarctic Mode Waters, local climate impacts in Antarctic Intermediate Waters, and reduction in outcrop areas in Circumpolar Deep Waters and Antarctic Bottom Waters. Intermodel variability in the feedbacks is predominately dpCO2 driven and should be a focus of efforts to constrain projection uncertainty. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.","Carbon cycle; Model comparison; Southern Ocean","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Earth (planet); Earth system models; Reservoirs (water); % reductions; Atmospheric CO 2; Carbon cycles; Climate system; CO 2 emission; CO 2 uptake; Earth system modeling; Models comparisons; Southern ocean; Water mass; Oceanography; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric chemistry; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; climate feedback; comparative study; emission inventory; intermediate water; mode water; model test; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117840596

However, land-use change, resource extraction and changing climates are threatening peatlands globally. Restoring degraded peatlands requires re-establishing the key features that drive these ecosystems – the hydrological conditions, chemical properties and characteristic biota. Using the best-available evidence to identify management interventions that will effectively abate threats and restore ecological processes can help facilitate successful conservation. ‘Rapid evidence reviews’ have emerged in healthcare as a method of delivering key research findings to policymakers and decision-makers in a timely manner. Here, we used a rapid review approach to identify, appraise and synthesise scientific evidence on the effectiveness of conservation interventions intended to restore the hydrological conditions, chemical properties and/or characteristic biota of degraded boreal, montane, alpine and temperate peatlands globally. We found that there is consistent evidence that rewetting, shading or mulching, reprofiling, mowing, controlling grazers and active revegetation can improve the condition of degraded peatlands. Taking a whole-system approach was reported as essential to successful conservation because the hydrological conditions, chemical properties and biota are intrinsically linked. There is consistent evidence that restoring peatlands can enhance the ecosystem service of carbon storage. We demonstrate that applying the rapid review approach to a conservation problem: 1) proved efficient for synthesising evidence from 453 individual studies collected through 23 reviews, and 2) yielded a valuable synthesis of the common interventions to support effective, evidence-based conservation and recovery of peatlands globally. This can enable policymakers and practitioners to apply the best-available research knowledge when addressing this important challenge. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bog; Conceptual map; Conservation; Ecosystem management; Evidence synthesis; Evidence-based decision making; Fen; Restoration; Systematic review","biodiversity; climate change; conservation management; conservation status; ecosystem service; peatland; revegetation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116015521

This paper discusses environmental-driven solar compensation mechanisms, specifically designed for energy communities. Such mechanisms consider the adoption of Distributed Energy Resources by the communities and reflect their overall life cycle environmental benefit. Notably, an innovative three-steps iterative methodology is adopted to design new feed-in tariffs including: (i) the optimal economic sizing of solar technologies, (ii) the life cycle assessment and (iii) the evaluation of a solar compensation mechanism. In the last step, the emissions avoided by communities are converted into economic solar compensation mechanisms (via feed-in tariffs) using the current value of carbon taxes. After the general methodology description, the proposed approach is applied to a specific Italian case study. In case carbon taxes are set to the current value, namely 15.4 EUR/tonCO2eq, the yearly national emissions are mitigated by the adoption of the proposed solar compensation from 121.1 MtonCO2eq/yr to 108.2 MtonCO2eq/yr. Differently, if taxes are increased to 20 EUR/tonCO2eq, the emissions are reduced to 84.3 MtonCO2eq/yr; in case carbon taxes are extended over this value, the grid gets saturated by communities electricity and the additional environmental advantages are negligible. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Batteries; Incentives; Life cycle assessment; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energy communities","Carbon; Energy resources; Iterative methods; Life cycle; Solar cells; Taxation; Carbon taxes; Community IS; Compensation mechanism; Current values; Energy systems; Feed-in tariff; Incentive; Multiusers; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energy community; Photovoltaic cells; alternative energy; economic conditions; energy resource; environmental economics; life cycle analysis; pollution tax; solar power; spatiotemporal analysis; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110189162

The extent of heat stress for agricultural crops depends on the co-occurrence of heat periods and heat sensitive phenological stages. Using the Wang and Engel phenology model and the most recent climate change projections for four sites across the Swiss Central Plateau, we estimated future heat stress exposure in Swiss wheat production and tested the potential of winter wheat genotypes with differing phenological characteristics to escape future heat periods. Across all genotypes, heat stress days (Tmax ≥ 30 °C) during the temperature sensitive stages of flowering and early grain filling increased from an average of 1.5 heat days in 1982−2006 to 2.1 by 2075−2099 with RCP2.6 (with climate change mitigation) and to 3.6 by 2075−2099 with RCP8.5 (without climate change mitigation), respectively. Across all genotypes and locations, a considerable escape from future heat periods was modelled due to a mainly temperature-driven advancement in the phenological development. Under both RCP scenarios, we predicted lower exposure to heat stress for early varieties than for late varieties. However, under the RCP8.5 scenario, for each location, heat stress exposure for early varieties was still projected to be higher by 2075−2099 than for late varieties under current conditions. Further, heat stress exposure was considerably increased at locations with cooler spring conditions, slowing down the early season phenological development and resulting in late heading dates.

However, we know relatively little about how cushion plants regulate the diversity and composition of soil microbial communities, major drivers of soil processes and ecosystem functioning. Identifying what factors drive the diversity and composition of soil microbial communities in high-elevation ecosystems is also fundamental to predict how global changes will affect their conservation and the services and functions they provide. Thus, we sampled four sites along the southern Andes following the vegetation belt of Azorella cushion species. The field sites spread along a latitudinal gradient and had contrasting levels of aridity, UV-B radiation, mean temperature and soil properties. Overall, Azorella, as well as aridity and UV-B radiation, were the major drivers of the distribution, composition and diversity of soil microbial communities in the studied ecosystems of the Chilean Andes. UV-B radiation affected particularly soil fungi, while soil properties such as pH, total C and N content, essential predictors of microbial diversity globally, had a much lower effect on the composition of soil microbial communities. Understanding the factors driving the structure and composition of microbial communities, particularly the role of cushion plants and the feedbacks between plant, climate and soil is of uttermost importance for the preservation of the functionality of high-elevation ecosystems threatened by climate change. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Andes; Atacama; Chile; High mountains; Microbial network; Torres del Paine; UV-B","alpine environment; aridity; ecosystem function; ecosystem structure; evergreen tree; keystone species; latitudinal gradient; microbial community; soil ecosystem; soil microorganism; Andes; Atacama; Azorella",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102888710

Population growth, as well as the intensive use of water resources for industrial and agricultural activities, among others, have caused water stress in various regions of the world. Rural areas are usually more affected due to water scarcity and a lack of sanitary infrastructure. The current practices associated with urban water management have been considered inefficient to respond to these problems. In recent years, the reuse of greywater has emerged as a promising and sustainable alternative. Several pilot greywater treatment systems have been implemented in rural areas of different countries, however, studies about the environmental impacts of these decentralized systems under different scenarios are lacking. In this work, the life cycle assessment of greywater treatment systems considering several scenarios was studied. Our results showed that the decrease in environmental impacts due to the saving of drinking water is more evident when the water supply is carried out through cistern trucks. This occurs because the environmental impact of land transport of water is extremely high and represents over 89% of the global warming indicator [kg CO2 eq] and 96% ozone depletion [kg CFC-11 eq] contributions of the system. Greywater treatment systems with backwashing and solar panels as a source of energy have lower environmental impacts, reducing CO2 and CFC emissions by 50% for the maintenance phase and by 85% (CO2) and 47% (CFC) for the operation phase. Furthermore, the acquisition of solar panels was economically feasible, with a payback of 19.7 years. This analysis showed the environmental feasibility of small-scale greywater treatment systems in rural areas affected by water scarcity. Furthermore, the proposed approach has contributed to understand the impact of greywater treatment systems in rural areas, which could become a support tool to integrate greywater reuse practices in different communities. © 2018","Environmental impacts; Greywater reuse; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Rural areas; Water reuse; Water scarcity","Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Global warming; Life cycle; Population statistics; Potable water; Rural areas; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Wastewater reclamation; Water supply; Greywater reuse; Greywater treatment; Life cycle assessment; Population growth; Reuse management; Solar panels; Treatment systems; Water reuse; Water scarcity; Waters resources; Water conservation; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; recycling; rural area; wastewater treatment; water availability; water management; Indicator indicator; water; animal; life cycle stage; sewage; water management; water supply; Animals; Life Cycle Stages; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water; Water Purification; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110069455

This study has been performed for the city of Turin, where road transport represents one of the main primary emission sources. Air pollution data were evaluated by ADMS-Roads, the flow traffic data used for simulation come from a real-time monitoring. Instead, statistics on mortality and hospitalizations due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were collected from the regional health information system and the National Health Institute and implemented in the BenMap software to evaluate the health and economic impacts. In both cases, two scenarios to evaluate the annual benefits of reducing PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 were used: reduction to the levels gained by the assumptions of 2025 and 2030 Scenario and the PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations were considered for evaluating short-term and long-term effects. The analysis performed doesn't include background pollution levels, i.e. the concentrations percentage reductions are only related to the local contribution, therefore derived from the contribution only of traffic source. The results show that fleet electrification has a potential benefit for concentrations reduction in comparison to the base Scenario, especially related to NO2, less for PM10 and PM2.5. Regarding 2025 Scenario (4 % (passenger car) and 5 % (light-duty vehicles) electric vehicles), reductions of 52 % of NO2, 35 % of PM10 and 49 % of PM2.5 are observed. Meanwhile, as regards 2030 Scenario reductions of 87 % of NO2, 36 % of PM10 and 50 % of PM2.5 are reached. Also, in terms of social costs a decrease of 47 % for the 2025 Scenario and 66 % for the 2030 Scenario in comparison to the base Scenario is arise. © 2021","Air dispersion modelling; Air quality assessment; Cost of illness (COI); Electric vehicles; Mortality; Value of statistical life (VSL)","diesel fuel; fuel; gasoline; liquefied petroleum gas; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); electric vehicle; electrification; mortality; respiratory disease; road transport; urban area; air pollution; air quality; Article; cardiovascular disease; clinical evaluation; comparative study; concentration process; controlled study; cost of illness; economic aspect; electric vehicle; environmental health; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; exhaust gas; health impact assessment; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; Italy; medical information system; mortality; motor vehicle; PM10 exposure; PM2.5 exposure; premature mortality; respiratory tract disease; software; traffic; traffic pollution; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; particulate matter; Italy; Piedmont [Italy]; Torino [Piedmont]; Turin; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Italy; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111323612

Considering the uniqueness of the tourism sector in Bali and the mobility it generates, this study aims to investigate the factors that influence EV use by tourists based on several scenarios for estimating EV share target and the emission reduction contributed. For those purposes, the stated choice questionnaire was distributed online and offline to tourists in Bali and analyzed using the multinomial logit (MNL) model. While the study done during pandemic times, where the number of the tourist is significantly decreasing and the travel behavior influenced by mobility restriction imposed by the government, the data collection still covered mobility of both international and domestic tourist. The survey found that rental cost and accessibility, as well as the quality of charging stations are factors that affect EV use by tourists. Motorcycle parking cost was also found to influence EV use. These findings align with previous studies, and interventions such as fiscal incentives for rental companies and infrastructure development are suggested similar to EV incentives implemented in China, India, or the US. The development of the low emission zone (LEZ) is also proposed to manage parking fares similar to what was implemented in London, specifically to push the shift from internal combustion engine (ICE) to EV. Based on emission inventory calculation, 1.9 million kg of potential annual CO2 can be pre-vented with the implementation of these policies by the government. © 2021 by the authors.

First, a preoptimization procedure for the engine operation is proposed to address the challenge posed by the large number of engine control inputs. By exclud-ing infeasible and suboptimal operation offline, an engine model is developed that can be evaluated efficiently during online optimization. Next, dynamic programming is used to find the optimal trade-off between fuel consumption and tailpipe NOx emissions for various vehicle configurations and driving missions. Simulation results show that for a conventional vehicle equipped with VEC and gear optimization run on the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycle (WLTC), the fuel consumption can be reduced by 5.4% at equivalent NOx emissions. At equivalent fuel consumption, the NOx emissions can be reduced by 80%. For an HEV, the introduction of VEC, in addition to the optimization of the torque split and the gear selection, drastically extended the achievable trade-off between fuel consumption and tailpipe NOx emissions in simulations. Most notably, the region with very low NOx emissions could only be reached with VEC. © 2021 by the authors.

Technological approaches are insufficient to bring urban air quality to recommended target levels, and miss out on opportunities to promote health more holistically through behavioural solutions, such as active travel. Behaviour change is not straightforward, however, and is more likely to be achieved when communication campaigns are based on established theory and evidence-based practices. We systematically reviewed the academic literature on air pollution communication campaigns aimed at influencing air pollution-related behaviour. Based on these findings, we developed an evidence-based framework for stimulating behaviour change through engagement. Across the 37 studies selected for analyses, we identified 28 different behaviours assessed using a variety of designs including natural and research-manipulated experiments, cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys and focus groups. While avoidance behaviour (e.g. reducing outdoor activity) followed by contributing behaviours (e.g. reducing idling) were by far the most commonly studied, supporting behaviour (e.g. civil engagement) shows promising results, with the added benefit that supporting local and national policies may eventually lead to the removal of social and physical barriers that prevent wider behavioural changes. Providing a range of actionable information will reduce disengagement due to feelings of powerlessness. Targeted localized information will appear more immediate and engaging, and positive framing will prevent cognitive dissonance whereby people rationalize their behaviour to avoid living with feelings of unease. Communicating the co-benefits of action may persuade individuals with different drivers but as an effective solution, it remains to be explored. Generally, finding ways to connect with people’s emotions, including activating social norms and identities and creating a sense of collective responsibility, provide promising yet under-explored directions. Smartphones provide unique opportunities that enable flexible and targeted engagement, but care must be taken to avoid transferring responsibility for action from national and local authorities onto individuals.

[…] Introduction: […] Studies that have concentrated on carbon storage in urban soils mostly neglected the carbon that is stored in vegetation and vice versa (Edmondson et al. 2012, Velasco et al. 2016). In a recent study (Lindén et al. 2020), the Corg stocks in park soils and vegetation of Helsinki have been estimated in dependency of management practices, vegetation type and age. A very recent and comprehensive study by Klingenfuß et al. (2019a) quantified soil, grass, shrub and tree vegetation carbon pools for Berlin using a complementary methodological design to this research. […] Besides urban soils and the aboveground biomass, Berlin exhibits another carbon stock, which can be seen as the result of the city's geological past and climate conditions: peatlands. These peatlands represent a third major carbon reservoir that contributes to the carbon cycle (Klingenfuß, 2015 and Klingenfuß et al., 2019a). […] […] The objective of the research reported in this article is to calculate the total quantities of carbon present in Berlin, taking the Corg stored in soils, peatlands and vegetation into account since except the NatKoS study by Klingenfuß et al. (2019a), published in German, no international study yet has combined both approaches for the city of Berlin due to a lack of reliable data (Velasco et al., 2016; Yigini and Panagos 2016). For this study however, data from different soil and vegetation investigations in Berlin were provided for this study, which is why both approaches could be combined. […] Methods: […] and Results: […]: The C pools of the soils were calculated using the following scheme: [Figure presented] And based on the following equation: Ctotal = CVeg + Csoil (without peatlands) + Cpeat, including data from Klingenfuß et al. (2015) which recognize different peatland thicknesses. Discussion: […] Furthermore, because it is one of the first studies of its kind, many challenges arose that cannot be compared with previous studies such as Strohbach and Haase 2012 for the city of Leipzig or, including emissions, Bergeron and Strachan (2011) for Montréal but in a novel study to the NatKoS study by Klingenfuß et al. (2019a) as there were different methods used and a comprehensive uncertainties analysis would be allowed. Further recalculations with respect to peatland area and shape, peat type, and peat thickness are needed in order to correct potential C pool overestimates caused by overlapping of peatland areas and respective block areas.

Semiconductor QDs that are near the bulk Bohr radius exhibit wide spectral tunability and high color purity due to quantum confinement of excitons within the dot boundary. However, with reducing dot size, the role of the surface-trapped state increases. The temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) confirms this with a ~3:1 emission intensity decrease from the surface-trapped state compared to the band edge. Large crystal irregularity, dangling ions, and foreign molecules can introduce new electronic transitions from surface-trapped states that provide broad spontaneous emission in the spectral region from visible to near IR in addition to the band edge emission. The time-resolved PL analyzed the fractional contributions of band edge, surface-trapped states, and possible intermediate trapped states to the broad spectral emission in order to characterize the CdSe QDs. © 2021 by the authors.

Although informal settlements, currently known as colonias populares, or barrios, house most of the urban population in Latin America, there is a poor understanding of how people in these communities use energy and contribute to GHG emissions. This investigation provides a comprehensive analysis of resource consumption in Mexico City’s colonia popular, including self-help housing, household energy consumption, and transportation. As there is no spatially specific data on energy use, the author conducted field research in the informal community of Isidro Fabela, founded in the 1960s. Isidro Fabela is an illuminating community that helps understand the energy use of informal settlements at advanced stages of urban consolidation. A mixed-method research approach served to collect empirical data through observations, household surveys, and in-depth interviews. Research sheds light on the efficient and sustainable ways in which families use energy, materials, and resources during self-help construction, and through their daily lives, in their community. The community-based LCA assessment finds that the contribution of Isidro Fabela to GHG emissions is 50% of the average impact in Mexico City. Natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) consumption for water heating is the most significant contributor to GHG emissions because families use inefficient heaters. Interestingly, by using public transportation and even walking, residents moderate the contribution of work commutes to GHG emissions. Therefore, climate change policy should enhance low-energy practices in informal settlements, by improving access to energy-efficient technologies and public transportation, to help families contribute further to GHG mitigation in Mexico City and elsewhere in Latin America. © 2021 by the author.

Recent advances have shown that the direct capture, storage, and deployment of solar energy, without conversion to electricity, has considerable potential to address space-heating needs even in cold and cloudy climates. However, the solar energy available for direct heating at climatic and metropolitan scales is both unquantified and widely assumed to be negligible, impeding further investigation, development, and policy responses. To estimate the magnitude and distribution of solar resources concurrent with space-heating needs, we spatially integrate datasets characterizing solar radiation, outdoor temperature, and heating energy use across U.S. climates. Results show that the median resource incident upon collectors of residential scale (10m2) and distribution is much greater than previously realized, equaling 7MWh per household annually; by comparison, the median household heating need is currently 10.3MWh. Unexpectedly, cloud-diffused solar radiation accounts for over one-quarter of this resource in all but semi-arid climates. Metropolitan residential resources exceed 5TWh in areas including Detroit and Boston (cold continental), WashingtonD.C. (humid subtropical), Seattle and San Francisco (Mediterranean), and Denver (semi-arid), and national resources exceed 750TWh annually, compared to approximately 1200TWh of annual heating need. Current technology is able to capture and retain over half of a direct solar heating resource, revealing that the untapped U.S. solar heating potential is comparable to one-third of the national residential space-heating need and implying that analogous resources exist in analogous climates worldwide. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate-responsive design; Diffuse solar radiation; Passive solar heating; Renewable resource evaluation; Solar energy; Space-heating decarbonization","Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Solar heating; Solar radiation; Space heating; Climate-responsive design; Decarbonisation; Diffuse solar radiations; Passive solar; Passive solar heating; Renewable resource; Renewable resource evaluation; Resource evaluation; Responsive designs; Space-heating decarbonization; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114692946

The use of green infrastructure is one option that could help improving urban air quality and promoting more sustainable cities. Detailed knowledge of how plants capture particulate matter can support plant selection for this purpose. Previous studies have primarily focused on 2D techniques to assess the micromorphology of plant leaves. Here, 3D optical profilometry and SEM imaging (2D) are used to quantify leaf roughness and other micromorphological leaf traits of three contrasting plant species (Hedera helix ‘Woerner’, Thuja occidentalis ‘Smaragd’, and Phyllostachys nigra) located within a mixed-species green barrier. These techniques have allowed us to identify the relative distribution of adhered atmospheric PM with respect to the surface topography of leaves, with high spatial resolution. Leaf surface roughness did not show a direct relationship with PM deposition; however, the descriptors width, depth and frequency of the grooves are important to explain PM capture by the leaves. Additionally, the presence of wax on leaves was relevant for PM adherence. All species captured PM, with their overall PM capture efficiency ranked from highest to lowest as follows: Thuja occidentalis > Hedera helix > Phyllostachys nigra. All green barrier species contributed to air quality improvement, through PM capture, regardless of their location within the barrier. Having multiple species in a green barrier is beneficial due to the diverse range of leaf micromorphologies present, thus offering different mechanisms for particulate matter capture. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Ecosystem service; Leaf roughness; PM2.5; Urban plants","Air quality; Ecosystems; Particles (particulate matter); Plants (botany); Topography; Air pollutants; Atmospheric particulate matter; Ecosystem services; Hedera helixes; Leaf roughness; Micromorphologies; Particulate Matter; Particulate matter2.5; Plant's capacity; Urban plant; Surface roughness; cedar leaf oil; atmospheric pollution; ecosystem service; leaf morphology; micromorphology; particulate matter; quantitative analysis; roughness; urban area; air pollutant; air quality; Article; atmospheric deposition; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental protection; ivy; leaf surface; leaf surface roughness; nonhuman; particulate matter; Phyllostachys nigra; plant; plant density; plant leaf; plant parameters; plant structures; profilometry; scanning electron microscopy; three-dimensional imaging; topography; air pollution; chemistry; environmental monitoring; human; particulate matter; plant leaf; Hedera helix; Phyllostachys nigra; Thuja occidentalis; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Plant Leaves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111048983

Pineapple (Ananas comosus) agroforestry systems (PAFS) form an essential constituent of the rural landscape in the Indian Eastern Himalayas and other parts of Asia. The traditional PAFS management in southern Assam is unique in that it involves shifting cultivation transitioning from native forests to a PAFS. Scarcity of information on the functioning and services in terms of species diversity and carbon storage potential in the traditional PAFS has restricted the opportunities for consideration under the nature-based solutions of climate action including REDD+. Therefore, the present study assessed the tree diversity and ecosystem carbon storage in a chronosequence from swidden agriculture through different phases of PAFS establishment. The result demonstrated that basal area in the PAFS increased with age. The most dominant species in the native forests was Palaquium polyanthum, while agricultural land use and PAFS aged &lt;5, 11–15 and &gt; 15 years old were dominated by Gmelina arborea, Albizia procera, Areca catechu and Hevea brasiliensis, respectively. The highest value of Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H) was recorded in native forests (2.71), and lowest in 5–10 years old PAFS. The ecosystem carbon storage declined from 261.43 Mg ha−1 in native forests to 181.07 Mg ha−1 in &lt;5-years old PAFS. In &lt;5 years old PAFS, the ecosystem carbon storage was 30 % lower than the native forest; while at &gt;15 years it was merely 5 % less than the native forests. The traditional PAFS maintains a steady ecosystem carbon stock while reducing land use related carbon emission and providing additional co-benefits to the communities.

We have investigated the charge storage capacity and mechanism of alkali metal ions Li+, Na+, and K+ in graphite and hard carbon (HC) nanoparticles of 50 nm in particle size. The charge storage capacity of the carbon nanoparticles follows the order: Li+ > K+ > Na+ in the potential window between 3.00 and 0.01 V vs the individual metal/metal ion couple. Above the plateau regions (above 0 V vs Na/Na+, 0.25 V vs K/K+, and 0.35 V vs Li/Li+), the storage of the alkali metal ions proceeds via a capacitive mechanism due to charge adsorption on the surface and defective sites, leading to a similar specific storage capacity. In the potential range between 3.0 and 0.01 V vs Li/Li+ and at 1 A/g, graphite and HC nanoparticles deliver Li+ storage capacities of 690 and 564 mAh/g, respectively. The significantly higher Li+ storage capacity of the graphite nanoparticles than the theoretical capacity of commercial graphite (372 mAh/g) is due to the extra Li+ storage via the capacitive mechanism. However, at an extremely high current density (e.g., 100 A/g), the HC nanoparticles store more Li+ (324 mAh/g) than the graphite nanoparticles (262 mAh/g). This study sheds light on alkali metal ion storage behavior in carbon nanoparticles and suggests that electrodes fabricated with carbon nanoparticles hold great promise for developing fast-charging rechargeable batteries. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","alkali metal ion; anode; carbon; fast-charging; nanoparticles","Anodes; Charging (batteries); Lithium compounds; Metal ions; Metal nanoparticles; Metals; Particle size; Secondary batteries; Storage (materials); Alkali-metal ions; Anode; Carbon nanoparticles; Charge storage; Charge storage capacity; Fast charging; Graphite carbon; Hard carbon; Li +; Storage capacity; Graphite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119112743

Water is made available to our society on a consistent and reliable basis largely due to flow regulation by storage reservoirs. However, under current management, the reservoir storage capacity needed for flow regulation is a non-renewable resource because this capacity is steadily being lost to sedimentation. Today's reservoirs occupy unique sites and may be considered largely irreplaceable, making the nation dependent on a non-sustainable resource. Sedimentation is steadily depleting storage capacity and progressively degrading the ability of reservoirs to fulfill their designated purposes. Sedimentation is also causing environmental impacts upstream and downstream of reservoirs. In the United States, the combined impacts of sedimentation and population growth have resulted in an estimated 35% decline in storage capacity per capita since this value peaked around 1970. In absolute terms, the estimated total reservoir storage capacity in the U.S. has dropped from a peak of 850 Gm3 in the late 1980s to 810 Gm3 today. Yet, sustaining the nation's long-term reservoir storage capacity has not been a priority for many public or private dam owners, especially when they lack a reservoir sedimentation monitoring policy. In many regions, future reservoir storage will have to serve an important role in the mitigation of climate change to help ensure water, food, and energy, and the reduction of flood risk. There is an imperative need to preserve existing reservoir storage capacity due to rising demands associated with population growth, and increasing hydrologic variability associated with climate change, and the challenges and costs associated with either expanding existing capacity or decommissioning and developing new storage capacity. The trapping of sediment behind dams has also contributed to the decline of freshwater and coastal environments downstream of dams. Reversing these dangerous trends in storage capacity and environmental integrity will require increased monitoring of reservoirs, application of both established and emerging sediment management technologies, and a new paradigm for sustainable reservoir design and management. It requires moving from the traditional design life (reservoir life expectancy) approach to the adoption of sustainable use as the appropriate criteria for reservoir design and operation, achieving a sediment balance across reservoirs to permit the indefinite operation of this critical infrastructure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Reservoir sedimentation; Sustainable management","Trachinotus falcatus",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111478125

Facilitating immobilization of HMMs in plants, face growing concerns as a result of global pollution challenge accompanying wobble climate patterns. Thus, reducing the HMM concentrations below the allowable limits is the key to safer food sustainability. Several studies are underway to develop methods having clear modes of action for removing HMMs from soil and wastewater. Engineered and incorporated practices are used to recover HMMs; some of which are very simple, such as applying agricultural (bioadsorption) and industrial waste, while some of them are complex, such as solvent extraction, phytoremediation, remediation by microbial communities, green separation by hydrogel polymers, immobilization, or principal nanotechnology techniques. However, most of these methods are insufficient for various reasons including incomplete removal of HMMs (poor efficiency), the necessity for extra reagents/high energy, the large amounts of waste production that could be difficult to eliminate later on, and production of unwanted toxic waste. In this review, different methods were compared to each other such as remediation methods that include biology-based methods and nanotechnology methods. Biology-based methods include phytoremediation, immobilization technique with the chelating agent, and low-cost bioabsorbents. Molecular and nanotechnology techniques were applied for enhancing the remediation process and open up new opportunities for remediation of heavy metal. Hydrogels and agricultural waste as new methods for the removal of water pollutants cannot apply for the heavy metal removal at nanoscale. Analyses of toxicity of the nanoparticles are essential for industries to provide healthy products for consumers. Therefore, the present study compared the advantages and disadvantages of the latest management strategies integrated to lower the HMM contamination levels in the soil and built barriers against ultimate transmission along the food chain. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Heavy metals; Metalloid plant; Remediation; Soil; Water","detection method; heavy metal; immobilization; metalloid; microbial activity; microbial community; nanotechnology; pollutant removal; separation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117947091

A critical input for city-scale modeling is a timely and spatially resolved emission inventory. Bottom–up approaches to create urban-scale emission inventories can be a demanding and time-consuming task, whereas local emission rates derived from a top–down approach may lack accuracy. In the frame of this study, the UrbEm approach of downscaling gridded emission inventories is developed, investing upon existing, open access, and credible emission data sources. As a proof-of-concept, the regional anthropogenic emissions by Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS) are handled with a top–down approach, creating an added-value product of anthropogenic emissions of trace gases and particulate matter for any city (or area) of Europe, at the desired spatial resolution down to 1 km. The disaggregation is based on contemporary proxies for the European area (e.g., Global Human Settlement population data, Urban Atlas 2012, Corine, OpenStreetMap data). The UrbEm approach is realized as a fully automated software tool to produce a detailed mapping of industrial (point), (road-) transport (line), and residential/agricultural/other (area) emission sources. Line sources are of particular value for air quality studies at the urban scale, as they enable explicit treatment of line sources by models capturing among others the street canyon effect and offer an overall better representation of the critical road transport sector. The UrbEm approach is an efficient solution for such studies and constitutes a fully credible option in case high-resolution emission inventories do not exist for a city (or area) of interest. The validity of UrbEm is examined through the evaluation of high-resolution air pollution predictions over Athens and Hamburg against in situ measurements. In addition to a better spatial representation of emission sources and especially hotspots, the air quality modeling results show that UrbEm outputs, when compared to a uniform spatial disaggregation, have an impact on NO2 predictions up to 70% for urban regions with complex topographies, which corresponds to a big improvement of model accuracy (FAC2 &gt; 0.5), especially at the source-impacted sites. © 2021 by the authors.

A cost optimization model was developed to estimate the capacities of the system components. A comprehensive life cycle assessment model was built to estimate emissions of manufacturing and use of these components. Our evaluation shows that, for covering one fifth of Singapore’s electrical energy needs, a system with an installed capacity of 13 GW PV, 17 GWh battery storage and 3.2 GW subsea cable is required. The life cycle GHG emissions of such a system are estimated to be 110 gCO2eq/kWh, with the majority coming from the manufacturing of solar PV panels. Cable manufacturing does not contribute largely toward GHG emissions. By varying full-load hours and cable lengths, it was assessed that sites closer to Singapore might provide the same energy at same/lower carbon footprint and reduced cost, despite the lower insolation as compared to Australia. However, these sites could cause greater emissions from land use changes than the deserts of Australia, offsetting the advantages of a shorter HVDC cable. © 2021 by the authors.

The finding shows that people of the study area are switching their formal livelihood activities into alternative sources. Crop diversification, homestead gardening, erosion proofing, and cage aquaculture are commonly used by the studied communities to adapt to climate change impacts. The main driver of vulnerabilities was found to be lack of education, underdeveloped infrastructures, lack of advanced health facili-ties, and lack of alternative livelihoods during extreme events. Therefore, people living in and around the haor region need special consideration.

One of them is due to the increase in the volume of vehicles. CO2 causes an increase in global temperature (global warming) through the greenhouse effect. Yogyakarta International Airport has a green open space planted with trees to support the existence of the airport itself. Trees have contributed to efforts to reduce CO2 in the air through CO2 absorption. Control of the amount of CO2 emissions in the air is done by adding carbon stocks on land so that the CO2 concentration does not continue to increase, therefore this research is necessary. The purpose of this study is to analyze the ability of trees to absorb pollutants and store carbon and estimate the value of environmental services that will be contributed by the tree green system at Yogyakarta International Airport based on existing planting plans. The research method used is modeling using CITYGreen 5.2 software to determine the value of tree services in the ability to absorb air pollution, carbon storage capacity, and cost savings that can be done by tree canopies. The method used in this study consisted of preparation, data inventory, and data analysis. The results of this study show that the value of environmental services provided by 125,72 acres of tree canopy cover in absorbing air pollution in the airport area is $ 9.045,54 / year or equivalent to Rp 133.356.587,10 per year, the total concentration of pollutants that can be absorbed is 3.813,30 lbs/year or equivalent to 1.729,68 kg/year, and the capacity of carbon storage is 1.326,46 tons with a sequestration rate of around 29,9 tons/year. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","air pollution; carbon storage; CITYgreen; environmental service; green open space; tree",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118884902

Massive energy infrastructure projects like China's Belt and Road initiative (BRI) could accentuate social and economic costs, as regulation is deferred to host countries with varying levels of domestic enforcement. To fill major gaps in the public evaluation of EIA practices and results, our objective here is to present an open-source approach for evaluating localized air pollution health impacts for BRI-financed coal-fired power plants. This analysis focuses on one specific problem, additional attributable mortality from stroke, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for adults ages 25–84 from fine particulate matter (PM2.5), known to be major risk factor for premature deaths globally. As a concrete example, we examine the case of the Port Qasim power plant located near Karachi, Sindh Province, Pakistan. We present results for two main scenarios: a base case, assuming fully operational pollution control technologies, in particular electrostatic precipitators (ESP); and an alternative case without ESPs. All material and methods for replicating this analysis for the case study and for other projects are available in our institutional open repository. Our approach can be applied immediately to virtually any source location in the world, due to the public and global availability of input data.

The desulfurization system was implemented in an anoxic bioscrubber, which supported H2S removal efficiencies ranging from 92 ± 8 to 97 ± 6% for H2S loading rates between 28.3 and 37.8 g S mliquid-3h−1. CO2 absorption during the desulfurization process mediated a slight reduction in the CO2 concentration from 39.5% in the raw biogas to 36.5–38.2% in the purified biogas. Such reduction in the CO2 concentration was proportional to the increase of CH4 concentration recorded, passing from 60.0% in the raw biogas to 61.7–63.5% in the purified biogas. Bacterial community characterization by means of 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing revealed the consistent presence of both methanotrophs (Methylibium, Methylomonas and Methylosinus genera) and methanol-oxidizing denitrifiers (Simplicispira and Methyloversatilis genera), which suggested that methane oxidation indeed occurred.

One difficulty is anticipating how rainfall will be partitioned into evaporative losses, groundwater, soil moisture, and runoff (the water balance) in the future, which has important implications for water resources and dryland ecosystems. However, in order to effectively estimate the water balance, hydrological models in drylands need to capture the key processes at the appropriate spatio-temporal scales. These include spatially restricted and temporally brief rainfall, high evaporation rates, transmission losses, and focused groundwater recharge. Lack of available input and evaluation data and the high computational costs of explicit representation of ephemeral surface-groundwater interactions restrict the usefulness of most hydrological models in these environments. Therefore, here we have developed a parsimonious distributed hydrological model for DRYland Partitioning (DRYP). The DRYP model incorporates the key processes of water partitioning in dryland regions with limited data requirements, and we tested it in the data-rich Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed against measurements of streamflow, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration. Overall, DRYP showed skill in quantifying the main components of the dryland water balance including monthly observations of streamflow (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE, 1/4 0.7), evapotranspiration (NSE > 0.6), and soil moisture (NSE 1/4 0.7). The model showed that evapotranspiration consumes > 90 % of the total precipitation input to the catchment and that < 1 % leaves the catchment as streamflow. Greater than 90 % of the overland flow generated in the catchment is lost through ephemeral channels as transmission losses. However, only 1/4 35 % of the total transmission losses percolate to the groundwater aquifer as focused groundwater recharge, whereas the rest is lost to the atmosphere as riparian evapotranspiration. Overall, DRYP is a modular, versatile, and parsimonious Python-based model which can be used to anticipate and plan for climatic and anthropogenic changes to water fluxes and storage in dryland regions. © 2021 E.

However, despite the high level of interest and research in climate-change risks on socioeconomic, urban and natural systems, studies that assess climate change impacts on urban cultural heritage and contribute to a holistic understanding on the subject present noticeable gaps in knowledge. A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to assess the state-of- the-art of cultural heritage risk assessment methodologies within urban systems in the context of climate change, specifically historic urban areas. For this purpose, a systematic search was applied using Web of Science and Scopus. The search identified and characterized existing methodologies on vulnerability and risk assessment for cultural heritage in a changing climate following the PRISMA protocol, and it synthesized knowledge gaps to be addressed in the near future. This study aims to bring risk assessment methodologies closer to urban planners for more efficient climate change adaptation policies. The research concluded that there is an unbalance between the amount of methodologies for the different climate change derived hazards and their impacts on historic urban areas. The amount of methodologies focused on flooding highlights that further research is needed for other relevant hazards, like heat and cold waves, that contribute to a holistic perspective. © 2021","Exposure; Extreme events; Historic urban areas; Risk assessment; Vulnerability assessment",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114267508

We investigated how climate change-induced reductions in plant survival, photosynthesis and productivity alter soil fungal community composition in a mixed arbuscular/ectomycorrhizal (AM/EM) semiarid shrubland exposed to experimental warming (W) and/or rainfall reduction (RR). We hypothesised that increased EM host plant mortality under a warmer and drier climate might decrease ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) abundance, thereby favouring the proliferation and activity of fungal saprotrophs. The relative abundance of EMF sequences decreased by 57.5% under W+RR, which was accompanied by reductions in the activity of hydrolytic enzymes involved in the acquisition of organic-bound nutrients by EMF and their host plants. W+RR thereby created an enhanced potential for soil organic matter (SOM) breakdown and nitrogen mineralisation by decomposers, as revealed by 127–190% increases in dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen, respectively, and decreasing SOM content in soil. Climate aridification impacts on vegetation can cascade belowground through shifts in fungal guild structure that alter ecosystem biogeochemistry and accelerate SOM decomposition by reducing the Gadgil effect. © 2021 The Authors.

Ocean climate change (‘CC’) modelling may become a key decision-support tool for MSP, but traditional modelling analysis and communication challenges prevent their broad uptake. We employed MSP-specific ocean climate modelling analyses to inform a real-life MSP process; addressing how nature conservation and fisheries could be adapted to CC. We found that the currently planned distribution of these activities may become unsustainable during the policy's implementation due to CC, leading to a shortfall in its sustainability and blue growth targets. Significant, climate-driven ecosystem-level shifts in ocean components underpinning designated sites and fishing activity were estimated, reflecting different magnitudes of shifts in benthic versus pelagic, and inshore versus offshore habitats. Supporting adaptation, we then identified: CC refugia (areas where the ecosystem remains within the boundaries of its present state); CC hotspots (where climate drives the ecosystem towards a new state, inconsistent with each sectors’ present use distribution); and for the first time, identified bright spots (areas where oceanographic processes drive range expansion opportunities that may support sustainable growth in the medium term). We thus create the means to: identify where sector-relevant ecosystem change is attributable to CC; incorporate resilient delivery of conservation and sustainable ecosystem management aims into MSP; and to harness opportunities for blue growth where they exist. Capturing CC bright spots alongside refugia within protected areas may present important opportunities to meet sustainability targets while helping support the fishing sector in a changing climate.

In this study, the spatial distribution of potential maximum emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the complete life cycle of asphalt mixtures, as well as the particulate matter (PM), asphalt fume, nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), VOCs, and benzoapyrene (BaP) emissions from typical processes (e.g., asphalt and concrete mixing stations, asphalt heating boilers, and asphalt storage tanks) in asphalt mixing plants, were determined in Beijing in 2017. The results indicated that the potential maximum emissions of VOCs in the complete life cycle of asphalt mixtures were 18,001 ton, with a large contribution from the districts of Daxing, Changping, and Tongzhou. The total emissions of PM, asphalt fume, NMHC, VOCs, and BaP from asphalt mixing plants were 3.1, 12.6, 3.1, 23.5, and 1.9 × 10−3 ton, respectively. The emissions of PM from asphalt and concrete mixing stations contributed the most to the total emissions. The asphalt storage tank was the dominant emission source of VOCs, accounting for 96.1% of the total VOCs emissions in asphalt mixing plants, followed by asphalt heating boilers. The districts of Daxing, Changping, and Shunyi were the dominant regions for the emissions of PM, asphalt fume, NMHC, and BaP, while the districts of Shunyi, Tongzhou, and Changping contributed the most emissions of VOCs. © 2021","Asphalt fume; Asphalt mixing plant; Benzoapyrene; Nonmethane hydrocarbon; Particulate matter; Volatile organic compounds","Air pollution control; Asphalt mixtures; Asphalt plants; Barium compounds; Boilers; Concrete mixing; Concrete mixtures; Life cycle; Mixtures; Tanks (containers); Volatile organic compounds; Air pollutant emission; Asphalt industries; Beijing , China; Emission sources; Maximum emissions; Non-methane hydrocarbons; Particulate Matter; Total emissions; Air pollution; asphalt; atmospheric pollution; construction industry; emission; hydrocarbon; life cycle analysis; particulate matter; power plant; pyrene; spatial distribution; volatile organic compound; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; asphalt; hydrocarbon; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; China; environmental monitoring; Air Pollutants; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Hydrocarbons; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102448487

However, studies on the difference in spatiotemporal variation of ecosystem services trade-offs in various climate zones under climate change are limited. This study aims to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics and driving factors of trade-offs between crop production and soil conservation in different climate zones by employing a case study in various climate zones of the Shaanxi Province. We adopted statistical and GIS-based spatial analyses to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of the trade-off and used gradient boosting decision tree to quantify the relative contribution of driving factors. Results showed that trade-off between crop production and soil conservation in a middle temperate zone (0.09) is significantly lower than in a warm temperate zone (0.18) and a subtropical zone (0.21). The trade-off clearly exhibits an upward trend from 1995 to 2018 in all climate zones. However, the increasing trend gradually weakened from the middle and warm temperate zones to the subtropical zone. Moreover, changes in the trade-off are spatially heterogeneous in all climate zones. Anthropogenic activities have larger relative contribution (62.27%–71.67%) to the trade-off than environmental factors in all climate zones. Climate zone type has an insignificant effect on the relative contributions of anthropogenic activities, whereas the relative contributions of most environmental factors are significantly different in various climate zones. Fertilization (relative contribution, 26.58%–37.66%), GDP per land area (relative contribution, 8.50%–20.49%), and population density (relative contribution, 9.77%–16.11%) are the most important anthropogenic driving factors in all climate zones. The environmental factors with greatest relative contribution in the middle temperate, warm temperate, and subtropical zones are accumulated temperature (13.40%), precipitation (26.64%), and accumulated temperature (9.63%), respectively. Thus, differences of spatiotemporal characteristics and driving factors of ecosystem services trade-off must be considered in the formulation of targeted polices for agroecosystem management in different climate zones. © 2021","Agroecosystem service; Climate zone; Driving factor; Gradient boosting decision tree; Spatiotemporal characteristic; Trade-off","Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Economic and social effects; Population statistics; Soil conservation; Tropics; Agroecosystem service; Climate zone; Driving factors; Ecosystem services; Environmental factors; Gradient boosting decision tree; Relative contribution; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Trade off; Ecosystems; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural policy; anthropogenic effect; climate change; crop production; ecosystem service; GIS; Gross Domestic Product; soil conservation; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; subtropical region; trade-off; China; Shaanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113748023

However, limited researches are available which investigate the feasibility of applying corn stalks in asphalt. The main goal of this research is to explore the possibility of using Hydrochar(HC) from corn stalks as a novel asphalt modifier. In this study, HC was produced from corn stalks by a new method called hydrothermal carbonization. The comprehensive rheological properties of Hydrochar modified asphalt(HCMA) with different HC dosages were investigated by Bending beam rheometer (BBR) and Dynamic shear rheometer (DSR). Moreover, storage stability of HCMA was also explored. The experimental results demonstrated that the HC modifier was able to enhance the rutting resistance of base asphalt. The fatigue performance of base asphalt was improved by HC. Furthermore, rutting resistance showed an upward trend and fatigue performance showed a downward trend with the increasing of HC content. However, the addition of HC adversely affected the low temperature cracking resistance of base asphalt. Besides, the storage ability of HCMA should be improved. Finally, it is believed that the application of HC from corn stalks as asphalt modifier in warm regions is a promising way to reduce environmental pollution and hydrothermal carbonization is a promising approach to solve environmental problems caused by corn stalks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Corn stalks; Hydrochar; Modified asphalt; Performance evaluation; Rheological tests","Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Asphalt; Carbonization; Rheometers; Temperature; Thermal fatigue; Asphalt modifiers; Base asphalt; Corn stalk; Environmental problems; Hydrochar; Hydrothermal carbonization; Modified asphalts; Performances evaluation; Rheological property; Rheological test; Rheology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116377998

This paper quantifies the changes in land use of Yangtze River Delta urban agglom-eration (YRD) in 2020 and 2035 under three economic growth scenarios, exploring the concurrent impact on carbon storage. The results showed that the land carbon storage of YRD had decreased by 1453.80 Tg in 2000–2020, and will continue to decrease by 982.38 Tg, 1417.62 Tg, and 1636.21 Tg under the scenarios of a slow, medium, and rapid economic growth from 2020 to 2035, respectively. The large‐scale occupation of cultivated land and woodland for construction land caused by economic development and population growth was an important reason. The occupation of cultivated land by construction land in Nanjing, Shanghai, and its surrounding areas had further intensified, while the reduction in carbon storage caused by the reduction in woodland had become more prom-inent in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Jinhua, and the surrounding areas. © 2021 by the authors.

Statistical approaches have limitations when assessing future potential yields, while large differences between results obtained using process-based models reflect uncertainties in model parameterisations. Here we simulate the potential yield of wheat across the present-day wheat-growing areas, using a new global model that couples a parameter-sparse, optimality-based representation of gross primary production (GPP) to empirical functions relating GPP, biomass production and yield. The model reconciles the transparency and parsimony of statistical models with a mechanistic grounding in the standard model of C3 photosynthesis, and seamlessly integrates photosynthetic acclimation and CO2 fertilization effects. The model accurately predicted the CO2 response observed in FACE experiments, and captured the magnitude and spatial pattern of EARTHSTAT 'attainable yield' data in 2000 CE better than process-based models in ISIMIP. Global simulations of potential yield during 1981-2016 were analysed in parallel with global historical data on actual yield, in order to test the hypothesis that environmental effects on modelled potential yields would also be shown in observed actual yields. Higher temperatures are thereby shown to have negatively affected (potential and actual) yields over much of the world. Greater solar radiation is associated with higher yields in humid regions, but lower yields in semi-arid regions. Greater precipitation is associated with higher yields in semi-arid regions. The effect of rising CO2 is reflected in increasing actual yield, but trends in actual yield are stronger than the CO2 effect in many regions, presumably because they also include effects of crop breeding and improved management. We present this hybrid modelling approach as a useful addition to the toolkit for assessing global environmental change impacts on the growth and yield of arable crops. © 2021 The Author(s).

Especially in absorption and conversion of solar energy, a variety of MOFs can be readily designed to cover and harvest the sun irradiation of ultraviolet (UV), visible and near-infrared region through tuning both organic linkers and metal nodes to create optimal photocatalytic efficiency. Nowadays, a variety of MOFs were successfully synthesized as powerful photocatalysts for important redox reactions such as water-splitting, CO2 reduction and aqueous environmental pollutants detoxification. MOFs applications in indoor-air VOCs pollutants cleaning, however, are less concerned partially because of limited diffusion of both gaseous pollutant molecules and photo-induced active species in very porous MOFs structures. In this mini-review, we focus on the major breakthroughs of MOFs as photocatalysts for the effective removal of indoor-air VOCs such as aldehydes, aromatics and short-chain alcohols. According to their nature of photoactive centers, herein MOFs photocatalysts are divided into two categories to comment, that is, MOFs with variable valence metal nodes as direct photoactive centers and MOFs with non-variable valence metal nodes but after combining other photoactive variable valence metal centers as excellent concentrated and concerted electron-transfer materials. The mechanisms and current challenges of the photocatalytic degradation of indoor-air VOC pollutants by these MOFs will be discussed as deeply as possible.

The proposed strategy has been developed and tested in a research and design studio, which took place in 2020 at a Master of Architecture degree program in the Netherlands. The studios focused on the sparsely populated, high flood risk region of the Lake District, UK. The Lake District faces urgent climate change challenges that demand effective solutions. On the other hand, the area is a UNESCO heritage site, characterized by massive tourism and tending towards museumification (sic). Three indicative design research projects were selected to illustrate the proposed research by design strategy. The results reveal that this strategy facilitates the iterative research by design process and hence offers a systematic approach to convert the threats of climate change into opportunities by unraveling the potentials of the study area. The findings lay the groundwork for more systematic studies on research by design as an effective strategy for climate change adaptation design.

Our analysis shows an annual growth rate of 10% from 1995 to 2012 in these high-value inventions. Yet, from 2013 to 2017, the growth rate of these inventions fell by around 6% annually, likely driven by declining fossil fuel prices, low carbon prices and increasing technological maturity for some technologies, such as solar photovoltaics. Invention has remained highly concentrated geographically over the past decade, with inventors in Germany, Japan and the United States accounting for more than half of global inventions, and the top ten countries for almost 90%.

Rapid urbanization increases air temperature and creates an urban heat island (UHI) effect due to dwindling greenery. Thus, the UHI directly impacts the indoor and outdoor thermal comfort, air quality, and well-being of the city dwellers by affecting the microclimate. Further, the artificial cooling demand is increasing steeply in tropical cities, increasing carbon emissions. Therefore, researchers are currently focusing upon mitigation of the UHI effect and improving the urban microclimate. This review article deals with urban microclimate control using trees, grasses, shrubs, green walls, green roofs, and waterbodies. The contributory role of vegetation in regulating air temperature is reviewed comprehensively, and recommendations are made for ensuring the thermal comfort of urban residents. The effective use of vegetation in tropical cities can significantly improve the microclimate by reducing the air temperature up to 4 °C by green roofs, 9 °C by using trees, 12 °C by the vertical greening system. The rooftop greeneries with trees, shrubs, and turfs can reduce the building's overall cooling load by 20.01 %, 18.85 %, and 9.08 %, respectively. Implementing urban greeneries is essential to become sustainable cities and communities through a perfect blending of green landscape elements. Further, the present work will be helpful to urban planners and architects working on incorporating such green landscape interventions to provide better thermal comfort, mitigation of carbon emissions, and consequently improve the quality of life for tropical urban city dwellers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Landscape elements; Microclimate; Thermal comfort; Tropical areas; Urban heat island; Vertical greening","Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Blending; Carbon; Forestry; Roofs; Surface properties; Thermal comfort; Vegetation; Air temperature; Carbon emissions; City-dwellers; Landscape elements; Microclimate; Thermal; Urban heat island; Urban Heat Island Effects; Urban microclimate; Vertical greening; Tropics; greenspace; heat island; microclimate; tropical region; urban climate; vegetation; Poaceae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111320550

In this context translating global goals to local realities implicates a set of different challenges. Standardized methodologies of allocation can support a target-cascading process. On the other hand, local strategies and norms are not currently designed to directly respond to limited carbon budgets in a 2050 horizon. The life cycle assessment of buildings implicates an intricate cross-industry and cross-border carbon accounting. For these reasons, effective and aligned carbon targets are needed to support and guide all actors in the construction sector. This research aims at addressing these challenges by developing a new methodology of allocation of a global carbon budget at different scales using the Swiss built environment as a case study. This approach allows the assessment of current best practices in regards to limited carbon budgets.

The building and construction sector is one of the essential industries contributing highly towards environmental impacts. Balancing development at all stages with environmental protection is the prime aim of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The construction sector paves the way for greater economic development in a country and thus has an obligation to protect the environment against degradation. A few of the notable SDG's relating to the construction and building sectors concerning the environment and climate change issues are SDG 11-Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG7- Affordable and Clean Energy. Solid waste management is very crucial as the solid waste from construction sites highly degrade the environment. Using of green resources of constructing buildings may reduce the energy efficiency and after construction can reduce the carbon emission. But the construction materials which are not disposed properly have become a moot question on the effectiveness of the existing regulations and the legislations. The solid wastes which are disposed in unregulated dumps or when openly burned may lead to serious health issues, effect the safety and results in environmental degradation. This solid waste, when disposed of, emits gases like methane, carbon and contributes to global climate change. India has an obligation to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, by balancing development and environmental protection. This paper will analyse the existing legislation relating to solid waste management, its effectiveness in regulating the construction sector and how far they comply with the international standard or requirement in protecting the environment.

In an isolated electric grid system like in the SIDS, the majority of the electricity is produced by fossil fuels, therefore most of the SIDS nations are now focusing on Variable Renewable Energy sources (VREs). VREs such as wind and solar are hardly predictable and bring instabilities in the electric power system if not buffered by a storage system. Here we investigate the possibility of using Seawater Pump Storage Hydropower Systems (S-PSHS) as a renewable energy storage solution in an isolated electric grid. For this, the island of Curaçao (one of the SIDS nations) is used as proof of the concept. For detecting potential locations for the S-PSHS sites on the island, GIS application was developed. The application of this conceptual proposed solution in similar systems is straightforward and it can be easily upscaled in other geographies. The concept of using seawater for the pumped hydro project is not common in practice and it is anticipated to have technical, environmental and financial challenges which are discussed in this paper. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 reduction; Energy storage system; Pump storage hydropower; Seawater pump storage hydropower system (S-PSHS); Small islands developing states (SIDS); Variable renewable energy source","Carbon dioxide; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Fossil fuels; Natural resources; Pumps; Seawater; CO2 reduction; Electric grids; Energy storage system; Hydropower system; Pump storage hydropower; Seawater pump storage hydropower system; Seawater pumps; Small island developing state; Variable renewable energy source; Hydroelectric power; alternative energy; energy storage; GIS; hydroelectric power; pump; seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107664203

So far, the approach has been limited to capturing adaptive variation among populations, neglecting tree-to-tree variation residing within a population. Here, we combined the response function methodology with the in-situ breeding approach, utilizing progeny trials of European larch (Larix decidua) across 21 test sites in Austria ranging from Alpine to lowland regions. We quantified intra-population genetic variance and predicted individual genetic performance along a climatic gradient.

The lack of convenient means, which can be used to measure this parameter, creates a critical knowledge gap, making it impossible to compare theory to experiment. In this work, a fast pattern recognition algorithm was developed to complement field emission microscopy, together creating a methodology to obtain and analyze electron emission micrographs in order to quantitatively estimate the field emission area. The algorithm is easy to use and made available to the community as freeware and therefore is described in detail. Three examples of DC emission are given to demonstrate the applicability of this algorithm to determine spatial distribution of emitters, calculate emission areas, and finally obtain experimental current density as a function of the electric field for two technologically important field emitter materials, namely, an ultra-nanocrystalline diamond and a carbon nanotube fiber. Unambiguous results, demonstrating the current density saturation and once again proving that conventional Fowler-Nordheim theory, its Murphy-Good extension, and the vacuum space charge effect fail to describe such behavior, are presented and discussed.

Analytical scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray adsorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) methods were systematically utilized to investigate the interfaces, measured local geometry, and chemical state electronics around the structured active sites of commercially available Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 material or synthesized Cu/ZnO. Processed Cu K-edge EXAFS analysis suggested that various Cu atom species, clusters, metallic fcc Cu, Cu oxides (Cu2O or CuO) and the Cu0.7Zn2 alloy with hexagonal crystalline particles are contained after testing. It was proposed that in addition to the model’s Cu surface area, the amount, ratio and dispersion of the mentioned bonded Cu compounds significantly influenced activity. Additionally, XPS revealed that carbon may be deposited on the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, forming the inactive carbide coating with Cu or/and Zn, which may be the cause of basicity’s severe deactivation during reactions.

At the same time, among the current and projected threats to national security and national interests of almost all countries of the world are the consequences of climate change and the growth of man-made pressure on the environment. Therefore, today it is necessary to find ways to solve modern problems of environmental safety, including climate safety, which is the purpose of this scientific work. A promising way to reduce the risks of global climate threat is to ensure the environmental security of each country, which provides for the introduction of green technologies on the principle of construction of biopower plants in combination with poultry and livestock farms, as well as in combination with organic raw materials from the population, agricultural enterprises, utilities. In addition, it is planned to obtain biogas as an ""alternative fuel"", which will produce electricity and heat, which will be used in lighting and heating of buildings. To prevent the complication of the environmental situation and reduce the intensity of climate change, it is proposed to reduce the area of landfills for organic raw materials. Analysis of soil contamination was conducted near the landfill for solid waste in Lozova city (Ukraine), from which the results of research. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121245231

The maximum northward expansion of the mangrove genus Avicennia since the Early Eocene is known, but this information is missing for other mangrove taxa. Here, we evaluate the diversity of past mangroves with respect to latitude during three Cenozoic thermal maxima (PETM: 56 Ma; EECO: 54–49 Ma; MMCO: 17–14 Ma). Location: North Atlantic, Mediterranean. Taxa: Avicennia, other mangrove taxa (Rhizophoraceae, Nypa, Xylocarpus, Pelliciera, etc.). Method: We collected well-dated marine sediments along a Northern Hemisphere latitudinal transect and we analysed their pollen content in order to compare the past distribution of mangrove taxa with the present. The analysis of 89 samples (PETM: 13; EECO: 31; MMCO: 45) was performed and interpreted using a robust botanical background for identification of pollen grains and their representativeness in marine sediments. Results: During the Early Eocene, two palaeolatitudinal thresholds at 65–70°N and 35°N, respectively, delimited the Avicennia-only mangrove from a diversified but scrawny mangrove and finally from a diversified and well-developed mangrove. The Avicennia threshold was selective at 40°N during the Mid-Miocene. The Avicennia range limit was up to 10–15° poleward of the limit for other mangrove taxa during the Early Eocene and the Mid-Miocene compared with 9° at present. Main conclusions: A buffer zone characterised by a diversified but scrawny mangrove co-occurring with a few megathermal plants occurred in the Early Eocene between 35°N and 65–70°N. This finding questions the relative influence of a more ‘equable’ climate and/or the ability of some taxa to expand towards areas with cooler conditions in the past. Mangrove provincialism, which was established progressively after the Early Eocene, was probably forced by plate tectonics. The taxonomic impoverishment of the Atlantic East Pacific province was probably caused by successive periods of global cooling. These results support the Tethyan origin of the mangroves. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Avicennia; climate change; Eocene–Miocene; mangrove; range limit; thermal optimum","buffer zone; Cenozoic; Eocene; geographical distribution; historical record; mangrove; Miocene; Northern Hemisphere; palynology; range expansion; species diversity; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Mediterranean Sea; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (East); Avicennia; Pelliciera; Rhizophoraceae; Xylocarpus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114996042

Due to their toxicological impact, HAPs are an increasingly studied class of compounds. Of the different HAPs sources, refineries are one of the major sources. In order to obtain a preliminary assessment of the impact of a refinery in terms of emissions, a useful instrument is the determination of the emission factor (EF). For this reason, this work, focusing on the USA refining scenario, aims to provide evidence for a generic trend in refinery emissions to evaluate a correlation between the plant size and the amount of its emissions, in particular the HAPs emissions. Based on the analysis of the data collected from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), a general trend in the emissions from refinery plants was established, showing a positive correlation between the HAPs emissions and the refinery size, represented by a value of the Pearson correlation coefficient r close to 1. Once this correlation was highlighted, a purpose of this work became the estimation of an organic HAPs emission factor (EF): from a whole refining plant, the EF of the total organic HAPs is equal to 10 g emitted for each ton of crude oil processed. Moreover, it was also possible to undertake the same evaluation for two specific HAP molecules: benzene and formaldehyde. The benzene and formaldehyde EFs are equal to, respectively, 0.8 g and 0.2 g for each ton of processed crude oil. This work provides a simple rule of thumb for the estimation of hazardous substances emitted from petroleum refineries in their mean operating conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

This is particularly crucial for the Mediterranean Sea, which is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, one of the world's most overfished regions, and where temperatures are rising 25% faster than in the rest of the ocean on average. In this study, we calculated a vulnerability index for 100 species that compose 95% of the Mediterranean catches, through a trait-based approach. The Climate Risk Assessment (CRA) methodology was subsequently used to assess the risks due to climate change of Mediterranean fisheries. We found that the northern Mediterranean fisheries target more vulnerable species than their southern counterparts. However, when combining this catch-based vulnerability with a suite of socio-economic parameters, north African countries stand out as the most vulnerable to climate change impacts. Indeed, considering countries’ exposure of the fisheries sector and their vulnerability to climate change, a sharp contrast between northern and southern Mediterranean appears, with Egypt and Tunisia scoring the highest risk. By integrating a trait-based approach on targeted marine species with socio-economic features, our analysis helps to better understand the ramifications of climate change consequences on Mediterranean fisheries and highlights the regions that could potentially be particularly affected. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","climate change; climate vulnerability assessment; exploited marine species; fisheries; Mediterranean Sea","biodiversity; climate change; resource development; risk assessment; socioeconomic status; vulnerability; Mediterranean Sea; animal; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; fish; fishery; human; Mediterranean Sea; Animals; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Fishes; Humans; Mediterranean Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112361013

The aim of this work is to investigate the parameters influencing the generation of the inner comae of a comet with a spherical nucleus and to model the gas activity distribution around its nuclei. Here, we investigate the influence of thermal conductivity combined with sub-surface H2O and CO2-ice sources on insolation-driven sublimation and the resulting gas flow field. In the process, we adopted some of the rotational and surface properties of the target of the Rosetta mission, comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/CG). Methods. We used a simplified model of heat transport through the surface layer to establish sublimation rates from a H2O-and CO2-ice sub-surface into a vacuum. We then applied the 3D Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method to model the coma as a sublimation-driven flow. The free parameters of the model were used to test the range of effects arising from thermal inertia and the depth of the source on the gas outflow. Results. Thermal inertia and the depth of the sublimation front can have a strong effect on the emission distribution of the flow at the surface. In models with a thermal inertia up to 80 TIU (thermal inertia units: J m-2 K-1 s-1a 2), the H2O distribution can be rotated about the rotation axis by about 20° relative to models with no thermal lag. For CO2, the maximum activity can be shifted towards the sunset terminator with activity going far into the nightside for cases with low thermal diffusivity. The presence of a small amount of CO2 can reduce the presence of H2O by at least an order of magnitude on the nightside by blocking H2O flow. In addition, CO2 can also decrease the speed of the mixed flow in the same region up to 200 m s-1, compared to cases with no CO2 activity. Conclusions. Even low values of the thermal inertia can substantially modify the gas flow field. Including CO2 leads to strong variations in the local CO2/H2O density ratio between the dayside and nightside. CO2 can dominate the gas composition above the nightside and can also act to modify the H2O flow field close to the terminator. © ESO 2021.","Comets: general; Comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; Methods: numerical","Flow fields; Flow of gases; Gas dynamics; Gases; Heat transfer; Ice; Monte Carlo methods; Numerical methods; Sublimation; Thermal conductivity of gases; Activity distribution; Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko; Comets: general; Comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; Gas flow field; Heat transport; Method: numerical; Rosetta mission; Sub-surfaces; Thermal inertia; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118788378

District heating and cooling (DHC) can be supplied with low carbon footprint, if power generated from renewable energy sources is used. The simultaneous supply of DHC is often not considered in energy planning, nor the characteristics of the heat source and sink. Simplified approaches may not reveal the true potential of HPs and chillers. In this paper, different heat sources and sinks and their characteristics were considered for the simultaneous supply of DHC based on large-scale HPs and refrigeration plants. An optimization model was developed based on mixed-integer linear programming. The model is able to identify ideal production and storage capacities, heat sources and sinks based on realistic hourly operation profiles. By doing so, it is possible to identify the most economical or sustainable supply of DHC using electricity. The optimization model was applied to the Nordhavn area, a new development district of Copenhagen, Denmark. The results show that a combination of different heat sources and sinks is ideal for the case study. A HP that uses the district cooling network as a heat source to supply DHC was shown to be very efficient and economical. Groundwater and sewage water HPs were proposed for an economical supply of district heating. The Pareto frontier showed that a large reduction in annual CO2 emissions is possible for a relatively small increase in investments. © 2020 Henrik Pieper et al., published by Sciendo 2020.","District cooling; district heating; energy planning; heat sink; heat source; large-scale heat pump; mixed-integer linear programming; optimization","alternative energy; cooling; design; energy planning; heat source; linear programing; power generation; power plant; pump; Copenhagen [(CTY) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; Hovedstaden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099103233

We derive two key insights. First, if the national government implements a permit system (equivalently, pollution taxes) that allow for emissions as in the first-best, cities chosen by local governments are too small. Second, if no emission scheme is implemented, or if emission policies are too lax, cities steered by local governments may become too large. The tractability of the model also allows us to uncover the determinants of optimal city sizes, emissions, emission intensities and determinants of locally chosen city sizes, as well as to address the second-best emission policy and extensions to city asymmetries, a fiscal externality, local pollution, generalized commuting costs and further pollution sources. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","City systems; Emission policies; Environmental pollution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115747383

However, their underpinnings reflecting continuities of longstanding structural divergence along racial lines when it comes to determinants of finance and uneven climate devastation are not well explored. Additionally, the current global configuration of “billions to trillions” of development finance remains silent on the historical responsibility and continuing coloniality that reproduce uneven and extreme consequences in climate-impacted Caribbean communities. This paper interrogates the role of the SDGs in reproducing racialized peripheries and extracting surplus value from these formerly colonized communities through the use of financial logics and innovative tools. The adoption of the SDGs at the same time of the International Decade of People of African Descent (2015–2024) appears merely coincidental. A lack of concern about climate justice and reparations for historical harms and climate-related losses is evident. This absence highlights the manner in which financial interests are privileged and mobilized in pursuit of high-yielding returns to be made from climate disaster, debt and dispossession. These contradictions usher in a new era of “bond-age” and coloniality that justify reparations for loss and damage facing frontline marginalised communities centred on climate justice. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Caribbean; Climate reparations; Colonialism; Development finance; Race; Sustainable development goals","climate effect; colonialism; environmental justice; environmental policy; finance; race; Sustainable Development Goal; Caribbean Islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115188852

In spite of its multiple applications, forest generation has been fostered during the last century to achieve few specific objectives such as timber production or catchment erosion protection. However, new afforestation programs are required to meet multiple objectives such as carbon sequestration, reducing environmental risks and enhance biodiversity conservation to reach sustainability. Objectives: Assessing the general efficiency of past large-scale afforestation programs on the provision of ecosystem services (ES) and other socio-ecological attributes. We also determined whether this efficiency depended on the type of ecosystem used for comparison. Methods: We carried out a semi-quantitative meta-analysis from 75 studies analyzing the effects of 128 afforestation actions developed in one of the EU countries with larger areas of afforested land during the twentieth century. Results: Spanish afforestation policy improved timber provision and carbon sequestration. However, our results show that afforestation programs did not enhance regulating ES when compared to natural land plots, but only when compared to highly degraded areas prior to restoration actions. Conclusions: Large-scale afforestations have difficulties in assuring the provisioning of regulating ES and the conservation of biodiversity when only productivity criteria are prioritized. Our results suggest the need for an afforestation agenda that embraces more comprehensive landscape management approaches that allow reducing undesired ES trade-offs while getting multiple objectives from different ecosystems. © 2021, The Author(s).","Afforestation; Ecological succession; Ecosystem services; Forest transition; Green infrastructure networks; Multifunctional landscapes; Territory management","afforestation; biodiversity; conservation status; ecosystem service; European Union; forestry production; land cover; landscape ecology; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111170058

Commercial forest management strongly acts on this biome, affecting natural areas of “cerradão”, a forest physiognomy. The loss of this ecosystem decreases the regional potential of carbon capturing and stocking by native plants, an ecological function that contributes to climate change mitigation, recognized as a regulating ecosystem service. On the other hand, human activities which guarantee the supply of provisioning services, such as commercial forests, are important for regional socioeconomic sustainability. Thus, keeping a balanced supply of both services without exceeding their thresholds brings benefits, avoiding irreversible losses for the human society. With this in mind, we aimed to evaluate the capacity of savanna landscapes in contributing to climate regulation by carbon sequestration from natural forests and generating financial incomes from silvicultural activity, in territories with different proportions of natural and commercial forest cover. We define thresholds and tradeoffs between the supply of ecosystem services and cellulose markets. Also, we assessed the role of compositional and structural attributes of the native forests on carbon stock results. The cerradão presents an average aboveground carbon (AGC) stock of 40 MgC.ha−1, while the carbon stock in Eucalyptus plantings with 6–8 years is almost twice this value, despite this contribution be temporary in the landscape. The benefits from native and commercial forests are equivalent in watersheds presenting at least 55% of their territories covered by native forests. The condition for sustaining carbon ecosystem services and still generating financial gains with the same relative value corresponds to CO2 sequestration equal to 90.6 Mg.ha−1 and a gross income of 20.8 × 103 US$ per hectare of Eucalyptus planted for cellulose pulp. The structural features of the native forest remnants on the AGC stock were more effective than compositional attributes, being strongly correlated with the dominance of certain species. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cerradão; Ecosystem services; Eucalyptus; Land-use change; Threshold; Tradeoff","Cellulose; Climate change; Deforestation; Economics; Ecosystems; Land use; Magnesium compounds; Plants (botany); Above-ground carbons; Carbon stocks; Cerradao; Ecosystem services; Eucalypti; Landuse change; matrix; Native forests; Threshold; Tradeoff; Carbon; carbon sequestration; cellulose; cerrado; climate change; ecosystem service; forest management; savanna; silviculture; Cellulose; Deforestation; Economics; Ecosystems; Land Use; Magnesium Compounds; Brazil; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112749297

Recent modeling advances have increased the transparency of meat and ethanol industry supply chains, where conventional production practices and associated environmental impacts have been characterized and linked to downstream points of demand. Yet, to date, information and efforts have neglected both the spatial variability of production impacts and land use changes (LUCs) across highly heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Developing effective mitigation programs and policies requires understanding these spatially-explicit hotspots for targeting GHG mitigation efforts and the links to downstream supply chain actors. Here we integrate, for the first time, spatial estimates of county-scale production practices and observations of direct LUC into company and industry-specific supply chains of beef, pork, chicken, ethanol, soy oil and wheat flour in the U.S., thereby conceptually changing our understanding of the sources, magnitudes and influencers of agricultural GHG emissions. We find that accounting for LUC can increase estimated feedstock emissions per unit of production by a factor of 2- to 5-times that of traditionally used estimates. Substantial variation across companies, sectors, and production regions reveal key opportunities to improve GHG footprints by reducing land conversion within their supply chains. © 2021 The Author(s).

The increasing spread of micro-wind turbines may promote not only the decentralized generation of energy, but also helps to achieve reductions in the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and to support the transition to transport system electrification. However, one of the barriers for the diffusion of micro-wind turbines in urban settlements is the difficulty to estimate its feasibility based on the local wind resource, which is highly site-specific and less predictable than other renewable sources in an urban framework (i.e. solar, biomass). The paper deals with extensive monitoring and analysis of a micro-wind turbine performed at the outdoor development center HEnergia of HERA S.p.A. in Forlì (Italy). The micro-wind turbine was remotely monitored and data on environmental conditions and electric energy production were continuously acquired and stored by a PC. Therefore, micro-wind turbine performance was measured on-site and correlated with environment conditions. The real energy production of the micro-wind turbine was measured and a method to estimate the performances based on local wind conditions was presented. Based on the results, a simplified approach to evaluate the economic feasibility of micro-wind turbine in urban areas based on the Levelized Cost Of Energy (LCOE) concept was also presented. © 2021 The Authors","Micro-wind turbine; Outdoor monitoring; System efficiency; System optimization; Techno-economic assessment","Greenhouse gases; Urban growth; Urban transportation; Wind power; Energy productions; Measurements of; Micro-wind turbines; Outdoor monitoring; Performance; Renewable energy source; System efficiency; System optimizations; Techno-economic assessment; Urban areas; Wind turbines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116952140

An experiment was conducted to identify thermal efficiency and harmful exhaust gas emission characteristics under partial load conditions in order to improve efficient fuel use in engines affected by the introduction of low calorific gases. A countermeasure for coping with emission gas regulations and preventing thermal efficiency deterioration under rated power operating conditions was then presented. An 11 L six-cylinder turbo-charged engine for city buses compliant with the EURO 6 regulation was used in the experiment, and the results obtained using the reference natural gas fuel were compared with those obtained using simulated low calorific gases. Pure methane (CH 4) was also used to investigate the effects of gas composition changes on thermal efficiency and exhaust gas emissions. When N2 is added or pure CH 4 is used under partial load operating conditions, the combustion rate decreases; consequently, the optimum ignition timing is additionally advanced relative to that obtained when the reference natural gas fuel is used. If the N2 mixing ratio is increased to a minimum of 4.7% under rated power operating conditions, combustion becomes unstable. Stable operation can be secured by increasing the set base fuel amount, 2.35% and 9.41% for pure CH 4 and 8% N2, respectively; however, torque decreases in proportion to the combustion speed of the gas fuel. The strategy of boost pressure control for the torque compensation can minimize the decrease in thermal efficiency. © 2021 The Author(s)","Countermeasures; Fuel composition; Ignition timing; Internal combustion engine; Natural gas; Torque compensation","Deterioration; Efficiency; Exhaust gases; Gas engines; Ignition; Natural gas; Combustion speed; Natural gas composition; Operating condition; Power operating conditions; Stable operation; Thermal efficiency; Torque compensation; Turbocharged engine; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100696067

This research addresses the impact of urbanization and industrial structure on carbon emissions from 2010 to 2018, by focusing on the Huaihe River Eco-economic Zone, which is an important economic corridor along the north–south division of China. Although many studies have focused on investigating the impact of urbanization or industrial structure on carbon emissions, few studies further addressed an analysis of the impact of both on carbon emissions, using multiple measurement models. This paper reveals the holistic and local impact of industrial structure and urbanization on carbon emissions, by integrating a threshold regression model with geographically weighted regression. The results are as follows: (1) From a holistic point of view, industrial structure and urbanization had both, single threshold, and double threshold effects on carbon emissions in the Huaihe River Eco-economic Zone. (2) From a regional perspective, the coefficients of industrial structure on carbon emissions were all positive, but the rate of increase gradually slowed down. The coefficients of urbanization on carbon emissions were all negative, reaching a maximum value of negative effect in 2013.

Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction by Imidazolium-Functionalized Molecular Catalysts. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2017, 139, 40, 13993−13996. 10.1021/jacs.7b07709]. These compounds feature charged imidazolium ligands in the secondary coordination sphere and exhibit higher catalytic activities as compared to the Lehn catalyst [Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl] (where bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine). However, the reaction mechanism for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is unclear. Here, we employ density functional theory (DFT) and restricted active space self-consistent field (RASSCF) methods to study the selectivity for CO2 fixation using [Re[bpyMe(ImMe)](CO)3Cl]+ (1+) in water and compare its reactivity to [Re[bpyMe(ImMe2)](CO)3Cl]+ (2+) and [Re[bpyMe(ImMe4)](CO)3Cl]+ (3+). Our results reveal that the turnover frequency (TOF) for CO2RR using 1+ is 4 orders of magnitude higher than for proton reduction, consistent with controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) experiments in which CO was the only detectable reduction product. The imidazolium moiety in the secondary coordination sphere stabilizes the metallocarboxylate species and assists the C−O cleavage through intermolecular hydrogen-bonding stabilizations. Furthermore, our calculations imply that the strongest hydrogen-bonding interactions at the C2 position in 1+ contribute to the faster reaction rate observed experimentally with respect to 2+. More significantly, the use of the energy span model demonstrates that the turnover frequency-determining transition state (TDTS) corresponds to the formation of the Re−CO2 adduct, contrasting with manganese analogues in which the C−O bond cleavage step is the TDTS. We attribute this distinction based on the electronic structures of doubly reduced active catalysts. Indeed, RASSCF calculations indicate that rhenium compounds are best described as a rhenium(I) coupled with a doubly reduced bipyridine ligand, [ReI[bpyMe(ImMe)2−](CO)3]0.

The region is also known for its ongoing development challenges including those arising from reconstruction in the aftermath of natural disasters. Incepting the idea of climate-resilience in development planning has, therefore, become a necessity in this poverty-ridden region. To identify the strategies that have been envisaged by the stakeholders in terms of climate-resilient development, this paper singled out the stakeholders who are responsible for local-level development in the mid-hill region of Nuwakot which lies in central Nepal. Data was collected through the visioning and back-casting method and included interviews with community members, NGO experts and regional representatives. The study identified the activities and priorities of stakeholders based on different time horizons illustrating climate-resilient development pathways. The study found that community pathways address mostly current needs and climate variability and that future challenges do not play a central role in the selection of adaptation measures. Although a majority of the actors recognized climate-resilient development as a priority, it tends to be planned in silos without cooperation and coordination among themselves. The results reveal that the risks and vulnerabilities encountered by community members, who are at the receiving end of climate change, have not been incorporated into the development plans of the policymakers. The study concludes that development priorities should be formulated based on the identification of a need and proposes that future cooperation mechanisms for stakeholders should be brought under one umbrella and include a discussion of climate-resilient development pathways that incorporates more community engagement so as not to lose the connection between country aspirations and community voices. © 2021","Climate change adaptation; Climate-resilient development; Climate-resilient development pathways; Community engagement; Mountains; Stakeholder cooperation and coordination","article; aspiration; climate change; human; interview; Nepal; voice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114811338

However, conventional bottom-up data collection is costly and subject to potential manipulation by stakeholders when data pass through their hands, which could pose challenges on the efficiency and effectiveness of compliance monitoring especially in developing countries. Satellite observations, specifically OCO-2 XCO2 measurements, are utilized in this study to develop a relatively independent and timely dataset for screening the attainment statuses of national and subnational CO2 mitigation goals in China's 13th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2016–2020). We establish CO2 emission estimation models at both pixel and provincial levels. As interpolated with the pixel-level model, CO2 emissions of prefecture-level municipalities indicate that approximately three fifth of them had accomplished their individualized FYP mitigation goals by 2019, while our provincial-level estimation suggests that three quarters of provinces had attained theirs. More resources for compliance monitoring could thus be directed to other presumably-unattaining local governments. National aggregate absolute emissions showed 8.0–18.3% reduction in 2019 across three provincial models from the 2015 level, while national CO2 intensity dropped by 28.8–36.8% to imply attaining the 18% reduction goals. © 2021 The Author(s)","China's 13th Five-Year Plan; Climate policy implementation; Compliance monitoring; Goal attainment; OCO-2; Satellite observation","Developing countries; Pixels; Satellites; % reductions; China 13th five-year plan; Climate policy implementation; CO$-2$/ emission; CO$-2$/ mitigation; Compliance monitoring; Five-year plans; Goal-attainment; OCO-2; Satellite observations; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; compliance; emission inventory; environmental policy; estimation method; policy implementation; satellite imagery; Article; carbon footprint; China; correlational study; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; trend study; climate; motivation; China; Carbon Dioxide; China; Climate; Goals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110085172

In the last decades, it has been introduced in the Mediterranean region and other parts of the world as a potential new crop. However, several tomato major pathogens may threaten the expansion of pepino cultivation. We identified Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (FOL), Verticillium dahliae (VE), pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) and tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) as four of the most likely pathogens to cause damage to pepino crops in Mediterranean climates. In order to evaluate the response of the pepino genepool against these pathogens, as well as to identify sources of tolerance, we inoculated six accessions of cultivated pepino, nine accessions of seven pepino wild relatives, and one interspecific hybrid with FOL, VE, PepMV and ToMV and followed its symptomatology for 30 days (FOL and VE) or 60 days (PepMV and ToMV). ELISA tests were also performed for PepMV and ToMV. Susceptible tomato materials were used as controls. The pepino genepool displayed fewer symptoms than susceptible tomato controls after inoculation with FOL, with most accessions being tolerant or resistant. Regarding VE, a wide variation of values for the symptoms index (SI) was observed, with three cultivated pepino accessions displaying tolerance. For PepMV a wide variation for SI was also observed, with one accession of S. caripense being resistant, and several accessions of pepino and other wild relatives displaying different degrees of tolerance. PepMV absorbance values obtained by ELISA tests followed a pattern similar to that of SI. For ToMV no resistances were found, although two wild accessions and the interspecific hybrid displayed low values for the SI and were considered as moderately tolerant. ELISA tests against ToMV revealed that the virus replicated well in all materials. None of the accessions evaluated displayed resistance or high levels of tolerance to the four pathogens, but some of them were complementary for resistance or high levels of tolerance. Although the interspecific hybrid tested was not resistant to any of the pathogens, it was tolerant to FOL and PepMV and moderately tolerant to VE and ToMV. A multivariate hierarchical clustering revealed similar patterns among accessions in the response to the two fungal diseases (FOL and VE) on one side and to the two viral ones (PepMV and ToMV) on the other. The information generated in this study has allowed identifying materials within the pepino genepool for the development of multi-resistant pepino cultivars to major diseases threatening its expansion in the Mediterranean region. © 2021 Association of Applied Biologists.","DAS-ELISA; Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici; inoculation; PepMV; Solanum muricatum; ToMV; Verticillium dahliae","absorbance; crop plant; fungal disease; inoculation; introduced species; pathogen; pest damage; range expansion; symptom; virus; wild population; Mediterranean Region; Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici; Lycopersicon esculentum; Pepino mosaic virus; Solanum muricatum; Tomato mosaic virus; Verticillium dahliae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105537556

It highlights that all transport modes—road, rail, aviation and waterborne—will have to contribute to this aim. A smart combination of vehicle/vessel/aircraft efficiency improvements, as well as fuel mix changes, are among the measures that can reduce GHG emissions, reducing at the same time noise pollution and improving air quality. This research provides a comprehensive analysis of recent research and innovation in low‐emission alternative energy for transport (excluding hydrogen) in selected European Union (EU)‐funded projects. It considers the latest developments in the field, identifying relevant researched technologies by fuel type and their development phase. The results show that liquefied natural gas (LNG) refueling stations, followed by biofuels for road transport and alternative aviation fuels, are among the researched technologies with the highest investments. Me-thane‐based fuels (e.g., compressed natural gas (CNG), LNG) have received the greatest attention concerning the number of projects and the level of funding. By contrast, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) only has four ongoing projects. Alcohols, esters and ethers, and synthetic paraffinic and aromatic fuels (SPF) are in between. So far, road transport has the highest use of alternative fuels in the transport sector. Despite the financial support from the EU, advances have yet to materialize, suggesting that EU transport decarbonization policies should not consider a radical or sudden change, and therefore, transition periods are critical. It is also noteworthy that there is no silver bullet solution to decarbonization and thus the right use of the various alternative fuels available will be key. © 2021 by the authors.

FDI is measured in three ways; inflow, net inflow, and stock. Employing data over the period 1995–2014 and a number of estimators, the results indicate FDI (whether measured as inflow or net inflow) has negative impact on emissions (irrespective of the measurement). However, the impact is generally found to be greater for the territorial-based emissions. The results of the FDI flow variables largely support the pollution halo hypothesis. Thus, the results are supportive of the robust effect of FDI's positive effect. Regarding the stock measure, the negative effect of FDI is only found for the territorial-based CO2 emissions. Since the territorial-based emissions capture emissions in the domestic economy only, it is not surprising that the plausible efficiency of FDI stock is found to reduce these emissions rather the consumption-based. FDI stock is now considered part of the local economy. The results of the paper are largely not parallel with previous studies that did not disaggregate CO2 emissions. This we believe is an indication that the measure of CO2 matters for the analyses of the FDI-emissions nexus. © 2021","Africa; Consumption-based CO2 emissions; Environment; FDI; Territorial-based CO2 emissions","Carbon dioxide; CO2 emissions; Disaggregation; Flow variable; Foreign direct investments; Local economy; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100435511

Rice farmers have also responded to perceived climate risks with strategies believed to be climate-smart. Farmers’ perception of climate risks is an important first step of determining any action to be taken to counteract the negative effects of climate change on agriculture. Studies on the link between perceived climate risks and farmers’ response strategies are increasing. However, there are limited studies on the determinants of rice farmers’ perception of climate events. The paper therefore examined climate change perception and uptake of climate-smart agriculture in rice production in Ebonyi State, Nigeria using cross-sectional data from 347 rice farmers in an important rice-producing area in Nigeria. Principal component analysis, multivariate probit regression model and descriptive statistics were adopted for data analysis. Perceived climate events include increased rainfall intensity, prolonged dry seasons, frequent floods, rising temperature, severe windstorms, unpredictable rainfall pattern and distribution, late onset rain, and early cessation of rain. Farmers’ socioeconomic, farm and institutional characteristics influenced their perception of climate change. Additionally, rice farmers used a variety of climate-smart practices and technologies to respond to the perceived climate events. Such climate-smart practices include planting improved rice varieties, insurance, planting different crops, livelihood diversification, soil and water conservation techniques, adjusting planting and harvesting dates, irrigation, reliance on climate information and forecasts, planting on the nursery, appropriate application of fertilizer and efficient and effective use of pesticides. These climate-smart agricultural measures were further delineated into five broad packages using principal component analysis. These packages include crop and land management practices, climate-based services and irrigation, livelihood diversification and soil fertility management, efficient and effective use of pesticide and planting on the nursery. High fertilizer costs, lack of access to inputs, insufficient land, insufficient capital, pests and diseases, floods, scorching sun, high labour cost, insufficient climate information, and poor extension services were the barriers to uptake of climate-smart agriculture in rice production. Rice farmers should be supported to implement climate-smart agriculture in rice production in order to achieve the objectives of increased rice productivity and income, food security, climate resilience and mitigation. © 2021 by the authors.

This study applies a systems elimination method using numerical simulation to validate and optimise recently-reported results demonstrating the benefits of photovoltaic (PV)–diesel — battery hybrid integrated power systems (IPS) for commercial centres, with Abuja in Nigeria used for the case study. An optimal IPS was identified from 20,200 candidate solutions analysed by assessment against environmental (1st priority) and economic (2nd priority) metrics. Although environmental conditions were prioritised, the optimal system was economically viable. The environmentally optimal system emitted 33% less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2 tonnes/yr.) than the economically optimised solution (PV–diesel) over their operational lifetimes ($/20 years), and was 4% costlier than same. The results demonstrate that carbon taxation or outright bans on independent fossil fuel systems (IFFSs) in emerging economies might not be effective policies in mitigating the impact of climate change on our environment. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on energising unserved and underserved communities in sub-Saharan Africa, considering the case study country of Nigeria. It decries the common practice of prioritising economic factors over environmental factors in optimising the operations of grid defected power system solutions as continental and regional electrification efforts are being ramped up.

The Finnish Government has declared a national target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2035. This will require further reductions in carbon intensity of the Finnish energy generation mix. Some of the energy related emission reductions could simultaneously be achieved through effective energy efficiency measures in the buildings sector. In this paper, the effectiveness of these measures is studied in alternative long-term energy system scenarios with varying CO2 reduction targets for the energy supply sector until 2050. The results show that initial carbon intensity of energy mix has a significant effect on the achievable CO2 emission reductions of demand-side measures. Moreover, assigned system boundaries can significantly affect the results, especially in a low-carbon energy system, where energy savings mostly reduce the use of wood-based biomass in the energy production. Furthermore, long-term perspective for identifying the environmental effects of an energy efficiency measure is recommended, since they often have a long economic lifetime and due to structural changes in the energy system, the marginal energy production unit changes over its lifetime. Consequently, the CO2 emission reduction potential of an energy efficiency measure can vary over its lifetime. © 2021","Building stock; Energy efficiency; Energy market; Energy system analysis; Low-carbon system; Variable renewable energy","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Building stocks; Efficiency measure; Energy; Energy markets; Energy systems; Energy systems analysis; Finnish; Low-carbon energy systems; Low-carbon system; Variable renewable energies; Carbon; carbon emission; electricity supply; emission control; energy efficiency; scenario analysis; sustainability; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109132298

In order to encourage prosumers to invest in renewable energy, EU Member States are developing renewable energy subsidy programs. In Poland, in the years 2019–2020, the “My Electricity” program was implemented, co-financing was up to 50% of eligible costs (max PLN 5000, i.e., EUR 1111), and the total cost of the program was 251 million euro. During this period, around 400,000 prosumer installations were created in Poland, including over 220,000 prosumer PV Installations under the My Electricity program. The total power of the installation under the “My Electricity” program was 1.295 GWp with an average installation power of 5.72 kWp. It is estimated that the micro-installations will produce approx. 1.4 TWh of electricity annually. Depending on the replaced source of electricity (coal, gas, mix), in the next 30 years, it will help to avoid 26.2–42.7 million Mg of greenhouse gases calculated as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). The coefficient of subsidy expenditure from the “My Electricity” program was 194 EUR/kWp, and in the next 30 years, it will be 6.52 EUR/MWh. The investment in PV will save EUR 1550 million, which would have to be incurred for the purchase of CO2 emission permits. © 2021 by the authors.

The gaseous pollutants were quantified using a gas analyzer, and the PM2.5 concentration and meteorological parameters were determined using an Air Metric Sampler and Wind Mate, respectively. SPSS for Windows and ArcGIS were used for data analysis. The results revealed that the seasonal variations in SO2, NO2, CO2, and PM2.5 showed a higher level of air pollutant concentration during the dry season than during the wet season. During the wet season, a significant correlation was observed between PM2.5 and temperature at the 1% level (0.957**), and VOC and SO2 (0.907*) at the 5% level; during the dry season, significant correlations were observed between NO2 and SO2 at the 1% level (0.9477**), and PM2.5 and relative humidity (0.832*) at the 5% level. Atmospheric pressure (72%), temperature (60%), and relative humidity (98.4) were the primary meteorological factors affecting air pollutants such as VOC, CO2, and SO2. The spatial dispersal of air pollutants revealed a high Z score and a moderate p-value, indicating hot spot locations throughout the five selected slum settlements. It is recommended that regular monitoring based on quantifiable economic costs that are beneficial to the well-being of the populace be investigated, and policy-based initiatives for air pollution control based on scientific evidence be advocated for. © 2021 by the authors.

It is, therefore, essential to understand the various strategies used by farmers to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change (CC). Data was collected from 183 participants from nine (9) District Municipalities in four provinces of South Africa. A double-hurdle model was employed to estimate the factors influencing farmers’ perception of CC and adoption of adaptation strategies. A Poisson endogenous treatment (PET) model estimated the effect of on-farm demonstrations on climate change adoption strategies (CCAS). The result of the PET revealed that on-farm demonstrations increased the intensity of CCAS. The results, also indicated that soil and water conservation, migration, improved varieties were the most suited CCAS in South Africa. Thus, income from non-farm employment can be ploughed back into farm operations such as the adoption of soil and water conservation and use of improved planting varieties to mitigate climate variability and subsequently increase productivity. The study concluded that education attainment, non-farm employment, access to climate change information and on-farm training were significant incentives to enhance smallholder farmers' adaptive capacity by adopting various adaptation approaches. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Climate change; Double-hurdle; Perception adaptation strategies; Poisson endogenous treatment effect models","Agriculture; Climate models; Demonstrations; Productivity; Soil conservation; Water conservation; Adaptation strategies; Change impacts; Change perceptions; Climate change adoptions; Double-hurdle; Perception adaptation strategy; Poisson endogenous treatment effect model; Smallholder farmers; Soil and water conservation; South Africa; Climate change; accessibility; climate change; climate effect; educational attainment; employment; farmers attitude; perception; smallholder; strategic approach; training; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111211197

This study identified the non-consideration of China-specific technology and databases as a factor limiting comprehensive quantification. The study aimed to comprehensively quantify regional direct CO2 emission in the industry using a hybrid of economic and environmental data. We retrieved nineteen (19) sets of fossil fuel and electricity data from provincial energy yearbooks between 1997 and 2015 for the study. To generate regression models for each of the six regional construction industries in China, the study further integrated the results with three sets of econometric data: total annual construction output, cement, and steel product yearly consumption data. The study identified the North China region as the main source of direct CO2 emission with over 30%, while Southeast China contributed the least. While there is a gradual shift to other energy sources, the study identified coal and crude oil to remain as the main energy sources in the industry. Cement and steel data exhibited a significant predictive relationship with CO2 emissions in five regional construction industries. The study identified the need to have policies tailored to technological improvements to enhance renewable energy generation and usage in the industry. The models developed in this study could be used to generate initial quantifications of carbon emissions in construction industries with similar carbon-emitting characteristics for carbon tracking, and energy policies for decision making. However, the three economic indicators used in the study could be extended to generate more robust models in future research. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to optimize waste incineration plants as a countermeasure to this problem, we analyzed the performance of the integration of the plants with the Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) system. In the integrated system, food waste and sewage sludge from waste incineration plants, sewage treatment plants, and industrial facilities were mixed and fermented to produce methane gas. In this study, we evaluated the environmental and economic performance of the integrated system in four case scenarios. The integrated system is located in Ichihara City in Chiba Pre-fecture, where the Keiyo Coastal Industrial Zone is located and where petroleum and chemical industries are concentrated. The MBT system in which the heat generated from the incineration of waste was transferred to the Keiyo Coastal Industrial Zone was found to be the best. This method could reduce CO2 emissions by 1341 t-CO2/Y, and the annual cost was the lowest at 1.60 billion yen/Y.

Because the United States is a leader in food exports, climate change impacts in the United States have the potential to disproportionately affect the global food supply. Given the change in temperature, precipitation, and carbon dioxide occurring now and expected into the future, the potential for agroecosystems to produce sufficient quantities of food to meet world demand is in question. To address this question, the concept of yield gaps, as the difference between potential yield (PY) and farm or actual yield (FY), provides a framework for the evaluation of progress in production. Across all crops, there have been increases in both PY (breeding, technological advances) and FY (implementation of improved genetic resources and management practices); however, climate change threatens to diminish those advances due to temperature stresses and more uncertain precipitation patterns. Climate change will not only directly increase the yield gap in the future but also further indirectly widen the yield gap by the degradation of the soil resource due to interactions of climate and management. Modern agricultural systems must adapt to become more resilient to climate change, and the tools to this adaptation involve genetics, environmental monitoring, and evolving management practices. However, progress can only begin once agricultural systems are managed from a more holistic view of providing both quantity and quality of a more diverse mixture of agricultural crops that will provide sustainability, equity, nutrition, and a secure food future. © 2021 The Authors.

However, these mechanisms can be effective only when they are correctly followed and only when individuals believe the risk of COVID-19 is high enough to warrant following them. As risk perceptions decline, individuals are more likely to relax following preventive measures and the rate of spread might increase. This study assesses the determinants of changes in perceptions of COVID-19 risk and the determinants of adherence to preventive measures in Uganda. Logistic regression results show that age, access to information and being supportive of preventive measures strongly predicts keeping higher risk perceptions and adhering to preventive actions. Qualitative results show that risk perceptions are also influenced by economic stress, citizens’ level of confidence in the government, local political climate and the extent of proliferation of misinformation about COVID-19. © 2021 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Preventive measures; Risk perception changes; Uganda",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119906351

Such opportunities exist in the renewable energy industry. It is widely recognized that renewable energy generation benefits the ecosphere through reduced carbon emissions, but currently, further opportunities for realising direct and indirect conservation benefits through the design of solar farms are less well known. Among other opportunities, solar farm designs that deliver environmental credits through carbon sequestration and biodiversity improvements can deliver higher financial returns. Other opportunities to improve local hydrology, pollination, and pest-control services could be available depending on site-specific characteristics where solar farms are built, and the other land use practices that exist, or are possible, in the immediate vicinity. Here, we explore opportunities among renewable energy generation, agriculture, and conservation, through the co-location and innovative design of PV solar energy farms on grazing and croplands. These forms of land sharing can achieve higher land-equivalent ratios (LERs), a quantitative metric of the reduction in land use. We identify opportunities whereby solar farms can be designed to improve biodiversity, land condition, and conservation outcomes, while maintaining or increasing commercial returns. Much work remains, however, to understand the suite of opportunities available for achieving simultaneously the best commercial and conservation outcomes through solar farm designs in agricultural landscapes. © 2021 International Solar Energy Society","Agrivoltaic systems; Biodiversity; Land sharing; Regenerative agriculture; Solar farm; Triple bottom line","Agricultural robots; Carbon; Conservation; Forestry; Land use; Solar energy; Agrivoltaic system; Carbon emissions; Conservation benefits; Environmental credits; Land sharing; Regenerative agriculture; Renewable energy generation; Renewable Energy industries; Solar farm; Triple Bottom Line; Biodiversity; alternative energy; carbon sequestration; design method; solar power",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116630324

It also wants to improve the voltage profile and reduce the dependence on the upstream network. Two types of distributed generation sources, that is, wind DGs and solar DGs, are investigated. In this article, the network loads vary according to the local consumption pattern. This research shows that the optimal utilizing of solar and wind distributed generation sources causes energy loss to decrease by about 43% and 94%, respectively. Besides, the grid will receive 1109.49 GWh of energy from the upstream power grid without distributed generation sources. In contrast, solar and wind generation sources receive only 801.47 and 125.84 GWh, respectively. Additionally, in solar and wind scenarios, micro-grid sends 71.62 and 102.42 GWh energy to the upstream network. Also, by calculating the emission reduction, it was observed that by installing 465.45 MW of the wind turbine units in the area under consideration, the country's CO2 equivalent is reduced by 754,586 tons, and the country's primary energy is reduced by 263,916 TOE. © 2021 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","demand and production pattern; microgrid; reduce energy loss; solar power; wind power","Distributed power generation; Emission control; Energy dissipation; Microgrids; Wind power; Consumption patterns; Distributed generation source; Emission reduction; Network load; Primary energies; Solar and winds; Voltage profile; Wind and solar power; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107801381

In northern India and Bangladesh, agricultural activities are considered to play an important role in GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. We performed weekly air sampling at Nainital (NTL) in northern India and Comilla (CLA) in Bangladesh from 2006 and 2012, respectively. Air samples were analyzed for dry-air gas mole fractions of CO2, CH4, CO, H2, N2O, and SF6 and carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios of CO2 (13C-CO2 and 18O-CO2). Regional characteristics of these components over the Indo-Gangetic Plain are discussed compared to data from other Indian sites and Mauna Loa, Hawaii (MLO), which is representative of marine background air. We found that the CO2 mole fraction at CLA had two seasonal minima in February-March and September, corresponding to crop cultivation activities that depend on regional climatic conditions. Although NTL had only one clear minimum in September, the carbon isotopic signature suggested that photosynthetic CO2 absorption by crops cultivated in each season contributes differently to lower CO2 mole fractions at both sites. The CH4 mole fraction of NTL and CLA in August-October showed high values (i.e., sometimes over 4000 ppb at CLA), mainly due to the influence of CH4 emissions from the paddy fields. High CH4 mole fractions sustained over months at CLA were a characteristic feature on the Indo-Gangetic Plain, which were affected by both the local emission and air mass transport. The CO mole fractions at NTL were also high and showed peaks in May and October, while CLA had much higher peaks in October-March due to the influence of human activities such as emissions from biomass burning and brick production. The N2O mole fractions at NTL and CLA increased in June-August and November-February, which coincided with the application of nitrogen fertilizer and the burning of biomass such as the harvest residues and dung for domestic cooking. Based on H2 seasonal variation at both sites, it appeared that the emissions in this region were related to biomass burning in addition to production from the reaction of OH and CH4. The SF6 mole fraction was similar to that at MLO, suggesting that there were few anthropogenic SF6 emission sources in the district. The variability of the CO2 growth rate at NTL was different from the variability in the CO2 growth rate at MLO, which is more closely linked to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In addition, the growth rates of the CH4 and SF6 mole fractions at NTL showed an anticorrelation with those at MLO, indicating that the frequency of southerly air masses strongly influenced these mole fractions. These findings showed that rather large regional climatic conditions considerably controlled interannual variations in GHGs, 13C-CO2, and 18O-CO2 through changes in precipitation and air mass. © Author(s) 2021.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119116865

Herein, using Yangquan as a case study, emission factor (EF) method and “(tracer ratio) TR - positive matrix factorization (PMF)” combined method based on atmospheric data were used to establish and verify the VOC emission inventory in coal resource-based cities, respectively. The total VOC emissions in Yangquan were 9283.2 t [-40.0%, 62.1%] in 2018, with industrial processes being the major contributors. Alkanes (35.8%), aromatics (25.0%), and alkenes (19.8%) were the main compounds in the emission inventory. The verification results for both species emission and source structure were in agreement, indicating the accuracy of VOC emission inventory based on EF method to a certain extent. However, for some species (ethane, propane, benzene, and acetylene), the EF method indicated emissions lower than those obtained from the TR results. Furthermore, the summer-time emission contribution from fossil fuel combustion indicated by the EF method (23.4%) was lower than that obtained from the PMF results (38.4%). Overall, these discrepancies could be attributed to the absence of a coal gangue source in the EF method. The verification results determined the accuracy of the VOC emission inventory and identified existing problems in the estimation of the VOC emission inventory in coal resource-based cities. In particular, not accounting for the coal gangue emissions may result in an underestimation of VOC emissions in coal resource-based cities. Thus, coal gangue emissions should be considered in future research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Coal gangue; Coal resource-based cities; Emission inventory; Positive matrix factorization model; Tracer ratio method","Coal combustion; Coal deposits; Factorization; Industrial emissions; Matrix algebra; Paraffins; Volatile organic compounds; Coal gangues; Coal resource-based cities; Coal resources-based cities; Emission factors; Emission inventories; Factor methods; Positive Matrix Factorization; Positive matrix factorization models; Tracer ratio method; Volatile organic compound emission; Coal; anthropogenic source; coal; emission inventory; fossil fuel; future prospect; gangue; tracer; urban area; volatile organic compound; China; Shanxi; Yangquan Coalfield; coal; ozone; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; China; city; environmental monitoring; Air Pollutants; China; Cities; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Ozone; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111264858

Design/methodology/approach: PM2.5 samples were collected on the basis of daytime and nighttime at the state controlling air sampling site in Handan city. Ten metal elements (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Rb, Sr, Cd and Ba) in PM2.5 were determined with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The pollution levels of metals were characterized by enrichment factors, and the sources of metals were identified with principle component analysis and cluster analysis. The ecological and health risks of metals were assessed using ecological and health risk indexes. Findings: Results showed that the highest and lowest PM2.5 concentration appeared in winter and summer, respectively. The concentration of PM2.5 at night was higher than in the daytime in winter, yet it is the opposite in other seasons. The total mass concentration of detected metals was the highest in winter, and the total mass concentration in the daytime was higher than at night in all four seasons. The elements V, Rb, Sr and Ba exhibited a deficient contamination level; Cr, Ni and Cu exhibited a moderate contamination level; while Fe and Cd were at an extreme contamination level. The metals in PM2.5 originated from a mixture source of fossil fuel combustion and manufacture and use of metallic substances (34.04%), natural source (26.01%) and construction and traffic-related road dust (17.58%). Results from the ecological risk model showed that the ecological risk of metals was very high, especially risks related to Cd. Health risk model presented that both the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk coefficients of metals were above the tolerance level of the human body. Originality/value: The significance of the study is to further know the pollution characteristics of PM2.5 and related HMs in Handan city, and to provide references for ensuring local resident health and ecological environment. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ecological risk; Health risk; Heavy metal; PM2.5; Pollution characteristic",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107502767

However, the implementation of strategies aimed at reducing carbon emissions such as electric energy substitution increases the uncertainty of power demand. In order to effectively extract the changing characteristics of electricity demand, this paper firstly proposes a secondary decomposition model based on a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on Loess (STL) and variational mode decomposition (VMD) to reduce sequence complexity. Then, different models such as grey wolf optimized support vector regression (GWO-SVR) for different sequences were used to achieve the best prediction effect. In addition, this study used the Markov chain model to further improve the prediction accuracy based on interval optimization. To verify the effectiveness of the hybrid model, a case study was conducted on the monthly electricity consumption in Zhejiang Province, China.

Notwithstanding progress in modelling literature, however, very little of the scenario space traces back to what stakeholders are ultimately concerned about. With a suite of eleven integrated assessment, energy system and sectoral models, we carry out a model inter-comparison for the EU, the scenario logic and research questions of which have been formulated based on stakeholders' concerns. The output of this process is a scenario framework exploring where the region is headed rather than how to achieve its goals, extrapolating its current policy efforts into the future. We find that Europe is currently on track to overperforming its pre-2020 40% target yet far from its newest ambition of 55% emissions cuts by 2030, as well as looking at a 1.0–2.35 GtCO2 emissions range in 2050. Aside from the importance of transport electrification, deployment levels of carbon capture and storage are found intertwined with deeper emissions cuts and with hydrogen diffusion, with most hydrogen produced post-2040 being blue.

Added to the output from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), the total data volume will be in the order of 20PB. Here, we present a dataset of annual, monthly, global, hemispheric and land/ocean means derived from a selection of experiments of key interest to climate data analysts and reduced complexity climate modellers. The derived dataset is a key part of validating, calibrating and developing reduced complexity climate models against the behaviour of more physically complete models. In addition to its use for reduced complexity climate modellers, we aim to make our data accessible to other research communities. We facilitate this in a number of ways. Firstly, given the focus on annual, monthly, global, hemispheric and land/ocean mean quantities, our dataset is orders of magnitude smaller than the source data and hence does not require specialized ‘big data’ expertise. Secondly, again because of its smaller size, we are able to offer our dataset in a text-based format, greatly reducing the computational expertise required to work with CMIP output. Thirdly, we enable data provenance and integrity control by tracking all source metadata and providing tools which check whether a dataset has been retracted, that is identified as erroneous. The resulting dataset is updated as new CMIP6 results become available and we provide a stable access point to allow automated downloads. Along with our accompanying website (cmip6.science.unimelb.edu.au), we believe this dataset provides a unique community resource, as well as allowing non-specialists to access CMIP data in a new, user-friendly way. © 2021 The Authors.

However, there has been little comprehensive evaluation of the short-term impact of air pollution on cause-specific YLL, especially in China. Hence in this study, we selected China as sentinel region in order to conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate diseasespecific YLL due to all the main ambient air pollutants. (2) Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate disease-specific YLL due to the main ambient air pollutants in China, and 19 studies were included. We conducted methodological quality and risk of bias assessment for each included study as well as for heterogeneity and publication bias. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were also performed. (3) Results: Meta-analysis indicated that increases in PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 were associated with 1.99–5.84 years increase in YLL from non-accidental diseases. The increase in YLL to cardiovascular disease (CVD) was associated with PM10 and NO2, and the increase in YLL to respiratory diseases (RD) was associated with PM10 . (4) Conclusions: Ambient air pollution was observed to be associated with several cause-specific YLL, increasing especially for elderly people and females. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we analysed the factors affecting the biogeographic pattern and assembly processes of soil bacterial communities under 58 tree species in five natural mountain forests. Location: Eastern China. Major taxa studied: Bacterial communities. Methods: Hierarchical partitioning analysis and distance decay models were performed to evaluate the relative contributions of plant phylogeny, environmental, and spatial variables to the composition of bacterial communities. We applied the nearest taxon index (NTI), β-nearest taxon index (βNTI), and the modified Raup–Crick metric to reveal the mechanisms of bacterial assembly processes. Results: We found that plant phylogeny accounted for a significant, but minor, fraction (0.7%) of the variation in composition of bacterial communities. In contrast, soil pH was the primary determinant of bacterial diversity and community composition, independently explaining 68.6 and 69.9% of the variation, respectively. Based on the NTI analysis, bacterial community assembly was more phylogenetically clustered with increasing soil pH. Variable selection was the predominant process explaining bacterial community assembly when differences in soil pH were ≥ 0.83, whereas homogenizing dispersal dominated when differences in soil pH were <0.83. However, there was no significant relationship between plant phylogenetic distance and βNTI. Main conclusions: Our findings provide strong evidence that soil pH predominantly determines bacterial distribution and mediates the relative impact of stochasticity and determinism in soil bacterial community assembly. This suggests that climate-change associated forest soil acidification could have a dramatic impact on soil bacterial diversity, composition, and function. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","assembly processes; bacterial distribution; forest ecosystems; plant phylogeny; soil bacteria; soil pH","community composition; forest ecosystem; microbial community; pH; phylogeny; soil microorganism; spatial distribution; species diversity; taxonomy; China; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112401554

There is now a considerable and diverse literature on procedural, distributional and intergenerational dimensions, including questions of recognition in climate justice. Yet its meaning, scope and practical implications are still contested. Importantly, the broader landscape within which climate justice is situated is rapidly changing, bringing new challenges to the understanding and practice of climate justice. This review takes stock of climate justice literature in view of this new context. We find several disconnects and tensions between more philosophical and academic treatments of the subject on the one hand, and “activist”-oriented approaches to climate justice on the other. Scholarship often falls into silos around scales from global and local, between mitigation and adaptation or draws distinctions between climate justice and other forms of (in)justice. This inhibits an understanding of climate justice that can address more directly its underlying root causes in an historically constituted global economic system and intersecting set of social inequalities. We propose a research agenda centered on a transformative approach to climate justice, placing analysis of power in its various guises at the center of its enquiry, and subverting and moving beyond existing distinctions by focusing on the social and institutional relations and inequalities that both produce climate change and profoundly shape responses to it. We elaborate on three key strands of such an approach: inclusive climate justice, deepening climate justice and governance for climate justice.

The paper develops a spreadsheet model to explore these options for the 2026 VRE targets in the SEM and her neighbours. Raising SNSP from 75 % to 85 % reduces curtailment from 13.3 % to 8.0 %, saving 1338 GWh/yr of spilled wind. Adding the Celtic Link of 700 MW at SNSP of 75 % reduces curtailment to 12.4 % and saves 235 GWh. Adding 100 MW of batteries saves 19 GWh/yr, but the costs of delivering these savings are high.

This paper aims to explore how different data uncertainties, usually unknown to the planner, may influence environmental planning recommendations. We apply a case study-based approach, in which we provide three illustrative examples of how data with different kinds and levels of uncertainty affect environmental assessments and, by that, the decision-support provided by environmental planning. The cases stem from different spatial levels in Germany and consider 'Regional soil-based climate change mitigation' in the region of Hannover, 'State-wide habitat conservation siting' in the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt, and 'National renewable energy planning'. Based on the three examples, we discuss implications for planning practice and derive recommendations for further research. The three cases studies illustrate the substantial effects of data uncertainty on environmental assessments and planning recommendations derived from those results. We identify four problem constellations of dealing with data uncertainty in environmental planning that relate to the severeness of uncertainty impacts, the responsibility of the decision-maker, and the kinds of impacts that wrong decisions may have. We close with recommendations for further research, among others to develop robust and pragmatic methods for identifying the uncertainty levels in environmental data and assessment results. © 2021 Neuendorf et al.

In this study, life cycle assessment (LCA) was adopted to compare the environmental impact of end-of-life (EOL) treatment of 1 kg plastic waste in India and Indonesia based on the EOL mix, which includes mechanical recycling, co-processing in cement kilns, incineration, sanitary landfill, open dumping and open burning. Nine environmental impacts were considered, namely climate change, cumulative energy demand, water depletion and marine eco-toxicity, human toxicity, terrestrial acidification, fossil depletion, particulate matter formation and urban land occupation. Waste plastics EOL treatment in India was found to have a lower environmental impact than Indonesia among all nine categories, which was attributed to higher mechanical recycling rates in India. Hotspot analysis revealed that open burning is a major contributor to climate change, while landfills are the major contributor to marine eco-toxicity. A sensitivity analysis found that the percentage of plastic waste collection, percentage of uncollected plastic waste openly burnt, percentage of plastic rejects from recycling and percentage replacement of virgin plastic from recycled plastic granules were key sensitive parameters. The results of a future scenario analysis showed that further investments in mechanical recycling by 2030 can not only reduce mismanaged plastic waste, but also contribute towards the Paris Agreement carbon reduction pledges for both India and Indonesia. The results from this study can be used to support future waste management investment decisions in both countries. © 2021","Carbon footprint; Circular economy; Environmental modeling; Mismanaged plastics; Waste management","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Developing countries; Economics; Investments; Municipal solid waste; Plastic products; Plastic recycling; Sensitivity analysis; Toxicity; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Circular economy; End of life treatments; End of lives; End-of-life treatments; Environmental model; Indonesia; Mechanical recycling; Mismanaged plastic; Open burning; Plastics waste; Elastomers; carbon footprint; comparative study; emission control; environmental modeling; life cycle analysis; plastic waste; sensitivity analysis; waste management; waste treatment; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; dumping; ecotoxicity; energy cost; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental impact; fossil depletion; incineration; India; Indonesia; land use; landfill; life cycle assessment; open burning; particulate matter; plastic waste; recycling; sensitivity analysis; soil acidification; urban area; waste management; water and water related phenomena; water depletion; India; Indonesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109028714

In numerous studies to crystallize the apo form of the LacI family transcription factor, the N-terminal domain (NTD), which functions as a DNA-binding domain, has been enigmatically missing from the final resolved structures. It was speculated that the NTD is disordered or unstable and gets cleaved during crystallization. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of Cra from Escherichia coli (EcCra). The structure revealed a well-defined electron density for the C-terminal domain (CTD). However, electron density was missing for the first 56 amino acids (NTD). Our data reveal for the first time that EcCra undergoes a spontaneous cleavage at the conserved Asn 50 (N50) site, which separates the N-terminal DNA binding domain from the C-terminal effector molecule binding domain. With the site-directed mutagenesis, we confirm the involvement of residue N50 in the spontaneous cleavage phenomenon. Furthermore, the Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay of the EcCra-NTD with DNA showed EcCra-NTD is in a functional conformation state and retains its DNA binding activity. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Catabolite repressor activator; Effector molecule; Gene expression; Isothermal titration calorimetry; Protein crystallization; Site-directed mutagenesis; Spontaneous cleavage; Transcription regulator; X-ray crystallography","DNA; tissue factor pathway inhibitor; agar gel electrophoresis; amino terminal sequence; Article; binding site; carboxy terminal sequence; consensus sequence; controlled study; crystal structure; DNA binding; DNA protein complex; Escherichia coli; gel filtration; gel mobility shift assay; isothermal titration calorimetry; mass spectrometry; molecular weight; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; operator region; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein conformation; protein domain; protein purification; repressor gene; site directed mutagenesis; X ray crystallography; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117163921

This issue is particularly important in Middle East and North Africa (MENA), which is recognized as one of the most water scarce regions of the world and vulnerable to climate change. Therefore, the objective of this study was an assessment of the different sectors’ vulnerability as well as the overall vulnerability of the MENA countries to climate change. The Notre Dame-Global Adaptation Index (ND-GAIN) was used to investigate climate change vulnerability. Cluster analysis revealed the very high, high, medium and low levels of vulnerability for the MENA countries by distinguishing their extent of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Further results indicated that the MENA countries have an acceptable status of infrastructure and habitat, tolerable health and ecosystem statuses, and inappropriate water and food conditions. Water shortage is also a serious problem in this region, to the extent that it is often assumed that water shortage is the root cause of all other types of vulnerability in MENA. However, the obtained results do not support this assumption. These findings provide insight about the adaptation challenges that should be faced and the choices that should be made in response to climate change, in MENA. © 2021 by the authors.

In general, a positive impact can be seen on the environment, especially in regard to air quality. This positive impact on air quality around the world is a result of movement control orders (MCO) or lockdowns, which were carried out to reduce the cases of COVID-19 around the world. Nevertheless, data on the effects on air quality both during and post lockdown at local scales are still sparse. Here, we investigate changes in air quality during normal days, the MCOs (MCO 1, 2 and 3) and post MCOs, namely the Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) and the Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO) in the Klang Valley region. In this study, we used the air sensor network AiRBOXSense that measures carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ), sulfur dioxide (SO2 ) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10 ) at Petaling Jaya South (PJS), Kelana Jaya (KJ) and Kota Damansara (KD). The results showed that the daily average concentrations of CO and NO2 mostly decreased in the order of normal days &gt; MCO (MCO 1, 2 and 3) &gt; CMCO &gt; RMCO. PM10, PM2.5, SO2 and O3 showed a decrease from the MCO to RMCO. PJS showed that air pollutant concentrations decreased from normal days to the lockdown phases. This clearly shows the effects of ‘work from home’ orders at all places in the PJS city. The greatest percentage reductions in air pollutants were observed during the change from normal days to MCO 1 (24% to 64%), while during MCO 1 to MCO 2, the concentrations were slightly increased during the changes of the lockdown phase, except for SO2 and NO2 over PJS. In KJ, most of the air pollutants decreased from MCO 1 to MCO 3 except for CO. However, the percentage reduction and increments of the gas pollutants were not consistent during the different phases of lockdown, and this effect was due to the sensor location— only 20 m from the main highway (vehicle emissions). The patterns of air pollutant concentrations over the KD site were similar to the PJS site; however, the percentage reduction and increases of PM2.5, O3, SO2 and CO were not consistent. We believe that local burning was the main contribution to these unstable patterns during the lockdown period. The cause of these different changes in concentrations may be due to the relaxation phases during the lockdown at each station, where most of the common activities, such as commuting and industrial activities changed in frequency from the MCO, CMCO and RMCO. Wind direction also affected the concentrations, for example, during the CMCO and RMCO, most of the pollutants were blowing in from the Southeast region, which mostly consists of a city center and industrial areas. There was a weak correlation between air pollutants and the temperature and relative humidity at all stations. Health risk assessment analysis showed that non-carcinogenic risk health quotient (HQ) values for the pollutants at all stations were less than 1, suggesting unlikely non-carcinogenic effects, except for SO2 (HQ &gt; 1) in KJ. The air quality information showed that reductions in air pollutants can be achieved if traffic and industry emissions are strictly controlled. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, barley chromosome regions affecting soil microbial biomass-C (MBC), dissolved organic-C (DOC) and root biomass were characterised. Methods: A quantitative trait loci analysis approach was applied to identify barley chromosome regions affecting soil MBC, soil DOC and root biomass. This was done using barley Recombinant Chromosome Substitution Lines (RCSLs) developed with a wild accession (Caesarea 26-24) as a donor parent and an elite cultivar (Harrington) as recipient parent. Results: Significant differences in root-derived MBC and DOC and root biomass among these RCSLs were observed. Analysis of variance using single nucleotide polymorphisms genotype classes revealed 16 chromosome regions influencing root-derived MBC and DOC. Of these chromosome regions, five on chromosomes 2H, 3H and 7H were highly significant and two on chromosome 3H influenced both root-derived MBC and DOC. Potential candidate genes influencing root-derived MBC and DOC concentrations in soil were identified. Conclusion: The present findings provide new insights into the barley genetic influence on soil microbial communities. Further work to verify these barley chromosome regions and candidate genes could promote marker assisted selection and breeding of barley varieties that are able to more effectively shape soil microbes and soil processes via rhizodeposition, supporting sustainable crop production systems. © 2021, The Author(s).","Barley (Hordeum vulgare); Crop breeding; Plant–microbe interactions; Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping; Soil microbial biomass carbon; Sustainable agriculture","carbon cycle; chromosome; crop production; genetic algorithm; genetic analysis; genotype; identification method; soil carbon; Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113396936

One of the challenges is to determine climate change adaptation sites. The complexity raises considering climate change impact a wide range of economic sectors, which require a lot of resources to conduct a comprehensive climate change assessments. This study proposes the use of climate change hotspots as an initiative to firstly consider the potential targeted sites. The target of global efforts to maintain air temperature under 2°C was employed as a clue to prioritize areas that air temperature is increasing beyond the thresholds to which can affect human activities. This study employed spatial and threshold analysis to develop climate change hotspots of projected temperature change for 2021-2050 over Indonesia. The thresholds were defined by considering the effects of base temperature of 32 °C, 35 °C, and 38 °C on agriculture, environment, and human health in combination with elevated temperature from 0.75 to 2 °C. The initiative method was applied to the baseline and projected air temperature obtained from higher resolution of climate model outputs simulated under representative carbon pathway scenario of 4.5 (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) as a case study. The maps of climate change hotspots provide the potential targeted areas for climate change adaptation actions. Referring to the target of suppressing global temperatures below 2°C, we identified the distribution of climate change hotspots in Indonesia with a scenario of increasing temperature of 2°C from baseline conditions so that future air temperatures will be more than 35°C. The maps can also be combined with the other maps related to climate change analyses, which are available in Indonesia such as SIDIK to refine the priority areas and/or more general geographic information such as city location. As an example, the overlay of climate change hotspots and city location can provide early anticipation on which city will experience urban heat island. The development of climate change hotspots nationally is also expected to initiate climate change services that can be provided to the end users to ease them in defining suitable actions to adapt to the impacts of climate change. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","adaptation; air temperature; Climate change; hotspots; site; threshold",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120866798

Accurate quantification of CO2 is critical for addressing the global challenge of climate change and for designing mitigation strategies aimed at stabilizing CO2 emissions. Satellites provide the most effective way to monitor the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. In this study, we utilized the concentration of the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2, i.e., XCO2 retrieved from a CO2 monitoring satellite, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), and the net primary productivity (NPP) provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate the anthropogenic CO2 emissions using the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) over East and West Asia. OCO-2 XCO2, MODIS NPP, and the Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic Carbon dioxide (ODIAC) CO2 emission datasets for a period of 5 years (2015-2019) were used in this study. The annual XCO2 anomalies were calculated from the OCO-2 retrievals for each year to remove the larger background CO2 concentrations and seasonal variability. The XCO2 anomaly, NPP, and ODIAC emission datasets from 2015 to 2018 were then used to train the GRNN model, and, finally, the anthropogenic CO2 emissions were estimated for 2019 based on the NPP and XCO2 anomalies derived for the same year. The estimated and the ODIAC CO2 emissions were compared, and the results showed good agreement in terms of spatial distribution. The CO2 emissions were estimated separately over East and West Asia. In addition, correlations between the ODIAC emissions and XCO2 anomalies were also determined separately for East and West Asia, and East Asia exhibited relatively better results. The results showed that satellite-based XCO2 retrievals can be used to estimate the regional-scale anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and the accuracy of the results can be enhanced by further improvement of the GRNN model with the addition of more CO2 emission and concentration datasets. © 2021 Farhan Mustafa et al.",,"anthropogenic source; artificial neural network; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; data set; emission control; MODIS; OCO; Far East; West Asia; Satellites; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119969156

Particle number concentrations (PNC) were recorded simultaneously inside and outside the cabin of a vehicle during 45 field trips in and around Paris (France) between 2016 and 2017. For a fixed ventilation setting, the impacts of external parameters were investigated to assess commuter's exposure for a wide range of traffic conditions, including the presence of tunnels and ring road, various times during the day, the specific driving routes, different road types and vehicle speeds. Overall, our results indicate that roadway tunnels represent the worse situation for commuters resulting in the highest concentrations outside and inside the car cabin, followed by the ring road around Paris. Comparisons with a previous study undertaken in Paris and its inner and outer suburbs in 2007 reveal drastic reduction of Particle Number Concentrations (PNC) in the car cabin over this period of 10 years. More stringent emission regulations, changes in the vehicle fleet and development of low emission zones explain these promising results.

Drawing on findings from key informant and group interviews as well as analysis of policy documents, we argue that political reform processes – including devolution and changing land and forest policies – combined with “green militarisation” and socio-environmental changes have profound implications for the politics of forest governance in Mukogodo. The way policy reforms interact with wider political dynamics has important implications for the management of environmental change. We find that competing claims to authority both within and between communities are exacerbated by increasingly weaponised resource management regimes, electoral politics and a territorialisation of resource rights. Contestations and tensions between different social groups ensue as some gain secure access to forest resources while others do not. Claims to decision-making authority over resources or to socio-political positions in general are often made based on ethnicity, gender, age, clan, education levels or other dimensions of social differentiation. The way that groups and organisations portray others as mismanaging the forest – and themselves as solving the problem – also forms part of how authority claims are being made in forest governance. The result is a forest governance regime that exhibits less flexibility and cooperation between social groups living in and around the forest, thus undermining livestock mobility and other practices that are critical for the resilience of pastoral systems in a changing climate. © 2021 The Authors","Authorities; Climate change; Conflict; Forest governance; Political reforms; Subjectivities","Decision making; Forestry; Natural resources; Public policy; Authority; Changing climate; Conflict; Environmental change; Forest governance; Political changes; Political reform; Social and environmental; Social groups; Subjectivity; Climate change; Decision Making; Dimensions; Dynamics; Forestry; Interviews; Kenya; Natural Resources; Resource Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115257945

Strengthening local green technologies and promoting local utilization will reduce carbon emissions that could be generated during transportation and delivery of green products from one country to another. In this paper we developed bio-oil/diesel blends using a low-tech pyrolysis system designed for smallholder farmers in developing countries and tested their appropriateness for diesel engines using standard ASTM methods. Corn stover retrieved from smallholder farmers in Gayaza, Uganda were pyrolyzed in a batch rocket stove reactor at 350 °C and liquid bio-oil harvested. Bio-oil chemical composition was analyzed by Gas Chromatography equipped with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). Bio-oil/diesel emulsions in ternary concentrations 5%, 10% and 20% bio-oil weight were developed with 1% concentration of sorbitan monolaurate as an emulsifier. The bio-oil/diesel emulsions and distillates had property ranges: specific gravities at 15 °C 827.4–830.7 kg m−3, specific gravities at 20 °C 823.9–827.2 kg m −3, kinematic viscosities at 40 °C 3.01–3.22 mm2/s, initial boiling points 140–160 °C, final boiling points 354–368 °C, and calculated cetane indexes 56.80–57.63. These properties of the bio-oil/diesel blends and their distillates compare well with standard transportation diesel fuel.

Attaining these benefits requires accurate kinetic modeling of LT chain branching, which depends heavily on ketohydroperoxide (KHP) decomposition. For diethyl ether (DEE), a promising biofuel, current estimates of the KHP decomposition rate constant are largely based on empirical fits to data. In this study, we investigate the most important KHP isomer in DEE LT oxidation by applying variable reaction coordinate transition state theory to the main pathway for KHP decomposition: OO bond fission to produce •OH and a keto-alkoxy radical, •OQ'O. We also use ab initio kinetics methods to investigate the decomposition of •OQ'O, where we find dominant branching to acetic acid, with the remaining flux going to CH3C(O)OCHO. Additionally, new time-resolved measurements of DEE and acetic acid concentrations during LT (450−600 K) DEE oxidation are obtained in a laser photolysis flow reactor coupled with multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry. These new experimental data, along with jet-stirred reactor data in the literature, are compared with the predictions of a recent DEE mechanism (Tran et al. Proc. Comb. Inst. 2019, 37, 511−519) that was modified with the newly calculated ab initio rate constants for KHP and •OQ'O decomposition. The predictions of the modified mechanism are quite poor when compared to the experimental data; this is primarily due to the new KHP ⇄ •OQ'O + •OH rate constant, which is 1−2 orders of magnitude slower than empirical values employed in recent mechanisms. To reconcile the new KHP rate constant and the experimental data, we explore and quantify the possible role of non-Boltzmann (nB) reaction sequences. The nB reactions have a substantial effect on both the overall mechanism reactivity and the •OQ'O branching to acetic acid. We also provide guidance on the proper implementation of nB reactions in kinetic mechanisms. © 2021 UChicago Argonne, LLC, Operator of Argonne National Laboratory.

Especially in urban areas, negative consequences from heavy rainfall events and prolonged dry periods are rising worldwide. In the past, the various tasks of urban water management were performed by different departments that often did not cooperate with each other (water supply, wastewater disposal, green space irrigation, etc.), as the required water supply was not a question of available water volumes. This is already changing with climate change, in some cases even dramatically. More and more, it is necessary to consider how to distribute available water resources in urban areas, especially during dry periods, since wastewater treatment is also becoming more complex and costly. In the future, urban water management will examine water use in terms of its various objectives, and will need to provide alternative water resources for these different purposes (groundwater, river water, storm water, treated wastewater, etc.). The necessary technological interconnection requires intelligent digital systems. Furthermore, the water industry must also play its role in global CO2 reduction and make its procedural treatment processes more efficient; this will also only succeed with adequate digital systems. Although digitization has experienced an enormous surge in development over the last five years and numerous solutions are available to address the challenges described previously, there is still a large gap between the scope of offerings and their implementation. Researchers at Hof University of Applied Sciences have investigated the reasons for this imbalance as part of WaterExe4.0, the first meta-study on digitization in the German-speaking water industry, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Only 11% of roughly 700 identified products, projects and studies relate to real applications. For example, the surveyed experts of the water sector stated that everyday problems are considered too little or hardly at all in new solutions, which greatly overburdens users. Furthermore, they see no adequate possibility for a systematic analysis of new ideas to identify significant obstacles and to find the best way to start and implement a digitization project. The results from four methodologically different sub-surveys (literature and market research, survey, expert interviews and workshops) provide a reliable overview of the current situation in the German-speaking water industry and its expectations for the future. The results are also transferable to other countries. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, the utilization of renewable and clean energy not only increases regional energy security but also alleviate the environmental risk. In this study, we employ the lifecycle assessment to examine the electricity generation from the use of municipal solid waste in China, and then investigate the emission reduction from this application. Different supply patterns of the wastes are also compared to make the results more robust. The results show that if recycled wastes are fully utilized, approximately 11,107 GWh can be generated, along with a profit of $1.2 billion from energy sales. In this case, the CO2 emission will reduce by 9.7 million metric tons. If the food waste is used in compositing and animal feed, the net power generation and emission reduction are about 8,216 GWh and 7.32 million metric tons, respectively. If additional 30% of recycled wastes are assumed to be utilized in their past use, the power generation, profit, and emission reduction will further decrease to 5,750 GWh, $697 million, and 5.12 metric tons, respectively. The results point out that the utilization of recycled wastes can effectively reduce the reliance on fossil fuels, improve energy security, and increase social welfare. Insights of the results and policy implications are also discussed in detail. © The Author(s) 2021.","emission reduction; incinerator; lifecycle assessment; renewable energy; waste recycling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120439190

Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power system has been acknowledged as a rare existing opportunity to utilize low-quality solid fuels with reduced emissions and co-generation of power, fuels and chemicals. Country like, Pakistan, where huge reserves of low-quality coal are present can benefit from this technology. In this work, the steady-state thermodynamic and economic evaluation of IGCC co-generation system has been performed for methane and ammonia production along with power generation. Gasification of coal has been simulated using entrained flow Shell gasifier under thermochemical equilibrium with the Gibbs free energy approach using local Thar lignite in Aspen Plus® V.11. The designs simulated include, IGCC 100% power with and without carbon capture, and IGCC co-generation system with carbon capture with varied production of methane, ammonia and electricity. Thermal efficiency, cost of electricity and CO2 avoided costs have been evaluated for 100% power design. Total capital in the form of total overnight cost and operating cost (fixed and variable) has been evaluated to account annualized expenditure for co-generation designs. Absorption refrigeration system (ARS) has been integrated with IGCC designs to meet the partial chilling requirement of lean solvent in Selexol process, which caused the reduction in CO2 emission because of reduced auxiliary power consumption. The net electrical efficiency of 100% power (design-2) is 32.33%, and the improved efficiency after ARS integration is 32.61%.

Thus, the majority of the population will live in cities. The urbanization model and the transport system of the city inherited from the 20th century have become disarticulated. There is a new trend for reinventing the frugal and sustainable city. This takes into account all the aspects of the ecological transition, especially energy, in the face of the climate challenge. This challenge is part of the Urban Project approach, which stems from postmodernist theory. The innovative idea of this collaborative intelligence aims to redesign the connected and more ecological city. This thinking is about green growth integrated with the carbon neutrality strategy. Today, this vision of urban renewal is based on sustainability which is a fundamental criterion in the eco-design of the safe and resilient city. It supports the use of renewable energies, the issue of climate change, the health emergency as well as the use of Green-Tech in ecological architecture and eco-urbanism, to serve strategic issues, especially environmental ones. The Urban Project will have to be multidisciplinary in the cross analysis of various themes. Moreover, this approach must be based on the judicious articulation of spatial and temporal scales. Also, this process must take into account contextual realities while favouring the ingredients of urban ecology. It is a question of supporting biodiversity, the green and blue grid, and above all the use of geo-sourced materials in the eco-construction of the low-carbon city. Certainly, this operational and interactive mode is complex. Consequently, it refers to multiple notions of transversality, partnership, governance and participatory democracy. This inclusive and concerted process is based on thinking-design, resulting from the fruitful meeting of public and private actors around an agile and acceptable city project for the post-carbon era. © 2021 by authors, all rights reserved.","Ecoconstruction; Ecodesign; Ecological transition; Geosourced materials; Post carbon city; Urban project",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121460860

Promoting a circular economy and reducing global warming at the same time is an increasingly important challenge for construction, demolition and recycling of buildings. This study assesses the greenhouse gas emissions in relation to the resource use of recycled concrete (RC-concrete) and transfers the results into a Building Information Modelling application for visualization of the footprints results. The town hall building in the German city of Korbach was selected as a case study, which was selectively demolished and rebuilt with RC-concrete using recycled aggregates from the old building. The production of RC-concrete is compared with conventional concrete made from natural aggregates. The analysis covers the end of life and the production phase of concrete within the life cycle assessment (LCA) boundaries. The environmental assessment is done based on product climate, energy, material and water footprints, as reliable benchmarks for climate and resource efficiency in the building sector. RC-concrete can decrease the material footprint by up to 50%, whereas the reduction potential for the climate footprint is limited and the water footprint can be up to ten times higher with wet processing of concrete waste. The visualization of footprint results using LCA and digital planning software will further enhance the low carbon architectural design and circularity in the building sector. © 2021 The Authors","Concrete waste treatment; Life cycle assessment; Product material footprint; Recycled aggregates for concrete; Visualization","Concrete aggregates; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Recycling; Sustainable development; Visualization; Buildings sector; Circular economy; Climate footprints; Climate mitigations; Concrete waste treatment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Product material footprint; Recycled aggregate for concrete; Recycled concretes; Water footprint; Waste treatment; aggregate; architectural design; efficiency measurement; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; recycling; reinforced concrete; waste treatment; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110585396

Increasing frequency/intensity of natural hazards under climate change scenarios is expected to exacerbate Louisiana's coastal flood risk. Although many factors are involved, land subsidence from marshland compaction and underground resource extraction, shoreline erosion accelerated by eustatic sea level rise (ESLR), and tropical-cyclone-induced storm surge are among the most important. While past research has focused on flood risk assessment and mitigation strategies, including climate change scenarios, few studies examine all of these factors collectively. This study shows present pluvial flood depth and the contributions of additional coastal subsidence and ESLR toward future (2050) pluvial flooding. Then, current tropical-storm-induced storm surge and future storm surge depth modeled by Louisiana's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) under climate change scenarios are presented. Present and future 100-year pluvial flood and storm surge losses (separately, 2020$) to structures and their contents are estimated at the individual building level for Grand Isle, Louisiana, a barrier island town of ecological, economic, historical, recreational, cultural, and aesthetic treasure. Results suggest that the average 100-year pluvial flood depth in buildings will increase by 1.35 feet by 2050, with subsidence contributing over 82% of this total. Subsidence is projected to escalate structure and content losses by ~17% above losses in 2017, while ESLR may contribute ~3% above 2017 losses. A 100-year tropical-cyclone-induced storm surge event amid a “low” scenario of environmental change as defined by CPRA would increase Grand Isle's structure and content losses by 68–74% above the 2017 value by 2027, 141–149% by 2042, and 346–359% by 2067. The (“high”) scenario of environmental change would increase the 100-year storm surge losses by 85–91% above the 2017 value by 2027, 199–218% by 2042, and 407–415% by 2067. Outcomes from this study will offer a more realistic risk assessment model and will direct flood risk managers, property owners, and other stakeholders to build a comprehensive framework to minimize future flood risk in one of the most vulnerable sites in the U.S.A. to coastal flooding.

Conversely, the applicability of research depends on whether it is responsive to the needs and constraints of resource managers and policy makers. However, many scientific fields including invasion ecology suffer from a disconnect between research and practice. Despite strong socio-political imperatives, evidenced by extensive funding dedicated to addressing invasive species, the pairing of invasion ecology with stakeholder needs to support effective management and policy is lacking. As a potential solution, we propose translational invasion ecology (TIE). As an extension of translational ecology, as a framework to increase collaboration among scientists, practitioners, and policy makers to reduce negative impacts of invasive species. As an extension of translational ecology, TIE is an approach that embodies an intentional and inclusive process in which researchers, stakeholders, and decision makers collaborate to develop and implement ecological research via joint consideration of the ecological, sociological, economic, and/or political contexts in order to improve invasive species management. TIE ideally results in improved outcomes as well as shared benefits between researchers and managers. We delineate the steps of our proposed TIE approach and describe successful examples of ongoing TIE projects from the US and internationally. We suggest practical ways to begin incorporating TIE into research and management practices, including supporting boundary-spanning organizations and activities, expanding networks, sharing translational experiences, and measuring outcomes. We find that there is a need for strengthened boundary spanning, as well as funding and recognition for advancing translational approaches. As climate change and globalization exacerbate invasive species impacts, TIE provides a promising approach to generate actionable ecological research while improving outcomes of invasive species management and policy decisions. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Conservation; Invasive species; Knowledge coproduction; Natural resource management; Translational ecology","biodiversity; climate change; ecology; globalization; invasive species; resource management; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109325799

However, currently available control strategies may lead to early Energy Storage Systems aging given that Automatic Generation Control requirements are increasing due to zero carbon power generation integration. In this sense, it is important to analyze the aging phenomena in order to assess the technical–economical usefulness of Battery Energy Storage Systems towards zero carbon power systems. In order to avoid early aging, various proposals on aging-reducing algorithms can be found; however, it is unclear if those aging-reducing algorithms affect the performance of Battery Energy Storage Systems. It is also unclear whether those effects must be internalized to properly dimension the capacity of Battery Energy Storage Systems to both comply with performance standards and to prevent early aging. Thus, this paper estimates the storage capacity of a Battery Energy Storage Systems to comply with Automatic Generation Control performance standard under aging-reducing operating algorithms by dynamics simulations of a reduced-order, empirically-validated model of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. The results show the relationship between the required performance of Automatic Generation Control and Battery Energy Storage System capacity, considering a 1-year simulation of Automatic Generation Control dynamics. It can be concluded that the compliance with performance standards is strongly related to the storage capacity, regardless of how fast the device can inject or withdraw power from the grid. Previous results in the state-of-the-art overlook the quantification of this relationship between compliance with performance standards and storage capacity. © 2021 by the authors.

Since 2005, academics and policy makers have increasingly referred to such changes as transformations. This recent uptake and rapid diffusion of transformation-related concepts in research on climate change mitigation calls for a systematic and up-to-date analysis. In this article, we address this gap by undertaking a systematic review of articles that use transformation-related terms in the social science literature on climate change mitigation. Drawing on a corpus of 198 articles identified from Scopus, we find a diverse, fragmented research field that strongly focuses on the national, city, and international levels, the energy sector, and high-income countries. Although the use of transformation terminology has increased rapidly, there are few shared definitions, which arguably constitutes a serious challenge to scholarship and evidence-based policy making. To facilitate a more cumulative and impactful approach to research, we propose transformational climate change mitigation as a new umbrella term for the varied mitigation-related societal transformations required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. We conclude by identifying priorities for future research. This article is categorized under: The Carbon Economy and Climate Mitigation > Benefits of Mitigation. © 2021 The Authors.

Using a flow-electrolyzer design where CO2 gas feed passes directly through the electrode interacting with the Cu catalyst layer, we observed that the selectivity of the electrochemical CO2 reduction in (bulk) pH neutral media can greatly be influenced by adjusting the structure of the electrode. In this, the variations in catalyst loading and ionomer content can profoundly affect the selectivity of CO2RR. We explore the hypothesis that this originates from the overall mass transport variations within the porous catalytic layer of the gas diffusion electrode. As further evidence for this, apart from the CO2 electrolysis results, we propose a special method to benchmark the reactant mass transport in flow-cells using oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limiting current measurements. Our analysis suggests that a restriction of mass transport is highly desirable due to its connection to a local alkalization and corresponding suppression of pH-dependent reaction products, given the absence of local CO2 concentration limitations. We further show how the electrode structure can be used to push the observed catalytic CO2 reduction selectivity either towards C1 or C2+ products, dependent on the ionomer content and catalyst loading in a cathodic current range of 50 to 700 mA cm-2. Measurements at various KHCO3 electrolyte concentrations agree with the notion of the local pH dictating the overall selectivity and point towards the presence of pronounced concentration gradients within the system. Overall, our work suggests that the differences in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction selectivity at high currents (in a range of pH neutral buffering electrolytes) largely originate from the local concentration gradients defined by the initial catalyst ink formulation and architecture of the catalytic layer, both of which represent a powerful tool for optimization in the production of selected value-added products. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Catalyst selectivity; Diffusion in gases; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrolytic cells; Electrolytic reduction; Ionomers; Potassium compounds; Catalyst loadings; Catalytic layers; CO2 reduction; Concentration- gradients; Electrocatalytic reduction; Electrolyzers; Gas diffusion electrodes; High currents; Performance; Product selectivities; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; catalysis; diffusion; electrochemistry; electrode; reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119653105

This implies the development of legislation and specific regulations that enable the research and development of these storage and management systems for hybrid systems. The research presented here aims to analyze the implementation of the SMES (Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage) energy storage system for the future of electric vehicles. To do this, the need for a hybrid storage system has been taken into account, with several regulatory options, such as the reduction of rates or the promotion of private investments, which allow the technological development of EVs. What is sought is to achieve the market share proposed by the different countries to reduce Greenhouse Gases (GHG), according to their objectives. This approach must be taken from the legislative and regulatory perspective, specific to EVs and charging points, of several countries or regions with different cultures, management models and implementation potential, such as the United States of America (USA), Europe and China. This analysis is associated with the economic study of costs that this storage system may involve in the implementation of EVs to replace ICE vehicles, resulting in possible economic benefits as well as the environmental benefits of the use of EVs. In this analysis, the current high cost of using a hybrid system of these characteristics can be observed with the comparison of three EVs, as well as current data on GHG emissions produced by transport. All this leads to a series of advantages and disadvantages that must be taken into account in order to achieve the objectives that countries have in the coming decades of EV diffusion. © 2021 The Author(s)","Economic analysis; Electric vehicle; GHG reduction; Hybrid storage; SMES","Competition; Cost benefit analysis; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Fuel storage; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Investments; Laws and legislation; Magnetic storage; Superconducting magnets; Current loads; Current power; Economics analysis; Greenhouse gas reductions; Hybrid storage systems; Hybrid storages; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Load density; Storage systems; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Hybrid systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119583988

Characterizing the expansion and contraction of intermittency in stream networks, and understanding how sensitive these dynamics are to climatic variability, is critical for predicting the trajectory of hydrologic regimes in a changing climate. Here, we consider the spatial patterns of stream intermittency, focusing on wetted channel conditions at the end of the dry season, and identify land cover, physiographic, and climate variables that influence surface water presence and variability across years. We trained statistical models with wetted channel mapping data from 25 streams over 7 years to predict both the spatial and interannual variability of the wetted channel network. We then used the models to assess intermittent stream dynamics across the Russian River watershed in northern California, USA. We found that an average of 3.7% of the stream network was reliably dry, while 16.1% was reliably wet at the end of the dry season, with the remainder of the network exhibiting variability in wetted conditions in response to antecedent precipitation. Both climatic and landscape characteristics controlled the extent of the wetted network, particularly antecedent precipitation at seasonal and annual time scales, highlighting the role of hydrologic memory in this system. Given predictions of increased climate volatility, an improved understanding of the spatial patterns and stability of dry season conditions in intermittent streams can inform climate risk assessments and strategies for protecting biodiversity and the ecosystem services that intermittent streams support. © 2021.

Moreover, the possibility of using a renewable source of energy makes this process environmentally compelling. CO2ER in ionic liquids (ILs) has recently attracted atten-tion due to its unique properties in reducing overpotential and raising faradaic efficiency. The current literature on CO2ER mainly reports on the effect of structures, physical and chemical interac-tions, acidity, and the electrode–electrolyte interface region on the reaction mechanism. However, in this work, new insights are presented for the CO2ER reaction mechanism that are based on the molecular interactions of the ILs and their physicochemical properties. This new insight will open possibilities for the utilization of new types of ionic liquids. Additionally, the roles of anions, cati-ons, and the electrodes in the CO2ER reactions are also reviewed. © 2021 by the authors.

To achieve this, a series of destructive (DTs) and non-destructive tests (NDTs) can be conducted on the MSW samples in the BLF. With this in view, several DTs were conducted on these samples retrieved from different depths of the two cells of a fully operational BLF in Mumbai, India. Subsequently, the physical and chemical properties of these samples such as composition, moisture content, volatile solids (VS), elemental content, lignocellulosic content (i.e. cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin content) and bio-methanation potential, were determined by following the laboratory testing, as a function of time. Also, NDTs such as cone penetration test and multichannel analysis of surface waves were conducted on these cells of BLF to obtain geomechanical parameters (viz. cone resistance, sleeve resistance, friction ratio and shear wave velocity) of the MSW. Based on the data obtained from these tests, and reported in the literature, it has been observed that the VS, elemental content, lignocellulosic content and bio-methanation potential of MSW exhibits very well-defined trends, as compared to the geomechanical parameters, with time. Furthermore, it has been observed that the VS, hydrogen-, carbon- and nitrogen-content reduce significantly (≈62%, 70%, 50% and 30%, respectively), following an exponential decay, until the critical time (tcr) (≈4 years) has been achieved. As, beyond tcr these parameters remain practically unchanged, which corresponds to the ‘stabilized MSW’, mining of the BLF can be initiated without further delay. © The Author(s) 2021.","bioreactor landfill; critical time; Decomposition of municipal solid waste; destructive and non-destructive tests; landfill mining; physico–chemico–geomechanical properties","Bioconversion; Bioreactors; Cellulose; Geomechanics; Hydrogenation; Land fill; Methanation; Municipal solid waste; Shear flow; Shear waves; Surface waves; Wave propagation; Bioreactor landfill; Critical time; Decomposition of municipal solid waste; Destructive and non-destructive test; Elemental contents; Geomechanical properties; Landfill mining; Nondestructive tests; Physico–chemico–geomechanical property; Volatile solid; Nondestructive examination; biodegradable plastic; carbon; cellulose; hemicellulose; hydrogen; lignin; nitrogen; plastic; polyethylene; Article; carbon nitrogen ratio; decomposition; landfill; methanogenesis; moisture; municipal solid waste; nonhuman; physical chemistry; shear stress; solid waste management; bioreactor; India; solid waste; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; Cells; Cellulose; Hydrogenation; Land Fill; Nondestructive Tests; Parameters; Samples; Shear Flow; Bioreactors; Cellulose; India; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115654070

NZC is an emerging topic with multiple variations in terms of scope and calculated methods, which complicates quantifying its performance. This paper covers three key barriers in achieving NZC targets: (1) the main focus of current definitions on buildings, disregarding community power systems and energy use in transportation; (2) different requirements (source, supply, metrics, etc.) in the existing definitions; and (3) lack of updated published reports to track the progress of committed NZC targets. The importance of this research is summarized as due to increased savings in primary energy and greenhouse gas emissions related to the three main energy sectors, namely power systems, buildings, and transportation (PBT). To clarify the current NZC, this paper reviews: (1) variations in the existing definitions and criteria from peer-reviewed publications; (2) the latest climate projection models by policymakers to achieve net zero by 2050; (3) the literature on renewable-based power systems; and (4) three planned NZC cases in international locations, in order to study their NZC targets, energy performance, and challenges. The outcome highlights NZC design guidelines, including energy efficiency measures, electrification, and renewables in PBT sectors that help stakeholders including policymakers, developers, designers, and engineers speed up achievement of NZC targets. © 2021 by the authors.

Continuous forest degradation and deforestation due to urbanization have led to an increase in atmospheric carbon emissions, risks, and impacts associated with climate change within urban landscapes and beyond them. Hence, urban reforestation has become a reliable long-term alternative for carbon sink and climate change mitigation. However, there is an urgent need for spatially accurate and concise quantification of these forest carbon stocks in order to understand and effectively monitor the accumulation and progress on such ecosystem services. Hence, this study sought to examine the prospect of Sentinel-2 spectral data in quantifying carbon stock in a reforested urban landscape using the random forest ensemble. Results show that Sentinel-2 spectral data estimated reforested forest carbon stock to an RMSE between 0.378 and 0.466 t·ha−1 and R2 of 79.82 and 77.96% using calibration and validation datasets. Based on random forest variable selection and backward elimination approaches, the red-edge normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, modified simple ratio index, and normalized difference vegetation index were the best subset of predictor variables of carbon stock. These findings demonstrate the value and prospects of Sentinel-2 spectral data for predicting carbon stock in reforested urban landscapes. This information is critical for adopting informed management policies and plans for optimizing urban reforested landscapes carbon sequestration capacity and improving their climate change mitigation potential. © 2021 by the authors.

A systematic review of Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed Central, clinical trial databases and recent international rheumatology conferences for interventional and observational studies reporting the effectiveness of DMARDs in TAK identified four randomized controlled trials (RCTs, with another longer-term follow-up of one RCT) and 63 observational studies. The identified trials had some concern or high risk of bias. Most observational studies were downgraded on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale due to lack of appropriate comparator groups. Studies used heterogenous outcomes of clinical responses, angiographic stabilization, normalization of inflammatory markers, reduction in vascular uptake on positron emission tomography, reduction in prednisolone doses and relapses. Tocilizumab showed benefit in a RCT compared to placebo in a secondary per-protocol analysis but not the primary intention-to-treat analysis. Abatacept failed to demonstrate benefit compared to placebo for preventing relapses in another RCT. Pooled data from uncontrolled observational studies demonstrated beneficial clinical responses and angiographic stabilization in nearly 80% patients treated with tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors, tocilizumab or leflunomide. Certainty of evidence for outcomes from RCTs ranged from moderate to very low and was low to very low for all observational studies. There is a paucity of high-quality evidence to guide the pharmacotherapy of TAK. Future observational studies should attempt to include appropriate comparator arms. Multicentric, adequately powered RCTs assessing both clinical and angiographic responses are necessary in TAK. © 2021, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).","Anti-rheumatic drugs; Aortoarteritis; Biological drugs; Disease-modifying systematic review; Meta-analysis; Takayasu arteritis","abatacept; antirheumatic agent; monoclonal antibody; aortic arch syndrome; diagnostic imaging; human; meta analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); tumor recurrence; Abatacept; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antirheumatic Agents; Humans; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Takayasu Arteritis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105379998

Here we compile a new synthetic dataset on anthropogenic GHG emissions for 1970-2018 with a fast-track extension to 2019. Our dataset is global in coverage and includes CO2 emissions, CH4 emissions, N2O emissions, as well as those from fluorinated gases (F-gases: HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) and provides country and sector details. We build this dataset from the version 6 release of the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR v6) and three bookkeeping models for CO2 emissions from land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF). We assess the uncertainties of global greenhouse gases at the 90 % confidence interval (5th-95th percentile range) by combining statistical analysis and comparisons of global emissions inventories and top-down atmospheric measurements with an expert judgement informed by the relevant scientific literature. We identify important data gaps for F-gas emissions. The agreement between our bottom-up inventory estimates and top-down atmospheric-based emissions estimates is relatively close for some F-gas species (1/4 10 % or less), but estimates can differ by an order of magnitude or more for others. Our aggregated F-gas estimate is about 10 % lower than top-down estimates in recent years. However, emissions from excluded F-gas species such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are cumulatively larger than the sum of the reported species. Using global warming potential values with a 100-year time horizon from the Sixth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global GHG emissions in 2018 amounted to 58 ± 6.1 GtCO2eq. consisting of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industry (FFI) 38 ± 3.0 GtCO2, CO2-LULUCF 5.7 ± 4.0 GtCO2, CH4 10 ± 3.1 GtCO2eq., N2O 2.6 ± 1.6 GtCO2eq., and F-gases 1.3 ± 0.40 GtCO2eq. Initial estimates suggest further growth of 1.3 GtCO2eq. in GHG emissions to reach 59 ± 6.6 GtCO2eq. by 2019. Our analysis of global trends in anthropogenic GHG emissions over the past 5 decades (1970-2018) highlights a pattern of varied but sustained emissions growth. There is high confidence that global anthropogenic GHG emissions have increased every decade, and emissions growth has been persistent across the different (groups of) gases. There is also high confidence that global anthropogenic GHG emissions levels were higher in 2009-2018 than in any previous decade and that GHG emissions levels grew throughout the most recent decade. While the average annual GHG emissions growth rate slowed between 2009 and 2018 (1.2 % yr-1) compared to 2000-2009 (2.4 % yr-1), the absolute increase in average annual GHG emissions by decade was never larger than between 2000-2009 and 2009-2018. Our analysis further reveals that there are no global sectors that show sustained reductions in GHG emissions. There are a number of countries that have reduced GHG emissions over the past decade, but these reductions are comparatively modest and outgrown by much larger emissions growth in some developing countries such as China, India, and Indonesia. There is a need to further develop independent, robust, and timely emissions estimates across all gases. As such, tracking progress in climate policy requires substantial investments in independent GHG emissions accounting and monitoring as well as in national and international statistical infrastructures.

Real-time measurements of aerosol light absorption were continuously obtained using an aethalometer while the Aethalometer model source apportionment data, optimized by using levoglucosan measurements, were evaluated against the modelling results of the LOTOS-EUROS chemical transport model. The measured mean equivalent BC mass concentration of 0.57 ± 0.64 μg m−3 was the lowest observed in the Mediterranean region. BC from fossil fuel (BCff) dominated the area throughout the study period with a maximum in winter and elevated levels by the approaching summer tourist season. Diel variability of BC concentrations from biomass burning (BCbb) was observed during stable winter conditions, with clear morning and evening concentration peaks, consistent with the profile of residential heating by wood burning. Up to 88% of BC concentrations were attributed to European emission sectors, with stationary source combustion, transportation, shipping and agriculture sectors being the most influential contributors. Source apportionment of BC highlighted that, in addition to biomass burning, small combustion fossil fuel sources, including land traffic and shipping, should be more strictly controlled in order to limit BC pollution in Mediterranean coastal areas. This study serves as a basis of comparison for future studies addressing air quality and pollution source apportionment in the Adriatic and/or the Mediterranean coastal regions in efforts of mitigation and adaptation to climate change. © 2021 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Adriatic sea; Aethalometer; Black carbon; Levoglucosan; LOTOS-EUROS; Source apportionment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117901968

The aim of this study is to analyze the amount, dynamics of changes, and structure of GHG emissions from agriculture in the EU in the years 2005–2018. The research based on data about GHG collected by the European Environment Agency. The structure of GHG emissions in 2018 in the EU is as follows: enteric fermentation (45%), agricultural soils (37.8%), manure management (14.7%), liming (1.4%), urea application (1%), and field burning of agricultural residues (0.1%). Comparing 2018 with the base year, 2005, emissions from the agricultural sector decreased by about 2%, which is less than the assumed 10% reduction of GHG emissions in the non‐emissions trading system (non‐ETS) sector. The ambitious goals set by the EU for 2030 assume a 30% reduction in the non‐ETS sector. This will require a significant reduction in GHG emissions from agriculture.

The Cathode-ANode (CANode) biofilm community was recently shown to facilitate both reactions; however, the identities of the primary constituents and underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we used metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to characterize the CANode biofilm. We show that a previously uncharacterized member of the family Desulfobulbaceae, Desulfobulbaceae-2, which had,1% relative abundance, had the highest relative gene expression and accounted for over 60% of all differentially expressed genes. At the anode potential, differential expression of genes for a conserved flavin oxidoreductase (Flx) and heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr) known to be involved in ethanol oxidation suggests a source of electrons for the energy-generating reaction. Genes for sulfate and carbon dioxide reduction pathways were expressed by Desulfobulbaceae-2 at both potentials and are the proposed energy storage reactions. Reduction reactions may be mediated by direct electron uptake from the electrode or from hydrogen generated at the cathode potential. The Desulfobulbaceae-2 genome is predicted to encode at least 85 multiheme ($3 hemes) c-type cytochromes, some with as many as 26 heme-binding domains, that could facilitate reversible electron transfer with the electrode. Gene expression in other CANode biofilm species was also affected by the electrode potential, although to a lesser extent, and we cannot rule out their contribution to observed current. Results provide evidence of gene expression linked to energy storage and energy-generating reactions and will enable development of the CANode biofilm as a microbially driven rechargeable battery. © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

The simulation allows investigating the local nominal gap height and the division of the pressure in its hydrodynamic and asperity contact contributions in detail.

Thus, the protection and restoration of tropical peatlands has recently turned into an important strategy to mitigate global climate change. Little research exists that has investigated the impacts and dynamics that such climate mitigation efforts evoke in local communities living in and around peatlands. We present insights on this from Sumatra, Indonesia and use a climate justice lens to evaluate local outcomes. We show how an increasingly transnational network of state and non-state actors has become involved in developing new laws, policy programs and land-use agreements on Sumatra's coastal peatlands, aiming at supposedly win–win low-carbon development pathways. We argue that such efforts are open to much of the same criticism that has been raised regarding previous policies and projects aimed at reducing GHGE from deforestation and forest degradation. These projects disregard local perspectives on development, fail to deliver the promised benefits and, through a reconfiguration of local land-use rights, reduce the capabilities of smallholder farmers to benefit from their land. In sum, our analysis suggests that recent policies and projects aimed at mitigating GHGE from tropical peatlands contribute to a redistribution of the global climate mitigation burden onto smallholder farmers in Indonesia. This occurs through their threefold assignment to protect forests, prevent fires and help restore degraded peatlands. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Climate justice; Indonesia; Peat fires; Peatland restoration; REDD+","agricultural land; climate change; deforestation; global climate; greenhouse gas; land use change; peatland; smallholder; Greater Sunda Islands; Sumatra; Sunda Isles; Trixis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118720231

In this review, the state-of-the-art developments of BiOBr-based photocatalysts for environmental remediation are summarized. Particular focus is paid to the synthetic strategies for the control of the resulting morphologies, as well as efficient modification strategies for improving the photocatalytic activities. These include boosting the bulk phase by charge separation, enhancing the spatial charge separation, and engineering the surface states. The environmental uses of BiOBr-based photocatalysts are also reviewed in terms of purification of pollutants and CO2 reduction. Finally, future challenges and opportunities of BiOBr-based materials in photocatalysis are discussed.

Focusing on Latin America and drawing on the work of James Ferguson, this article examines how green capitalism is established, legitimized, and negotiated among marginalized rural populations through what we call “green distributive politics.” Green distribution refers to value transfers that link state, capital, and civil-society actors in ways that promote environmental protection and green development. Different forms of distribution—such as markets, reciprocity, redistribution, and sharing—are mobilized by state and capital actors as they transfer value to marginalized populations and seek to legitimize new socioeconomic arrangements. Green distributive politics refers to efforts to build consent through distributive programs that both cultivate citizen-subjects with environmental responsibilities and open up longer-term fields of contested sociopolitical interactions with rural populations. The argument is developed comparatively across case studies from Chile (Aysén), Brazil (Acre), and Mexico (Michoacán) focused respectively on sustainable fishing, forest emissions reductions, and pine resin plantations. The article contributes to scholarship on capitalist environmentalisms by critiquing “green marketization” approaches as insufficiently attentive to the sociopolitical dynamics and varied distributive forms employed by state and capital actors to generate consent for green capitalist initiatives. It also elaborates a conceptual framework for green distributive politics that can be applied to other domains within and beyond Latin America. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Distributive politics; Green capitalism; Latin America; Neo-developmentalism; Neoliberalism; Sustainable development","capitalism; environmental politics; environmental protection; neoliberalism; sustainability; sustainable development; Latin America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111076047

MATERIALS/METHODS: Robust treatment planning and biological optimization procedures were developed within a GPU-accelerated dose engine and treatment planning system, establishing a dedicated energy/spot/angle selection protocol for robust SHArc delivery. Initial tests were performed for three clinical particle beams (protons, helium, and carbon ions) on water-equivalent cylindrical phantoms for simple targets and clinical-like scenarios with an organ-at-risk (OAR) in proximity of the target to compare SHArc against reference conventional techniques using single and multi-field configurations. SHArc patient treatments were surveyed in various sites (head, H&N, thorax and pelvic region). Dosimetric and biological features were calculated and evaluated applying the modified microdosimetric kinetic model. To determine impact of LET variations within the tumor volume, a model for hypoxia-induced radio-resistance was developed and applied for particle therapy to investigate impact on effective dose. RESULTS: SHArc plans exhibited similar target coverage with unique treatment attributes and distributions compared to conventional planning, with carbon ions demonstrating the greatest potential for tumor control and normal tissue sparing among the arc techniques. All SHArc plans exhibited a low-dose bath outside the target volume with a reduced maximum dose in normal tissues compared to single and multi-field plans. Moreover, favorable LET distributions were possible with the SHArc approach with substantial increases in LETmax and volume containing high-LET components. Moreover, reductions of high-LET regions in normal tissues and OARs were observed compared to static treatment beam delivery. CONCLUSION: The first arc treatment delivery technique using helium and carbon ion beams is proposed. Evidence suggests that through arc delivery of high-LET particle beams, SHArc therapy may offer uniquely valuable clinical advantages both dosimetrical and biological. Robust SHArc treatments could potentially improve tumor control by overcoming tumor microenvironment resistance factors such as hypoxia induced radio-resistance, and reduce toxicity in critical structures by minimizing high-LET components.

Findings: Nine key cognitive bias were noted, including, pessimism, just-world, confirmation, optimum, curse of knowledge, Dunning–Kruger, self-serving, concision and converge biases. Additionally, the authors report on the interactive nature of these biases. Right-leaning audiences are perceived to be willfully uninformed and motivated by self-interest; centric audiences want solutions based on common-sense for the common good; and left-leaning supporters of progressive climate change policy are typically pessimistic about the future of climate and energy policy in Australia. Impacts of powerful media organization shaping biases are also explored. Research limitations/implications: Through a greater understanding of the types of cognitive biases, policy-makers are able to better design and execute influential upstream social marketing campaigns. Originality/value: The study demonstrates that observing cognitive biases through social listening can assist upstream social marketing understand community biases and underlying reasonings towards climate and energy policy. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Climate change; Cognitive biases; Energy policy; Social listening; Upstream social marketing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114455200

This is a global problem in which the growth of road transport constitutes a major factor. Looking to the future, electric vehicles (EVs) are considered to be the choice technology for reducing road transport greenhouse gas emissions, but their impact on air quality needs to be considered. Taking the UK as a case study, this paper begins by understanding the trajectory of a future scenario without the introduction of EVs, reflecting on the latest emission control improvements in internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). This is then compared to a 2050 scenario in which the introduction of EVs, based on the UK government’s Transport Decarbonisation Plan, is reviewed. This plan includes a ban on the sale of ICEV cars and LGVs, beginning in 2030, with the subsequent electrification of heavier vehicles. By 2030, population exposure to NOx was found to be significantly reduced in the ICEV scenario, with a marginal further reduction found for the EV scenario. The EV scenario further reduced NOx exposure by 2050, with most of the benefits being realized before 2040. For the ICEV and EV scenario, PM2.5 emissions were largely unchanged due to the primary contribution of non-exhaust emissions, suggesting that EVs are likely to yield relatively smaller changes in exposure to PM2.5 than for NOx . © 2021 by the authors.

While this helps to maintain a neutral stance in relation to policy advocacy, this approach may also create reluctance amongst IPCC scientists to communicate affective information about climate change, which could help to facilitate behavioural and societal transitions to manage climate risks. Research from the social sciences demonstrates that communications can influence cognitive, affective, and behavioural engagement with climate change. Specifically, there is ample evidence that people’s sense of ‘efficacy’ — beliefs about personal or collective capacity to respond, and effectiveness of responses — must be appealed to sufficiently alongside communication about the threats posed by climate change, to help facilitate mitigation and adaptation responses. This essay draws on a range of research findings to argue that the IPCC’s scientists and communications personnel can nurture efficacy beliefs about climate change, without compromising on values of policy neutrality, or undermining public trust. Specifically, the essay draws on communications strategies related to vicarious learning, mastery experiences, highlighting success stories, and use of language and imagery, which have been shown to increase efficacy. The essay has implications for how IPCC scientists and the organisation as a whole engages with a range of audiences, and suggestions also have relevance for other communicators of climate change, such as governments, academics, journalists, health professionals, community leaders, and creative practitioners. © 2021, The Author(s).","Communication; Efficacy; Framing; Language; Visuals","Behavioral research; Visual languages; Adaptation response; Adaptive response; Efficacy; Framing; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Language; Policy advocacy; Public trust; Societal transitions; Visual; Climate change; adaptive management; advocacy; climate change; cognition; communication; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; mitigation; policy making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118694504

Although current global carbon (C) models focus on the coupling between soil nitrogen (N) and C, ecosystem P response to climate warming may also influence the global C cycle. Permafrost soils may see enhanced or reduced P availability under climate warming through multiple mechanisms including changing litter inputs through plant community change, changing plant–microbial dynamics, altered rates of mineralization of soil organic P through increased microbial activity, and newly exposed mineral-bound P via deeper thaw. We investigated the effect of long-term warming on plant leaf, multiple soil and microbial C, N, and P pools, and microbial extracellular enzyme activities, in Alaskan tundra plots underlain by permafrost. Here, we show that 25 yr of experimental summer warming increases community-level plant leaf P through changing community composition to favour relatively P-rich plant species. However, despite associated increases in P-rich litter inputs, we found only a few responses in the belowground pools of P available for plant and microbial uptake, including a weak positive response for citric acid–extractable PO4 in the surface soil, a decrease in microbial biomass P, and no change in soil P (or C or N) stocks. This weak, neutral, or negative belowground P response to warming despite enhanced litter P inputs is consistent with a growing number of studies in the arctic tundra that find no long-term response of soil C and N stocks to warming. © 2021 The Authors.","climate change; experimental warming; extracellular enzyme activity; long-term; phosphorus; toolik LTER; tundra",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119963791

Molecular speciation of biochar compounds has been challenging due to low solubility, aggregation, and immense compositional polydispersity that challenges nearly all mass spectrometry methods routinely applied to carbon-based organic materials. Through a combined technique approach that applies advanced analytical strategies, we provide bulk and molecular characterization of Kentucky bluegrass biochar that can be applied to any biomass or biochar sample. First, we characterize Kentucky bluegrass biochar chemical functional groups by solid-state magic-angle spinning dynamic nuclear polarization NMR (MAS-DNP NMR) and resolve aromatic and aliphatic signals from the pyrogenic material and intact plant material. Next, we isolate water-soluble biochar species by solid-phase extraction followed by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) and identify highly polar, oxygen species across a wide carbon number range. Solvent fractionation of biochar further expands the compositional range and identifies condensed polycyclic aromatic species across nonpolar and polar classes detected by two ionization modes (-ESI and +APPI) by FT-ICR MS. Plotting biochar species with DBE versus carbon number highlights the pericondensed molecular structural motif that persists across numerous heteroatom classes and ionization modes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular level identification of nonfunctionalized PAHs in biochar extracts by APPI FT-ICR MS. Thus, we identify biochar species that span the same compositional space as coal, heavy oil asphaltenes, and coal tar and correspond to condensed ring PAHs. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon; Crude oil; Heavy oil production; Ionization of gases; Magic angle spinning; Mass spectrometry; Oxygen; Phase separation; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Soils; Solvent extraction; Biochar; Carbon number; Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry; Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry; FT-ICR mass spectrometry; Ionization modes; Kentucky; Lower density; Organic materials; Water soluble fraction; Soil pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119328478

Yet there has been relatively little discussion of how the new emergency framing might shape broader governance and policy. In this advanced review, we critically review and synthesize existing literature on crisis and emergency to inform our understanding of how this new shift might affect governance and policy. Specifically, we explore the literature on crisis governance and policy to argue that there is no simple answer to whether the “climate emergency” framing will be supportive of climate governance and policy; rather, more work needs to be done to understand how different political actors respond according to their perceptions, interests and values. To assist this endeavor, we develop a typology of four policy pathways, ranging from “no emergency,” to “no emergency, but recognize risk,” “emergency as a threat” and “emergency as an opportunity.” We highlight the need to consider the effects of multiple and overlapping emergency frames, using the example of the intersection of climate change and COVID-19. Finally, we suggest new interdisciplinary research directions for critically analyzing and refining this new phase of climate change framing.

Soil conservation practices, such as no-tillage, have the potential to mitigate GHG emissions. We examined the short-term consequences of no-tillage with a winter wheat cover crop (NTW) and no-tillage winter fallow (NT) on N2O emissions, N2O reducing bacterial populations, and overall soil bacterial abundance during the summer growing season in the southern Great Plains, United States. Conservation practices were coupled with nitrogen (N) fertilizer application timing (100% pre-plant, 100% mid-season, 40% pre-plant 60% mid-season, 100% pre-plant with N stabilizer). In addition, N2O emissions were measured to determine any functional effects of altering N fertilizer timing and changing bacterial populations. The combination of N treatment and conservation practice affected nosZ clade II abundance in the second year of the study. Diversity of nosZ clade II was evaluated to determine effects on non-typical N2O reducers which were highly abundant in this study. No nosZ clade II diversity effects were determined, although some clustering of conservation system and N treatments was observed in the second year. Nitrogen treatment affected N2O-N emissions during the summer of both years, likely related to overall increased microbial activity and N fertilizer application. Negative fluxes (consumption) of N2O-N were observed in every treatment and tillage combination and were most pronounced in the control (0 kg N ha−1). Negative fluxes are likely due to a combination of low inorganic-N concentrations at various points during the year and a robust clade II population driving N2O consumption. Altering conservation system and the timing of N fertilizer application affects the microbial community and will likely continue to select for unique communities as the system matures. This will also likely further impact N2O emissions from the system and may increase the rate and frequency of N2O consumption.

We describe an automated field system for measuring plant and soil carbon fluxes over such timescales using stable isotope methods, and we assess its performance. The system comprises 24 large (1-m deep, 0.8-m diameter) cylindrical lysimeters connected to gas-flux chambers and instruments. The lysimeters contain intact, naturally structured C3 soil planted with a C4 grass. Fluxes of CO2 and their 13C isotope composition are measured three times daily in each lysimeter, and the isotope composition is used to partition the fluxes between plant and soil sources. We investigate the following potential sources of error in the measurement system and show they do not significantly affect the measured CO2 fluxes or isotope signatures: gas leaks, the rate of gas flow through sampling loops, instrument precision and drift, the concentration dependence of isotope measurements, and the linearity of CO2 accumulation in the chambers and associated isotope fractionation resulting from different rates of 13CO2 and 12CO2 diffusion from the soil. For the loamy grassland soil and US prairie grass (Bouteloua dactyloides) tested, the precision of CO2 flux measurements was ±0.04% and that of the flux partitioning ±0.40%. We give examples of diurnal and seasonal patterns of plant and soil C fluxes and soil temperature and moisture. We discuss the limitations of the isotope methodology for partitioning fluxes as applied in our system. We conclude that the system is suitable for measuring net ecosystem respiration fluxes and their plant and soil components with sufficient precision to resolve diurnal and seasonal patterns. Highlights: We describe an automated system for measuring plant and soil carbon fluxes under field conditions. We exploit the large difference in isotope signatures between C3 and C4 soils and plants to partition the net flux. Possible sources of error are quantified and shown to be small.

Academics and activists have called for climate policies and practices that affirm climate justice; ensuring that climate policies cater for all rather than reinforcing existing systemic inequalities. Climate justice often focuses on the scale of the urban through climate urbanism, which is emerging as a new mode to consider how urban lives are lived in relation to the climate crisis, mitigation, and action. Criticisms exist that climate urbanism is a continuation of neoliberal urbanism with little to no consideration of marginalised groups’ experiences. However, by only considering dominant narratives within climate urbanism, we risk perpetuating the inequalities that already exist for marginalised groups. Building on the work of academics, artists, and activists working with indigenous communities, this article advocates for an intersectional approach to climate urbanism amongst marginalised groups. An intersectional approach allows scholars to investigate groups of people through multiple axes of identity and consider the kyriarchal multiple systems that dominate and oppress people. I contextualise the need for an intersectional approach by looking at Irish Travellers as a marginalised group and the current Irish climate policy context. Lessons from climate action in one marginalised group can enable broader conceptualisations of concepts such as climate justice and climate urbanism. As an emerging research agenda, to prevent the reproduction of systemic inequalities through climate policies, academics need to advocate for intersectional climate urbanism. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate action; Climate urbanism; Debates; Intersectionality; Marginalized groups","adaptive management; climate change; environmental justice; environmental policy; urban climate; Ireland",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114166407

States' acceptance of temperature targets as a collective objective is relevant to interpreting the standard of due diligence applicable to mitigation obligations only inasmuch as this objective is actually reflected in consistent State practice. At present, temperature targets represent essentially an agreement on a direction of travel: the need for more mitigation action. Over time, the acceptance of this objective could facilitate further legal developments as States agree on particular implications of temperature targets and on a requirement that each of them acts consistently with its interpretation of these targets. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

In this exploratory study, we extend the Index to include future climate change and population projections using RCP 8.5 climate projections of coastal flood, river flood and drought, and SSP3 and SSP5 population projections for the period 2036 to 2065. For the three hazards considered, annually 1.3 billion people (150% increase), 1.8 billion people (249% increase) and 1.5 billion people (197% increase) in the mid-21st century are projected to be exposed under the 2015, SSP3 and SSP5 population estimates, respectively. Drought shows the highest exposure levels followed by river flood and then coastal flood, with some regional differences. The largest exposed population is projected in Asia, while the largest percent changes are projected in Africa and Oceania. Countries with largest current and projected risk including non-climatic factors are generally located in Africa, West and South Asia and Central America. An uncertainty analysis of the extended index shows that it is generally robust and not influenced by the methodological choices. The projected changes in risk and coping capacity (vulnerability) due to climate change are generally greater than those associated with population changes. Countries in Europe, Western and Northern Asia and Africa tend to show higher reduction levels in vulnerability (lack of coping capacity) required to nullify the adverse impacts of the projected amplified hazards and exposure. The required increase in coping capacity (decreased vulnerability) can inform decision-making processes on disaster risk reduction and adaptation options to maintain manageable risk levels at global and national scale. Overall, the extended INFORM Risk Index is a means to integrate Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation policy agendas to create conditions for greater policy impact, more efficient use of resources and more effective action in protecting life, livelihoods and valuable assets. © 2021 The Authors","Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk reduction; Indicator-based assessments; INFORM Risk Index; MRE measures; Ordered weighted averaging","climate change; crisis management; decision making; disaster management; future prospect; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis; vulnerability; Africa; Central America; Europe; South Asia; Indicator indicator; Oceania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119150188

Home confinement, measures to limit non-essential economic activity and travel restrictions in many countries during the spring of 2020 ledto rapid air quality improvements in cities. A detailed analysis of Barcelona's daily immissions of seven pollutants (CO, SO2, NO, NO2, NOx, PM10 and O3) shows a clear decrease from mid-March to June, with the peak in April and the nitrogen oxides. For these pollutants the reduction of traffic density is very likely the main cause of their immissions decrease. On another note, the global reduction of CO2 emissions derived from the use of fossil fuels was estimated at approximately 8 % in 2020, which, despite constituting an unprecedented drop, will have little impact on concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The current situation must be seen as an opportunity to push, without delay, for a drastic change in the energy and economy models towards a socio-environmental paradigm based on sustainability, economic efficiency and solidarity between peoples. © 2021 Asociacion de Geografos Espanoles.

This quasi-experimental study compared hourly fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10) particulate matter measurements from six air monitors (three beta attenuation monitors; three low-cost sensors) in commercial and low/middle-income residential areas of Temuco, Chile between 2019 and 2020. The potential impact of varying annual meterological conditions on air quality was also assessed. During COVID-19 lockdown, average monthly ambient PM2.5 concentrations in a commercial and middle-income residential neighborhood of Temuco were up to 50% higher (from 12 to 18 μg/m3) and 59% higher (from 22 to 35 μg/m3) than 2019 levels, respectively.

The currently available numerical tools for the 3D detailed mechanical limit state study of the structural behavior of retrofitted RC elements are currently bound by numerous numerical and computational constraints, thus are usually implemented at the level of a single structural member under nonlinear or elastic monotonic loading. This work alleviates these constraints through the use of the hybrid modeling (HYMOD) approach [1–3] which is used to develop a finite element model that is numerically validated through the use of a full-scale multistorey RC building that was retrofitted with infill RC walls and carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) jacketing. Further validation was also performed and presented in this manuscript on joints that foresaw the use of 3 layers of CFRP sheets. The understudy 4-storey RC building, which was experimentally tested under ultimate limit state cyclic loading, was used to develop 24 models that foresaw different retrofitting strategies. Two retrofitting techniques were investigated herein, the CFRP jacketing and the infill RC shear walls, where for the case of the later four different rebar materials were investigated (Steel-, Glass-, Aramid- and Carbon-FRP). In order to determine the optimum cost-effectiveness of each strengthening intervention, an optimum retrofitting cost-effectiveness factor is proposed that takes into account the overall cost of the retrofitting strategy in relation to the respective strength and energy dissipation enhancement that is achieved compared to the initial bare RC frame. Based on the proposed factor and the numerical findings during the seismic assessment of the understudy retrofitting strategies, it was concluded that the use of infill RC shear walls with Aramid-FRP rebars was the most cost-effective strengthening method when both strength and energy dissipation enhancement was within the desired design. For the case where the main objective was the increase of strength (base shear) the use of infill RC shear walls with CFRP rebars was found to be the most cost-effective option. Furthermore, when comparing standard steel-reinforced shear walls with CFRP jacketing, the use of CFRP sheets was found to be more cost-effective in the case where strength enhancement was the main objective. According to the numerical investigation performed herein, more numerical investigation is deemed necessary for the study of the cost-effectiveness of more strengthening methods and seismic isolation systems, where more RC structures and bridges will also be considered. © 2021","CFRP jacketing; Cost optimization; G-A-CFRP rebars; Infill RC shear walls; Nonlinear cyclic loading; Retrofitting design","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cyclic loads; Decision making; Earthquakes; Energy dissipation; Infill drilling; Numerical methods; Reinforced concrete; Seismic design; Shear walls; Strengthening (metal); Carbon fiber reinforced polymer jacketing; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Cost effective; Costs Optimization; G-A-carbon fiber reinforced polymer rebar; Infill reinforced concrete shear wall; Nonlinear cyclic loading; Reinforced concrete shear walls; Reinforced concrete structures; Retrofitting design; Retrofitting; concrete structure; cyclic loading; efficiency measurement; nonlinearity; optimization; polymer; reinforced concrete; seismic design; seismic retrofit; shear strength; structural analysis; structural response; wall",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113776453

By utilizing standard deviation ellipse and trend analyses, we studied the spatial patterns and temporal trends of PM2.5 over Pakistan from 1998 to 2016. The outcomes of these analyses indicated that PM2.5 concentrations were considerably amplified in Pakistan, particularly in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh. The areal extent of PM2.5 concentrations below 15 μg/m3 declined constantly, and the area with PM2.5 concentrations above 35 μg/m3 increased significantly. The highly affected cities were Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan, Southern Gujranwala, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur, Sukkur, and Larkana. Overall, the northwest–southeast axis experienced more rapid variations in the spatial pattern of PM2.5 than the northeast–southwest axis; similarly, the east–north axis also experienced faster changes in the spatial distribution of this crucial pollutant than the west–south axis. To support nationwide air pollution control, a two-tier level was recommended for allocated regions in Pakistan depending on their PM2.5 concentrations. From 1998 to 2016, health risks expanded and increased in Pakistan, particularly in Lahore, Karachi, Multan, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, and Hyderabad; these are Pakistan's most populated cities. The outcomes of this study suggest that human health is continuously affected by PM2.5 in Pakistan, and that a plan of action to combat air pollution is immediately needed.

The country is frequently affected by numerous climatic events including floods, droughts, cyclones, etc., which damages the farm household’s livelihood and socio-economic condition. Therefore, this work intends to appraise the smallholder farmers’ perceived climate-related risk, impact, and the factors that influence their choices of adaptation strategies to cope with the adverse impact of the climatic extreme events in northern Bangladesh. Survey data were collected from 300 respondents from two drought-prone districts of northern Bangladesh in January–February 2020. The climate-related risk perception index (CRRPI) was constructed to assess the farmers’ perceived risk. The multinominal logit (MNL) model was employed to explore the factors influencing farmers’ choices of adaptation strategies. Farmers’ perceptions of climate change risk were found to be consistent with meteorological data in the research area. Results of the CRRPI revealed that flood, drought, riverbank erosion, and heat waves were the critical risks perceived by the farmers. Farmers used a variety of adaptation measures to deal with these climatic threats, including agricultural diversification, changes in fertilizer and insecticides, and crop and seed changes. The MNL model results showed that the factors that influenced a farmer’s choices of adaptation strategies were age, education level, family members, income level, year of farming experience, and the farmer’s information on climate change. This study also demonstrated that water scarcity in the dry period and the frequency of crop diseases were the major limiting factors experienced by the farmers whilst undertaking adaptation strategies. Thus, awareness and capacity building through training and support to adopt the adaptation strategies are essential to enhance the resilience of the farmers. © 2021 by the authors.

The identification of local development benefits from climate change mitigation is a possible motivating factor to achieve this. However, there is a lack of practical examples of how climate change mitigation and development priorities can be integrated in national planning processes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This work considers two questions i) What are the factors that have to be considered when developing a plan integrating GHG reductions with local development goals?; and ii) How do you structure a process to reach a consensus about the plan itself?. It does this by conceptualising the integration of climate mitigation and development benefits as a policy intervention. As a case study, a national planning process that integrated climate change mitigation with improvements to air quality and human health in Nigeria is conceptualised, ex-post, as an intervention theory model. The key factors identified include the importance of tailoring the planning process to the national context of how development priorities are identified and then used in the allocation of national budgets. In particular, assessments undertaken within the planning process, of emission reductions, and development of implementation pathways provided necessary information on how climate mitigation actions contribute to national development priorities. Additionally, the importance of structuring these assessments within a planning processes that also engaged key stakeholders to allow the information produced by the assessments to be informed, and acted upon, by those responsible for mitigation in each key sector is also highlighted. Finally, approaches for the use of intervention theory as a conceptual framework to design a planning process, ex-ante, are discussed, to further optimise the integration of development priorities into climate change planning. © 2021 The Authors","Air pollution; Climate change; Health; Intervention theory; Nigeria; Sustainable development","air pollution; air quality; article; budget; climate change; conceptual framework; consensus; human; Nigeria; sustainable development; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114691869

The issues regarding the overuse of oil, traffic jams, inefficient use of time, pollution due to overuse of vehicles on the road, and health problems. It is also expected that ride-sharing and carpooling will be more efficient for autonomous vehicles because of their unmanned nature and full-fledged autonomy. When unmanned cars will do the responsibility of carpooling and ride-sharing or car-hailing, many issues regarding booking rides, location sharing, payment handling, and privacy issues must be improved. To cope with these issues, mainly concerning the scheduling of resources, we need effective scheduling techniques to handle all kinds of emotional problems and provide a pollution-free and accident-free environment on autonomous vehicles' roads. Among other approaches, we feel that Data Science provides a perfect opportunity to leverage machine learning models to classify and see what parameters can encourage people to opt for a move towards connected autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we discuss autonomous vehicles, Vehicle-as-a-Service, and their role in reducing CO2 emissions. The dataset used in this study gives insights into the city of Chicago's taxi trips. The dataset includes data about taxi trips, their respective duration, and anonymized data about the passengers. We also discuss some studies by a taxonomy that will identify the gap of an optimal incentive mechanism that will influence users to join carpooling in autonomous cars instead of having their vehicles. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Autonomous vehicles; car pooling; cyber-physical system; data science; machine learning","Accidents; Data Science; Information management; Pollution; Scheduling; Taxicabs; Traffic congestion; Emotional problems; Location sharing; Machine learning models; Optimal incentives; Privacy issue; Proactive scheduling; Resource management; Scheduling techniques; Autonomous vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104670811

It was shown that disturbances in the development of male gametophyte in the zones of technogenic pollution are already realized at the early stages of microspore development and are revealed by the high frequency of small underdeveloped pollen. At the same time, the frequency of small and degenerated pollen was many times higher in the pool of mature pine pollen in the stand under conditions of a low level of pollution than under background conditions. A high frequency of pollen grains with anomalies of air sacs was detected in the stand under background conditions. The results of the study indicate a high sensitivity of the male generative system to technogenic pollution (accumulated in the soil, aerosol, gas) and the possibility of its bioindication in the absence of symptoms of damage to the assimilation apparatus. It was found that most of the pine trees growing on the soil of fine-stone-sandy composition correspond to the categories of weakened and dying ones, which makes it possible to recognize the conditions of the man-made land as extremely unfavorable for the growth and development of pine. The mature pine pollen of these stands is characterized by the peculiar features that distinguish it from the pollen of other stands. The conclusion is made about the negative effect of smoke emissions from the JSC «Karabashmed» plant on the condition of pine plantations and the male generative system of pine, even at a considerable distance from the source of emissions. © 2021 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120399974

Often the efficiency of the cold chain is less than ideal, significantly increasing food waste and energy consumption. Refrigerated transport is a critical phase of the cold chain because of its negative impact on energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. It is estimated that around 15% of global fossil fuel energy is used in the refrigerated transport sector, so there has been a growing interest in the last decades in the optimization of these systems in order to reduce their environmental impact. Vapor compression refrigeration units, usually powered by means of a diesel engine, are the most commonly used systems in road refrigerated transport. This paper provides a review of (a) currently used systems and alternative technologies that could reduce the environmental impacts of road refrigerated transport and (b) optimization models and methods used to minimize fuel/energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, focusing both on reducing the thermal loads and solving the refrigerated vehicle routing problem. © 2021 by the authors.

The aim of the work was to develop a standardized protocol, including physicochemical characterization, biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests, digestate characterization, life cycle assessment (LCA) and economic analysis, to verify the techno-economic suitability and the related environmental impacts of upgrading conventional full-scale anaerobic digesters. Low-temperature (65–85 °C) thermal pretreatment showed the best performances in enhancing sludge solubilization and methane yield (up to 110%), followed by ultrasonication (up to 53%) and biochar addition (about 16%). The solubilization rate obtained after each pretreatment was similar for municipal and industrial sludge; however, it did not correspond to a proportional increase in methane yield. LCA showed that ultrasonication led to the worst environmental impacts at laboratory scale, due to the huge electricity request; however, at full-scale conditions, green-house gases (GHG) emissions could be reduced by 22%, fossil depletion by 25% and stratospheric ozone depletion by 18%, when compared to the baseline scenario (raw sludge anaerobic digestion). The economic analysis proved that the high ultrasonication capital costs could not be recovered in the considered timeframe (15 yr), while biochar price should be significantly lowered (down to 6.5 €/ton) to give an overall positive outcome. Finally, the thermal scenario would be convenient only when considering waste heat recovery. The proposed protocol, including physicochemical sludge characterization, BMP tests, digestate characterization, LCA and economic analysis, could be extended to other existing digesters to compare alternative pretreatment strategies, enhancing renewable energy generation in biogas form. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Economic analysis; Enhanced anaerobic digestion; Life cycle assessment; Pretreatment; Sewage sludge","Biogas; Economic analysis; Greenhouse gases; Heat treatment; Heating; Life cycle; Methane; Renewable energy resources; Sewage sludge; Sludge digestion; Solubility; Temperature; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Biochar; Biochemical methane potential; Digestate; Economics analysis; Enhanced anerobic digestion; Life cycle assessment analysis; Lows-temperatures; Methane Yield; Pre-treatments; Ultra-sonication; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115173517

The meteorological data utilized in this study included maximum and minimum air temperatures, diurnal temperature (DTR) and rainfall for the state of Jharkhand. This data was evaluated on annual basis as well as for monsoon (June–September), winter (October–January) and summer (February–May) seasons respectively. A nonparametric statistical test (Mann–Kendall test) was employed to statistically analyze the aforementioned meteorological data. Prior to Mann–Kendall test, the time series data was processed using pre-whitening test to remove any serial correlation present in the data. An increasing trend in maximum and minimum temperatures was apparent during winter season and on annual basis for the period of study in Jharkhand at 1%, 5% and 10% significant levels. During monsoon season, all the districts exhibited decreasing trend in DTR at 1%, 5% and 10% significant levels except Giridih district where no trend was apparent at 0.0001% significance level. In winter season, no trend in DTR was apparent for all the districts at 0.0001% significance level except Pashchimi Singhbhum which exhibited decreasing trend at 10% significance level. No trend was observed in the annual DTR for most of districts except Dhanbad, Gumla, Kodarma, Lohardaga, Pashchimi Singhbhum and Ranchi. Rainfall exhibited a decreasing trend during monsoon season for all the district at 1%, 5% and 10% significant levels except Purbi Singhbhum district where the trend was not significant at 0.0001% level. A decreasing trend in annual rainfall was apparent for most of the districts at 1%, 5% and 10% significant levels. However, no significant trend was found in annual rainfall for Pashchimi and Purbi Singhbhum districts, respectively, at 0.0001% significant level. The change point test reveals that break years occured during the 1950 decade for annual maximum temperature and rainfall. Meanwhile, for minimum temperature, break years happened in 1920 decade, whereas a mix behavior was found for DTR.

However, little is known on the potential to expand the practice in other regions of Europe. In this paper, sequential crop calendars were developed for different EU climate regions, and the EU biomethane potential of the anaerobic digestion (AD) of sequential crops was estimated for a Conservative_Scenario and a Maximum_Scenario, assuming different percentages of primary crop land dedicated to the practice and biogas yields. A total EU biomethane potential of 46 bcm/yr and 185 bcm/yr was estimated from the AD of sequential crops in the two scenarios, respectively, and the Continental region registered the highest potential compared to the other regions. The additional benefits of the combination of sequential cropping with other agricultural conservation practices and digestate use included in BDR™ systems were also discussed.

The compilation of these indices and indicators allowed the construction of a toolbox (with indicators of hazard, exposure, sensitivity, adaptative capacities, and vulnerability), which offers a consistent conceptual and methodological framework and a set of potentially valuable indicators that may guide future research. Such toolbox is put into practice with the development of an Urban Risk Index for Climate Change (URICC) tested for Mexico City. To develop the URICC, indicators were chosen from the toolbox that were significant for the case study, repeated in at least two of the reviewed works, and with data availability. The URICC –measured at the municipal level and the Basic Geostatistical Areas–, evaluates advances or setbacks concerning the national goal of reducing 50% vulnerability to climate change by 2030 and offers a comparative analysis of climate change risk by 2030 among the 16 municipalities that comprise Mexico City. The findings show that Milpa Alta municipality will experience the most significant setbacks by 2030, while Iztapalapa encounters the highest risk across municipalities. The methods and scales used to assess risk are determinant in producing different results. Assessing risk at the finest scale possible allows identifying specific neighborhood requiring priority interventions. We conclude by reflecting on how the conceptual evolution from vulnerability to risk has impacted the elaboration of risk indices and on the strengths and limitations of our framework. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cities; Indicator; Toolbox; Urban; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114995146

The soil Hg concentrations were measured and predicted mostly by vegetation type as well as soil organic matter, while the Hg in hair of small mammals (Muridae and Cricetidae) showed deeply influenced by soil Hg. Notably, combined with the field survey data, soil and hair Hg were both enhanced in low and mid-elevations, which overlapped the distribution ranges of a majority of mammals. Overall, this indicates that Hg contamination in low- and mid-elevations poses a potential threat to the top predators that consuming small mammals directly or indirectly.

We explored effects of international trade participation on both the carbon dioxide emission intensity and sulfur dioxide emission intensity with a panel data of 179 major countries during 20 years when globalization thrived. Carbon dioxide causing climate change is a global concern. While sulfur dioxide is one major air pollutant causing local health problems. Empirically, international trade participation mainly reduces carbon dioxide emission intensity but not sulfur dioxide emission intensity. Also, trade in goods form is more effective than in service form. However, international trade participation does little to improving a country's overall technology level, implying that regulation enhancement under international norm is the main mechanism. Compared with developed countries, developing countries can reduce both kinds of pollutant emission intensities more effectively by participating into international trade. A case study of China's entering into World Trade Organization (WTO)'s impact on pollutant reduction can provide more evidence.

To understand the air quality change from the perspective of aerosol optical depth (AOD), we adopted two statistical methods of Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to AOD retrieved by MODIS over China and surrounding areas. Results showed that EOF and NMF identified the important factors influencing AOD over China from different angles: natural dusts controlled the seasonal variation with contribution of 42.4%, and anthropogenic emissions have larger contribution to AOD magnitude. To better observe the interannual variation of different sources, we removed seasonal cycles from original data and conducted EOF analysis on AOD monthly anomalies. Results showed that aerosols from anthropogenic sources had the greatest contribution (27%) to AOD anomaly variation and took an obvious downward trend, and natural dust was the second largest contributor with contribution of 17%. In the areas surrounding China, the eastward aerosol transport due to prevailing westerlies in spring significantly influenced the AOD variation over West Pacific with the largest contribution of 21%, whereas the aerosol transport from BTH region in winter had relative greater impact on the AOD magnitude. After removing seasonal cycles, biomass burning in South Asia became the most important influencing factor on AOD anomalies with contribution of 10%, as its interannual variability was largely affected by El Niño. Aerosol transport from BTH was the second largest contributor with contribution of 8% and showed a decreasing trend. This study showed that the downward trend of AOD over China since 2011 was dominated by aerosols from anthropogenic sources, which in a way confirmed the effectiveness of air pollution control policies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol optical depth; China; Empirical orthogonal function; MODIS; Non-negative matrix factorization","Aerosols; Air quality; Dust; Factorization; Matrix algebra; Radiometers; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol transport; Anthropogenic sources; China; Comparatives studies; Empirical Orthogonal Function; Matrix factorizations; Nonnegative matrix factorization; PM$-2.5$; Seasonal cycle; Optical properties; aerosol property; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; empirical orthogonal function analysis; MODIS; optical depth; aerosol; aerosol optical depth; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; biomass; China; comparative study; dust; El Nino; empirical orthogonal function; factor analysis; human activities; mathematical analysis; non-negative matrix factorization; optical depth; particulate matter 2.5; pollution transport; seasonal variation; South Asia; statistical analysis; winter; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; China; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109697596

However, poor low-temperature flow property and high viscosity of biodiesel limit its use in engines. Therefore, alcohol comes into researchers’ eyes as a promising additive for diesel–biodiesel (DB) blends. In this study, the effects of lower and higher alcohol contents with different speeds on combustion and emissions characteristics were investigated in a modified single cylinder diesel engine. The results indicated that the maximum pressure rise rate (MPRR) maintained a consistent drop ratio as speed increased from 1500 rpm to 1800 rpm for the tested fuels. However, B10E10 (10% biodiesel and %10 ethanol by volume) had a big drop, which meant that engine's power ability had a big loss at high speed. The declining rate with speed decreased for indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) when adding alcohol to diesel–biodiesel blends, especially n-pentanol. Moreover, compared with other tested fuels, B10P10 (10% biodiesel and 10% n-pentanol) had smaller cycle variation and more stable combustion state as speed changed, despite it had the highest coefficient of variation (COV) at 1000 rpm. It can be found that has advantages in combustion stability, and can well reduce the total hydrocarbon (THC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions under the condition of medium speed commonly used by vehicle. Overall consideration, using diesel/biodiesel/alcohol ternary fuels may be a better choice for diesel engines. © 2021","Alcohols; Biodiesel; Combustion and emissions; COV; Diesel engine; Ternary blends","Biodiesel; Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Speed; Temperature; Bio-diesel blends; Coefficient of variation; Combustion stability; Emissions characteristics; Indicated thermal efficiency; Performance and emissions; Single-cylinder diesel engine; Total hydrocarbons; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100802201

This study theoretically analyzes the overall effect and the effect of the intermediate LRM mechanism on carbon emissions and empirically tests the impact of LRM on carbon emissions based on panel data collected from 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2017 using the environmental Kuznets curve theory. The results show that (1) the local governments have monopolized the primary land market across the nation, leading to resource misallocation among industrial, commercial, and residential land. This inefficient and unsustainable allocation aggravated the release of carbon emissions. (2) The impact of LRM on carbon emissions has varied among different regions. LRM in the eastern and central regions significantly exacerbated carbon emissions. A greater impact on carbon emissions occurred in the eastern region, while the impact was insignificant in the western region. (3) There are two mechanisms through which LRM affects carbon emissions. One is the restraint of upgrading industrial structure, and the other is the restriction of technological innovations. In conclusion, speeding up the reform of the tax sharing system is suggested to reduce the excessive dependence of local governments on land resources. Meanwhile, in order to reduce carbon emissions, the land acquisition and transfer system should be reformed to gradually achieve the market-oriented allocation of land resources, and the benefits coordination mechanism of different land transfer modes should be established. Finally, we propose different carbon emission reduction policies for the heterogeneity of regional economic development. © 2021 by the authors.

Cities contribute the most to CO2 emissions. However, the contribution of vegetation to fossil-fuel-related CO2 emissions in urban agglomeration is unclear. Clarifying the trade-off role of vegetation can disaggregate carbon reduction targets down to sub-units to adapt to and even mitigate global warming. In this study, the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), one of the world's largest metropolitan areas, was studied using our proposed inter-calibration method. The results showed that the inter-calibration method is satisfactory and that the EANTLI model effectively decreases the blooming and saturation effects of nighttime light. In addition, fossil-fuel-related CO2 emissions increased significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) in the GBA during 2000–2018, while the variation in CO2 sequestrations was far lower than that in the increase in emissions. CO2 sequestrations by vegetation fully offset fossil-fuel-related CO2 emissions in 2000, while the status reversed after 2001. Our findings illustrate the role of vegetation carbon sequestration in offsetting fossil-fuel-related CO2 emissions and emphasize the importance of a CO2 budget. Additionally, the one city, one policy strategy is a good choice for further adapting to and mitigating global warming. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon budget; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon neutrality; Nighttime light data","Barium compounds; Budget control; Calibration; Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Fossil fuels; Vegetation; Bay areas; Calibration method; Carbon budgets; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon neutralities; CO$-2$/ emission; Hong-kong; Intercalibration; Nighttime light data; Trade off; Global warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111218554

The attachment of ancillary donors including carbazole, diphenylamine, and phenolazine to the fused carbazole/carbonyl skeletons further tunes their emissions from blue to yellow-green. Particularly, pure-blue OLEDs incorporating the peripheral carbazole attached emitter exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 22.3%, with a small full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 48 nm. In addition, the peripheral phenolazine attached yellow-green emitter shows extremely small singlet−triplet state energy gap (ΔEST) of 0.01 eV, high photoluminescence quantum efficiency of 82.5%, short delayed fluorescence lifetime of 6.2 µs and good OLED performances with an EQEmax of 21.7%, an FWHM of 68 nm and low efficiency roll-off. These results demonstrate that the new synthetic strategy for fused carbazole/carbonyl molecules provide a valuable reference for the design of high-efficient TADF emitters. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","carbazole; carbonyl; high-efficiency; organic light-emitting diodes; thermally activated delayed fluorescence","Fluorescence; Full width at half maximum; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Quantum theory; Delayed fluorescence; External quantum efficiency; Low efficiency roll offs; Organic light emitting diodes(OLEDs); Photoluminescence quantum efficiency; Synthetic strategies; Thermally activated delayed fluorescences; Triplet state energies; Quantum efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113369774

The contradiction between rapid economic development and increasing energy utilization exacerbates the difficulty of achieving this goal. Here, we explored the feasibility of fulfilling deep decarbonization in the energy system by 2050 in Sichuan, one of the leading provinces in economic growth in China. Three transition pathways sustained by imported electricity, biomass, and natural gas were developed and simulated using the EnergyPLAN model. All the pathways utilized local hydropower, wind power, and solar photovoltaic resources. These pathways were evaluated using multi-dimensional analysis considering energy self-sufficiency, environmental sustainability, and economic affordability. We found that the energy self-sufficiency rate of the 100% electricity pathway was less than 68%, whereas those of the other pathways were nearly 100%. The CO2 emission reduction differed by pathway, with 100% electricity achieving 91.52%, biomass achieving 90.48%, and natural gas achieving 58.17%. Moreover, all the pathways achieved zero direct CO2 emissions with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology. From an economic perspective, the highest system cost, i.e. 1.3 times that of the reference system, appeared in the 100% electricity pathway after introducing CCS technology, and was comparable to the energy system costs of other provinces in 2050. The methods and results of this study can serve as a basis for facilitating decarbonization in any provincial energy system in the long term. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Deep decarbonization; Energy self-sufficiency; Energy system costs; EnergyPLAN; Sichuan","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Natural gas; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Wind power; China; CO$-2$/ emission; Decarbonisation; Deep decarbonization; Energy self-sufficiency; Energy system cost; Energy systems; EnergyPLAN; Sichuan; Transition pathway; Decarbonization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111972558

Pyrolysis is a thermochemical process that decomposes organic matter at elevated temperature and under anaerobic conditions, and it has attracted an increasing attention in sludge treatment in the recent years. However, comprehensive environmental and economic assessment of sludge pyrolysis in China's context is rare, due to the small quantities of full-scale sludge pyrolysis plant. In this paper, we applied our design and operation parameters of full-scale sludge pyrolysis plants to generate the material and energy consumptions of the pyrolysis system under various of conditions, including sludge organic content and moisture content, system size, system energy distribution, and whether or not heat substitution is applied. Life cycle assessment and techno-economic assessment were then applied to investigate the environmental and economic performance of the system. Our results demonstrate the significant environmental and economic impacts associated with sludge properties and system size. Generally, sludge with higher organic content and lower moisture content requires less natural gas consumption, which leads to a simultaneous improvement of the system environmental and economic performance. The system economic performance is more sensitive to the system size, and centralized sludge handling using a larger pyrolysis system is more economic favorable. In the most ideal case, the average global warming potential and minimum sludge handling price of sludge pyrolysis could be as low as −32.5 kg CO2-Eq/t DS and 188.8 $/t DS, respectively. Based on these results, we discussed the pathways that could be taken to further optimize the environmental and economic performances of the pyrolysis system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon Mitigation; Life cycle assessment; Pyrolysis; Sludge; Techno-economic assessment","Energy utilization; Global warming; Life cycle; Moisture; Moisture determination; Sustainable development; %moisture; Carbon mitigation; Economic assessments; Environmental and economic performance; Environmental assessment; Municipal sludge; Organic content; Sludge; System size; Techno-economic assessment; Pyrolysis; design; economic analysis; environmental assessment; environmental economics; global warming; life cycle analysis; pyrolysis; sludge; China; China; heat; human; pyrolysis; sewage; China; Hot Temperature; Humans; Pyrolysis; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109458651

Even though its concentrations are generally low at the regional scale, BC presents very high concentrations in streets (at the local scale), potentially with important effects on human health and the environment. Modeling studies of BC concentrations usually underestimate BC concentrations due to uncertainties in both emissions and modeling. Both exhaust and non-exhaust traffic emissions present uncertainties, but the uncertainties with respect to non-exhaust emissions, such as tire, brake, and road wear as well as particle resuspension, are particularly high. In terms of modeling, street models do not always consider the two-way interactions between the local and regional scales. Using a two-way modeling approach, a street with high BC concentrations may influence urban background concentrations above the street, which can subsequently enhance the BC concentrations in the same street. This study uses the multiscale Street-in-Grid model (SinG) to simulate BC concentrations in a suburban street network in Paris, taking the two-way coupling between local and regional scales into account. The BC concentrations in streets proved to have an important influence on urban background concentrations. The two-way dynamic coupling leads to an increase in BC concentrations in large streets with high traffic emissions (with a maximal increase of about 48 %) as well as a decrease in narrow streets with low traffic emissions and low BC concentrations (with a maximal decrease of about 50 %). A new approach to estimate particle resuspension in streets is implemented, strictly respecting the mass balance on the street surface. The resuspension rate is calculated from the available deposited mass on the street surface, which is estimated based on particle deposition and wash-off parameterizations adapted to street-canyon geometries. The simulations show that particle resuspension presents a low contribution to BC concentrations, as the deposited mass is not significant enough to justify high resuspension rates. Non-exhaust emissions, such as brake, tire, and road wear, may largely contribute to BC emissions, with a contribution that is equivalent to exhaust emissions. Here, a sensitivity analysis of BC concentrations is performed by comparing simulations with different emission factors of tire, brake, and road wear. The different emission factors considered are estimated based on the literature. We found a satisfying model-measurement comparison using high tire wear emission factors, which may indicate that the tire emission factors usually used in Europe are probably underestimated. These results have important policy implications: public policies replacing internal combustion engines with electric vehicles may not eliminate BC air pollution but only reduce it by half. © 2021 Lya Lugon et al.",,"atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; combustion; emission; parameterization; resuspension; street canyon; urban area; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119964263

This explicit representation is expected to reduce climate projection uncertainty related to deep convection parameterizations found in most climate models. A recent surge in CPRCM decadal simulations over larger domains, sometimes covering continents, has led to important insights into CPRCM advantages and limitations. Furthermore, new observational gridded datasets with fine spatial and temporal (~1 km; ~1 h) resolutions have leveraged additional knowledge through evaluations of the added value of CPRCMs. With an improved coordination in the frame of ongoing international initiatives, the production of ensembles of CPRCM simulations is expected to provide more robust climate projections and a better identification of their associated uncertainties. This review paper presents an overview of the methodology to produce CPRCM simulations and the latest research on the related added value in current and future climates. Impact studies that are already taking advantage of these new CPRCM simulations are highlighted.

Using Australia as an exemplar of the many favourable policy outcomes which powerful corporate interests have secured from successive governments in relation to climate and energy policy, it seeks to demonstrate that covert networks of political influence have played a major role in the decisions made and actions implemented in both areas of policymaking over the last fifteen years. Through detailed empirical analysis of a database of current and former senior politicians, political staffers and bureaucrats with employment links to the fossil fuel and resource extraction industries, it argues that these industries have constructed a covert network of lobbyists and revolving door appointments which has ensured that industry interests continue to dominate Australia's energy policy, and that its emissions from fossil fuel use continue to rise. Covert corporate influence in Australia's energy and resource sectors provides an additional layer of explanation for the persistence of structural biases in its financing, policy and regulatory regimes to those accounts which draw on different forms of discourse and policy analysis. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate power; Covert networks; Decarbonisation; Energy policy; Fossil fuels",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115025121

The application of the green concept on mixed-use buildings must consider several criteria, one of which is the comfort aspect. The density of commercial buildings in Medan City causes a reduction in green open space, and even many buildings do not comply with the minimum green open space requirements on their buildings, which can support the development of this city to reduce environmental temperatures. The aim of this study is to analyze the green concept that can be applied to mixed-use buildings in urban areas. A mixed-use building design with the application of green building principles is the right choice to reduce the effects of climate. The green building concept can help reduce excess heat radiation inside and outside the building. The method used is qualitative with data collection techniques through observation. The analysis was carried out descriptively to obtain a mixed-use building model with the green building concept. The results show that land use efficiency, energy conservation, materials and water conservation can be applied to provide comfortable on buildings. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120545703

Closer examination of seismic and well data reveals several important differences in the depositional setting of each “Globigerina-sand” lithofacies, linked to its stratigraphic history. These differences impact the quality of the lithofacies as a gas reservoir. The two periods are around the Oligo-Miocene boundary, a unit previously called the Prupuh Formation but shown here to have two very distinct parts, and also in the later Early Pliocene, a lithofacies called the Mundu Formation. Both these units have tested gas at commercial rates. The importance of analyses and sample observation is stressed, as many important characteristics are not visible on seismic data. Deep marine, tropical and Cenozoic sediments offer good age control from biostratigraphy. Rates of sedimentation are linked to lithofacies and are examined through age-depth plots and geohistory diagrams. In addition there are important lithological features such as the small amounts of allochthonous grains including lithoclasts, in what should be a clastic-starved deposit, as well as subtle seismic bedding styles, and evidence for winnowing. It can be shown that globigerine-rich lithofacies are not the most condensed stratigraphic units, being only moderately condensed and diluted by micrite derived from adjacent carbonate platforms.

In this review, we present the distribution and diversity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB) in the pond environment. Combined with environmental conditions, we analyze the advantages of AOA and AnAOB in aquaculture water treatment and discuss the current situation of pond water treatment engineering involving these microbes. AOA and AnAOB play an important role in the nitrogen removal process of aquaculture pond water, especially in seasonal low temperatures and anoxic sediment layers. Finally, we prospect the application of bioreactors to purify pond aquaculture water using AOA and AnAOB, in autotrophic nitrogen removal, which can reduce the production of greenhouse gases (such as nitrous oxide) and is conducive to the development of environmentally sustainable pond aquaculture.

However, the Li metal anode has limitations, including virtually infinite volume change, nonuniform Li deposition, and an unstable electrode–electrolyte interface, which lead to rapid capacity degradation and poor cycling stability, significantly hindering its practical application. To address these issues, intensive efforts have been devoted toward accommodating and guiding Li deposition as well as stabilizing the interface using various carbon materials, which have demonstrated excellent effectiveness, benefiting from their vast variety and excellent tunability of the structure–property relationship. This review is intended as a guide through the fundamental challenges of Li metal anodes to the corresponding solutions utilizing carbon materials. The specific functionalities and mechanisms of carbon materials for stabilizing Li metal anodes in these solutions are discussed in detail. Apart from the stabilization of the Li metal anode in liquid electrolytes, attention has also been paid to the review of anode-free Li metal batteries and solid-state batteries enabled by strategies based on carbon materials. Furthermore, we have reviewed the unresolved challenges and presented our outlook on the implementation of carbon materials for stabilizing Li metal anodes in practical applications. © 2021 The Authors.

Here, four variants (CuL-1, CuL-2, CuL-3, and CuL-4) assembled from the same CuICuIIL-metalloligand motif form different structures in which the dihedral angles of adjacent CuICuIIL-metalloligands (9°, 33°, 84°, 180°) increase gradually. CuL-2, CuL-3 and CuL-4 belong to supramolecular isomers. The relevant experimental and calculative results demonstrate that the larger the dihedral angle of adjacent CuICuIIL-metalloligands, the higher the stability of the structural variant. Moreover, the metastable structures (CuL-1, CuL-2, and CuL-3) can undergo single crystal-to-single crystal transformation into the most stable variant (CuL-4). Additionally, based on the unique mixed-valence copper structure distribution characteristics and strong alkali stability, CuL-4 is applied as an electrocatalyst for CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), in which CO2 can be reduced to high-value hydrocarbons with a total faradaic efficiency of 85.02% (FECH4 = 67.76%, FEC2H4 = 17.26%) at-1.0 V (j = 477.42 mA cm-2). As far as we know, CuL-4 is better than most crystalline CO2RR catalysts. Furthermore, the corresponding DFT calculation proves that the independent Cu(i) sites are mainly responsible for CH4 generation, while the synergistic two adjacent Cu(ii) sites are inclined to produce C2H4. Significantly, crystalline CuL-4 can serve as a well-defined model electrocatalyst to explore the role of evenly distributed mixed-valence copper active sites in reducing CO2 to hydrocarbons. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon dioxide; Copper compounds; Dihedral angle; Electrocatalysts; Hydrocarbons; Isomers; Metals; Single crystals; Supramolecular chemistry; Different structure; Electro reduction; Metalloligands; Metastable structures; Mixed-valence copper; Modelling systems; Multiple variants; Self assembly process; Single crystal-to-single-crystal transformation; Stable state; Electrolytic reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118278264

However, the selectivity and running current are still beyond practical applications. Herein, we report new unsaturated SACs with CO2 to CO selectivity of nearly 100% at 51 mA cm-2, and 91% at 100 mA cm-2. Such unsaturated SACs (M-Nx, M = Ni, Fe and Co, x < 4) are rationally prepared through a novel CO2-to-carbon process in large quantity and confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. As electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, unsaturated Ni-N2 centered SACs exhibit outstanding activity for CO2 reduction, outperforming state-of-the-art unsaturated SACs. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculation reveal that such unsaturated Ni sites with rich vacancies are favorable for production of more unpaired 3d electrons, and consequently reduce the free energy for COOH∗ formation, therefore boosting CO2 reduction performance. Not only does this work provide a new method towards unsaturated SACs in large quantity, but also contributes fundamental understanding of the unsaturated single-atom sites in electrochemical catalysis. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Atoms; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Energy conversion; Free energy; Nickel compounds; Vacancies; 'current; Active site; CO2 reduction; Electrochemical reductions; Emerging materials; Faradaic efficiencies; Reduction reaction; Single-atoms; X-ray absorption spectroscopy; ]+ catalyst; X ray absorption spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119598080

In achieving the SDGs, green urban areas (GUA) play a fundamental role at the local level as they provide recreational and bioclimatic regulatory functions and act as a carbon sink, as well. Specifically, the GUAs contribute directly to three SDGs: SDG 11 Sustainable cities and communities, SDG 13 Climate Action and SDG 15 Life on land. This paper evaluates direct contribution of GUA to this SDGs with high spatial resolution in the case study of the city of Valencia (Spain). The evaluation carried out has made it possible to make a diagnosis of the quantity and accessibility of GUA at sub-neighbourhood level. The results for SDG 11 show that only 9.23% of the population do not have desirable access to GUA and 2.73% live in areas without easy walking distance access to GUA. On the other hand, the evaluation of SDG 15 shows that each inhabitant has at their disposal 10 m2 of GUA, below the average of cities of more than 250,000 inhabitants in Spain. The high spatial resolution of the evaluation has also made it possible to identify the city areas with the worst access to GUA and the least amount of GUA per inhabitant. In consequence, the results allow determining zones with high potential to improve. Additionally, the quantification of the CO2 fixed by the GUA carried out for the evaluation of SDG 13, shows that the fixed carbon is equivalent to 0.04% of total gross GHG emissions of the city and is 36% higher than the total GHG emissions of the annual fuel consumption of the total fleet in the city. Finally, the monitoring of the indicators applied allows evaluating the evolution of the GUA to improve the sustainable development of the city. © 2021 The Authors","Accessibility; Carbon; Climate change; Green Urban Areas; SDGs","Carbon; Greenhouse gases; Image resolution; Planning; Sustainable development; Case-studies; GHG emission; GHGs emissions; Green urban area; High spatial resolution; Regulatory functions; Sustainable development goal; United Nations; Urban areas; Valencia (Spain); Climate change; greenspace; recreational activity; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; urban area; Comunidad Valencia; Spain; Valencia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118789193

In particular, in the educational sec-tor, the virtual class modality generated changes in the patterns of energy consumption at the institu-tional level; the identification of this consumption will allow us to reflect on new energy saving and efficient use strategies. In this research, we present a case study of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on electricity consumption in 13 state universities in Michoacán, Mexico. Electric energy consumption has been evaluated before and during the presence of the COVID-19 between 2019 and 2020. The comparative analysis estimated the reduction in energy consumption and its economic and environmental im-pact. The results show a considerable decrease in electricity consumption, generating an average saving of 76.24 MWh/month, which translates into an annual emission reduction from 2019 to 2020 of approximately 497 TnCO2e, and in economic terms of $ 8,882.25 USD each month. In general, it was identified that consumption patterns in the use of machinery and computer equipment for administrative activities were drastically reduced. If education continues in virtual or hybrid modes, energy consumption schemes will continue to decline and institutions could move towards resilient, affordable, and sustainable models of energy production and consumption. © 2021 by the authors.

This phenomenon is related to greenhouse gas emissions generated by anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic activities. The most notable climate change effects are the rise of sea levels, changes in the water pH, apparition or increased transmission of diseases, changes in the water cycle, loss of marine ecosystems, and several negative impacts on human health. Due to the adverse effects occasioned by climate change, global initiatives have been taken to mitigate its impact, one of these is the reduction of greenhouse gases such as CO2. Some microorganisms such as photosynthetic bacteria and microalgae can capture CO2 and use it as a carbon source for growth. The outstanding CO2 bio-capture or CO2 phycocapture capacity shown by microalgae make them excellent candidates for reduction of atmospheric CO2 in cities. CO2 phyco-capture equivalent CO2 emissions in Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) was determined as a case study, considering greenhouse gas emissions in this city. It was estimated that 94,847 tons of microalgae biomass must be produced daily to equal the amount of CO2 emissions (170,726 CO2-eq per day), thus obtaining a zero balance of emissions. For the above, CO2 phyco-capture implementation can be possible in cities and also in open spaces and that even its production can work as the carbon credits nowadays implemented, the space required, and the high capture rate led us to consider that the microalgae production on a larger scale may have a faster effect on the concentration of CO2 globally, which can help with greater urgency to the aims established by 2030. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Climate change; CO2 bio-capture; Environmental impact; Microalgae; Urban spaces","Algae; Bacteria; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sea level; Urban planning; % reductions; Carbon sink; Circular economy; CO 2 emission; CO2 bio-capture; Greenhouse gas emissions; Long-term period; Sink-in; Urban spaces; Weather patterns; Microalgae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115059223

A dynamic energy simulation was used to assess the energy performance of an existing office building located in the town of Bragança, Portu-gal. By using a staged renovation approach, two passive technologies applied to the building enve-lope and an efficient domestic hot water system were selected and a financial evaluation through the net saving (NS) method was undertaken to choose the best efficiency measures/packages for improving the building’s energy performance. Real discount rates of 3% and 1% were used in the financial evaluation. Considering the real discount rate of 3%, the results showed that only two out seven retrofit options had a positive financial return. By using the real discount rate of 1%, all retrofit options were found to be financially efficient. The results of the study corroborated those of earlier works that found that the financial profitability of energy renovation investments is very sensitive to the discount rate used in the analysis. The results of the study also suggested that the staged renovation approach used in the analysis is economically feasible, and that this approach is an alternative to one‐step renovation approach to help to achieve the country´s energy and climate targets by 2030.

Based on this growth, it became necessary to consider climatic-meteorological conditions as determinants for boosting tourism in some geographical areas. The main objective of this paper is to characterize the perception of bioclimatic comfort of tourists who visited the city of Porto in the summer seasons of 2019 and 2020 (in the on-going pandemic). Primary data were obtained from a questionnaire on perceptions of bioclimatic comfort and microclimatic measurements applied to 207 tourists in the summer of 2019, 146 in the winter of 2019–2020 and 210 in the summer of 2020. It took place in one of the main places of passage for tourists visiting the city of Porto. Based on statistical analysis, responses were parameterized according to the environmental and sociodemographic characteristics of the tourists. In addition, summary indicators (Physiological Equivalent Temperature – PET, Thermal Sensation Vote – TSV, Thermal Preference Vote – TPV) were used to characterize the profile of visiting tourists. The influence of microclimate conditions on the thermal comfort of tourists was evident, showing, however, that they still felt comfortable regardless of the situation. The results demonstrated a good effort to reduce thermal discomfort through adapted behavior. Air temperature and relative humidity seem to be more directly related to mean thermal sensation votes in the summer of 2019 (r2 = 0.86 and r2 = 0.68, respectively). In the winters of 2019–2020 and summer of 2020, these indicators do not show such a strong correlation. Anyway, it is verified that there is a greater tolerance for higher and lower temperatures than those that are verified for the residents, when compared to previous studies. The consideration of average thresholds for thermal comfort in tourism is crucial. In future studies and planning proposals, it will be necessary to consider the optimal climatic conditions of local climate change adaptation and mitigation policies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","City of Porto; Perceptions; Thermal comfort; Tourism; Urban areas","Climate change; Physiological models; Sensory perception; Urban planning; Case-studies; City of porto; Economic sectors; Human thermal comfort; International scale; Portugal; Thermal; Thermal sensation votes; Urban areas; Urban tourisms; Thermal comfort; air temperature; bioclimatology; microclimate; mitigation; perception; relative humidity; temperature effect; tourist destination; urban area; urban climate; Porto [Porto (DST)]; Porto [Portugal]; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113276484

CO2 ice abundance is retrieved simultaneously with water ice, dust, and particle sizes, and rotational temperature and CO2 column profiles in 16 of 26 cases. Small particles (&lt;0.5 μm) prevail at dusk, while water ice likely provides most source nuclei at dawn. Clouds east of Hellas are found to be dominantly nucleated on surface-lifted dust. CO2 ice is sometimes detected in unsaturated air together with dust nuclei at dawn, suggesting ongoing sublimation. Depending on latitude and local time, the interplay between particle precipitation and the lifetime of temperature minima (i.e., cold pockets) determines CO2 ice properties. © 2021.

We prepared a series of transition metal (TM) doped CeO2 catalysts by impregnating them with vermiculite (VMT) as a carrier for reducing NOx by SCR with carbon monoxide (CO–SCR). The catalyst performance was in the following order: Zn &lt; Cr &lt; Fe &lt; no dopant &lt; Mn &lt; Ni &lt; Co &lt; Cu. In other words, Mn, Ni, Co, and Cu greatly promoted NO conversion compared with Ce/VMT alone, whereas Zn, Cr, and Fe dopants hindered NO conversion. We applied density functional theory (DFT) by structural optimization and potential configuration analyses of CeO2 (1 1 1) and TM–CeO2 (1 1 1), which enabled us to propose the reaction pathway and the potential energy distribution of the transition state. Our DFT analyses are in accordance with the sequence of the NO + CO reaction. The performance of the Cu catalyst was superior to the others. The CeO2 (1 1 1) lattice plane is primarily in the cerium species, whereas the Cu–O–Ce interface forms in two phases, which indicates a complex interplay between the copper and cerium. Furthermore, the catalyst has numerous surface oxygen vacancies (Ovs) and active *O species, and exhibits an impressive reduction capacity: the NO conversion reaches 100% with a gas hourly space velocity of 102,000 h−1 at 300 °C. The CO–SCR reaction pathway on the Cu–CeO2 (1 1 1) surface is as follows: R1: CO + Olattice → Ov; R2: 2NO → *ONNO → N2O + *O; R3: N2O → N2 + *O; R4: *O + CO → CO2; R5: *O + Ov → Olattice. The synergy of the dopants on the CeO2 (1 1 1) surface modulated the distribution of active centers in the catalyst, which in turn modulated the catalyst performance. Our research will be useful for flue gas remediation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cerium dioxide; Denitration; Density functional theory; Oxygen vacancy; Selective catalytic reduction; Two-dimensional vermiculite","Carbon monoxide; Catalysts; Cerium oxide; Copper; Copper compounds; Iron; Manganese compounds; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Potential energy; Quantum chemistry; Reduction; Selective catalytic reduction; Structural optimization; Catalyst performance; Catalytic reduction; CeO$-2$; Cerium dioxides; Density-functional-theory; Metal-doped; N$-2$/O; NO conversion; Two-dimensional vermiculite; ]+ catalyst; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111261553

The combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system is a high-efficiency energy system that can promote energy-saving and decrease carbon emissions. The choices of installed capacity and operation strategies impacts the economy, energy-saving, and environmental protection of combined cooling, heating, and power systems. The aim of this study was to determine the potential and comprehensive benefits of combined cooling, heating, and power systems based on the comprehensive performance assessment. In this study, a comprehensive performance index (CPI) method was presented to optimize the configurations and operation strategies of combined cooling, heating, and power systems in a Japan eco-campus, based on historically monitored data. According to the influencing factors of the combined cooling, heating, and power system in comprehensive performance index evaluation, the adaptability and development potential of economy, energy saving, and CO2 emission reduction were evaluated to consider future renovation of energy systems. In this study, we adopted a seasonal time-of-use (STOU) electricity price to evaluate the economic performance of combined cooling, heating, and power systems and compared them to the time-of-use (TOU) electricity price. The results indicated that the seasonal time-of-use electricity price was more economic in regions that had high cooling demand in summer. By comparing the CO2 emission coefficient of electricity in different regions in Japan, we could estimate that more than 40% of the cleaner energy ratio was positive. The results obtained can provide suggestions for the future development of combined cooling, heating, and power systems. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, Gao, Qian, Zhang and Kuroki.","combined cooling, heating, power (CCHP) system; comprehensive performance index (CPI); optimization model; seasonal time-of-use (STOU) electricity price; sensitivity analysis","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cooling; Cooling systems; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Heating; Combined cooling; Combined cooling heating and power; Combined cooling, heating, power system; Comprehensive performance; Comprehensive performance index; Heating power; Optimization models; Performance indices; Seasonal time-of-use electricity price; Time-of-use electricity price; Sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119430545

In this article, two carbonation approaches, namely hot-stage carbonation and accelerated carbonation, were employed to leach the metals, and the influence mechanism on the metal sequential leachability of the binders composed of 80 wt% of EAF slag incorporating 20 wt% of Portland cement (PC) was revealed. The carbonate products, microstructures, and chemical states were investigated, and the results indicated that chromium, vanadium, and titanium gradually transformed into inactive phases after two carbonation approaches, while zinc appeared the opposite trend. The sequential leachability of chromium declined with the increase of the carbonation efficiency, in which the exchangeable chromium decreased from 1.99 mg/kg in the A2A binder to below the detection limit in the A2C binder and C2C binder. Hot-stage carbonation treatment facilitated particle agglomeration, minerals remodeling, and calcite formation. The carbonation curing of the steel slag paste resulted in the formation of amorphous CaCO3, calcite crystalline and Si-bearing hydrates that covered the pores of the matrix, and silicate structure with a higher disorder. The hot-stage carbonation and accelerated carbonation curing methods were adopted to jointly prevent the leaching of harmful metals and facilitate promising high-volume steel slag-based binders with structural densification and CO2 storage.

Under the framework of cross-market rebalancing theory, in this study, we aim to systematically examine the market connections among world financial, energy, renewable energy and European carbon markets by measuring the return spillovers from 2008 to 2021. We find that the renewable energy market is more closely connected to the world financial and energy markets in the sense of the return transmission, while the carbon market is less connected to them. However, due to improved market regulations and determinations related to fighting climate change, the connections between the carbon market and other markets have gradually intensified. Plotting the return spillover indexes, we observe that strong return spillovers from the renewable energy market to other markets occurred when large investment plans were announced. Regarding the carbon market, regulation changes introduced by the EU Commission to improve and stabilize market environment induced intensified return transmission from carbon market to other markets.

Scientifically and effectively constructing a low-carbon tourism development level evaluation index system is conducive to the healthy and sustainable development of the tourism industry. However, the current evaluation of the development level of low-carbon tourism mainly focuses on low-carbon development, energy conservation, and emission reduction. There are few studies and a lack of specific empirical research evaluating the development of low-carbon tourism. In this research, the Delphi method and analytic hierarchy process were used for data collection and corresponding weight analysis. This research refers to the results of existing studies on low-carbon tourism evaluation index systems, and constructs an objective and quantitative evaluation model. It establishes a low-carbon tourism development evaluation model with 34 specific indicators from the three dimensions of the tourism economic support level, the tourism low-carbon development level, and the tourism policy support level. The research results were applied to the Daxinganling region for verification. The results show that the development of tourism in the Daxinganling region has changed from a mode dominated by economic interests to a mode in which tourism-related parties begin to seek effective low-carbon methods to maintain low-carbon tourism activities. In addition, the Daxinganling region has the lowest level of low-carbon tourism development and the highest level of financial support. Based on the research conclusions, corresponding suggestions for the development of low-carbon tourism in the Daxinganling region are provided. The results are also intended to provide a reference point in the optimization of low-carbon tourism development models in this and other regions. © 2021 by the authors.

Economic growth relies heavily on financial development; indeed, low-carbon economic development is inseparable from financial support. This paper studies the impact of financial development on carbon emission intensity and its mechanism from both theoretical and empirical aspects. Based on the 2005–2018 data on Chinese cities and the Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) research results, this paper finds that: (1) Financial development has significantly reduced China’s carbon emission intensity overall. After considering spatial effects, financial development increases local carbon emission intensity, although it may lead to a more significant decrease in the surrounding area. (2) The analysis of heterogeneity shows that only the financial development in the eastern region has a substantial detrimental impact on total carbon emission intensity and the carbon emission intensity of neighboring cities. The financial development in the central and western regions has no significant effect on carbon emission intensity. (3) The mechanism test shows that financial development mainly reduces carbon emission intensity through technological innovation and structural optimization, with the effect of technological innovation being 9.5%, and the effect of structural optimization being 12.15%. The expansion of the consumption effects of financial development has no significant impact on carbon emission intensity. Accordingly, this article believes that it is necessary to further support financial development, build large-scale financial centers, continue to optimize the structure of financial products, and encourage the development of green finance. © 2021 by the authors.

However, this process confronts a dilemma of relatively high effluent nitrogen concentration (&gt;10 mg N/L), owning to the unwanted prevalence of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and the intrinsic nitrate production by anammox bacteria. Here, a novel technology, named the one-stage PNAM, that integrates Partial Nitritation, Anammox and Methane-dependent nitrite/nitrate reduction reactions, was developed in a single membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR). With feeding of synthetic mainstream wastewater containing ∼50 mg NH4+-N/L at a hydraulic retention time of 12 h, more than 95% nitrogen was removed in the established one-stage PNAM process at a practically useful rate of 0.1 kg N/m3/d. Microbial community characterization and in-situ batch tests revealed a sophisticated microbial structure consisting of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), anammox bacteria, nitrite/nitrate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-DAMO) bacteria and archaea, and a small fraction of NOB and aerobic methanotrophs. The role of methane in removing nitrate was confirmed by switching on/off the methane supply, which relaxed the requirement for NOB suppression. In addition, the established system was relatively robust against temperature variations, evidenced by a total nitrogen removal efficiency above 80% at temperature as low as 14 ℃. The results provide a promising alternative for efficient nitrogen removal from domestic wastewater using methane as the sole carbon source. © 2021","Anaerobic methane oxidation; Anammox; Mainstream; Membrane biofilm reactor; Nitrite/nitrate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-DAMO); One-stage","Aerobic bacteria; Ammonia; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Carbon; Denitrification; Effluents; Methane; Nitrates; Oxidation; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic methane oxidations; ANAMMOX; Mainstream; Membrane biofilm reactor; Nitrate reduction; Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria; Nitrite/nitrate-dependent anerobic methane oxidation; One-stage; Partial nitritation; Nitrogen removal; ammonia; methane; nitrate; nitrite; nitrogen; nitrogen derivative; RNA 16S; ammonium derivative; methane; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; ammonium compound; bacterium; methane; nitrate; nitrification; nitrite; nitrogen; oxidation; pollutant removal; reduction; wastewater treatment; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; anaerobic ammonium oxidation; anammox bacterium; Article; carbon source; controlled study; heavy metal removal; hydraulic retention time; methanotroph; microbial community; nonhuman; surface property; waste water treatment plant; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; denitrification; oxidation reduction reaction; wastewater; Archaea; Nitrosomonadales; Ammonium Compounds; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Methane; Nitrates; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116883257

In this regard, CO2 electroreduction (CER) to formate is one of the promising approaches to converting CO2 to a useful product. However, to achieve a high production rate of formate, the existing catalysts for CER fall short of expectation in maintaining the high formate selectivity and activity over a wide potential window. Through this study, we report that Bi2O3 nanosheets (NSs) grown on carbon nanofiber (CNF) with inherent hydrophobicity achieve a peak formate current density of 102.1 mA cm-2 and high formate Faradaic efficiency of >93% over a very wide potential window of 1000 mV. To the best of our knowledge, this outperforms all the relevant achievements reported so far. In addition, the Bi2O3 NSs on CNF demonstrate a good antiflooding capability when operating in a flow cell system and can deliver a current density of 300 mA cm-2. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the hydrophobic carbon surface can repel water molecules to form a robust solid-liquid-gas triple-phase boundary and a concentrated CO2 layer; both can boost CER activity with the local high concentration of CO2 and through inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by reducing proton contacts. This water-repelling effect also increases the local pH at the catalyst surface, thus inhibiting HER further. More significantly, the concept and methodology of this hydrophobic engineering could be broadly applicable to other formate-producing materials from CER. ©","carbon support; CO2electrolysis; formate production; hydrophobic microenvironment; triple-phase boundary","Bismuth compounds; Carbon dioxide; Carbon nanofibers; Catalyst selectivity; Climate change; Electrolytic reduction; Liquefied gases; Molecular dynamics; Molecules; Reaction kinetics; Carbon nanofibres; Carbon support; CO2electrolyse; Electro reduction; Formate production; Hydrophobic microenvironment; Hydrophobics; Microenvironments; Potential windows; Triple phase boundary; Hydrophobicity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118796654

Understanding the cause of such extreme phenomena is important for further prevention. This study successfully reproduced the extreme dust storms using the Community Multiscale Air Quality model with refined bulk density of different soil types and improved spatial resolution. The wind-blown PM2.5 and PM10 are estimated to be around 15 and 120 µg m−3 in dust source areas (equal 9.6% and 31.0% in average of China), resulting in 1.1 and 2.0 times increases in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in populated regions of the Middle Yellow River Basin and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. The critical threshold friction velocity is the key parameter to judge whether wind-blown dust occurs. Dust flux is sensitive to the bulk soil density (increased by 4.2% and 12.6% for PM2.5 and PM10 after refined soil bulk density) and resolution (increased by 13.5% and 3.5% for PM2.5 and PM10 from 27 km to 9 km). Such results demonstrated the strong correlation between wind speed, frequency, and intensity of dust phenomena from 2013 to 2021. The wind speed can be further enhanced in dust source areas even in the context of a decline in the national average, leading to more frequent and persistent dust storms in March 2050. Only relying on coordinated emission reductions to mitigate climate change, wind-blown dust in northern China still poses considerable potential risks to air quality. Urgent actions should also be taken to improve land-use and land-cover to reduce the area of dust sources. © 2021 The Author(s).

The operating stage has the biggest share in the perspective of whole life cycle analyses. To conserve energy and reduce emissions is a critical issue for the public building sector. This study employs the non-radial directional distance function and data envelopment analysis methods to estimate the environmental efficiency of the public building industries in 30 provincial administrative regions between 2010 and 2017. And the Moran index is used to explore its spatial distribution characteristics. Finally, the factors affecting environmental efficiency are analyzed using a spatial econometric model analysis. The results indicated that the environmental efficiency for the public building industries across China were generally low, whereas their spatial characteristics were high in the east and low in the west, and high in the south and low in the north. There are several kinds of measures that can promote environmental efficiency, such as increasing the proportion of tertiary industry, promoting gross domestic product per capita growth, increasing the proportion of electricity in terminal energy consumption, and attracting foreign direct investment. However, the increases in urban population may decrease environmental efficiency. Nevertheless, an obvious spatial spillover effect exists in the environmental efficiency of the public building sector. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China'S public buildings; Environmental efficiency; Moran index; Non-radial directional distance function; Spatial econometric model","Buildings; Data envelopment analysis; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Historic preservation; Investments; Life cycle; China'S public building; Directional distance function; Energy-consumption; Environmental efficiency; Moran index; Non-radial directional distance function; Public buildings; Spatial characteristics; Spatial econometric models; Tertiary industries; Construction industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115188487

We have carried out the density functional theory (DFT) calculation of NiCo2S4 and its oxidation structure. Both theory and experiments show that unoxidized NiCo2S4 was found to be paramagnetic, but, the magnetic states of the oxidized NiCo2S4 powders were changed significantly. It is found by the DFT calculation that the octahedrons in the partially oxidized NiCo2S4 spinel lattice were distorted, leading to changes in the orbital ordering of the Co3+ t2g level. In particular, one electron of the dyz orbital jumps into the d(x2−y2) orbital of the eg level, and the nonmagnetic low spin Co3+ transforms to an intermediate spin state. The magnetic measurements show the ferromagnetism in the partially oxidized NiCo2S4 powders, which originated from the exchange interaction between intermediate spin Co3+ and Ni ions mediating through intervening O ions. When the NiCo2S4 powders were heavily oxidized, Co3+ ions were gradually reduced to Co2+. Due to a strong covalent effect, Co2+ makes little contribution to the magnetic properties of the sample, but antiferromagnetic exchange interactions occur between Ni3+ ions in the heavily oxidized sample. All the NiCo2S4 powders with different degrees of oxidation were found to retain metallic conductivity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Distortion; Ferromagnetism; Substitution; Sulfide spinels","Antiferromagnetism; Density functional theory; Distortion (waves); Metal ions; Nickel compounds; Oxidation; Substitution reactions; Sulfur compounds; Transition metals; Density-functional theory calculations; Hydrothermal methods; Intermediate spins; Magnetic state; Orbital order; Orbitals; Spinel lattices; Sulphide spinel; Synthesised; Transition metal ions; Ferromagnetism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111676986

However, whether the ETS in PRC can promote non-fossil energy development remains to be answered. This paper uses a difference-in-differences model to evaluate the effect of the ETS on non-fossil energy development in PRC. Using provincial monthly panel data from January 2004 to December 2019, we find that (1) the ETS has significantly promoted non-fossil energy development in PRC, increasing the monthly average share of non-fossil energy power generation in total power generation by 2.326 percentage points, which has been verified by a series of robustness tests. (2) The effect of the ETS on non-fossil energy development is heterogeneous by energy type, pilot region, and pilot-energy type. The ETS has significantly increased the share of hydropower and photovoltaic power generation, and has significantly promoted non-fossil energy development in Guangdong; meanwhile, the ETS has significantly increased the share of hydropower and nuclear power in Guangdong, and the share of wind power and photovoltaic power in Hubei.

Hence, the spatial-temporal variation of carbon intensity of China’s 30 provinces from 2010 to 2017 is explored by applying a Spatial-temporal Index decomposition analysis (ST-IDA) model combined with energy input-output analysis. Industrial structure, energy intensity, energy structure, and carbon emission coefficient are identified as driving factors; simultaneously, a new factor, energy conversion efficiency, is also introduced based on the energy input-output analysis, which is of significance as China is vigourously pushing electricitification. The results show that the carbon intensity of economic sectors in most provinces declined from 2010 to 2017. Energy intensity is the biggest contributor to both the temporal decline of carbon intensity and its spatial difference for economic sectors, followed by industrial structure, energy conversion efficiency, energy structure and carbon emission coefficient, while the rank of inhibition of each factor is the same as above. Meanwhile, the carbon intensity of the residential sector is mainly affected by per capita GDP and per capita energy consumption.

Through documents analysis and interviews with key market actors in Kuala Lumpur and other financial centres, our findings point to the emergent international adoption of green sukuk. While this achieves Malaysia's state-building objectives, specifically through expanding Malaysia's sukuk market and advancing its status as a frontier of Islamic financial innovations, the potential for improving the current green bond regime has been more doubtful. A key limitation is the incorporation of existing Green Bond Principles, which enables not only green sukuk's international acceptance but also renders it susceptible to greenwashing.

We argue that sustainable agriculture development in this region requires a systematic approach toward climate change adaptation, and propose a schematic framework for strategic thinking. We first briefly review the impacts of climate change on various agricultural environmental factors, including light, temperature, water, and atmosphere, and explores the effects of climate change on agricultural practices, such as disaster response, pests and weeds control, fertilizer application, and species selection. The study shows that climate change has increased extreme climate disasters such as drought and heat waves, and has expanded the scope and severity of pests and weeds, which in turn requires a series of changes in farming practices. These effects have profound impacts on farmland management, as well as the sustainability of the agricultural system. Based on the findings, the authors argue that the key adaptation strategies should include: (1) optimizing the geographic distribution of agriculture, (2) cultivating new crop varieties that can better adapt to the changing environment, (3) adjusting cropping timing and structure, (4) developing water-saving irrigation systems, (5) improving capacities of disaster prevention and mitigation at both household and government levels, and (6) strengthening the sciences, technology, and human resources to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, Li, Wang, Zhong and Wang.","climate change adaptation; climate disaster; food security; resilience; sustainable agriculture; vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119471897

However, extra retrofit materials are required to achieve this standard, which raises a contradiction between how to balance the environmental impacts of the retrofitting material inputs and extremely low energy consumption after retrofit. This motivated the analysis in this paper, which aimed to evaluate the possibilities of reducing the required retrofitting material inputs when trying to achieve the EnerPHit energy standard using a typical suburban dwelling in China’s hot summer-cold winter climate region as a case study. Firstly, how the insulation performance of each envelope component affected the building’s energy consumption was analysed. Based on this, sensitivity simulations of combinations of different insulation levels with different fabric components were investigated under four scenarios of insulation levels, airtightness and glazing choice. The final proposed retrofitting plans achieved the EnerPHit standard with insulation materials’ savings between 18% to 58% compared to a baseline retrofit plan, and this led, in turn, to 3.9 to 12.6 tonnes of carbon reductions. Moreover, an energy-saving of 87% in heating and 70% in cooling was achieved compared with the pre-retrofit dwelling. © 2021 by the authors.

It is thus critical to understand how various climate and land use changes impact overall carbon sequestration in large‐scale city circle areas. As the largest urban agglomeration in central China, carbon dynamics in the Wuhan City Circle area have been deeply affected by rapid urbanization and climate change in the past two decades. Here, we applied monthly climate data, spatially explicit land use maps, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) images and the CASA (Carnegie–Ames–Stanford Approach) model to estimate the spatial and temporal changes of carbon dynamics in the Wuhan City Circle area from 2000 to 2015. We designed six different scenarios to analyze the effects of climate change and land use change on carbon dynamics. Our simulation of NPP (Net Primary Productivity) increased from 522.63 gC × m−2 to 615.82 gC × m−2 in the Wuhan City Circle area during 2000–2015. Climate change and land use change contributed to total carbon sequestration by −73.3 × 1010 gC and 480 × 1010 gC, respectively. Both precipitation and temperature had a negative effect on carbon sequestration, while radiation had a positive effect. In addition, the positive effect on carbon sequestration from afforestation was almost equal to the negative effect from urbanization between 2000 and 2015. Importantly, these findings highlight the possibility of carrying out both rapid urbanization and ecological restoration simultaneously. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we integrated observational data, control policies and strategies, and air quality simulations to develop PM2.5 attainment demonstration by year 2030 for the city of Bengbu, which represents a typical non-compliant city in the northern YRD region. In 2018, the annual average PM2.5 concentration in Bengbu was 51.8 μg/m3, which was 48 % higher than the standard of 35 μg/m3 set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Different future emission scenarios were developed for year 2025 as mid-term and year 2030 as long-term. Integrated meteorology and air quality modeling system together with monitoring data was applied to predict the air quality under the future emission scenarios. Results show that when a conservative emission reduction ratio of 40 % was assumed for surrounding regions, the annual average PM2.5 concentration in Bengbu could meet the target value by 2030, in which case emissions of SO2, NOx, PM2.5, VOCs, and NH3 need to be reduced by 70.6 %, 43.5 %, 47.2 %, 33.4 %, and 47.5 %, respectively. PM2.5 concentration in Bengbu is not only controlled by local emission reductions but also affected by emission reductions of surrounding regions as well as contribution from long-range transport. More attentions need to be paid to the control of VOCs emissions in the near future to avoid increase of ozone concentrations while reducing PM2.5. Our results provide scientific support for the local government to formulate future air pollution prevention and control strategies, sub-regional joint-control among surrounding cities, as well as trans-regional joint-control between the north China and the YRD region. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution prevention; Control strategies; Emission reduction; Non-compliant city","ammonia; nitric oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; local government; meteorology; pollution control; volatile organic compound; air monitoring; air pollution control; air quality; air quality control; Article; China; city; concentration (parameter); control strategy; environmental policy; environmental protection; government; meteorology; observational method; particulate matter 2.5; pollution transport; simulation; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112791290

Here, abundance changes in spores and pollen record the devastating effects this volcanic induced climate crisis had on coastal and near-coastal lowland mire vegetation around the European epicontinental sea and the European Tethys margin. Combined stress from rising air temperatures and changing climate at the onset of the crisis was exacerbated by a rapidly rising sea-level resulting in fragmentation and destruction of coastal and near-coastal lowland mire habitats, causing mass rarity and extinctions primarily in gymnosperm trees and shrubs adapted to these environments. The devastation of these habitats was further amplified by a subsequent sea-level fall leaving pioneering opportunists and herbaceous survivors to colonize disturbed areas in an environment stressed by increased wildfire activity and enhanced soil erosion. The pioneering flora was severely decimated in a second mass rarity phase and ultimately extirpated. The second mass rarity phase occurred just prior to and at the onset of a prominent negative excursion in δ13Corg. A subsequent sea-level rise appears to have restored some of the near-coastal mire habitats allowing some of the plants to recover. The supraregional mass rarity during the end-Triassic crisis affected both previously dominant as well as rare plants and this resonates with ongoing and future climate change and attests to the vulnerability of coastal and lowland vegetation, especially rare plant species, to climatic and environmental disturbances, where rising sea-level threatens entire ecosystems.

The area is densely populated and highly industrialized, resulting in high concentrations of pollutants over the area. Although emissions from industrial sources are much larger, exposure to household emissions poses the most significant risk to human health. Interventions aimed at reducing solid fuel burning in low-income settlements on the Highveld have the potential to reduce exposure, but quantifying their true impact remains a challenge. We aimed to estimate the health and associated economic benefits of the regional implementation of thermal insulation as intervention measure in low-income settlements to predict the potential impact on the regional scale. We used a land use type regression model to estimate pre-intervention PM2.5 concentrations over the Highveld and then used sampled post-intervention air quality data from a pilot offset programme to relate changes in air quality to changes in avoided premature mortalities. We estimate that the large-scale implementation of this intervention could result in 143 avoided premature mortalities with an estimated economic benefit of just under ZAR (2011) 341.6 million, equivalent to USD (2011) 49.4 million. © 2021 by the authors.

Wetlands are declining worldwide, and hence, ecosystem functions linked to wetlands are threatened. We use Caltha palustris “a common wetland plant” to study whether warming affects growth and reproduction differently depending on origin of source population, potentially affecting phenotypic response to local climate. We conducted a 2-year in situ temperature manipulation experiment using clone pairs of C. palustris in four regions, along a 1300-km latitudinal gradient of Sweden. Open-top chambers were used to passively increase temperature, paired with controls. Growth and reproductive traits were measured from 320 plants (four regions × five sites × two treatments × eight plants) over two consecutive seasons to assess the effect of warming over time. We found that warming increased plant height, leaf area, number of leaves, and roots. High-latitude populations responded more strongly to warming than low-latitude populations, especially by increasing leaf area. Warming increased number of flowers in general, but only in the second year, while number of fruits increased in low-latitude populations the first year. Prolonged warming leads to an increase in both number of leaves and flowers over time. While reproduction shows varying and regional responses to warming, impacts on plant growth, especially in high-latitude populations, have more profound effects. Such effects could lead to changes in plant community composition with increased abundance of fast-growing plants with larger leaves and more clones, affecting plant competition and ecological functions such as decomposition and nutrient retention. Effects of warming were highly context dependent; thus, we encourage further use of warming experiments to predict changes in growth, reproduction, and community composition across wetland types and climate gradients targeting different plant forms. © 2021 The Authors.

In this work, differential thermogravimetric (DTG), electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) we re used to reveal the adsorption-regeneration process of H2S and the effect of adsorption products on carbon consumption. The results show that H2S reacts with the C=C bond to form the C-S bond as an intermediate state, followed by the formation of elemental sulfur. It directly sublimates at approximately 380 °C, about 30 °C higher than the decomposition temperature of H2SO4. In the thermal regeneration process, the elemental sulfur in the form of monoclinic sulfur (S8) first breaks into infinitely long chain molecules (S∞) and then into small molecules, finally into sulfur vapor. The desorption of elemental sulfur consumes less oxygen and carbon functional groups, reducing the chemical carbon consumption by 59.8% than H2SO4; moreover, the compressive strength reduces less due to its slight effect on the disordered graphitic structure. H2S also reacts with the C=O bond to form H2SO3 or H2SO4. The desorption of H2SO3 does not require carbon consumption. The decomposition of H2SO4 needs to react with the C=C bond to release SO2, CO2, and CO, and the compressive strength of activated carbon significantly decreases. The carbon consumption originates from two aspects; the one from the regeneration of sulfur-containing products is more than twice the other one from the decomposition of oxygen-containing functional groups. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Activated carbon; Chemical carbon consumption; Elemental sulfur; Hydrogen sulfide; Physical carbon abrasion","activated carbon; adsorption; compressive strength; decomposition; detection method; hydrogen sulfide; purification; charcoal; coke; oxygen; sulfur; adsorption; Adsorption; Charcoal; Coke; Oxygen; Sulfur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108599745

Over the twentieth century, each factor contributes to global yield increase; increasing nitrogen fertilization rates is the strongest driver for maize, and increasing [CO2] is the strongest for soybean. Over the 21st century, crop yields are projected under two future scenarios, RCP4.5-SSP2 and RCP8.5-SSP5; the warmer temperature drives yields lower, while rising [CO2] drives yields higher. The adverse warmer temperature effect of maize and soybean is offset by other drivers, particularly the increase in [CO2], and resultant changes in the phenological events due to climate change, particularly planting dates and harvesting times, by 2090s under both scenarios. Global yield for maize increases under RCP4.5-SSP2, which experiences continued growth in [CO2] and higher nitrogen input rates. For soybean, yield increases at a similar rate. However, in RCP8.5-SSP5, maize yield declines because of greater climate warming, extreme heat stress conditions, and weaker nitrogen fertilization than RCP4.5-SSP2, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, suggesting that application of advanced technologies, and stronger management practices, in addition to climate change mitigation, may be needed to intensify crop production over this century. The model also projects spatial variations in yields; notably, the higher temperatures in tropical and subtropical regions limit photosynthesis rates and reduce light interception, resulting in lower yields, particularly for soybean under RCP8.5-SSP5. © 2021.

Our objectives are to investigate how the ecosys model simulate the effects of fall and spring slurry injections on N2O production and if de-watering slurry could become a potential N2O mitigation strategy for both fall and spring injections. The ecosys model was used to simulate hourly N2O fluxes from 2014 to 2017 in a cropping system with and without slurry (fall and spring additions) in comparison with field measurements in Alberta, Canada. Furthermore, we performed simulations of de-watered fall and spring slurry applications in the same scenarios. Our results showed ecosys adequately simulated soil temperatures and moisture contents at 10 and 20 cm depths [correlation coefficients (r) ≥ 0.929 for temperatures; r ≥ 0.529 for moistures]. The divergences of modelled and measured soil water contents during spring thaws could be attributed to uncertainties in model inputs for soil hydrological parameters as well as uncertainties in field measurements. The model captured reasonably well the dynamics of N2O fluxes from soils receiving fall and spring slurry (r = 0.356). However, the concurrent discrepancies of N2O fluxes between modelled and measured values during the wetter spring thaw of 2017 might be a result of an unsatisfactory simulation of snowmelt infiltration and runoff.

Herein, we, for the first time, report novel AsP nanosheets (NSs) with P-type semiconducting property and enough negative conduction band, which can work as a stable near-infrared (NIR) region-responsive electron donor for water reductive hydrogen (H2) production. To mimic photosystem I, Au nanorods (NRs) act as electron transport media, which are also responsible for the enhanced electric field nearby, and 1T-MoS2 NSs as a hydrogen evolution catalyst are orderly coupled with AsP NSs with a sheet-rod-sheet structure by electrostatic self-assembly. The cascaded band level alignment enables unidirectional electron flow from AsP to Au and then to MoS2, and the optimum H2 production rate of the MoS2-Au-AsP ternary heterojunction reaches 125.52 μmol g-1 h-1 with good stability even after being stored for several months under light irradiation with a wavelength longer than 700 nm.

By looking into the local species generated during the electrolysis using the in-situ ATR-FTIR, the increased amount of anions such as OH− and CO32− trapped within the porous structure, which increases with the thickness of the nanostructure, leads to an increase in local pH near the electrode surface, and thus at the expense of the HER, the CO production is promoted.

Many existing studies have indicated the CBAM will curtail greenhouse gases, and will subsequently be positive in terms of reducing global warming. However, serious legal issues and trade disputes are expected in terms of the compatibility of the CBAM with the trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Contrary to the EU’s explanation, the international community has a strong view of CBAM as a new trade barrier under the guise of preventing global warming. Above all, this is because it is an arbitrary measure by the EU and not the one that has been internationally agreed upon. Therefore, this paper tries to identify the pitfalls and estimate the global cost of CBAM, arguing that the mechanism is not in line with international trade rules, and that many countries will not sit back and suffer from it. The world economy will inevitably face a vicious cycle of trade retaliation. The CBAM will drive up trade costs and cause another trade distortion. While the goal of preventing climate change is good, the CBAM scheme is too costly for the world economy. © 2021 by the authors.

One plant factory system, container farms, consists of artificially lit, vertically stacked hydroponic farms inside retrofitted shipping containers and support crop production in otherwise unused locations regardless of climate and daylight availability. Given their high energy intensity, municipalities considering container farms require reliable models to study their overall environmental performance and feasibility. While previous studies have used co-simulators to consider plant-air interactions within building performance simulation (BPS) tools, energy validation studies are lacking for such models. This research presents the validation of an EnergyPlus model of a hydroponic container farm in Boston, Massachusetts based on nine months of measured data. Despite shortcomings in predicting of hourly conditioning energy, the resulting calibrated energy model achieves a Normalized Mean Bias Error of 3% and a Coefficient of Variation of the Root-Mean-Square Error of 11%.

Temperature increases due to climate change can modify the equilibrium between these fluxes and trigger ecosystem-climate feedbacks that can accelerate climate warming. As these dynamics have not been well studied in dry shrublands, we subjected a Mediterranean shrubland to a 10-year night-time temperature manipulation experiment that analyzed ecosystem carbon fluxes associated with dominant shrub species, together with several plant parameters related to leaf photosynthesis, leaf morphology, and canopy structure. Under moderate night-time warming (+0.9°C minimum daily temperature, no significant reduction in soil moisture), Cistus monspeliensis formed shoots with more leaves that were relatively larger and denser canopies that supported higher plant-level photosynthesis rates. Given that ecosystem respiration was not affected, this change in canopy morphology led to a significant enhancement in net ecosystem exchange (+47% at midday). The observed changes in shoot and canopy morphology were attributed to the improved nutritional state of the warmed plants, primarily due to changes in nitrogen cycling and higher nitrogen resorption efficiency in senescent leaves. Our results show that modifications in plant morphology triggered by moderate warming affected ecosystem CO2 fluxes, providing the first evidence for enhanced daytime carbon uptake in a dry shrubland ecosystem under experimental warming. © 2021 The Authors.

The latest and most competitive carbon emission data from Chen et al. (2020) and the time-varying difference-in-differences (DID) model is used to examine the role of forest city construction (FCC) in reducing carbon emissions. The results show that the FCC reduced CO2 by 1.71% in Chinese cities, which is approximately equivalent to 1.79 million tons. These results are supported by a variety of robustness tests. Mechanism analysis shows that FCC not only directly increased green spaces and vegetation carbon sequestrations, but also had indirect effects by deriving green development models in cities, such as green transportation, green innovation, and energy consumption reduction. Furthermore, regarding city heterogeneity, FCC was more effective in eastern and southern cities as well as cities with more populations and better economy. In the context of carbon neutrality, these findings are significant to Chinese cities on the road to low carbon development and provide the enlightenment for other developing countries to achieve carbon emission reduction. © 2021","Carbon emission; Carbon neutrality; China; Forest city construction (FCC); Green development models; Vegetation carbon sequestration","Carbon; Developing countries; Emission control; Energy utilization; Forestry; Carbon emissions; Carbon neutralities; Carbon sequestration; China; City construction; Development model; Forest city construction; Green development model; Low-carbon development; Vegetation carbon sequestration; Vegetation; carbon emission; developing world; economic conditions; emission control; environmental economics; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; vegetation type; China; Chen chen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114784271

Two CAM-MPAS experiments, one with a global quasi-uniform resolution mesh of 120 km (MPAS-UR) and the other with a variable resolution mesh of 30–120 km refined over East Asia (MPAS-VR), are conducted from 1989 to 2005 following the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project protocol. Two regional climate model simulations at ∼25 km resolution from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment East Asia second plan are also analyzed for comparison. Results show that CAM-MPAS performs better than the selected regional models in simulating the precipitation climatology over East Asia. Compared with MPAS-UR, MPAS-VR with refinement over East Asia better simulates the precipitation over and around the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the upper-level circulation, the precipitation frequency and intensity in various regions of China, and the interannual precipitation pattern associated with the East Asian summer monsoon. Both decreased grid spacing and the use of finer-scale terrain information contribute to the improvements in MPAS-VR relative to MPAS-UR. However, decreased grid spacing is more essential for simulating the precipitation magnitude over TP and the location of peak precipitation south of TP, likely due to the better resolved physical and dynamical processes associated with orographic precipitation. The 30–120 km CAM-MPAS model is shown to be a promising tool for precipitation simulation over East Asia. © 2021 The Authors.

Understanding the development of BSAT and SB is of great significance to the sustainable development of the construction industry. This research used the bibliometric method to analyze the development and evolution in the relevant literature on SB and BSAT from 1990 to 2021, and the correlations and differences between them were investigated. We found that there are many common trends in the development of research efforts in SB and BSAT: (1) they focused solely on the environment, in the early days, and only later considered economic and social impacts; (2) the scales with which they are concerned continue to expand, from individual buildings to communities and even cities; (3) key areas, such as energy, materials, resources, indoor environmental quality, high-tech applications, adaptability, and concern for people are being given more attention by both SB and BSAT. On the other hand, the difference between them is that SB research focuses on more macro aspects, such as policy, culture, climate change, while BSAT research is more concerned with micro aspects, such as its system of tools. Furthermore, some current research gaps in the BSAT field are identified, clarifying its future research directions.

Modeling phenological variations of plant species over broad regions is challenging because of the varied climatic requirements of geographic populations due to local adaptation. In this study, we developed an empirical method to calibrate phenological models of temperate trees using latitude as a predictor to account for local adaptation of populations to a N–S temperature gradient. Fourteen widely distributed tree species in the eastern U.S.A. were investigated using data from the USA-National Phenology Network. We implemented the method in a basic thermal time bud break model to introduce the algorithm of the method and test its effectiveness. For each species, dates of breaking leaf buds were first predicted using a traditional non-spatial model and then with a spatial model that has the critical thermal forcing requirements calibrated for different populations at varied latitudes. As anticipated, non-spatial model predictions that assumed a uniform forcing requirement across latitudes showed consistent and systematic biases at both higher (overestimation-predictions being later) and lower (underestimation-predictions being earlier) latitudes. Spatial models that have been calibrated using our method removed the geographic biases and yielded latitudinal gradients that more closely matched those of the observations. The spatial models also reduced the overall prediction errors from an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 32.2 days to 20.4 days for the training dataset and an average root mean square error for prediction (RMSEP) of 32.2 days to 19.9 days for the testing dataset. This paper is focused on introducing the new calibration method as a preparatory step toward developing operational models that may potentially predict large-scale and range-wide phenological responses of various plant species to climatic changes with improved local accuracy. © 2021, ISB.","Climate adaptation; climate change; Nature’s Notebook; phenological forecasting; spring phenology; USA-NPN","acclimatization; climate change; plant leaf; season; temperature; tree; Acclimatization; Climate Change; Plant Leaves; Seasons; Temperature; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106479641

Hence, strengthening CO2 recycling is necessary. CO2 electroreduction reaction (CRR) is recognized as a promising approach to utilize waste CO2. Electrocatalysts in the CRR process play a critical role in determining the selectivity and activity of CRR. Different types of electrocatalysts are introduced in this review: noble metals and their derived compounds, transition metals and their derived compounds, organic polymer, and carbon-based materials, as well as their major products, Faradaic efficiency, current density, and onset potential. Furthermore, this paper overviews the recent progress of the following two major applications of CRR according to the different energy conversion methods: electricity generation and formation of valuable carbonaceous products. Considering electricity generation devices, the electrochemical properties of metal–CO2 batteries, including Li–CO2, Na–CO2, Al–CO2, and Zn–CO2 batteries, are mainly summarized. Finally, different pathways of CO2 electroreduction to carbon-based fuels is presented, and their reaction mechanisms are illustrated. This review provides a clear and innovative insight into the entire reaction process of CRR, guiding the new electrocatalysts design, state-of-the-art analysis technique application, and reaction system innovation. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","carbonaceous fuel; CO 2 electroreduction; electrocatalysts; mechanisms; metal–CO 2 batteries","Carbon dioxide process; Electric batteries; Electric power generation; Electrocatalysts; Electrolysis; Electrolytic reduction; Greenhouse gases; Organic polymers; Transition metals; Carbon based materials; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon-based fuels; Carbonaceous products; Conversion methods; Electricity generation; Faradaic efficiencies; Reaction mechanism; Carbon dioxide",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108287064

To explore the impact of COVID-19 lockdown (LCD) on organic aerosols, the mixing states and evolution processes of amine-containing particles were studied using a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer from January to March 2020 in Liaocheng, which is a seriously polluted city in North China. The counts and percentages of amine-containing particles in total obtained particles during the pre-LCD (547832, 29.8 %) were higher than those during the LCD (283983, 20.7 %) and post-LCD (102026, 18.4 %), mainly due to the reduced emission strength of amines and suppressed gas-to-particle partitioning of amines during the LCD and post-LCD. 74(C2H5)2NH2+ was the most abundant amine marker, which accounted for 98.2 %, 98.4 %, and 96.7 % of all amine-containing particles during the pre-LCD, LCD, and post-LCD, respectively. Correlation analysis and temporal variations indicated that the gas-to-particle partitioning of amines was facilitated by the stronger acidic environment and lower temperature, while the effect of RH and aerosol liquid water content was minor. The A-OC particles were the most abundant type (accounting for ~40 %) throughout the observation period. The temporal profiles and correlation analysis suggested that the impact of the increased O3 on the amines and their oxidation products (e.g., trimethylamine oxide) was minor. The identified particle types, correlation analysis, and the potential source contribution function results implied that the amine-containing particles were mainly derived from local and surrounding sources during the LCD, while those were mainly affected by long-range transport during the pre-LCD and post-LCD. Our results could deepen the comprehension of the sources and atmospheric processing of amines in the urban area of North China during the COVID-19 outbreak. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Amine-containing particles; COVID-19 lockdown; Diethylamine (DEA); Gas-to-particle partitioning","Aerosols; Air quality; Correlation methods; Disease control; Industrial emissions; % reductions; Amine-containing particle; Chinese Government; Coronavirus disease 2019 lockdown; Coronaviruses; Correlation analysis; Diethylamine; Gas-to-particle partitioning; North China; Urban atmospheres; Amines; aerosol; air quality; correlation; COVID-19; pollutant source; temporal analysis; urban atmosphere; urban pollution; China; Liaocheng; Shandong; Coronavirus; amine; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; atmosphere; China; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; epidemic; human; particulate matter; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Amines; Atmosphere; China; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112723799

Thus, with reflecting multi-principles (fairness, efficiency, sustainability, and feasibility), this paper formulates the CO2 emission quota allocation among cities in BREC in 2030 based on the multi-objective decision approach. We first propose three allocation schemes based on the principles of fairness, efficiency, and sustainability, which are conducted by entropy method, zero-sum gains data envelopment (ZSG-DEA) model, and CO2 sequestration share method, respectively. Then, the CO2 allocation satisfaction is defined and used to measure the feasibility principle which is integrated as the objective function of the multi-objective decision model together with three allocation schemes to obtain the optimal allocation results. The results show that Beijing, Tianjin, Dalian, Shijiazhuang, Yantai, Weifang, and Linyi enjoy the largest CO2 emission quotas, having 1179.94 Mt in total and accounting for 31%. Beijing has the highest quotas, and Laiwu has the lowest emission quotas. Cities with large energy consumption and less CO2 sequestration capacity, such as Tianjin, Handan, and Tangshan, experience a decrease in the emission quota shares from 2017 to 2030, indicating that these cities would undertake large emission reduction obligations. Sensitivity analysis shows that Beijing, Zibo, and Jinan are more sensitive to minimum satisfaction changes, and the total satisfaction experiences an increase first and declines thereafter. Based on the results above, cities with large pressure to reduce CO2 emissions should not only promote economic development but also improve the capacity of CO2 sequestration by enhancing environmental protection to realize emission reduction targets. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Allocation satisfaction; City level; CO2 emission quota allocation; Multi-objective decision model; Multi-principles","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic development; emission control; environmental protection; China; carbon dioxide; China; city; economic development; Beijing; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Economic Development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108658591

Afterward, considering three different scenarios, we analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics and the dynamic evolution pattern of CRP. We also employ spatial Durbin model (SDM) to investigate the influencing factors of CRP. The results are obtained as follows: (1) CRP across the three scenarios varies considerably across provinces and different-located groups. CRP higher areas are mainly located in the economically developed eastern coastal regions, while most provinces with low CRP are concentrated in the western region. (2) Provinces with a similar CRP showed a significant geographic agglomeration, and the agglomeration effect was strengthened first and then weakened. Simultaneously, the local spatial distribution of moderation carbon reduction potential (MCRP), fairness carbon reduction potential (FCRP), and efficiency carbon reduction potential (ECRP) shows a slight spatial polarization feature. (3) Through the SDM analysis and spillover effect decomposition, we find that improvement of regional CRP not only depends on economic development, industrial structure adjustment, and energy efficiency elevation, but also involves energy structure optimization, low-carbon innovation, and population. The low-carbon innovation provides critical support for local CRP under the efficiency scenario but restrains the local CRP under the fairness scenario. Therefore, the central government should emphasize local conditions and the ex-ante scenario assessment, strengthen regional interactive governance, optimize energy efficiency, and promote the application of clean energy to enhance CRP. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon abatement cost; Carbon emission reduction potential; Directional distance function; Policymaker preference; Spatial Durbin model; Spatio-temporal evolution","abatement cost; agglomeration; carbon emission; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental factor; spatiotemporal analysis; spillover effect; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; industry; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108569075

This complex is featured with an iron(I) center, which bonds to a 1,2-ethanediamine (en) and a 2-hydroxy-biphenyl group. Reaction mechanisms for the CO2 reduction to formate catalyzed by this iron(I) model complex were explored using density functional theory (DFT) computations. Studies showed that the univalent iron(I) compound can efficiently fix and activate a CO2 molecule, whereas its oxidized forms with trivalent iron(III) or bivalent iron(II) cannot activate CO2. For the iron(I) compound, it was found that the lowest spin state 2Fe(I) is the most favorable for the CO2 reduction as the reactions barriers involving 2Fe(I), 4Fe(I), and 6Fe(I) are 25.6, 37.2, and 35.9 kcal/mol, respectively. Yet, a photosensitizer-free visible-light-mediated high-low spin shift from 4Fe(I) and 6Fe(I) to 2Fe(I) is likely through the reverse intersystem crossing (RIC) because the 4Fe(I) and 6Fe(I) compounds have strong absorption in the visible-light range. Notably, the synergistic interaction between the hydrogen bonding from the auxiliary hydroxyl group in the 2-hydroxy-biphenyl moiety to CO2 and an intermediate five-membered ring promotes the proton transfer, leading to the formation of the -COOH moiety from CO2 and the Fe-O bond. With the addition of H2, one H2 molecule is split by the Fe-O bond and thus serves as H atom sources for both the CO2 reduction and the recovery of the auxiliary hydroxyl group. The present theoretical study provides a novel solution for the challenging CO2 reduction, which calls for further experimental verifications. © 2021 The Authors.

This research applies social network analysis and a quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) to explore the structural characteristics and determinants of a global green technological collaboration network from 2000 to 2018, based on 456,945 patents. The results show that the number of countries involved in green technology cooperation is rapidly growing; however, the cooperative network is far from complete or regular and presents obvious core–periphery structural features. The United States and Canada, Germany and France, and China and Japan are, respectively, at the center of the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Block model results indicate that the pattern of global green technological cooperation centers on core countries and is led by core countries and strong semi-peripheral countries. QAP regression analysis shows that economic proximity, technological proximity, social proximity, and strict environment regulations are key factors that promote international green technological collaboration. The determinants of green technology cooperation within each continent are also heterogeneous.

After fermentation, the fermented total mixed ration (FTMR) group had lower contents of neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, starch, non-fibrous carbohydrates, and carbohydrates. In addition, lactic acid content and relative abundance of Lactobacillus in the FTMR group were higher. Compared with the TMR group, the in vitro ammonia nitrogen and total volatile fatty acid concentrations and the molar proportion of propionate and butyrate were increased in the FTMR group. However, the ruminal pH, molar proportion of acetate, and methane production were significantly decreased in the FTMR group. Notably, we found that the relative abundance of ruminal bacteria was higher in FTMR than in TMR samples, including Prevotella, Coprococcus, and Oscillospira. At the same time, we found that the diversity of methanogens in the FTMR group was lower than that in the TMR group. The relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter significantly decreased, while the relative abundances of Methanoplanus and vadinCA11 increased. The relative abundances of Entodinium and Pichia significantly decreased in the FTMR group compared with the TMR group. These results suggest that FTMR can be used as an environmentally cleaner technology in animal farming due to its ability to improve ruminal fermentation, modulate the rumen microbiome, and reduce methane emissions. © Copyright © 2021 Li, Lv, Wang, Zhou, Zhang, Wei, Sun, Lan, Dou and Zhang.","carbohydrate component; fermented total mixed ration; methane yield; rumen microbiome; ruminal fermentation","acetic acid; ammonia; butyric acid; carbohydrate; lactic acid; lignin; nitrogen; non fibrous carbohydrate; propionic acid; starch; unclassified drug; volatile fatty acid; Acetobacter; Acinetobacter; animal experiment; animal model; Article; Bacillus; Brevibacillus; Burkholderia; carbohydrate analysis; controlled study; Coprococcus; dry matter intake; Entodinium; fermentation; fermented total mixed ration; Gluconacetobacter; Lactobacillus; Lysinibacillus; Methanobrevibacter; methanogen; methanogenesis; Methanoplanus; microbial community; microbiome; nonhuman; Oscillospira; Paenibacillus; pH; Pichia; Prevotella; protein analysis; Rubrivivax; rumen microorganism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119503151

In order to realize the coordinated development of Baiyangdian water quality improvement and carbon sink increase, this paper establishes the calculation model of the amount of sludge to be cleared to improve the unit water quality and the amount of carbon dioxide released by clearing the silt using the release flux and diffusion flux of nitrogen and phosphorus elements in the water body, and the relationship between the content of nitrogen and phosphorus elements, the depth of Baiyangdian sludge excavation and the amount of carbon dioxide released: as the content of nitrogen and phosphorus elements in the water decreases, the depth of sludge excavated to improve the unit water body increases, and the amount of carbon dioxide released gradually increases. As the nitrogen and phosphorus content in the water decreases, the depth of dredged sludge to improve the quality of the water body increases, the carbon dioxide released gradually increases, and when the nitrogen and phosphorus concentration reaches 0.18 g/m3 and 0.6 g/m3 respectively, the carbon dioxide released will increase exponentially. Thus, we propose countermeasures to improve the water quality of Baiyangdian and increase the carbon sink capacity: we can improve the water quality by reasonable dredging before the water quality reaches poor category 3; we can achieve the dual goals of improving the water quality and increasing the carbon sink by increasing the reed planting area. © 2021 by the authors.

To provide further empirical evidence and guidance for urban green spaces planning and design, field measurement of summertime air temperature and relative humidity was conducted in and out of 10 large urban parks in Beijing, China. Averaged daytime and nighttime park cool and wet island intensity were 1.09 ℃, 1.48 % and 3.63 ℃, 4.25 % respectively. Parks’ influence on local-scale climate extended as far as over 1km during summer nights, and more effective cooling effects were provided within approximately one-park width. Among all influencing factors, park size plays dominant role in regulating nighttime local-scale climate in parks’ adjacent area, while vegetation coverage around sampling points out of urban parks also has significant contributions, indicating that large urban parks and their surrounding urban greenery interact to affect neighborhood climate. Park size was the only factor found correlated with nocturnal park cool and wet island intensity. Results of this study provide additional information on large urban parks’ local-scale climate effect and give insights to future urban green spaces planning and design practice. © 2021","Air temperature; Park cool island; Park wet island; Relative humidity; Urban climate; Urban green space","air temperature; climate effect; greenschist facies; greenspace; heat island; neighborhood; relative humidity; seasonal variation; urban planning; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117138056

Although it is an enclosed basin with a narrow opening to the east, prevailing easterly winds during heavy haze episodes have a large potential to bring air pollutants to the GZB from the two highly polluted neighboring provinces of Shanxi and Henan (SX&amp;HN). The source-oriented WRF-Chem model simulations of a persistent and heavy haze episode that occurred in the GZB from December 6 to 21, 2016, reveal that local emissions dominate PM2.5 concentrations in the GZB, with an average near-surface PM2.5 contribution of about 56.0% during the episode. The transboundary transport of emissions from SX&amp;HN accounts for around 22.2% of the total PM2.5 in the GZB. Furthermore, with the deterioration of the air quality in the GZB from being slightly polluted to severely polluted in terms of hourly PM2.5 concentration, transboundary transport of emissions from SX&amp;HN plays an increasingly important role in the particulate pollution, with the average PM2.5 contribution increasing from 8.0% to 27.5%. Compared with the source-oriented method (SOM), the brute force method (BFM) overestimates the contribution of GZB local emissions and transboundary transport of emissions from SX&amp;HN to the total PM2.5 in the GZB. In addition, the BFM-estimated NH3 contribution of transboundary transport of emissions from SX&amp;HN is negative, indicating the limitation of the BFM in source apportionment. Our results suggest that cooperative emission mitigation strategies with neighboring provinces are beneficial for lowering the particulate pollution in the GZB, particularly under severely polluted conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Brute force method; Local emissions; PM2.5; Source-oriented WRF-Chem model; Transboundary transport","Ammonia; Deterioration; Particles (particulate matter); Brute force; Brute force method; Force method; Local emissions; Particulate pollution; PM$-2.5$; Source-oriented WRF-chem model; Trans-boundary; Transboundary transport; Transport contributions; Air quality; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission; haze; modeling; particulate matter; pollutant transport; transboundary pollution; air quality; article; China; deterioration; particulate matter 2.5; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; China; Guanzhong Plain; Henan; Shaanxi; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111059186

The work improves an existing spatiotemporal analysis method by introducing an adapted form of Hitchcock transportation problem and linear programming to solve the optimal allocation problem in network of supplies and demands. The new method is compared with the original method and is found to improve the accuracy of estimating the allocable industrial excess heat supply in a Swiss case study.

Different from the traditional environmental regulation methods, China’s carbon market pilots (CMP) can use market mechanism to achieve carbon emission reduction policy goals while also providing more efficient control methods for air pollution. Using the unique daily air pollution data of 324 prefecture-level and above cities in China from December 1, 2013, to December 18, 2017, and matching them with the daily data of carbon allowance trading in each CMP, we employ the time-varying difference-in-differences (DID) method to explore the casual relationship between CMP and air pollution, and its influence mechanism. Our results show that (1) the establishment of CMP can reduce air pollution by at least 4.9%, especially on sulfur dioxide, inhalable particulate matter, fine particles, and carbon monoxide. This conclusion is still robust after we use the instrumental variable (IV) method to deal with endogeneity. (2) Mechanism analysis shows that the reducing effect of CMP on air pollution is achieved mainly through three channels, including energy consumption reducing, technological progressing, and industrial structure upgrading. (3) Since CMP have just been established, government regulation plays a stronger role than the market mechanism in the process of CMP affecting air pollution. However, with the continuous improvement of CMP, the market mechanism has also played an increasingly important dynamic effect. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air pollution; Carbon market pilots (CMP); Energy consumption; Industrial structure; Instrumental variable (IV); Technological progress","atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; economic development; energy; government; impact; industrial structure; China; air pollutant; air pollution; airplane pilot; China; city; human; particulate matter; prevention and control; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Humans; Particulate Matter; Pilots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117250069

However, little information is available on large-scale spatial variations in leaf potassium concentrations (LKC) in different plant species, the variations in LKC, and the mechanism underlying these variations. Here, we measured LKC in 2781 plant species sampled from 78 typical ecosystems (including forests, grasslands, and deserts) in China. The average LKC was 18.30 g kg−1, and the minimum and maximum LKC were 0.35 and 52.65 g kg−1, respectively. The LKC differed significantly among plant life forms and climate zones. In addition, LKC had a significant spatial variation in China. The LKC increased with increasing latitude and was mainly affected by climatic variables, especially temperature, but was not constrained by phylogeny. Higher LKC was observed in lower-temperature regions, indicating a cold adaptation mechanism.

A major challenge in dealing with this issue is the uncertainty regarding the influence of burning biomass on PM2.5 regional transport. In this study, Harbin-Changchun Megalopolis is the research area. Using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model combined with satellite data and PM2.5 monitoring data, we quantitatively analyzed the regional transport of PM2.5 from burning biomass upwind of each city under different emission conditions. Conditions at burn sites, especially emission intensity and meteorological factors, as well as transport distance play significant roles in the regional transport of PM2.5. Higher emission intensity aggravated the concentration of downwind PM2.5, at most 19.7 μg ⋅ m−3. Shorter transport distance strengthened the impact of biomass burning on downstream PM2.5 by weakening elimination, which could be up to 96.8 μg ⋅ m−3. Moreover, meteorological factors at fire points were closely related to the transport of PM2.5. First, lower planetary boundary layer height could enhance the transport of PM2.5 from the burning biomass by inhibiting vertical diffusion, and the enhancement could be up to 46.1 μg ⋅ m−3. Second, compared to strong wind, light wind caused the weaker dilution, enhancing PM2.5 regional transport by as much as 32.5 μg ⋅ m−3. Third, relatively humidity at 30%-40% had the strongest effect in facilitating the transport of PM2.5 from burning biomass. We conclude that comprehensively considering these three factors, namely the emission intensity, transport distance and meteorological factors at burn sites can facilitate the cross-regional development of accurate prediction models and effective pollution control measures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass burning; Emission intensity; Meteorological factors; PM2.5 pollution; Regional transport; Transport distance","Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Pollution control; Regional planning; Biomass-burning; Condition; Emissions intensity; Fine particulate matter; Meteorological factors; PM$-2.5$; PM2.5 pollution; Regional transport; Transport distances; Uncertainty; Biomass; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; biomass burning; concentration (composition); particulate matter; traffic emission; air pollutant; air pollution; biomass; China; city; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Biomass; China; Cities; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109480976

In order to explore an effective approach for monitoring the carbon sink of forests in developed coastal areas on a large scale, in this paper, Guangdong Province was taken as the case study region; eight periods plots of data of national forest resources continuous inventory were used to estimate the forest carbon storage and carbon density in Guangdong Province from 1979 to 2012; unary linear regression and standard deviation ellipse were used to analyze the dynamic change of carbon storage; and the structural equation model was used to study the driving factors of forest carbon storage. The results showed that: (1) From 1979 to 2012, the forest carbon storage in Guangdong Province increased by 15,087.93 × 104 t, and the forest carbon density increased by 17.66 t/ha. (2) After 2007, the main body of forest carbon storage changed from coniferous species to broadleaf species. (3) From 1979 to 2012, the proportion of young and middle-aged forest carbon storage continued to decline, but it still occupied the dominant component. (4) The forest carbon storage and carbon density in the northern region of Guangdong Province are higher than those in the southern region. (5) Stand factors and environmental factors have a positive effect on forest carbon storage, and understory factors have a negative effect. In conclusion, although forest carbon storage has fluctuated under the influence of forestry policies and human activities, the overall carbon storage and carbon density of Guangdong Province have been increasing. Tree species have become more abundant and the proportion of coniferous forest to broadleaf forest became more rationalized. The forest age group structure is continuously optimized. We also compared our results with that of other provinces in China and other countries with approximate latitude and climatic conditions. The carbon sink potential of Guangdong Province is huge in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Focusing on OECD countries from 1990 to 2018, this study examines the determinants of renewable energy innovation by applying a negative binomial model. There are four main findings: (1) Renewable energy patents show an inverted U-shaped curve, peaking in 2010; solar energy accounts for the largest share of patents; and the US is the largest renewable energy innovator, followed by South Korea and Germany. (2) Renewable electricity installed capacity, share of expenditure on research and development (R&D) of GDP, and implementation of the Kyoto Protocol are all found to promote innovation; by comparison, the proportion of renewable energy power generation of the total electricity generating capacity shows a negative effect. The price of crude oil shows no significant effect due to the offset effect between the European and non-European country groups. (3) Share of R&D expenditure of GDP is confirmed to be the force driving technological progress in the solar, geothermal, and marine sectors, and it plays a more important role in Japan than in the US or Europe. Implementation of the Kyoto Protocol has no significant effect on innovation in European countries. (4) Three institutional factors—namely, the legal system and property rights; regulations; and freedom to trade internationally—are confirmed to be the driving forces, whereas this is not the case for the growth and free circulation of money. Policy implications for the optimization of the renewable energy sector's structure, the enhancement of renewable energy capacity, and the improvement of R&D investment and the institutional environment are proposed.

However, long and continuous time series analyses of the relationships between the UGI landscape and PM2.5 pollution remain a challenge. In the present study, then we analyzed the PM2.5 variations and their relationships with the UGI landscape patterns at the urban agglomeration (the urban area of CLUA) and neighborhood scales (6 neighborhood zones with radii ranging from 500 m to 3000 m around the sampling point.). The results illustrated PM2.5 concentration increased slightly in the urban expansion areas and decreased in some old urban areas, but the changing trend was not significant. The PM2.5 concentrations were different among the four seasons in this area, and the lowest and highest concentrations occurred in winter (66.79 μg/m³) and summer (24.32 μg/m³), respectively. At the urban agglomeration scale, just a very small proportion of the PM2.5 variations in the CLUA during this study period could be attributed to the UGI landscape pattern, wind speed and relative humidity; PM2.5 concentrations were affected more strongly by wind speed and relative humidity than by UGI landscape patterns; the LSI (landscape shape index) and bridges served as the main landscape indicators affecting the PM2.5 concentrations among the UGI landscape patterns factors. At the neighborhood scale, the LPI (largest patch index), AWMSI (area-weighted mean shape index), AI (aggregation index), Core and Loop served as the main UGI landscape indicators influencing PM2.5 and had different degrees of influence on the PM2.5 concentrations; the seasonal and scale effects of UGI landscape patterns on PM2.5 concentrations at neighborhood scales were observed. Comparatively, the effects of the UGI landscape patterns on PM2.5 concentration seem more significant at the neighborhood scale than at the urban agglomeration scale. The findings of this multiscale analysis can provide new insights into understanding the relationships between UGI landscape patterns and urban air pollution at different scales, and provide a scientific reference for urban planning and air pollution control. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Green infrastructure; Landscape pattern; Neighborhood scale; PM2.5 pollution; Urban agglomeration","Agglomeration; Air pollution; Air pollution control; Continuous time systems; Time series analysis; Urban planning; Green infrastructure; Landscape pattern; Multi scale analysis; Neighborhood scale; Neighbourhood; PM 2.5; PM2.5 pollution; Urban agglomerations; Urban areas; Wind speed; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116919242

Based on panel data from 30 provinces in China which were collected firms in operation between 1999 and 2016, this paper used a difference-in-differences (DID) approach to assess whether China's current carbon-abatement policies (i.e. energy-saving goals (ESGs), new energy subsidies (NESs), and carbon emission trading schemes (ETSs)) can direct innovation activities towards low-carbon technologies; then, this paper analyzed the channels involved from the perspective of investment preferences. In terms of policy-induced effects, the contributions of both ESGs and NESs policies were discovered to be relatively stable in the 11th five-year period (FYP) (2006–2010), but weaker in the following 12th FYP, and the ETSs’ effect on innovation was found to be not significant. In particular, the estimates for policy coordination were not significant, and the innovation-inducing effects of NESs were moderated by market performance. For the analysis of channels, only administrative regulation had a reinforcing effect on the propensity to pursue technological investment.

Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl offers excellent CO2reduction ability of functional units to BTN-Re; meanwhile, the abundant Lewis base sites brought in by melamine promote capture of CO2contributing to the reduction of CO2. Steady-state fluorescence tests confirm that integrating Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl into BTN-Re skeletons efficiently inhibits electron-hole recombination.

Previous research focused on the impact of sea embankment reclamation on the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks in salt marshes, whereas no study attempted to assess the impact of sea embankment reclamation on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in such marshes. Here we examined the impact of sea embankment reclamation on GHG stocks and fluxes of an invasive Spartina alterniflora and native Phragmites australis dominated salt marsh in the Dongtai wetlands of China’s Jiangsu province. Sea embankment reclamation significantly decreased soil total organic C by 54.0% and total organic N by 73.2%, decreasing plant biomass, soil moisture, and soil salinity in both plants’ marsh. It increased CO2 emissions by 38.2% and 13.5%, and reduced CH4 emissions by 34.5% and 37.1%, respectively, in the Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis marshes. The coastal embankment wall also significantly increased N2 O emission by 48.9% in the Phragmites australis salt marsh and reduced emissions by 17.2% in the Spartina alterniflora marsh. The fluxes of methane CH4 and carbon dioxide CO2 were similar in both restored and unrestored sections, whereas the fluxes of nitrous oxide N2 O were substantially different owing to increased nitrate as a result of N-loading. Our findings show that sea embankment reclamation significantly alters coastal marsh potential to sequester C and N, particularly in native Phragmites australis salt marshes. As a result, sea embankment reclamation essentially weakens native and invasive saltmarshes’ C and N sinks, potentially depleting C and N sinks in coastal China’s wetlands. Stakeholders and policymakers can utilize this scientific evidence to strike a balance between seawall reclamation and invasive plant expansion in coastal wetlands. © 2021 by the authors.

This study identified turbidite records in a gravity core (BoB-104) taken from near a currently inactive channel (E4) based on lithology, geochemical and mineralogical parameters. This core contained turbidite and hemipelagic layers in this core. This study identified 21 turbidite layers which exhibited consistent provenance with the hemipelagic layers, showing a two end-member mixing pattern and indicating consistent sources since the last glacial period. Typical turbidite layer analysis was used to study the possible turbidite deposition mechanism. Features such as the lithology break interface, normal graded sequence, a consistent pattern of a sharp increase and gradual decrease in the variation of the mean grain size (Mz), and median grain size (D50) and Si/Al ratios commonly implied a continuous deposition in accordance with variations in densities and particle sizes. This study identified long-term evolution of turbidite deposition in the eastern middle Bengal Fan that appears to be the last and indispensable part of the systematic response of the “Bengal depositional system” to the climate. Four stages were identified from the turbidite records and all the identified intervals showed synchronous changes with the entire system. The Indian summer monsoon (ISM) played a dominant role in the system interactions. The sea level affects the turbidity system by regulating the transition of the deposition center between the deep-sea and the shelf, whereas the migration of the main channel to the “Active Valley (AV)” between 14.5 ka to 10.4 ka almost halted the deposition of turbidites along the E4 channel. Thus, turbidity activity in the eastern middle Bengal Fan is not an isolated incident but part of a comprehensive system resuling from global and regional changes at different scales. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bengal Fan; Indian summer monsoon; Late Pleistocene; Provenance; Sea level; Turbidity current","Grain size and shape; Lithology; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Particle size analysis; Sea level; Turbidity; Comprehensive system; Continuous deposition; Deposition mechanism; Depositional system; Indian summer monsoon; Last glacial period; Median grain sizes; System interactions; Deposition; climate; deep sea; lithology; migration; source-sink dynamics; turbidity; Bengal; Bengal Fan; Indian Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113406119

There are overwhelming studies of how urbanization contributes to the increase of carbon emissions. However, it has been unclear how emission and economic change within urban systems evolve with social development in a long period. Therefore, feasible emission reduction policy for the near future is desired. Taking Guangdong province as a case study, Dynamic simulation model of carbon emission is developed to assess the stability of a metabolic system and simultaneously, explore potential changes of gross domestic products (GDP) and carbon emissions over a long period from 2000 to 2035, based on comprehensive applications of three-perspective stability and linkage analyses. Furthermore, eight simulated scenarios are developed to assess potential emissions and GDP changes of 2035 under the condition of reducing the final demand of key carbon emission sectors to varying degrees. We find that emission flows experience a remarkable increase during investigated years. Under the premise of minimizing economic losses and reduce emissions per unit GDP, emission reduction policies for final demand should be implemented on domestic products-reliant sectors rather than imported products-reliant sectors. © 2021","Carbon emission; Final demand; Input-output; RAS method; Scenario simulation; Urban metabolism","Carbon; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Losses; Sustainable development; Carbon emissions; Carbon metabolism; Demand-side; Emission reduction policies; Final demand; Gross domestic products; Input-output; RAS method; Scenario simulations; Urban metabolisms; Metabolism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112139451

Haze has obvious seasonal/daily variations across the globe. The concentration of fine particulate matter is higher in winter and lower in summer, and its daily variation shows bimodal characteristics. The objective of this paper is researching the formation mechanism of this pattern. The coupling between earth-air and fine particulate concentration is studied by monitoring and correlation analysis. Monitoring results have shown that earth-air pressure generally fluctuates with the overall atmospheric pressure. There is a mechanism of ‘passive breathing’ of earth-air, and due to the effect of seasonal/daily changes in soil temperature, ‘autonomous breathing’ also exists. The magnitude of the autonomous breathing effect is small (3.57 mm/d), whereas the passive breathing effect is much larger (421.25 mm/d). Correlation coefficients between volume of earth-air passive breathing and PM2.5 on yearly and daily timescales are 0.82 and 0.84, respectively. Statistical analysis suggests that when atmospheric pressure rises, atmospheric air is compressed, and concentration increases. At the same time, a part of the atmosphere enters the soil and causes back-mixing. When atmospheric pressure drops, atmospheric air expands, and filtered earth-air enters the atmosphere, reducing the near-surface PM2.5 concentration. This results in PM2.5 concentration changing synchronously with the earth-air passive breathing. Therefore, passive breathing of earth-air has important impact on the formation of haze patterns, and the atmospheric pumping effect provides the main driving force. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Earth-air; Fine particulate concentration; Haze pattern; PM2.5","Developing countries; Economics; Particles (particulate matter); Urban growth; Atmospheric air; Breathing effects; Daily variations; Earth-air; Economic growths; Fine particulate concentration; Fine particulates; Global environmental problems; Haze pattern; PM 2.5; Atmospheric pressure; atmospheric pressure; concentration (composition); developing world; diurnal variation; economic growth; formation mechanism; haze; particulate matter; suburbanization; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118704927

However, previous studies largely focused on life cycle assessment about environmental risk and impact through measuring environmental emissions, or fertilization scheme recommendation with single optimization goal based on field experiments. In this study, we used soil testing and formulated fertilization field data from the experimental region (Ezhou, South China) to acquire the optimal application scheme of synthetic fertilizers for paddy field crops. Based on four crops (i.e. rapeseed, early rice, middle rice and late rice) and two rotation systems (i.e. rapeseed-rice rotation and rice-rice rotation), we applied the life cycle assessment method to analyze life cycle inventories and assess environmental impacts. The fertilizer production and resource consumption were defined as the initial boundary, and the crop production and environmental emissions were defined as the terminal boundary. Four crops were assessed and compared under 1t crop grain functional unit and 1hm2 cropland area functional unit, and two rotation systems were assessed and compared under 1hm2 cropland area functional unit. The environmental impact categories assessed were energy consumption, climate change, eutrophication, environmental acidification, land use and water consumption. Based on three fertilization schemes (i.e. fertilization on benchmark value (Schemeb), yield balance value (Schemeyb) and threshold value (Schemet)), we subsequently simulated crop yields and environmental emissions of fertilization schemes. The results show that the estimated environmental impact category indicators assessed by life cycle per t of rapeseed were higher than rice, and that per hm2 of rapeseed-rice rotation were lower than rice-rice rotation. Eutrophication contributed the most (over 80%) to the environmental impact of producing 1t crop, followed by environmental acidification. Ammonia (NH3) emission accounted for a high contribution to eutrophication (about 30%) or environmental acidification (about 90%), and nitrate ion (NO3-) loss contributed the most to eutrophication (about 40%). The results also show that paddy field crops reached maximum yields but caused greatest environmental impact under the Schemeyb. Whereas, the Schemet could guarantee paddy field crops to keep average yields but cause minimum environmental impact, which was the optimal fertilization scheme. Our study indicates that producing 1t rice and 1hm2 rapeseed-rice rotation had higher environmental benefit than producing 1t rapeseed and 1hm2 rice-rice rotation respectively. Eutrophication could lead to the biggest threat to ecological environment, and the key to alleviating this environmental impact was reducing NH3 volatilization and NO3- loss. Our work implies that the optimal fertilization scheme can both guarantee food sufficiency and reduce environmental pollution, which is applicable combining with soil testing and formulated fertilization technology in Ezhou. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental impact; Ezhou; Life cycle assessment; Optimal fertilization; Paddy crop production","Ammonia; Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Land use; Oilseeds; Risk assessment; Rotation; Soil testing; Soils; Crop production; Environmental acidification; Environmental emissions; Ezhou; Fertilisation; Field crops; Functional units; Optimal fertilization; Paddy crop production; Paddy fields; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116928543

Combined with the responsibility of renewable energy consumption, green certificate trading mechanism, carbon emission rights trading, and China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER), a regional integrated energy system operation optimization model was proposed. The model aims to minimize the total cost of the system, which included with electric bus, thermal bus, and cold bus. Setting different scenarios for the given example, the results show that the optimized model could effectively reduce the operating costs of the system.

In many countries, actions are taken with the main aim of reducing CO2 emissions. The main action, especially in developed countries, is decarbonization. The European Union has become one of the organizations that plays a leading role in decarbonization of the economy. For this reason, renewable energy sources are being intensively developed in the EU countries. Solar energy with the use of PV installations is developing the fastest. Poland is one of the European leaders in photovoltaic development, and according to estimates for 2021–2025, it will continue to be. The aim of this study was to find out the opinions of people toward actions related to the decarbonization policy in Poland. These opinions were obtained through the prism of respondents’ attitudes toward energy produced by means of PV micro-installations. A questionnaire survey was used in this research. The survey was conducted using the CAWI (Computer-Assisted Web Interview) technique. To analyze the results of the study, a Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA test and U–Mann Whitney test were used. Responses were obtained from 633 people. The results obtained from the survey allowed us to draw conclusions, which include the following: (1) a lack of general conviction of respondents about the effectiveness of Poland’s decarbonization policy on reducing global CO2 emissions, especially among those who show a higher willingness to use PV installations, (2) the willingness to use PV installations is motivated by economic rather than environmental benefits, (3) the need for more widespread public campaigns aimed at promoting the benefits of decarbonization and renewable energy sources, and (4) the finding that the respondents’ region of residence (with a different degree of insolation) mattered for the willingness to use PV installations. © 2021 by the authors.

The aim of this study was to examine the association between chronic exposure to air pollution in Israeli cities and towns, their demographic and socioeconomic status, and COVID-19 morbidity, during the three local morbidity waves. Methods: We examined the associations between: (a) annual average concentrations of NOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5 and SO2 in 2016–2019, and demographic and socioeconomic parameters, and (b) COVID-19 positive cases in 279 Israeli cities and towns, in the four state-wide morbidity peaks: 1st wave peak: March 31st, 2020; 2nd wave peaks: July 24th and September 27th, 2020, and the 3rd wave peak: January 17th, 2021, which occurred after the beginning of the nationwide vaccination campaign. These associations were calculated using both Spearman correlations and multivariate linear regressions. Results: We found statistically significant positive correlations between the concentrations of most pollutants in 2016–19 and COVID-19 morbidity rate at the first three timepoints but not the 4th (January 17th, 2021). Population density and city/town total population were also positively associated with the COVID-19 morbidity rates at these three timepoints, but not the 4th, in which socioeconomic parameters were more dominant - we found a statistically significant negative correlation between socioeconomic cluster and COVID-19 morbidity. In addition, all multivariate models including PM2.5 concentrations were statistically significant, and PM2.5 concentrations were positively associated with the COVID-19 morbidity rates in all models. Conclusions: We found a nationwide association between population chronic exposure to five main air pollutants in Israeli cities and towns, and COVID-19 morbidity rates during two of the three morbidity waves experienced in Israel. The widespread morbidity that was related to socioeconomic factors during the 3rd wave, emphasizes the need for special attention to morbidity prevention in socioeconomically vulnerable populations and especially in large household communities. Nevertheless, this ecological study has several limitations, such as the inability to draw conclusions about causality or mechanisms of action. The growing body of evidence, regarding association between exacerbated COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates and long-term chronic exposure to elevated concentrations of air pollutants should serve as a wake-up call to policy makers regarding the urgent need to reduce air pollution and its harmful effects. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Environmental exposure; NOx; PM10; PM2.5; Population density; Socioeconomic-cluster; Vaccination campaign","bnt 162b 2; carbon monoxide; comirnaty; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; demography; morbidity; mortality; OECD; socioeconomic conditions; vaccination; air pollutant; air pollution; ambient air; Article; city; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; human; Israeli; long term exposure; morbidity; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; population density; socioeconomics; vaccination; vulnerable population; adverse event; analysis; environmental exposure; particulate matter; toxicity; Israel; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; COVID-19; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Morbidity; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110417967

These legume crops are sensitive to hydric and heat stresses. The adaptation depends on the efficiency of specific cultivars to use the available resources to produce biomass. This capacity is determined by the genotype and agronomical management practices. The present work aimed to uncover the influence of Baltic agro-environmental conditions (fava bean cultivar, plant density, climate, and soil features) on yield and protein content. For this, field trials were set under Baltic agro-climatic conditions, in Latvia and Estonia with five commercially available fava bean cultivars, representing broad genetic variation (‘Gloria’, ‘Julia’, ‘Jogeva’, ‘Lielplatones’, and ‘Bauska’). The results evidenced ‘Bauska’, ‘Julia’, and ‘Lielplatones’, as the most productive cultivars in terms of seed yield (4.5, 3.7, and 4.6 t ha−1, respectively) and protein yield (1.39, 1.22, and 1.36 t ha−1, respectively) under Estonian and Latvian agro-climatic conditions. Sowing these specific cultivars at densities of 30–40 seeds m−2 constitutes sustainable management for fava bean production in conventional cropping systems in the Baltic region. © 2021 by the authors.

Nitrogen and phosphorous removal can be challenging to achieve efficiently, and in the case of phosphorous removal, can often necessitate the use of chemicals. There is a major drive globally to improve wastewater treatment infrastructure, whilst simultaneously reducing the carbon footprint of the process. The intermittently aerated sequencing batch reactor offers a modification of the well-known sequencing batch reactor process that can enable lower energy requirements than conventional sequencing batch reactor processes and can facilitate enhanced nutrient removal capaci-ties. However, to date much of the previous literature has focused on relatively short laboratory-scale trials (often with synthetic wastewater) which may not be representative of larger scale system performance. This study explored the intermittently aerated sequencing batch reactor technology via a case-study deployment at a dairy production facility, in terms of treatment efficiency and energy efficiency with a focus on optimisation between phases. High treatment capacity and operational flexibility was achieved with NH4-N removals averaging &gt;89%, PO4-P removal averaging &gt;90% and total suspended solids removal averaging &gt;97%. This research demonstrates the characteristics of intermittently aerated sequencing batch reactor technology at scale to effectively achieve biological nutrient removal. In addition, this study demonstrated that when effectively managed, energy sav-ings and reductions in carbon emissions in the region of 36–68% are achievable through optimisation of reactor operation. © 2021 by the authors.

Stroke and Alzheimer Disease (AD) are two pathologies with extensive NVU dysfunction. The cell types of the NVU change in both structure and function following an ischemic insult and during the development of AD pathology. Stroke and AD share common risk factors such as cardiovascular disease, and also share similarities at a molecular level. In both diseases, disruption of metabolic support, mitochondrial dysfunction, increase in oxidative stress, release of inflammatory signaling molecules, and blood brain barrier disruption result in NVU dysfunction, leading to cell death and neurodegeneration. Improved therapeutic strategies for both AD and stroke are needed. Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are well-known targets for other diseases and are being recently investigated for their function in the development of cerebrovascular pathology. CAs catalyze the hydration of CO2 to produce bicarbonate and a proton. This reaction is important for pH homeostasis, overturn of cerebrospinal fluid, regulation of CBF, and other physiological functions. Humans express 15 CA isoforms with different distribution patterns. Recent studies provide evidence that CA inhibition is protective to NVU cells in vitro and in vivo, in models of stroke and AD pathology. CA inhibitors are FDA-approved for treatment of glaucoma, high-altitude sickness, and other indications. Most FDA-approved CA inhibitors are pan-CA inhibitors; however, specific CA isoforms are likely to modulate the NVU function. This review will summarize the literature regarding the use of pan-CA and specific CA inhibitors along with genetic manipulation of specific CA isoforms in stroke and AD models, to bring light into the functions of CAs in the NVU. Although pan-CA inhibitors are protective and safe, we hypothesize that targeting specific CA isoforms will increase the efficacy of CA inhibition and reduce side effects. More studies to further determine specific CA isoforms functions and changes in disease states are essential to the development of novel therapies for cerebrovascular pathology, occurring in both stroke and AD.

This is the basis to support the design of adaptation strategies to climate change. Altimeter sea level products are operationally produced and distributed by the E.U. Copernicus services dedicated to the marine environment (CMEMS) and climate change (C3S). The present article is a review paper that intends to explain why and to which extent the sea level monitoring indicators derived from these products are appropriate to develop adaptation strategies to SLR. We first present the main key scientific questions and challenges related to SLR monitoring. The different processing steps of the altimeter production system are presented including those ensuring the quality and the stability of the sea level record (starting in 1993). Due to the numerous altimeter algorithms required for the production, it is complex to ensure both the retrieval of high-resolution mesoscale signals and the stability of the large-scale wavelengths. This has led to the operational production of two different sea level datasets whose specificities are characterized. We present the corresponding indicators: the global mean sea level (GMSL) evolution and the regional map of sea level trends, with their respective uncertainties. We discuss how these products and associated indicators support adaptation to SLR, and we illustrate with an example of downstream application.

However, many challenges remain, including the realisation of large-scale systems with high current density and stability. Herein, we report a carbon-supported tungsten-seed-based 3D silver dendrite (W@AgD) catalyst with abundant nanograin boundaries that exhibit enhanced CO2 reduction (CO2R) performance and stability. In zero-gap CO2 electrolyzer, W@AgD showed outstanding catalytic activity with a maximum CO partial current density of 400 mA cm–2 and stable operation for 100 h at 150 mA cm–2. The 3D dendrites improve CO2 mass transfer, while the abundant grain boundaries drive the AgxCyOz layer near the surface after activation, leading to superior CO2R catalytic activity owing to the strong local electric fields. In a stand-alone photovoltaic-electrochemical system, we achieved a solar-to-CO efficiency (ηSTC) of 12.1 % at 1 A. Thus, the synthesized catalyst and system are suitable for efficient solar energy storage. © 2021 The Author(s)","Ag dendrites; Carbon monoxide; Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR); Photovoltaic-electrochemical system; Solar to chemical conversion","Artificial photosynthesis; Carbon monoxide; Catalyst activity; Electric fields; Electrocatalysts; Grain boundaries; Heterojunctions; Mass transfer; Reduction; Silver compounds; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Ag dendrite; Ag$++$; CO conversion; Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR); Electrochemical conversion; Electrochemical systems; Photovoltaic-electrochemical system; Photovoltaics; Solar to chemical conversion; ]+ catalyst; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107824642

The present study reports current organic carbon stocks and sequestration rates in the coastal areas of West Sea, South Sea, and East Sea of South Korea, encompassing entire intertidal areas using long-term field survey combined with remote sensing technology. Twenty-one intertidal flats were targeted across seven provinces (Gyeonggi, Chungnam, Jeonbuk, Jeonnam, Gyeongnam, Gyeongbuk, Gangwon). Out of the evaluated environmental parameters, mud content represented a significant factor controlling sedimentary organic carbon stocks across target areas, and was significantly positively correlated to the total organic carbon (p &lt; 0.05). Organic carbon stocks measured in salt marshes (i.e., upper intertidal zone) reflected the high carbon fixation capacity of halophytes through primary production. Sediment textural type was classified using analysis of remotely sensed imagery, and was closely correlated to field-based classification data (p &lt; 0.05). Using field and remote sensing results, we estimated total organic carbon stocks (13,142,149 Mg C) and sequestration rates (71,383 Mg C yr−1) in the tidal flats of South Korea.

While governments are promoting the transition to alternative fuel vehicles, the lack of refueling and recharging infrastructure for the vehicles is a key barrier to the adoption. At the same time, the public sector cannot solely provide needed alternative fueling infrastructure due to limited financial resources. Consequently, governments in the U.S. have been working on facilitating the private sector’s investment in alternative fueling infrastructure. The most common approach was financial incentive programs and policies, but the U.S. also promotes self-organized collaborative governance of alternative fuels across sectors at the local level. This paper asks whether these two approaches stimulate the private sector’s engagement in providing alternative fueling infrastructure. This study uses the case of the Clean Cities program that targets the reduction in petroleum usage, adoption of alternative fuels and creation of self-governance at the local level. Local private businesses, local government agencies and non-profit organizations voluntarily participate in the local transition to alternative fuels. Therefore, this governance aims at facilitating more sustainable actions and business choices in the private sector. This paper tests the hypotheses of whether the local self-governance of Clean Cities increases privately-owned alternative fueling infrastructure using panel fixed-effects Poisson regression models. Based on the data of counties in 12 states from 2004 to 2015, the results of empirical analysis suggest that both self-governance and financial incentive programs are effective in increasing the engagement of private actors in providing alternative fueling infrastructure. © 2021 by the author.

They imply more frequent extreme weather events, which are responsible of sea level rise, coastal erosion, flooding, droughts, and desertification. Mitigation and adaptation represent intertwined strategies for counteracting climate changes. Mitigation is associated to the lessening of the causes of climate changes and includes actions reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Adaptation is a proactive concept addressing how humans can adapt and benefit from climate change. The mainstreaming and integration of adaptation to climate change into routine practice can be favored by Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of regional policies, plans and programmes. In this study, we aim at scrutinizing a set of SEA reports of regional plans and programmes adopted in Sardinia (Italy), to investigate if -and to what extent- adaptation to climate change has characterized planning and programming tools. Evidence shows that the integration of adaptation-driven issues into regional planning is still in its infancy but presents the signs of promising expansion. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Adaptation to climate change; Content analysis; Regional plans and programmes; Regional strategy for adaptation to climate change; Strategic environmental assessment","Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Regional planning; Sea level; Adaptation to climate changes; Coastal erosion; Extreme weather events; Global environment; Planning and programming; Plans and programmes; Regional policies; Strategic environmental assessments; Climate change; adaptation; climate change; extreme event; greenhouse gas; regional planning; strategic environmental assessment; Italy; Sardinia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111025813

Long-duration rice cultivars along with conventional till farming and lack of irrigation facilities limit the chances of growing succeeding crops like pulses in rice fallow areas. Therefore, a field study was conducted to test the hypothesis that cultivating short-duration rice and lentil (Lens culinaris Medic.) cultivars along with residue retention through mulching or standing rice stubble under no-till (NT) farming for lentil can enhance the productivity in rice fallow areas and improve economic returns from the cropping system by conserving soil moisture and improving soil properties and carbon stocks. Two rice cultivars (namely, Shahsarang-1: high yielding and medium duration; and Mendri: local, low yielding, and long-duration variety), two high biomass lentil varieties (DPL-81: early duration and IPL-406: medium duration), and three rice residue management practices (namely, residue removal, 20 cm standing stubble, and mulching at 5 Mg ha−1 in lentil) were tested in the rice–lentil system. After harvest of rainy season rice, lentil was sown under NT using a manually operated furrow opener. Results of a 3-year study revealed that rice residue retention as mulch at 5 Mg ha−1 and 20 cm standing stubbles (~2 Mg ha−1) conserved residual soil moisture and recorded significantly lower bulk density (1.10 and 1.09 Mg m−3), increased water-holding capacity (57.05% and 55.14%), and improved water infiltration rate (3.47 and 3.30 cm hr−1) compared to residue removal. Soil organic carbon (SOC), soil microbial biomass carbon, dehydrogenase enzyme activity, available nitrogen, and phosphorus contents at 0–15 cm soil depth were significantly higher by 7.2%–11.1%, 3.9%–6.8%, 4.1%–6.7%, 2.7%–6.4%, and 2.7%–8.0%, respectively, under standing rice stubbles/mulching than residue removal. The SOC stock (25.3 Mg ha-1) under mulching was significantly higher than that recorded under residue removal at 0–15 cm (23.4 Mg ha−1) and remained non-significant at 15–30 cm depth. A significantly higher mean seed yield of lentil was obtained under mulching (1.68 Mg ha−1) and standing stubbles (1.49 Mg ha−1) than that under removal (1.27 Mg ha−1). Average productivity of lentil (1.53 Mg ha−1) after medium-duration rice variety Shahsarang-1 was greater than that grown after local long-duration rice variety Mendri (1.43 Mg ha−1). The mean seed yield of early lentil variety DPL-81 grown after medium-duration rice was significantly higher (1.60 Mg ha−1) than medium-duration lentil variety IPL-406 (1.36 Mg ha−1). Thus, cultivating medium-duration rice (Shahsarang-1) followed by early-duration lentil variety (DPL-81) and rice residue retention either through mulching or standing rice stubble is recommended for improving soil properties, carbon stock, and productivity of lentil in rice fallow areas of the Eastern Himalayan region of India and other similar agro-ecosystems. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","hill ecosystem; residue retention; rice fallows; soil carbon stock; soil properties; yields","Biomass; Cultivation; Enzyme activity; Infiltration; Irrigation; Organic carbon; Soil conservation; Soil moisture; Soil testing; Carbon stocks; Hill ecosystem; Long duration; Residue removal; Residue retention; Rice fallow; Rice residues; Soil carbon stock; Soil property; Yield; Productivity; carbon storage; crop yield; infiltration; land degradation; mulching; rice; soil property; yield response; India; Lens culinaris; Matthiola; Oryza sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118438245

The primary benefit of EVs is the high fuel efficiency by using only electricity, and hence lowers the dependency on fossil fuels and significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Although the number of EVs has increased, the availability of EV charging stations for public use has been disproportionate to its demand. More recently, populations residing in the Southern California region have been faced with challenges such as range anxiety owing to the uneven spatial distribution of charging stations throughout the region. As the EV population continues to expand, identifying hotspots of EV charging and barriers to the equitable access of charging stations have gained much importance. Our study uses a geospatial data fusion approach with spatial statistics to combine EV charging station data, land use information, and American Community Survey (ACS) data at the census block group level in Orange County, California to discover optimal locations to broaden the EV charging network and identify potential equity issues surrounding charging station placements. © 2021 ACM.","charging demand; data fusion; electric vehicle; KDE; least cost path","Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Surveys; Charging demands; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle usages; Fuel efficiency; Geospatial data fusion; Greenhouse gas emissions; Growing demand; KDE; Least cost path; Data fusion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121119342

Those hopes rest on the narrative that an abundance of geological storage opportunity is available to meet all needs. In this Perspective, we present the contrasting view that deep uncertainty over the sustainable injection rate at any given location will constrain the pace and scale of carbon capture and storage deployment. Although such constraints will probably have implications in most world regions, they may be particularly relevant in major developing Asian economies. To minimize the risk that these constraints pose to the decarbonization imperative, we discuss steps that are urgently needed to evaluate, plan for and reduce the uncertainty over CO2 storage prospects. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.",,"abundance; carbon sequestration; economics; geological feature; risk; uncertainty analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117522707

Waterfront settings provide a unique opportunity for UHI mitigation, as cool winds (i.e. sea breezes) provide good cooling conditions. We used ENVI-met numerical simulations to investigate the synergistic mitigation effects of redeveloped urban forms, ventilation corridors, and extensive greenery on local microclimate and outdoor thermal comfort at an urban waterfront in Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong. The thermal performance along the waterfront and within an inner urbanised area was evaluated in three scenarios: existing configuration (Case A), redeveloped building form (Case B), and Case B with a ventilation corridor and extensive greenery added. In the study area's subtropical climate, the additional strategies used led to a synergistic improvement in microclimate and thermal comfort in both settings. The appropriate use of combined urban forms and ventilation corridors along waterfronts can thus lead to a more acceptable pedestrian-level wind environment and enhance the ventilation potential within inner urbanised areas. The cooling intensity of greenery (turf and green facades) along such waterfronts can also be extended for further benefits. Overall, the synergistic mitigation effects of redeveloped urban forms, ventilation corridors, and extensive greenery in proximity to water bodies demonstrated here provide science-based guidance for the use of bioclimatic design along urban waterfronts in order to achieve improved microclimates and thermal comfort at neighbourhood scales. © 2021","Bioclimatic design; Microclimate; Mitigation strategies; Outdoor thermal comfort; Waterfront","Atmospheric temperature; Thermal comfort; Thermal pollution; Bio-climatic designs; Hong-kong; Microclimate; Mitigation effects; Mitigation strategy; Outdoor thermal comfort; Urban form; Urban heat island; Urbanized area; Waterfront; Ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111269944

Such improvements would also help reduce greenhouse gases. For this, research and development has focused on one factor that has a significant impact on the performance of these engines: the phenomenon of cavitation. In fact, most high-performance heat engines are fitted with a high-speed fuel supply system. These high speeds lead to the formation of the phenomenon of cavitation generating instabilities in the flow and subsequently causing disturbances in the combustion process and in the efficiency of the engine. In this review article, it is a question of making a state-of-the-art review on the various studies which have dealt with the characterization of the phenomenon of cavitation and addressing the possible means that can be put in place to reduce its effects. The bibliographic study was carried out based on five editors who are very involved in this theme. From the census carried out, it has been shown that there are many works which deal with the means of optimization that must be implemented in order to fight against the phenomenon of cavitation. Among these solutions, there is the optimization of the geometry of the injector in which the fuel flows and there is the type of fuel used. Indeed, it is shown that the use of a biofuel, which, by its higher viscosity, decreases the effects of cavitation. Most of these jobs are performed under cold fluidic conditions; however, there is little or no work that directly addresses the effect of cavitation on the combustion process. Consequently, this review article highlights the importance of carrying out research work, with the objective of characterizing the effect of cavitation on the combustion process and the need to use a biofuel as an inhibitor solution on the cavitation phenomenon and as a means of energy transition. © 2021 by the authors.

The reduction depends on the amount of LAI and their physical and chemical proper-ties, which vary spatially and temporally. Spectral reflectance data and snow and ice samples, containing LAI, were collected in the ablation zone of the Djankuat Glacier, Central Caucasus, Russia. The spectra of the samples containing mineral dust transported from deserts were characterized by negative visible near‐infrared gradients and were different from the spectra of clean aged snow and exposed glacier ice and from the samples containing mineral dust produced locally. Geochemical and mineralogical analysis using X‐ray diffraction and X‐ray fluorescence spectrom-etry showed that samples containing desert dust were characterised by a high proportion of clay materials and such minerals as smectites, illite–smectites and palygorskite and by a smaller size of mineral particles. They were enriched in chromium, zinc and vanadium. The latter served as an indicator of dust transport over or origin from the oil‐producing regions of the Middle East. There was a strong negative correlation between the amount of organic matter and mineral dust in the collected samples and the albedo of surfaces from which the samples were collected. The results suggested that organic matter reduced albedo more efficiently than mineral dust.

Although oxygen plasma has been used to create highly active copper oxide electrodes for CO2RR, how such treatment alters the copper surface is still poorly understood. Here, we study the oxidation of Cu(100) and Cu(111) surfaces by sequential exposure to a low-pressure oxygen plasma at room temperature. We used scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), low energy electron microscopy (LEEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) for the comprehensive characterization of the resulting oxide films. O2-plasma exposure initially induces the growth of 3-dimensional oxide islands surrounded by an O-covered Cu surface. With ongoing plasma exposure, the islands coalesce and form a closed oxide film. Utilizing spectroscopy, we traced the evolution of metallic Cu, Cu2O and CuO species upon oxygen plasma exposure and found a dependence of the surface structure and chemical state on the substrate's orientation. On Cu(100) the oxide islands grow with a lower rate than on the (111) surface. Furthermore, while on Cu(100) only Cu2O is formed during the initial growth phase, both Cu2O and CuO species are simultaneously generated on Cu(111). Finally, prolonged oxygen plasma exposure results in a sandwiched film structure with CuO at the surface and Cu2O at the interface to the metallic support. A stable CuO(111) surface orientation is identified in both cases, aligned to the Cu(111) support, but with two coexisting rotational domains on Cu(100). These findings illustrate the possibility of tailoring the oxidation state, structure and morphology of metallic surfaces for a wide range of applications through oxygen plasma treatments. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Copper oxides; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Electrons; Morphology; Oxidation; Oxide films; Oxygen; Scanning electron microscopy; Scanning tunneling microscopy; Surface structure; X ray absorption; Catalytic properties; Copper surface; Electrochemical reductions; Low energy electron microscopy; Low-pressure oxygen plasma; Near edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopies; Oxide islands; Oxygen plasma exposure; Oxygen plasmas; Plasma exposure; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118654976

In the present work, a land-use-constrained generation model is proposed to identify natural pathways for energy flows within a politically administered region so as to evolve a sustainable nexus between electricity generation and consumption in a decentralized power generation scenario. The model envisages district-level coordination of electricity generation on barren rocky waste land and state-level coordination of distribution. Application of the model to five south Indian states, individually and together, demonstrates how the model is able to account for intra- and interstate disparities in electricity consumption and photovoltaic electricity generation potential. Two of these states can go completely renewable by using all available barren rocky area for electricity generation while the other three will have to rely on as yet untapped off-shore wind power and nuclear power to move towards carbon neutrality in power generation. When considered together, almost all the day time electrical energy demand of all the states can be met by utilizing barren rocky waste land for harnessing solar energy, thus saving considerably on storage losses.

The research is based on the method of comparison and analysis associated with the concept of multipurpose, rational, sustainable use of forest resources. Carbon stocks were estimated using an analytical method. The volumes of atmospheric carbon and carbon dioxide absorbed by forests, as well as the volume of oxygen released, have been calculated. The calculation results show that the maximum amount of carbon is absorbed by ordinary ash (931.9 t/ha) and English oak (476.7 t/ha).

Many of these services are positively correlated with tree size and structure. The quantification of above-ground biomass (AGB) is of especial importance to assess its carbon storage potential. However, quantification of AGB is difficult and the allometries applied are often based on forest trees, which are subject to very different growing conditions, competition and form. In this article we highlight the potential of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) techniques to extract highly detailed information on urban tree structure and AGB. Methods: Fifty-five urban trees distributed over seven cities in Switzerland were measured using TLS and traditional forest inventory techniques before they were felled and weighed. Tree structure, volume and AGB from the TLS point clouds were extracted using quantitative structure modelling. TLS-derived AGB estimates were compared with AGB estimates based on forest tree allometries dependent on diameter at breast height only. The correlations of various tree metrics as AGB predictors were assessed. Key Results: Estimates of AGB derived by TLS showed good performance when compared with destructively harvested references, with an R2 of 0.954 (RMSE = 556 kg) compared with 0.837 (RMSE = 1159 kg) for allometrically derived AGB estimates. A correlation analysis showed that different TLS-derived wood volume estimates as well as trunk diameters and tree crown metrics show high correlation in describing total wood AGB, outperforming tree height. Conclusions: Wood volume estimates based on TLS show high potential to estimate tree AGB independent of tree species, size and form. This allows us to retrieve highly accurate non-destructive AGB estimates that could be used to establish new allometric equations without the need for extensive destructive harvesting. © 2021 The Author(s).

There is currently a wide range in estimates of high-latitude annual CH4 fluxes, where estimates based on land cover inventories and empirical CH4 flux data or process models (bottom-up approaches) generally are greater than atmospheric inversions (top-down approaches). A limitation of bottom-up approaches has been the lack of harmonization between inventories of site-level CH4 flux data and the land cover classes present in high-latitude spatial datasets. Here we present a comprehensive dataset of small-scale, surface CH4 flux data from 540 terrestrial sites (wetland and non-wetland) and 1247 aquatic sites (lakes and ponds), compiled from 189 studies. The Boreal-Arctic Wetland and Lake Methane Dataset (BAWLD-CH4) was constructed in parallel with a compatible land cover dataset, sharing the same land cover classes to enable refined bottom-up assessments. BAWLD-CH4 includes information on site-level CH4 fluxes but also on study design (measurement method, timing, and frequency) and site characteristics (vegetation, climate, hydrology, soil, and sediment types, permafrost conditions, lake size and depth, and our determination of land cover class). The different land cover classes had distinct CH4 fluxes, resulting from definitions that were either based on or co-varied with key environmental controls. Fluxes of CH4 from terrestrial ecosystems were primarily influenced by water table position, soil temperature, and vegetation composition, while CH4 fluxes from aquatic ecosystems were primarily influenced by water temperature, lake size, and lake genesis. Models could explain more of the between-site variability in CH4 fluxes for terrestrial than aquatic ecosystems, likely due to both less precise assessments of lake CH4 fluxes and fewer consistently reported lake site characteristics. Analysis of BAWLD-CH4 identified both land cover classes and regions within the boreal and arctic domain, where future studies should be focused, alongside methodological approaches. Overall, BAWLD-CH4 provides a comprehensive dataset of CH4 emissions from high-latitude ecosystems that are useful for identifying research opportunities, for comparison against new field data, and model parameterization or validation.

However, little is known about how intra-site historical climate variability can mediate the influences of current climate differences on community dissimilarity and assembly. To fill this gap, we examined and disentangled the interactive effects of historical climate variability and current climate differences on the soil bacterial community dissimilarity and stochasticity of community assembly among 143 sites from 28 forests across eastern China. We hypothesize that the relative importance of stochasticity and community dissimilarity are related to historical climate variability and that an increasing sum of intra-site historical variability enhances stochasticity while reduces dissimilarity between two communities. To test our hypothesis, we statistically controlled for covariates between sites including differences in soil chemistry, plant diversity, spatial distance, and seasonal climate variations at annual timescales. We observed that an increase in inter-site current climate differences led to a reduced impact of stochasticity in community assembly and a pronounced divergence between communities. In stark contrast, when communities were subjected to a high level of intra-site historical climate fluctuation, the observed impact incurred from current climate differences was substantially weakened. Moreover, the influence of increased historical variability was consistent along the gradient of current temperature differences between sites. However, effects induced by historical fluctuation in precipitation were disproportional and only evident when small inter-site differences were observed. Consequently, if the prior climate variability is ignored, especially regarding environmental factors like temperature, we assert that the influence current climate differentiation has on regulating community dissimilarity and assembly stochasticity will be underestimated. Together, our findings highlight the importance and need of explicitly controlling the mean and the historical variability of climate factors for the next “generation” of climate change experiments to come. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","community assembly; community dissimilarity; current climate difference; ecological stochasticity; forest soil; historical climate fluctuation","anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; forest soil; microbial community; paleoclimate; soil chemistry; soil microorganism; stochasticity; temperature effect; China; Bacteria (microorganisms); bacterium; forest; microbiology; microflora; soil; Bacteria; Forests; Microbiota; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113605503

In this review we present the most recent advances in III-V microdisk/microring lasers. We briefly describe basic physics behind photonic WGM resonators and discuss different designs of III-V microdisk/microring lasers. We focus on the technological key points of the different approaches to realize efficient optical and carrier confinement in the laser cavity. Advantages and disadvantages of various types of the laser active region, i.e. quantum well (QW) and quantum dots, are discussed. We also report on successful fabrication of microlasers with gain medium of mixed dimensionality, so called QW-dots, which is promising for low-threshold, temperature insensitive and high output power operation. We summarized and systematically compare the characteristics of electrically driven microlasers. We address one major shortcoming for the circular WGM lasers, which is that the lasing emission is non-directional and non-homogeneous along the cavity rim. High quality factor of the resonator modes and circular symmetry lead to difficulties in obtaining the directional light output and in obtaining significant levels of the output optical power. We compared various techniques for realizing unidirectional emission or coupling to a waveguide. We also discuss high-speed direct modulation, which is another crucial characteristic for the microlasers. We also address energy consumption characteristics of the WGM microlasers under direct modulation and possibilities of energy-to-data ratio minimization. Finally, we summarize the prospects for the WGM lasers and their role in future applications in communications and sensing. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","III-V semiconductor laser; microdisk; microring; quantum dots; quantum well","Acoustic resonators; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Geometry; Light sources; Modulation; Q factor measurement; Quantum well lasers; Semiconductor quantum dots; Semiconductor quantum wells; Whispering gallery modes; Carrier confinements; Circular symmetry; Direct modulation; Future applications; High output power; High quality factors; Planar geometries; Temperature-insensitive; Quantum dot lasers",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114442637

We expand upon previous findings to show with multiple leaf litter types that microbial composition can drive variation in carbon flow from litter decomposition and specific microbial community features are associated with synonymous patterns of carbon flow among litter types. Although plant litter type selects for different decomposer communities, within a litter type, microbial composition drives variation in the quantity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measured at the end of the decomposition period. Bacterial richness was negatively correlated with DOC quantity, supporting our hypothesis that across multiple litter types there are common microbial traits linked to carbon flow patterns. Variation in DOC abundance (i.e. high versus low DOC) driven by microbial composition is tentatively due to differences in bacterial metabolism of labile compounds, rather than catabolism of non-labile substrates such as lignin. The temporal asynchrony of metabolic processes across litter types may be a substantial impediment to discovering more microbial features common to synonymous patterns of carbon flow among litters. Overall, our findings support the concept that carbon flow may be programmed by manipulating microbial community composition. © 2021 The Authors.

Pollution risk begins at each of the industrial premises, presenting different environmental risks which require individual treatment and contingency plans. This is best achieved using SUDS technology, which adds green infrastructure with passive drainage features to the existing drainage and treatment systems, designed to capture the pollutants present in runoff at source on individual sites, for conveyance and on a regional basis serving the whole estate. Here, we develop a multistage investigative framework structured to facilitate the search for relevant solutions and optimization of their design. This paper presents the results of the awareness survey, identifies barriers and opportunities, and reports on case studies dealing with potential SUDS retrofits at industrial facilities, assessing the existing control measures and the scope for new ones with the aim of improving pollution management. The feasibility of SUDS components was assessed with respect to their functional characteristics, economic costs, and logistical constraints. Lack of knowledge related to SUDS and pollution prevention legislation was identified as the major barrier to retrofits, which should be addressed through educational measures. Although comprehensive SUDS retrofits could be prohibitive in cost for small and medium-sized companies, partial and affordable retrofit solutions can be easily implemented to achieve the environmental benefits sought. In addition to the improvements in water quality and alleviation of flood risk, the introduction of Blue-Green Infrastructure will bring about further multiple benefits related to such ecosystem services as the amelioration of the local climate, reduction of noise, improvements in air quality, enhancement of the local biodiversity, and positive effects for the human well-being and mental health. © 2021 by the authors.

The current pandemic situation has given the world an alarm to act towards the reduction/eradication of carbon footprint. Developing countries like India are striving hard to strike a balance between sustainability and global growth. To support the nation, certain measures and their prioritization would be helpful. Motivated by this notion, in this study, a new framework is proposed with double hierarchy fuzzy information, which not only gives experts a better style to articulate preferences linguistically but also makes a rational decision with methodical support. Mayor's transport strategy, 2018 is a popular document that provides valuable information towards sustainable transport practices, and the measures considered in this study are adapted from the same. In this framework, (i) a novel attitudinal evidence-based Bayesian approach is proposed for criteria weight estimation; (ii) experts’ weights are determined by using variance approach, and (iii) Evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) approach is extended for prioritizing zero-carbon measures.

Here, we present a case study of peat meadows that were drained from the mid 1980s to 1990s and were restored by interrupting drainage pipes through clay sealed trenches. This trial was subject of extensive survey of plant, soil fauna and soil chemistry, which was done just before restoration and then repeated 20 years later. The water table was the closest to surface in undrained meadows and much deeper in drained and restored meadows during both times. In the restored meadow, some increase of the water table was observed, but the water table was mostly within 60 cm of the surface. Undrained meadow was much richer in soil organic carbon. Plant communities in both drained and restored plots become closer to those in undrained remnants 20 years after restoration. Community weighted mean for Ellenberger values showed that undrained peat meadow remnants were more oligotrophic than drained and restored sites. Soil fauna communities of undrained remnants and both drained treatments were clearly separated in 1990s and lumped together 20 years later. This was caused by a shift in the communities in both drained treatments but also by degradation of undrained remnants, which shifted towards drained sites. The results show that restoration slightly shifted the communities towards the undrained reference sites, but the shift was not much bigger that those in drained sites and in both cases, do not result in peat formation. Control sites also show some degradation most likely due to eutrophication. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Fungal bacterial ratio; Peatlands; Soil pH changes","Biodiversity; Eutrophication; Groundwater; Organic carbon; Peat; Restoration; Wetlands; Agriculture intensifications; Biodiversity loss; Case-studies; Drainage pipes; Fungal:bacterial ratios; Peatland; Soil fauna; Soil ph change; Undrained; Water tables; Soils; agricultural intensification; biodiversity; drainage; environmental restoration; meadow; oligotrophic environment; peat; soil carbon; soil chemistry; soil degradation; soil fauna; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110109975

We tested this limit on decay using forest soils from coastal British Columbia with contrasting Mn concentrations. Moderately weathered soils (Brunisols) had an average 3.6-fold increase in MnP activity within the upper soil profile in comparison to highly weathered Podzols. Ordination of the Agaricomycete fungal community, which are responsible for MnP production, confirmed significant differences in assemblages between soil types for saprotrophic fungi, particularly species within Agaricales, Trechisporales and Auriculariales. Ectomycorrhizal fungi of Pseudotsuga menziesii were equally aligned with soil type and select taxa more abundant on Brunisols may have supplemented MnP activity. A laboratory incubation with an Mn amendment produced significant interactions in MnP activity by soil type. Surprisingly, MnP activity of both Brunisol substrates declined substantially with an amendment (− 56 and − 40% for forest floor and mineral soil, respectively), in contrast to Podzols (− 30 and + 26%, respectively). This inhibitory response was linked to considerable uptake of the added Mn in Brunisols, presumably by saprotrophic fungi, and underscores how Mn likely operates directly on fungi as a regulator of gene transcription for MnP production. Our study highlights a new perspective concerning the abiotic drivers underpinning the expansive soil C stocks across perhumid temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest. © 2021, Crown.","Agaricomycete fungi; Decomposition; Forest soils; Mn-peroxidase; Podzolization","carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); decomposition analysis; ectomycorrhiza; enzyme activity; fungus; oxidation; oxidative stress; Podzol; saprotrophy; soil type; British Columbia; Canada; Pacific Northwest; Agaricales; Auriculariales; Columbia; Matthiola; Pseudotsuga menziesii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112824201

If fuel production is accounted for when developing shipping inventories, total CO2 emissions reported could increase by 11%. In addition to fuel production, effects of weather and heavy traffic regions were found to significantly impact emissions at global and regional levels. The global annual efficiency for different fuels and ship segments in approximated operational conditions were also investigated, indicating the need for more holistic metrics than current ones when seeking appropriate solutions aiming at reducing emissions. ©","Decarbonization; Emissions; Life-cycle assessment; Shipping","Carbon dioxide; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Ships; Wakes; Bottom up; CO2 emissions; Decarbonisation; Emission; Emission inventories; Fuel production; Global shipping; Greenhouses gas; Shipping emissions; Transformation pathways; Life cycle; carbon dioxide; fuel; carbon emission; detection method; emission; global perspective; model; aerosol; Article; carbon footprint; combustion; comparative study; consensus; energy consumption; geographic mapping; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; latitude; life cycle assessment; liquefaction; longitude; meteorology; radiative forcing; ship; shipping; traffic; velocity; weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118796028

The decrease in precipitation and average annual air temperature increase and intensive hydroelectric construction have led to a decline in the total water content of the river, during the last 10 years, being below the long‐term historical “norm”. The shifts in the river flow result in multidirectional seasonal dynamics of nutrient concentrations. During the modern period, a stabilization of nutrient concentrations takes place, being lower than at the peak of eutrophication in the 1970s–1980s, but higher than in the natural flow period. The construction of reservoirs leads to a long‐term decline in silica concentrations, continuing in the modern period. The concentration of heavy metals and metalloids in water and bottom sediments of the river generally corresponds to the ecological status of “Moderate”. Biological communities show a high β‐diversity of microalgae, but low diversity of plankton and benthic invertebrates. Biological communities respond to the impact of HPP in both the short‐ and long‐term. Hydroelectric dams change the bioavailability of nutrients downstream which, in the long‐term, causes shifts in phytoplankton composition, especially the reduction of Bacillariophyta due to the lack of silicates that are deposited in reservoirs. However, in the shortterm, after the discharge from the HPP dam, the concentration of silicates and the proportion of diatoms increase. Long‐term changes also include a decline in the proportion of Rotifera and an increase in Copepoda in the total abundance of zooplankton and the unification of the benthic community with an increase in the biomass of gastropods in the area, which can be considered as indicators of the impact of hydroelectric power plants. The saprobity index, calculated both for zooplankton and macrozoobenthos, characterised the water as moderately polluted; benthic biotic indexes (Biological monitoring working party (BMWP), Belgian Biotic Index (BBI), Danish Stream Fauna Index (DSFI)) calculated on macrozoobenthos described the condition as “low” quality. © 2021 by the authors.

Investigating how to design, set up and implement a PCT scheme for a community or country raises several difficulties. For instance, it is unclear how to introduce a reduction rate of CO2 allowances to ensure a steady decrease in CO2 emissions from households. Computational approaches have been introduced to address these challenges of PCT by providing an opportunity to test counterfactual scenarios. Among the benefits of an agent-based modeling approach (ABM) is the potential to directly address dynamic developments and introduce counterfactual situations. In this paper, we review existing modeling approaches and present an ABM for PCT. With simulations of an artificial population of 1000 and 30,000 agents, we address questions on the price and reduction rate of allowances. A key contribution of our model is the inclusion of an adaptive reduction rate, which reduces the yearly allocated amount of allowances depending on a set CO2 abatement target. The results confirm that increased emissions targets are related to higher allowance prices and a higher proportion of buying households. Our analysis also suggests a significant path dependence in the dynamics of allowance prices and availability, but that adaptive reduction rates have little impact on outcomes other than the price. We discuss data availability and computational challenges to modeling a PCT scheme with an ABM. Ideal data to populate an ABM on PCT are not available due to the lack of real-world implementations of a PCT. Nonetheless, meaningful insights about the dynamics and the focal variables in a PCT scheme can be generated by the exploratory use of an ABM. © 2021 by the authors.

The UK government aims to build large numbers of new schools to meet this demand. However, legally binding carbon emissions mitigation commitments might limit the ability of the government to adequately meet this demand on-time, on-budget, and within sustainability targets. This paper assesses the opportunity for prefabricated engineered timber construction methods to help meet the demand for new primary and secondary school buildings in the UK within these constraints. Building on a study of past government-led school building programmes and the state-of-the-art developments in engineered timber construction, this paper outlines the benefits that an engineered timber school building programme could have on a sustainability and procurement level. A strategy is then proposed for the wider adoption of engineered timber for the construction of school buildings in the UK, including detailed guidelines for designers and policymakers. The study concludes with recommendations for the adaptation of this strategy in different countries, depending on context-specific requirements, therefore promoting a generalised adoption of sustainable and efficient construction processes. © 2021 by the authors.

While the U.S. has agreed to participate in the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO’s) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), it has only recently adopted federal rules that define greenhouse gas emission reduction standards for certain classes of airplanes (effective January 2021). However, such standards focus on engine efficiency rather than the fuel burned. For sustainable aviation fuels, the U.S. continues to rely on voluntary programs at a federal, state, and regional level. The federal Renewable Fuel Standard program allows producers to opt in. In addition, states have started to allow sustainable aviation fuel producers to “opt in” to their programs; this includes California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Oregon’s Clean Fuels Program, and Washington’s newly adopted Clean Fuels Program. Other states are also starting to consider such programs. Elsewhere, states like Hawaii are starting to support SAF production in other ways, including through tax mechanisms. In addition, regional and private efforts to adopt and/or promote sustainable aviation fuels are underway. This piecemeal approach—due in part to the lack of cohesive U.S. federal policy—stands in contrast to the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive and Emissions Trading System, and adoption of policies by European countries. Because of aviation’s international nature, tracking what is happening in Europe matters greatly for U.S. carriers. As the U.S. works to meet its international obligations through CORSIA, finding a way forward with sustainable aviation fuel in the United States may depend on a more defined federal policy. Actions taken by both the EU and European countries offers some guidance for actions that could be taken by the U.S. Even in the absence of more defined measures, better tracking of voluntary measures is a critical step.

The macrofauna of pine and spruce forests is characterized by a high similarity and low diversity at the level of large taxa. This is typical feature of coniferous forests in the middle taiga subzone. The species richness of invertebrate communities is estimated for the period from 2003–2019. It is comparable for the impact and buffer areas and is almost twice lower than that of the background area. The total number of macrofauna and taxonomic groups varies by periods and areas of load. A change of dominant species was observed in the pine forests of the impact area in 2007 and 2010. Lithobius curtipes C.L. Koch, 1847 and Pella humeralis (Gravenhorst, 1802) predominated in the buffer and background areas, Philonthus rotundicollis (Menetries, 1832) and Philonthus politus (Linnaeus, 1758) predominated in the impact area. No changes of dominants were detected in pine forests in 2018 and in spruce forests in 2006, 2010, and 2019. Dendrobaena octaedra (Savigny, 1826) and L. curtipes were dominants in the impact, buffer, and background areas. The dominance of zoophages was typical for all of the studied plots. The number of some taxa (Lumbricidae, Diplopoda, Elateridae) indicates an increase in the relative abundance of saprophages in soils of coniferous forests in the impact area.

In this study, the LULC change dynamics of Kano metropolis, Nigeria, were analysed over the last three decades, i.e., 1990–2020, using multispectral satellite data to understand the impact of urbanization on LST in the study area. The Maximum Likelihood classification method and the Mono-window algorithm were utilised in classifying land uses and retrieving LST data. Spectral indices comprising the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) were also computed. A linear regression analysis was employed in order to examine the correlation between land surface temperature and the various spectral indices. The results indicate significant LULC changes and urban expansion of 152.55 sq. km from 1991 to 2020. During the study period, the city’s barren land and water bodies declined by approximately 172.58 sq. km and 26.55 sq. km, respectively, while vegetation increased slightly by 46.58 sq. km. Further analysis showed a negative correlation between NDVI and LST with a Pearson determination coefficient (R2 ) of 0.6145, 0.5644, 0.5402, and 0.5184 in 1991, 2000, 2010, and 2020 respectively. NDBI correlated positively with LST, having an R2 of 0.4132 in 1991, 0.3965 in 2000, 0.3907 in 2010, and 0.3300 in 2020. The findings of this study provide critical climatic data useful to policy-and decision-makers in optimizing land use and mitigating the impact of urban heat through sustainable urban development. © 2021 by the authors.

In this article—an experiment in itself—we aim to gain a deeper understanding of how RWLs contribute to urban transformation in very different contexts. We apply Jennifer Robinson’s theoretical framework “thinking through elsewhere” on two ongoing urban RWLs: the Itaim Paulista Lab, located in the urban periphery of São Paulo, Brazil and the Lokstedt Urban Transformation Lab in Hamburg, Germany. We operationalize Robinson’s framework in two steps. First, we present the genetics—context, roots, concepts and activities—of both labs. Second, we engage the RWLs in a generative conversation on their role in transforming governance and practical action, with a special focus on the questions of if and how the labs contribute to long-term transformative change. We also find that both labs show potential to contribute to long-term transformative change through governance and practical action. © 2021 by the authors.

The atmosphere is adjusted to fixed surface temperatures between 280 and 330 K while preserving other boundary conditions in particular the relative humidity and the CO2 concentration. We show that an out-of-bounds usage of the radiation scheme rapid radiative transfer model for GCMs (RRTMG) can lead to an erroneous decrease of the feedback parameter and an associated “bump” in climate sensitivity as found in other modeling studies. Using a line-by-line radiative transfer model, we find no evidence for a strengthening of the longwave radiative feedback for surface temperatures between 305 and 320 K. However, the line-by-line simulations also show a slight decrease in climate sensitivity when surface temperatures exceed 310 K. This decrease is caused by water-vapor masking the radiative forcing at the flanks of the CO2 absorption band, which reduces the total radiative forcing by about 18%. © 2021.

Environmental planning often has to evaluate whole landscapes in a spatially explicit way, including marginal landscape elements for which data on provisional, regulatory, and cultural ecosystem properties and services are not readily available or are costly to provide. On the other hand, many planning schemes include a habitat- or vegetation survey, raising the question whether ecosystem services can be predicted from vegetation properties alone. I used a large data set of herbaceous plant communities collected across Germany, The Netherlands, and Denmark, as well as additional data, to predict (i) the probability of obtaining a high marginal income from forage production, (ii) the probability of a high conservation value based on the occurrence of regionally rare plants, and (iii) carbon stocks in mineral soils (SOC). The predictions are based on 22 plant traits of 123 common species of reeds and of dry, mesic, wet, and ruderal grasslands. The individual traits were aggregated to trait modules representing major biological functions that affect the provision of services. High marginal income from forage production was predicted for plant communities functionally composed of intermediate levels of above-ground size and allocation, and an acquisitive leaf economy on the one hand, but little lateral expansion, generative reproduction and root mass on the other. The probability of finding regionally rare plants increased in communities with small-to-intermediate above-ground size, a conservative leaf economy, low C:N ratios, few and large seeds, and little lateral expansion. Communities displaying pronounced lateral expansion and above-ground size were linked to high soil organic-carbon stocks. The models predict trade-offs between these ES that are relevant to environmental planning. Where income from forage production is high, regionally rare plants will not be found, and SOC will be low. Where SOC is high, income from forage production will be low and rare plants infrequent. Where many rare plants are found, neither income from forage production nor SOC will be high. Using the predictive functions and the trait data provided in the Appendix S3, users can evaluate the supply of the three services for many perennial herbaceous communities in northwestern Europe. © 2021 The Author(s)","Carbon sequestration; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental planning; Income from forage production; Land management; Nature conservation; Regional plant rarity; Soil organic carbon stocks","carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; environmental planning; herb; landscape planning; organic carbon; probability; soil carbon; terrestrial vegetation type; trade-off; vegetation type; Denmark; Germany; Netherlands; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113142808

The investigated melts range from foidite to tephri-phonolite to tephrite from the CAVD to a phonolite from the Vesuvius (Italy) with CO2 concentrations up to 0.50 wt%. Viscosity and calorimetric measurements are performed in the glass transition range Tg between 600 and 780 °C. Although nominally anhydrous, the investigated melts contain H2O concentrations up to 0.23 wt%. The data exhibit a decrease in viscosity of approx. 100.40 Pa s for the phonolitic composition with ~ 0.07 wt% CO2 and a Tg reduced by approx. 14 °C. For the tephritic composition, Tg is approx. 5 °C lower and has a viscosity reduced by 100.25 Pa s for the sample containing ~ 0.5 wt% CO2. Calorimetric measurements of the tephri-phonolite show lowered onset of Tg by approx. 6 °C for the melt with ~ 0.11 wt% CO2 and Tg of the foidite appears not to be influenced by a CO2 concentration of ~ 0.37 wt% CO2. However, these tephri-phonolitic and foiditic melts foamed during calorimetric measurements preventing a reliable measurement. It would appear that most of this overall drop in viscosity is caused by the small amounts of H2O in the melts with CO2 slightly reducing the viscosity or having no effect on viscosity. Additionally, it is shown that the reduction in viscosity decreases with an increasing degree of the depolymerisation for the investigated melts. Consequently, the explosive style of the CAVD eruptions is mainly caused by crystals and bubbles which form and rise during magma storage and ascent which increases the magma viscosity whereas the CO2 in the melt slightly reduces the viscosity. © 2021, The Author(s).","Calorimetry; Carbon dioxide; Colli Albani; Foidite; Glass transition; Viscosity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117346494

This study compares three potential variants for an R/V Sproul replacement vessel (SRV): a Baseline SRV consisting of a traditional diesel-electric powertrain, a Battery Hybrid SRV (battery/diesel-electric) and a Hydrogen Hybrid SRV (hydrogen fuel cell/diesel-electric). All three variants meet the science mission requirements of the SRV but with varying levels of zero-emission runtime, energy efficiency and emissions. The Battery Hybrid SRV can provide 2.5 h of zero emissions (battery only) operation, but could not complete any of the identified SRV science missions without also engaging the diesel generators. In contrast, the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV can provide 23.4 h of zero emission (hydrogen only) runtime, and can complete 74% of the SRV science missions solely with zero-emission operation. The superior performance of the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV is attributable to the higher volumetric energy storage density of the LH2/fuel cell combination. The capital costs of these vessels are estimated to be: ∼ $21.4 M for the diesel-electric Baseline SRV, ∼ $26.0 M for the Battery Hybrid SRV vessel and ∼ $34.4 M for the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV. The “well-to-waves” (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria pollutant emissions were estimated using various sourcings for the diesel fuel, electricity and hydrogen fuel. The lowest emission levels are achieved with the Hydrogen Hybrid variant using 100% renewable hydrogen. The annual WTW GHG emissions from the Hydrogen Hybrid using renewable LH2 in combination with fossil diesel in the hybrid arrangement yields a 26.7% GHG emissions reduction from the Baseline vessel using fossil-derived diesel fuel. The Battery Hybrid vessel with 100% renewable electricity combined with diesel fuel provides a 6.9% reduction in GHG emissions. Similar results are seen for the criteria pollutant emissions. The hybrid vessels are also compared with regard to operational safety. The study reveals that hydrogen fuel-cell technology provides an effective hybrid supplement to diesel power for a coastal/local research vessel. © 2021","Fuel cells; Hybrid power; Liquid hydrogen; Maritime; Research vessel; zero-emission","Diesel engines; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Gas fuel purification; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Liquefied gases; Greenhouse gas emissions; Hybrid power; Hydrogen fuel cells; Liquid hydrogens; Maritime; Pollutants emissions; Research vessels; Runtimes; Science missions; Zero emission; Ships",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116758859

Design/methodology/approach: Three science major student cohorts at Loyola Marymount University – first-year exposure (first-years taking a course related to climate science), first-year control (first-years taking a course unrelated to climate science) and non-first-year exposure (non-first-years interested in climate science taking a related course) – were given a climate literacy survey at the beginning and end of each course. Student perceptions were also compared with national and local data. Findings: First-year students exposed to the topic showed increased awareness of climate change, trust in climate scientists and acknowledgment of the scientific consensus. Exposure also increased the non-first-year cohort’s awareness that global warming is already affecting the country. All three cohorts showed greater awareness of humanity’s role in causing climate change than the public. However, misconceptions regarding technical concepts persisted throughout. Research limitations/implications: This was a single-institution study in Los Angeles with a limited sample. Exposure to specific topics varied between cohorts, depending on the learning outcomes of each course. Originality/value: Undergraduate science majors have a greater understanding of climate change’s anthropogenic nature compared with local and national populations. First-year students have a lower initial understanding of climate change and less trust in climate scientists than non-first-year students interested in the topic. All science majors can improve their understanding of general concepts and strengthen their confidence in scientists by taking a relevant course.

Traditionally associated with kava-drinking ceremonies, talanoa includes practices that temporarily mitigate differences in hierarchy and rank, which help to facilitate the formation of consensus, a process sometimes referred to as ‘The Pacific Way’. This capacity has also motivated its application to a wide range of social interactions and speech events, scaling up from local contexts and national debates to international arenas. This includes talanoa's contribution to the facilitation of the Paris Climate Agreement by promoting cooperation and the exchange of ideas. The Talanoa Dialogue differs from other speech genres at the UN, including the process of reconciliation through which resolutions and declarations are formulated.

How costly might it be to attain that goal, especially when adverse climate change projections apply to agriculture in southern Australia? This study uses scenario analysis to examine agricultural emissions and their abatement via reforestation in south-western Australia under projected climate change. Most scenarios include the likelihood of agricultural emissions being reduced in the coming decades. However, the impact of projected adverse climate change on tree growth and tree survival means that the cost of achieving agricultural carbon neutrality via reforestation is forecast to increase in south-western Australia. Agricultural R&D and innovation that enable agricultural emissions to diminish in the coming decades will be crucial to lessen the cost of achieving carbon neutrality. On balance, the more likely scenarios reveal the real cost of achieving carbon neutrality will not greatly increase. The cost of achieving carbon neutrality under the various scenarios is raised by an additional AUD22 million to AUD100 million per annum in constant 2020 dollar terms. This magnitude of cost increase is very small relative to the region’s gross value of agricultural production that is regularly greater than AUD10 billion. © 2021 by the authors.

Polish municipalities mainly take their heat from local district heating networks with large-scale coal-fired heat sources. Today, transition to nonemissive sources on this scale would be impractical. The easiest way to reduce carbon emissions is to limit heat consumption, but at the same time, to preserve thermal comfort, the application of smart technologies is necessary. Veolia operates on 71 district heating systems in Poland, including Warsaw, Lodz, and Poznan. Since heat consumption in Warsaw and Metropolis GZM is at a similar level, this is a case study of Hubgrade automation system application within the Warsaw district heating network. This paper also presents results of simulation of harmful emission reduction potential in Metropolis GZM. Simulation results show that there is a potential for saving approximately 275 kt of CO2 for the whole Metropolis GZM. © 2021 by the authors.

As a case study, the Sejong national pilot smart city in South Korea was selected to evaluate the renewable energy penetration rate. For evaluating the proposed renewable energy systems, the electrical and thermal loads of the smart city were estimated using field measurement data. Then, the renewable energy penetration rate of the city was evaluated. The HomerPro software was used to analyze the PV generation and operating energy consumption of the natural gas (NG) generator with a district heating network. The thermal load-supporting potential of the solar thermal system was estimated using the TRNSYS software. The results showed that the proposed urban integrated renewable energy system could meet over 30% of the renewable energy penetration rate and the levelized cost of energy and total net present cost was 7% lower than the base case system (i.e., NG generator).

First, we characterized emissions using the Clean Air Policy Support System (CAPSS) emission statistics, and compared them with both ground-and aircraft-based measurements obtained during the KORUS-AQ campaign. The emission statistics showed that the SMA had higher NOx levels, whereas BMA had significantly higher SO2 levels. Ground-level observations averaged for the summer season also showed SMA–nitrate and BMA–sulfate relationships, reflecting the CAPSS emission characteristics of both areas. However, organic carbon (OC) was higher in BMA than SMA by a factor of 1.7, despite comparable volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in the two areas. DC-8 aircraft-based measurements showed that, in most cases, nitrogen-rich localities were found in the SMA, reflecting the emission characteristics of precursors in the two sampling areas, whereas sulfur-rich localities in the BMA were not apparent from either ground-based or aircraft observations. KORUS-AQ measurements were classified according to two synoptic conditions, stagnant (STG) and long-range transport (LRT), and the nitrate-to-sulfate (N/S) ratio in both ground and upper layers was higher in the SMA for both cases. Meanwhile, organic aerosols reflected local emissions characteristics in only the STG case, indicating that this stagnant synoptic condition reflect local aerosol characteristics. The LRT case showed elevated peaks of all species at altitudes of 1.0–3.5 km, indicating the importance of LRT processes for predicting and diagnosing aerosol vertical distributions over Northeast Asia. Other chemical characteristics of aerosols in the two metropolitan areas were also compared. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

This paper presents a literature review of important research themes within the context of thermal comfort and energy use in mixed-mode buildings. The findings from our focused review suggest that occupant perception of, or attitudes toward indoor thermal environment can differ, depending on the mode of operation within a MM building. The comfort zone of occupants in MM buildings are consistently estimated to be wider than that of fully air-conditioned building counterparts. Although the scale of benefit greatly depends on climate characteristics, the MM strategy demonstrates significant energy saving potential especially when coupled with a ‘moving comfort target’ approach based on the adaptive comfort model. The focus of future research should be on how to optimise comfort, level of control (automated vs. manual), and the associated energy demands. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive opportunity; Climate change; Hybrid ventilation; Mixed-mode; Thermal comfort","Air conditioning; Buildings; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Ventilation; Adaptive opportunities; Energy demands; Energy solutions; Energy use; Hybrid ventilation; Literature reviews; Lower energies; Mixed mode; Mixed-mode ventilations; Thermal; Thermal comfort; airflow; climate change; flow modeling; indoor air; literature review; numerical model; ventilation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111648347

Two-day personal exposure of 16 couples from gers and 16 couples from apartments in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, was measured in January and February 2019. A portable monitor (ASLUNG, Rododo Science, Taipei, Taiwan) was used to measure real-time personal PM2.5 exposure, and information on participants’ time-activity patterns was recorded in a logbook. Ger residents were exposed to a significantly higher PM2.5 concentration (59.1(1.7) μg/m3) than apartment residents (26.8(2.0) μg/m3). However, the personal exposure of couples in gers and apartments was not affected by the time-activity pattern.

TPMDS consists of toluene, pyridine, methanol, surfactant dodecylbenzenesulfonic and sodium hydroxide. The optimum concentrations of TPMDS components were determined based on the efficiency evaluation of the chemical reagents to eliminate the asphaltene precipitation under static conditions. The highest effectiveness of the developed solvent package under static conditions was found to be 98%, which was observed at a soaking time of 6 h and a mass concentration of 1%. TPMDS had high performance (more than 97.5%) for asphaltene removal in four different oil samples containing various asphaltene concentrations. The results of the turbidity and dissolution rate experiments of asphaltene in the presence of TPMDS and toluene showed that the performance of TPMDS for asphaltene removal is significantly better than toluene. In addition, core flood tests were carried out with the use of TPMDS and toluene. Pressure drop due to asphaltene precipitation in the carbonate core samples was reduced eight times using the developed solvent package. The damaged permeability due to asphaltene deposition was 51% of the initial rock permeability before injection of any solvent. The results of core flood tests showed that the rock permeability has reached about 94% and 71% of the initial permeability after injection of TPMDS and toluene, respectively. Despite the increase in the amount of asphaltene precipitation in the core samples by increasing injection rate, the efficiency of the developed solvent was not decreased by changing the injection rate since the performance of the TPMDS was improved by the appearance of a synergistic effect for asphaltene dissolution. Furthermore, oil viscosity reduction with the use of TPMDS was more significant than with the use of toluene. The corrosion rate of the metal samples in the presence of the developed solvent package solution was less than 0.08 mm/year in a temperature range from 25 °C to 100 °C, which is less than an acceptable threshold corrosion rate of 0.1 mm/year. Moreover, the results of field analysis showed that the oil production rate could be enhanced by 3.3 times after treatment by TPMDS. Asphaltene removal effectiveness in the production wells using the industrial reagent and TPMDS has reached 84 and 96%, respectively.

We studied West Nile virus (WNV) in New York (NY) and Connecticut (CT) using a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model climate change scenario, which allows us to examine the effects of climate change and variability on WNV risk at county level. We chose WNV because it is well studied, has caused over 50,000 reported human cases, and over 2200 deaths in the United States. The ecological impacts have been substantial (e.g., millions of avian deaths), and economic impacts include livestock deaths, morbidity, and healthcare-related expenses. We trained two Random Forest models with observational climate data and human cases to predict future levels of WNV based on future weather conditions. The Regional Model used present-day data from NY and CT, whereas the Analog Model was fit for states most closely matching the predicted future conditions in the region. Separately, we predicted changes to mosquito-based WNV risk using a trait-based thermal biology approach (Mosquito Model). The WRF model produced control simulations (present day) and pseudo-global warming simulations (future). The Regional and Analog Models predicted an overall increase in human cases of WNV under future warming. However, the Analog Model did not predict as strong of an increase in the number of human cases as the Regional Model, and predicted a decrease in cases in some counties that currently experience high numbers of WNV cases. The Mosquito Model also predicted a decrease in risk in current high-risk areas, with an overall reduction in the population-weighted relative risk (but an increase in area-weighted risk). The Mosquito Model supports the Analog Model as making more realistic predictions than the Regional Model. All three models predicted a geographic increase in WNV cases across NY and CT. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","arbovirus; climate change; global warming; neuroinvasive; Weather Research Forecast; West Nile virus","global warming; health care; health risk; infectious disease; weather forecasting; West Nile virus; New York [United States]; United States; Arbovirus; West Nile virus; animal; climate change; Connecticut; human; mosquito; New York; United States; West Nile fever; West Nile virus; Animals; Climate Change; Connecticut; Culicidae; Humans; New York; United States; West Nile Fever; West Nile virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113626500

As a result, scientists are eager to find alternatives to fossil fuels, and biomass could be one of them. One method of turning biomass into biogas is anaerobic digestion (AD). One of the organic waste kinds used to generate biogas is abattoir waste. In developing countries, managing abattoir waste streams is a significant concern. Using these wastes to produce biogas and biofertilizers could help Ethiopia reduce its environmental hazard while also solving energy and fertilizer-related issues. Given that, the researchers in this study intend to investigate the biogas and biofertilizer production potential of abattoir waste in Shashemene Municipality Abattoir (SMA), Ethiopia. To this aim, the production potential of biogas, energy, biofertilizer, and Greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction was examined. The study showed about 688,755 kg (kg) per year of slaughterhouse waste is produced from 13,505 cattle, and anaerobic digestion may create approximately 206.63 x 103 m3/year of biogas. As a result, it can generate 1,018.98 Kilowatt-hour (kWh)/day and 371,927.7 kWh/year. On an annual basis, the biogas output (206.63 103 m3) can replace the 211.8 tons of energy consumed by LPG, kerosene, charcoal, furnace oil, petrol, and diesel. Moreover, the anaerobic digester has the potential to minimize the emission of greenhouse gas (GHG) by 952.4 tons CO2 eq per year. Furthermore, biogas has the potential to generate 43,184.9 kg of dry bio-fertilizer per year. Therefore, while biogas technology is the long-term solution for ensuring environmental safety and public health, proper disposal was one of the short-term options. © The Author(s).

The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in the United Kingdom have reported that the UK's highest recording temperatures have transpired in the years since 2002. With over 90% of England homes currently in use of high carbon systems for space heating and domestic hot water. Contributing to increased atmospheric carbon emissions in the dependency on fossil fuel burning; alluding to human-produced atmospheric temperature increase. To help tackle these issues in the residential sector, the capacity of zero-energy technologies has been introduced. Zero-energy implementation has potential to revolutionise the power system, with on-site power generation at the forefront of this. This paper will explore the influence of zero-energy implementation on two UK residential dwellings of disparate locations, using Integrated Environmental Solutions Virtual Environment (IESVE) by focusing on renewable on-site micro-generation systems. The ASHRAE climate zones of Edinburgh and London Gatwick has been selected to examine the performance of the building over varied regional climates of disparate locations. The selected design variables were finally implemented in combination for building simulation in IESVE and compared with a basic model dwelling. The processed simulation results showed a reduction in the buildings energy consumption of 43.4538MWh (71%) for Edinburgh and 33.9929MWh (64%) for London respective to the baseline model. The greatest savings in mitigation of UK climate change can be evaluated in relation to reduction of carbon emissions, which were 7880kgCO2 (46%) and 5423kgCO2 (36%) respectively. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","carbon emissions.; energy consumption; Energy efficiency; IESVE; zero-energy",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120543839

Taking into consideration environmental safety due to discarding of textile waste, it becomes critical to recuperate useful products from such waste for economic reasons. The present work deals with the preparation of porous and electrically conductive activated carbon fabric by a novel single stage method of simultaneous carbonization and physical activation of Kevlar feedstock material procured from local industries, for effective electromagnetic (EM) shielding applications. The Kevlar fabric waste was directly carbonized under a layer of charcoal without any intermediate stabilization step at 800◦ C, 1000◦ C, and 1200◦ C, with a heating rate of 300◦ C/h and without any holding time. The physical and morphological properties of the activated carbon, influenced by carbonization process parameters, were characterized from EDX, X-ray diffraction, SEM analysis, and BET analysis. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity was analyzed. Finally, the potential application of the activated material for EM shielding effectiveness was analyzed at low (below 1.5 GHz) and high (2.45 GHz) frequencies. The phenomena of multiple internal reflections and absorption of electromagnetic radiations was found dominant in the case of activated carbon fabric produced at higher carbonization temperatures. © 2021 by the authors.

The purpose of the study was to determine the recreational capacity of natural green areas, followed by an ecological and economic assessment. In the work, recreational and sanitary-hygienic assessments were carried out, the stages of digression, the classes of stability of plantings were determined, followed by an ecological and economic assessment of suburban green areas. The weighted average value of the ecological recreational capacity is determined. In plantations with a predominance of oak or pine in the existing types of forest growing conditions, the specific value of the ecological recreational capacity is the same, therefore, approaches to the development of these forests may be the same. To assess the ecological potential of plantings, the content of carbon, absorbed carbon dioxide, and oxygen released by them were calculated. The results of the calculations show that the maximum amount of C2 is observed in mixed stands with a predominance of oak, the minimum-in pure pine stands.

While reducing fossil fuel needs, growing short rotation coppices (SRCs), such as poplar or willow, may have a high impact on local air quality as these species are known to produce high amounts of isoprene, which can lead to the production of tropospheric ozone (O3). Here, we present a long-term leaf-scale study of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions from a Swedish managed willow site with the aim of providing information on the seasonal variability in BVOC emissions during two growing seasons, 2015–2016. Total BVOC emissions during these two seasons were dominated by isoprene (&gt;96% by mass) and the monoterpene (MT) ocimene. The average standardized (STD, temperature of 30◦C and photosynthetically active radiation of 1000 µmol m−2 s−1) emission rate for isoprene was 45.2 (±42.9, standard deviation (SD)) µg gdw−1 h−1. Isoprene varied through the season, mainly depending on the prevailing temperature and light, where the measured emissions peaked in July 2015 and August 2016. The average STD emission for MTs was 0.301 (±0.201) µg gdw−1 h−1 and the MT emissions decreased from spring to autumn. The average STD emission for sesquiterpenes (SQTs) was 0.103 (±0.249) µg gdw−1 h−1, where caryophyllene was the most abundant SQT. The measured emissions of SQTs peaked in August both in 2015 and 2016. Non-terpenoid compounds were grouped as other VOCs (0.751 ± 0.159 µg gdw−1 h−1), containing alkanes, aldehydes, ketones, and other compounds. Emissions from all the BVOC groups decreased towards the end of the growing season. The more sun-adapted leaves in the upper part of the plantation canopy emitted higher rates of isoprene, MTs, and SQTs compared with more shade-adapted leaves in the lower canopy. On the other hand, emissions of other VOCs were lower from the upper part of the canopy compared with the lower part. Light response curves showed that ocimene and α-farnesene increased with light but only for the sun-adapted leaves, since the shade-adapted leaves did not emit ocimene and α-farnesene. An infestation with Melampsora spp. likely induced high emissions of, e.g., hexanal and nonanal in August 2015. The results from this study imply that upscaling BVOC emissions with model approaches should account for seasonality and also include the canopy position of leaves as a parameter to allow for better estimates for the regional and global budgets of ecosystem emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

For each of these types, three intense and pervasive dust events are analyzed from a synoptic meteorological and numerical simulation perspective. The performance of 9 operational dust models in forecasting these dust events in the Middle East is qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated against Terra-MODIS observations and AERONET measurements during the dust events. The comparison of model AOD outputs with Terra-MODIS retrievals reveals that despite the significant discrepancies, all models have a relatively acceptable performance in forecasting the AOD patterns in the Middle East. The models enable to represent the high AODs along the dust plumes, although they underestimate them, especially for cyclonic dust storms. In general, the outputs of the NASA-GEOS and DREAM8-MACC models present greater similarity with the satellite and AERONET observations in most of the cases, also exhibiting the highest correlation coefficient, although it is difficult to introduce a single model as the best for all cases. Model AOD predictions over the AERONET stations showed that DREAM8-MACC exhibited the highest R2 of 0.78, followed by NASA_GEOS model (R2 = 0.74), which both initially use MODIS data assimilation. Although the outputs of all models correspond to valid time more than 24 h after the initial time, the effect of data assimilation on increasing the accuracy is important. The different dust emission schemes, soil and vegetation mapping, initial and boundary meteorological conditions and spatial resolution between the models, are the main factors influencing the differences in forecasting the dust AODs in the Middle East. © 2021 by the authors.

This study uses radiative forcing (RF), a time-sensitive life cycle assessment metric, to evaluate space heating alternatives. We compare forest residue and willow biomass resources and natural gas as fuel sources against decentralized heating using heating oil. The comparison is performed for selected locations in the Northeastern United States over a 30-year production timeline and 100 observation years. The natural gas and willow scenarios are compared with scenarios where available forest residue is unused and adds a penalty of GHG emissions due to microbial decay. When forest residues are available, their use is recommended before considering willow production. Investment in bioenergy-based DH with carbon capture and storage and natural-gas-based DH with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is considered to assess their influence on RF. Its implementation further improves the net carbon mitigation potential of DH despite the carbon and energy cost of CCS infrastructure. Soil carbon sequestration from willow production reduces RF overall, specifically when grown on land converted from cropland to pasture, hay, and grassland.

In this study, using first-principles modeling, NO2 and SO2 adsorption on MgO/(Mg0.5Ni0.5)O/MgO(1 0 0) was theoretically predicted. Adsorption of NO2 was stronger than that of SO2 on the MgO/(Mg0.5Ni0.5)O/MgO(1 0 0) surface. Both structural and chemical changes were applied to MgO/(Mg0.5Ni0.5)O/MgO(1 0 0) in order to investigate strategies for improving the strength of adsorption of these gases on the MgO/(Mg0.5Ni0.5)O/MgO(1 0 0) system. NO2 and SO2 adsorption on MgO/(Mg0.5Ni0.5)O/MgO(1 0 0) was found to be tunable using the applied strain and certain promoters, such as Ca and Sr. The approach with the promoter more effectively enhanced the strength of NO2 and SO2 adsorption on MgO/(Mg0.5Ni0.5)O/MgO(1 0 0) than the approach with the applied strain. The interactions between the adsorbate (i.e., NO2 and SO2) and the MgO/(Mg0.5Ni0.5)O/MgO(1 0 0) surface were further elucidated through an investigation of the density of states and Bader charge. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; Density functional theory; NO2; Promoter; SO2; Strain","Adsorption; Magnesia; Nickel compounds; Nitrogen oxides; Strain; Applied strain; Density-functional-theory; First principles; First-principles modeling; MgO; MgO(1 0 0); NO $-2$; Performance; Promoter; SO$-2$; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111056415

This paper investigates the role of beliefs and influence in shaping collaboration under conditions of high and low conflict by estimating Exponential Random Graph Models using network survey data on the climate policy domains in four countries. Results show that both beliefs and influence are associated with the formation of collaboration ties in the high conflict contexts of South Korea and the United States, whereas neither are significant in the low conflict contexts of Sweden and Switzerland. By considering the level of conflict, our findings provide a more nuanced understanding of when beliefs and influence shape collaboration patterns. © 2021 Policy Studies Organization","climate change policy; collaboration; conflict; Exponential Random Graph Model; policy networks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100174131

Previous literature has reputable evidence that improving fiscal policy enhances environmental quality. However, the literature fails to classify the exact turning level (threshold point) below/above which the association may be negative or positive. In this regard, this research investigates the nexus between fiscal policy, foreign direct investment, financial development, trade openness, urban population, gross capital formation, labour force, and CO2 emissions in the era of globalization. The panel data set contained 105 countries over the period from 1990 to 2016. The empirical findings are estimated through linear and nonlinear panel data approaches such as fully modified ordinary least square and panel threshold regression. The subsequent findings are established: first, fiscal policy and globalization significantly increase environmental pollution. Second, the empirical results confirm the existence of the pollution haven hypothesis (PHV). Third, financial development and gross fixed capital formation are also considered some of the most crucial indicators to increase pollution levels. Fourth, trade openness, urban population, and labour force improve environmental quality. Fifth, panel threshold regression discovers that countries maintain a minimum level of fiscal policy at −1.2889. Based on these empirical findings, this study suggests that policymakers and governments of these countries should take steps to restructure their industrial sector and design macroeconomic-level carbon-free policies to support the implementation of low-energy-intensive and lower carbon production technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

Future trends in agricultural land use, livestock husbandry and associated environmental pressures are determined by developments in the food sector, agricultural productivity, technology, and many other influencing factors. Scenario analysis helps to understand their complex interaction and obtain quantitative insight. We here present an in-depth description of the agricultural land use model BioBaM-GHG 2.0 (“BioBaM”), designed for evaluating large numbers of agricultural and livestock production scenarios assembled on the basis of exogenous assumptions on food systems, crop yields and other factors. BioBaM determines the feasibility of specific parameter combinations and the corresponding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural activities, livestock husbandry, land-use change and other activities. We provide a description of the software environment, the model's data structures, input and output variables and model algorithms. To illustrate the model's capabilities and the scope of model applications, we describe two exemplary studies performed with BioBaM: We assess implications of agro-ecological innovations and the feasibility of their widespread application in order to illustrate their implications in terms of agricultural self-sufficiency and GHG emissions. This first case study aligns a small number of individual scenarios with qualitative storylines. We also showcase a ”biophysical option space approach”, which represents a comprehensive sensitivity analysis regarding the multidimensional uncertainties inherent to main influencing parameters, i.e. projections for diets and yields; assumptions on cropland use for bioenergy, and regarding grassland intensification. The global potential of forest regeneration for climate change mitigation serves as an example for this second approach. The option space comprises 90 scenarios and encompasses the full range of literature estimates on GHG mitigation from afforestation in 2050 (0.5 – 7 Gt CO2/yr). It further shows that the potential is zero under certain diet-yield-combinations. Assuming zero energy crop cultivation and global convergence to a healthy reference diet, the sequestration potential of afforestation rises to 10 Gt CO2/yr in 2050. These exemplary applications illustrate how option spaces developed with BioBaM can complement scenario-based assessments that usually focus on small numbers of individual scenarios: Option spaces shift attention to a wider scope of conceivable futures and thus support a comprehensive view on systemic relations and dependencies, whereas analyses with few scenarios allow apprehension of much more detailed scenario narratives and qualifications. © 2021 The Author(s)","Afforestation; Agriculture; Climate change; Food system; Integrated assessment model; Land use modelling","Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Ecology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Productivity; Reforestation; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Agricultural land use; Bio-energy; Food system; Global scale; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouses gas; Integrated assessment modelling; Land Systems; Land use modelling; Option spaces; Climate change; agricultural land; agroecology; crop yield; cultivation; environmental factor; exploration; greenhouse gas; land use; model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114327535

This is in part due to intracellular formation of calcium carbonate scales termed coccoliths. Traditionally, the influence of changing environmental conditions on this process has been estimated using poorly constrained analogies to crystallization mechanisms in bulk solution, yielding ambiguous predictions. Here, we elucidated the intracellular nanoscale environment of coccolith formation in the model species Pleurochrysis carterae using cryoelectron tomography. By visualizing cells at various stages of the crystallization process, we reconstructed a timeline of coccolith development. The three-dimensional data portray the native-state structural details of coccolith formation, uncovering the crystallization mechanism, and how it is spatially and temporally controlled. Most strikingly, the developing crystals are only tens of nanometers away from delimiting membranes, resulting in a highly confined volume for crystal growth. We calculate that the number of soluble ions that can be found in such a minute volume at any given time point is less than the number needed to allow the growth of a single atomic layer of the crystal and that the uptake of single protons can markedly affect nominal pH values. In such extreme confinement, the crystallization process is expected to depend primarily on the regulation of ion fluxes by the living cell, and nominal ion concentrations, such as pH, become the result, rather than a driver, of the crystallization process. These findings call for a new perspective on coccolith formation that does not rely exclusively on solution chemistry.","biomineralization; coccolith; cryoelectron tomography; crystallization; ocean acidification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121033017

This issue is particularly pertinent for cities due to the concentration of assets and population at risk, and rapid socio-economic and land use changes. We develop a mixed methods approach, which integrates quantitative, qualitative and participatory methods to (1) identify internal and external drivers of socio-economic development and land use change, (2) explore a range of future pathways using local socio-economic scenarios, and (3) visualize changes in vulnerability indicators with the help of a participatory mapping exercise. We test the approach in the City of Helsinki with the timeframe up to 2050. Our results show the connections between the drivers and changes in vulnerability indicators, while maps developed in a stakeholder workshop visualize the potential spatial changes in indicators.

PM2.5 personal environmental monitoring samplers were used to collect both indoor and outdoor PM2.5 in urban and rural areas in Taiwan. Al, Cd, Cr, Mn, Pb, V, and Zn were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Source apportionment of metals in PM2.5 was carried out with factor analysis (FA). Health risk assessment of metals was performed on children via inhalation. The average indoor PM2.5 concentrations were 11.9 ± 5.2 μg/m3 and 11.9 ± 4.7 μg/m3 in urban and rural areas, respectively. The most predominant metal indoors in urban areas was Al, followed by Zn, Pb, Mn, V, Cr, and Cd, with a similar result in rural areas. The results from FA indicated that traffic emission and oil combustion in the outside environment were major pollution sources to indoor Mn, V, and Zn; corrosion of building material could be a contributor to Al, Cd, and Pb; pollution sources were different to Cr in two areas. The carcinogenic risk for indoor Cr(VI) via inhalation was higher in urban areas (boy: 6.61E-06; girl: 6.18E-06) than that in rural areas (boy: 2.80E-06; girl: 2.62E-06). These findings will help us to further understand the pollution sources, health risks, and control strategies for metals in PM2.5 in children's bedrooms for reducing adverse health effects, including in rural areas. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Children; Indoor air quality; Metal; Rural; Urban","Air quality; Chromium compounds; Health; Health risks; Indoor air pollution; Mass spectrometry; Risk assessment; Rural areas; Child; Factors analysis; Health risk assessments; Indoor air quality; Metal concentrations; PM$-2.5$; Pollution sources; Urban; Urban and rural areas; Urban areas; Metals; aluminum; cadmium; chromium; lead; manganese; metal; oil; vanadium; zinc; combustion; concentration (composition); construction material; corrosion; factor analysis; indoor air; monitoring system; risk assessment; rural area; urban area; air pollution; ambient air; Article; carcinogenicity; child; child health; combustion; concentration (parameter); control strategy; controlled study; corrosion; factor analysis; female; health hazard; human; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; male; particulate matter 2.5; PM2.5 exposure; risk assessment; rural area; traffic; urban area; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114183707

In this regard, countries across the globe initiate policies to combat CO2 emissions and attain a carbon neutrality target. As an emerging research area, the current study investigated carbon neutrality targets for BRICS economies (excluding Russia) covering the period from 1980 to 2018. This study covers important variables that influence both the economy and energy. Considering the role of electricity production from renewable energy and globalization, this study also checked for the role of income and renewable energy consumption. Various second-generation unit root and cointegration tests are used for the panel data to observe the stationarity and long-run relationship among these variables. Also, the DOLS and FMOLS are employed for the long-run estimation. Additionally, the article utilizes fixed effect and random effect models. This study also utilizes the augmented mean group (AMG) to confirm the prior findings. The empirical findings present evidence of the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis in the region. Moreover, the findings suggest that income and globalization play a positive role in carbon dioxide emission, which negatively influences the carbon neutrality target. However, electricity production from renewable energy and renewable energy consumption is efficient for achieving carbon neutrality targets. Specifically, the AMG estimates reveal that a percent increase in GDP and globalization increases 1.087 and 0.0342 % CO2 emissions while a unit increase in renewable electricity production and renewable energy consumption declines CO2 emissions by 0.0205 and 0.0143 %, respectively. The results are found robust and significant. Based on the empirical findings, policy implications are provided that would lead the BRICS region to attain the carbon neutrality target by revising the policies concerning globalization and economic growth. Also, proper attention should be paid to renewable energy electricity adaptation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","BRICS; Carbon neutrality; EKC; Globalization; Renewable electricity; Renewable energy","carbon dioxide; economic development; electricity; international cooperation; renewable energy; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Electricity; Internationality; Renewable Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112212261

Lehmann, J., Soil and Crop Sciences, School of Integrative Plant Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States","We synthesized 20 years of research to explain the interrelated processes that determine soil and plant responses to biochar. The properties of biochar and its effects within agricultural ecosystems largely depend on feedstock and pyrolysis conditions. We describe three stages of reactions of biochar in soil: dissolution (1–3 weeks); reactive surface development (1–6 months); and aging (beyond 6 months). As biochar ages, it is incorporated into soil aggregates, protecting the biochar carbon and promoting the stabilization of rhizodeposits and microbial products. Biochar carbon persists in soil for hundreds to thousands of years. By increasing pH, porosity, and water availability, biochars can create favorable conditions for root development and microbial functions. Biochars can catalyze biotic and abiotic reactions, particularly in the rhizosphere, that increase nutrient supply and uptake by plants, reduce phytotoxins, stimulate plant development, and increase resilience to disease and environmental stressors. Meta-analyses found that, on average, biochars increase P availability by a factor of 4.6; decrease plant tissue concentration of heavy metals by 17%–39%; build soil organic carbon through negative priming by 3.8% (range −21% to +20%); and reduce non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from soil by 12%–50%. Meta-analyses show average crop yield increases of 10%–42% with biochar addition, with greatest increases in low-nutrient P-sorbing acidic soils (common in the tropics), and in sandy soils in drylands due to increase in nutrient retention and water holding capacity. Studies report a wide range of plant responses to biochars due to the diversity of biochars and contexts in which biochars have been applied. Crop yields increase strongly if site-specific soil constraints and nutrient and water limitations are mitigated by appropriate biochar formulations. Biochars can be tailored to address site constraints through feedstock selection, by modifying pyrolysis conditions, through pre- or post-production treatments, or co-application with organic or mineral fertilizers. We demonstrate how, when used wisely, biochar mitigates climate change and supports food security and the circular economy. © 2021 The Authors.

To support climate resilient urban planning efforts, here we present an approach for simulating future urban land-use changes and evaluating potential flood exposure at a high spatial resolution (30 m) and national scale. As a case study, we applied this model to the Philippines – a country frequently affected by extreme rainfall events. Urban land-use changes were simulated to the year 2050 using a trend-based logistic regression cellular automata model, considering three different scenarios of urban expansion (assuming low/medium/high population growth). Flood exposure assessment was then conducted by overlaying the land-use simulation results onto a global floodplain map. We found that approximately 6040–13,850 ha of urban land conversion is likely to be located in flood prone regions between 2019 and 2050 (depending on the scenario), affecting approximately 2.5–5.8 million additional urban residents. In locations with high rates of future urban development in flood prone areas (Mindanao Island, in particular), climate resilient land-use plans should be developed/enforced, and flood mitigation infrastructure protected (in the case of “nature-based” infrastructure) or constructed. The data selected for our land-use change modeling and flood exposure assessment were all openly and (near-)globally available, with the intention that our methodology can potentially be applied in other countries where rapid urban expansion is occurring.

Agricultural intensification has been identified as a relevant driver of this process and agri-environment schemes have been implemented to foster biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Because species-specific outcomes of measures strongly depend on tailored design of the policy framework and the local management, while changing climate may pose additional challenges, policy and management need science-based information of which landscape composition should be promoted to achieve set biodiversity goals. Here, we used direct observations of European brown hares over 20 years for evaluating the effects of landscape composition and weather conditions on European brown hare density. For the first time, our analysis compared the estimates of machine learning (gradient boosting machine) and linear mixed models in terms of importance of a wide range of explanatory variables for European brown hare densities and effect trends. Scattered woody vegetation, as represented by the two variables transitional woodland-shrub and small woody features, was on top rankings among the predictors and greater proportions of these elements were accompanied by sharp increases of European brown hare density. Also warmer winter temperature had a positive effect. We conclude that promoting scattered woody vegetation in agricultural landscapes is a powerful tool for improving European brown hare habitat quality. Particularly with the increasing dynamic in agriculture due to climate change, incentives and regulations that create a long-lasting heterogeneity in the landscape composition through near-natural elements can support the population of this popular mammal. © 2021 Gesellschaft für Ökologie","Agri-environment schemes; Agricultural intensification; Climate; Hedges; Heterogeneity; Lagomorpha; Landscape composition; Lepus europaeus; Population dynamic; Spotlight count; Subsidies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114219588

However, the key volatiles that trigger this state and their priming mechanisms remain largely unknown. The tea geometrid Ectropis obliqua is one of the most devastating leaf-feeding pests of tea plants. Here, plant–plant communication experiments demonstrated that volatiles emitted from tea plants infested by E. obliqua larvae triggered neighbouring plants to release volatiles that repel E. obliqua adult, especially mated females. Volatile analyses revealed that the quantity of eight volatiles increased dramatically when plants were exposed to volatiles emitted by infested tea plants, including (Z)-3-hexenol, linalool, α-farnesene, β-Ocimene and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT). The results of behavioural bioassays demonstrated that β-Ocimene strongly repelled mated E. obliqua females. Individual volatile compound exposure experiments revealed that (Z)-3-hexenol, linalool, α-farnesene and DMNT triggered the emission of β-Ocimene from tea plants. Chemical inhibition experiments demonstrated that the emission of β-Ocimene induced by (Z)-3-hexenol, linalool, α-farnesene and DMNT were dependent on Ca2+ and JA signalling. These findings help us to understand how E. obliqua moths respond to volatiles emitted from tea plants and provide new insight into volatile-mediated plant–plant interactions. They have potential significance for the development of novel insect and pest control strategies in crops. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","calcium (Ca2+); HIPVs; JA; mated moth; MPK signalling; tea plant","herbivore; inhibition; plant-herbivore interaction; tea; volatile organic compound; Ectropis obliqua; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114949699

To improve understanding of the origin of deeply buried microbial-dominated carbonate reservoir of the Lower Cambrian Xiaoerbulake Formation in Bachu-Tazhong area, the influences of microfacies types and carbonate diagenesis on porosity development were carefully investigated using petrographic observations and geochemical analyses from outcrop and core samples. Fifteen microfacies types (MF1-15) were identified in (1) tidal flat, (2) lagoon, (3) ramp-crest shoal, (4) sheltered proximal middle-ramp, (5) microbial mounds-biostromes proximal middle-ramp, and (6) distal middle-ramp environments on a gentle dipping carbonate ramp. A third-order depositional sequence consists of transgressive and highstand systems tract corresponding to the lower and upper member of the Xiaoerbulake Formation respectively. The HST section was characterized by extensively high-energy ramp-crest shoals and microbial mounds-biostromes proximal middle-ramp with moderate–good reservoir quality, while the TST section was composed of distal middle ramp and scattered microbial mounds with poor-non reservoir quality. The vertical cyclic pattern of porosity of microbial-related and dolo-grainstone microfacies types resulted from frequent exposure to meteoric leaching due to high-frequency relative sea level changes, as demonstrated by the diagenetic sequence. Main pore types are intergranular, vuggy pores, and microbial-related framework pores. Dolomitization occurred relatively early in shallow diagenetic environments, which may have improved the resistivity of carbonate rocks against chemical compaction. Preservation of porosity was likely attributed to a high-pressure closed diagenetic system under the middle Cambrian evaporites. The subsequent faulting and uplifting may have locally destroyed the reservoirs and increased the reservoir heterogeneity. This work would provide new sights for better understanding of the microbial-dominated carbonate reservoirs in deeply buried Lower Cambrian strata worldwide. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Diagenesis; Microbial-dominated carbonates; Microfacies analysis; Reservoirs; Tarim basin","Analytical geochemistry; Carbonates; Petroleum prospecting; Petroleum reservoirs; Porosity; Sea level; Sedimentology; Textures; Cambrians; Carbonate reservoir; Diagenetics; Lower cambrians; Microbial-dominated carbonate; Microfacies; Microfacies analyse; Reservoir quality; Tarim Basin; Tazhong area; Carbonation; Cambrian; carbonate ramp; diagenesis; dolostone; facies analysis; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon reservoir; leaching; microfacies; Bachu; China; Tarim Basin; Tazhong; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111835071

Given uneven sources, they typically exhibit distinct spatial heterogeneity, varying sharply over short distances (10 m-1 km). However, all-around observational constraints on the emission sources are limited in much of the world. Consequently, traditional emission inventories lack the spatial resolution that can characterize the on-road vehicle emission hotspots. Here we establish a bottom-up approach to reveal a unique pattern of urban on-road vehicle emissions at a spatial resolution 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than current emission inventories. We interconnect all-around traffic monitoring (including traffic fluxes, vehicle-specific categories, and speeds) via an intelligent transportation system (ITS) over Xiaoshan District in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. This enables us to calculate single-vehicle-specific emissions over each fine-scale (10 m-1 km) road segment. Thus, the most hyperfine emission dataset of its type is achieved, and on-road emission hotspots appear. The resulting map shows that the hourly average on-road vehicle emissions of CO, NOx, HC, and PM2.5 are 74.01, 40.35, 8.13, and 1.68 kg, respectively. More importantly, widespread and persistent emission hotspots emerged. They are of significantly sharp small-scale variability, up to 8-15 times within individual hotspots, attributable to distinct traffic fluxes, road conditions, and vehicle categories. On this basis, we investigate the effectiveness of routine traffic control strategies on on-road vehicle emission mitigation. Our results have important implications for how the strategies should be designed and optimized. Integrating our traffic-monitoring-based approach with urban air quality measurements, we could address major data gaps between urban air pollutant emissions and concentrations. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Accurate localized PV information, including location and size, is the basis for PV regulation and potential assessment of the energy sector. Automatic information extraction based on deep learning requires high-quality labeled samples that should be collected at multiple spatial resolutions and under different backgrounds due to the diversity and variable scale of PVs. We established a PV dataset using satellite and aerial images with spatial resolutions of 0.8, 0.3, and 0.1m, which focus on concentrated PVs, distributed ground PVs, and fine-grained rooftop PVs, respectively. The dataset contains 3716 samples of PVs installed on shrub land, grassland, cropland, saline-alkali land, and water surfaces, as well as flat concrete, steel tile, and brick roofs. The dataset is used to examine the model performance of different deep networks on PV segmentation. On average, an intersection over union (IoU) greater than 85% is achieved. In addition, our experiments show that direct cross application between samples with different resolutions is not feasible and that fine-tuning of the pre-trained deep networks using target samples is necessary. The dataset can support more work on PV technology for greater value, such as developing a PV detection algorithm, simulating PV conversion efficiency, and estimating regional PV potential.

However, due to the extreme shortage of large-scale energy storage facilities, the utilization efficiency of wind and solar power remains low. This paper proposes to use abandoned coal mine goafs serving as large-scale pumped hydro storage (PHS) reservoir. In this paper, suitability of coal mine goafs as PHS underground reservoirs was analyzed with respects to the storage capacity, usable capacity, and ventilation between goaf and outside. The storage capacity is 1.97 × 106 m3 for a typical mining area with an extent of 3 × 5 km2 and a coal seam thickness of 6 m. A typical goaf-PHS system with the energy type (Formula presented.) has a performance of 82.8% in the case of annual operation, able to regulate solar-wind energy with an average value of 275 kW. The performance of the proposed goaf-PHS system was analyzed based on the reservoir estimation and meteorological information from a typical region in China. It has been found that using abandoned coal mine goafs to develop PHS plants is technically feasible in wind and solar-rich northwestern and southwestern China.

Using a political economy approach to the study of international law, the article analyzes politico-legal issues associated with the creation of the ISA. The legal form of the ISA is best described as 'soft law in a hard shell': It uses the legal infrastructure of a treaty while relying on the social structure of participating actors for its future implementation. Empirical evidence suggests that three factors explain the treaty structure of the ISA: India's leadership role in the treaty-making process, the early involvement of non-state actors, and the preference of developing countries for legal form. Ultimately, the case illustrates India's shift towards a leadership role in climate change governance, and the steady emergence of non-state actors in driving climate action. © 2021 The Author(s).

One way to generate bioenergy is through anaerobic digesters. However, a common problem found in feasibility analyses is the appropriate location for these biodigesters, since the biomass is geographically and spatially dispersed. When the location is poorly chosen, it can interfere with the viability of the project. Therefore, the objective of this research is to determine the existence of areas that could still be explored by investigating studies that seek to identify suitable locations for deploying the biodigesters from the perspective of aspects (economic, environmental and social), localization problems (location/allocation and supply chain) and techniques. To this end, a systematic review of the literature was conducted from the Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science databases. It was observed that the literature could be more explored to (a) consider the social aspect in biodigesters location models, (b) propose studies that specify and consolidate each aspects’ characteristics found in the literature applied in biodigesters location models, (c) integrate the economic–environmental–social aspects into supply chain project problems, and (d) explore the creation of clusters for energy production through strategic partnerships between small farms. © 2021","Biodigesters; Bioenergy; Biomass; Location; Systematic review","Biomass; Greenhouse gases; Social aspects; Supply chains; Waste disposal; % reductions; Anaerobic digester; Bio-energy; Biodigesters; Feasibility analysis; Greenhouses gas; Location modeling; Location problems; Renewable energies; Systematic Review; Location",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109139655

The impact of the policies on the entire energy system at provincial level, however, has rarely been investigated. From this perspective, this paper provides geographically updated assessment of emissions reduction policies. This study adopts two opposite policies, a tax on coal-fired generation (Coal scenario) and a subsidy on PV generation (PV scenario). As an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM), GCAM-Korea, a version of GCAM with provincial level resolution of Korea, is applied in this study. GCAM-Korea can provide insights across provinces as well as sectors. Simulation results show that Coal scenario increases electricity price, while PV scenario decreases electricity price. With different conditions in each end-use sector, different responses are expected by this electricity price change. Industry sector, especially steel and iron manufacture industry, shows the most susceptible response to the electricity price change through substitution of electricity with coal. Under Coal scenario, higher electricity price causes larger coal consumption with smaller electricity consumption, while under PV scenario lower electricity price causes smaller coal consumption with larger electricity consumption. This inter sectoral impacts are directly transformed into inter provincial impacts. This transformation should be carefully handled, considering that the top five provinces accounted for 83 % of total industrial energy consumption in South Korea. Even though there is a large fraction of coal consumed in industry sector, the tax on coal has been imposed only on thermal coal under current energy price policy in Korea. A tax on industrial coal use as a whole could possibly buffer the negative impacts from non-taxed coal consumption in iron and steel industry. Further empirical examination is required to check the validity of this prediction from the model. Finally, the positive impact of emissions reduction by tax on coal fired generation, in turn, triggers negative externality on other provinces by causing more consumption of coal in industry sector. Even if this simulation results can not be quantified in terms of total amounts of benefit compared with total amounts of damages caused by this negative externality, the existence of distributional issue of emissions reduction at provincial level has been successfully demonstrated. GCAM-Korea is shown to capture the provincial level characteristics of energy system and it can be applied for the analysis of regional energy plan being conducted every 5 years by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Korea. © 2021 The Authors","Integrated assessment; Multi-sectoral analysis; Provincial-level analysis; South Korea","Coal; Electric power utilization; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Iron and steel industry; Photovoltaic cells; Predictive analytics; Steelmaking; Taxation; Coal fired generation; Electricity-consumption; Empirical examination; Industrial energy consumption; Integrated assessment models; Level characteristic; Manufacture industry; Negative externalities; Coal industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113152067

Fluxes of heat and momentum exchange across the sea-Air interface, as do fluxes of matter, including greenhouse gases, aerosols, microbes (algae, bacteria sensu lato and viruses) and other substances. At least at calm to moderate windspeeds, microbial OM (MOM) in the SML reduces these fluxes. Another MOM fraction, foam, covers a part of the ocean surface. Ocean foam increases mean ocean albedo because it reflects solar radiation, thus cooling the ocean and the Earth. The rheological properties of MOM and the reduction of sea-Air fluxes depend on microbial abundance and taxonomic composition, as do the formation and persistence of foam. Genomic regulation of MOM secretion may thus be helping to regulate air-sea fluxes and climate. Unpredictable changes in abundance and taxonomic composition of these microbial communities may be adding uncertainty to global and more local climate. Some of this uncertainty could be mitigated by studying the ecology and genomics of the surface microbial community together with chemical and rheological properties of their secreted MOM and its effects on sea-Air fluxes and foam coverage, to incorporate into climate models. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

It could be argued that industries cannot produce CO2 emissions unless primary resources are available. However, few studies have focused on estimating the role of primary resources in the production of industrial CO2 emissions. Furthermore, primary resource-induced inter and intra-sectoral linkages have received little attention. The purpose of this research is to estimate the role of primary resources in driving direct and net CO2 emissions (net CO2 linkages) in China, India, and the United States, all of which are at different stages of economic development. This study estimated the supply-induced CO2 emissions and linkages of China, India, and the United States using the Ghosh supply input–output model and by proposing some new supply-induced net emission linkage measures. The findings revealed that, when compared to fixed capital, labor produced more total and net carbon emissions in all three countries. The utility sector of “Electricity, gas, and water” (EGW) had the highest amount of labor and capital-induced emissions of all three nations. However, further decomposition of these emissions revealed the impact of different levels of economic development. In the services-based developed economy of the United States, input supplies from the sector of “Financial Intermediation and Business Activities” resulted in the highest emissions of the downstream sectors. The largest amount of downstream emissions was caused by supplies from the raw material supplier of “Mining and quarrying” in the industrial-based Chinese economy. While in India, which has a comparatively more agro-based economy, the “Agriculture” sector caused the greatest amount of downstream emissions. Our findings on supply-induced CO2 emissions of major countries at various levels of economic development can help guide both developed and developing economies to reduce industrial carbon emissions by efficiently managing and reallocating primary resource supplies to sectors. © 2021 The Author(s)","Ghosh supply model; Hypothetical extraction method; Input-output model; Primary resource; Resource and carbon policy; Supply-side linkage","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Industrial economics; Industrial emissions; Carbon policy; Extraction method; Ghosh supply model; Hypothetical extraction method; Input-output modeling; Primary resources; Resource policy; Supply models; Supply sides; Supply-side linkage; Economic and social effects; capital; carbon emission; economic development; environmental economics; labor market; resource allocation; China; India; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115887745

Conservation agriculture (CA) is being increasingly advocated as a management strategy to overcome these issues but precision nutrient management under the CA-based maize-wheat system is rarely studied. Two year’s (2014–2015 and 2015–2016) research was conducted at the research farm of BISA, Pusa, Bihar, India to develop precision nutrient management practices for CA-based management in the maize-wheat system. Seven treatment combinations involving (i) tillage (conventional tillage; CT & permanent beds; PB) and (ii) nutrient management rates, application methods (farmers’ fertilizer practices; FFP, state recommended dose of fertilizer; SR and precision nutrient management using Nutrient Expert tool; NE and GreenSeeker; (GS), applied using two methods; broadcasting (B) and drilling (D)) were investigated for multiple parameters. The results showed that NE, NE+GS, and SR-based nutrient management tactics with drilling improved crop yields, nutrient-use efficiency (NUE), and economic profitability relative to NE-broadcasting, SR broadcasting, and FFP broadcasting methods. Maize-wheat system productivity and net returns under NE+GS-drilling on PB were significantly higher by 31.2%, 49.7% compared to FFP-broadcasting method, respectively. Total global warming potential (GWP) was lower in the PB-based maize-wheat system coupled with precision nutrient management compared to CT-based maize-wheat system with FFP. Higher (15.2%) carbon sustainability index (CSI) was recorded with NE-drilling compared to FFP-broadcasting method. Results suggests that PB-based maize-wheat system together with precision nutrient management approaches (NE+GS+drilling) can significantly increase crop yields, NUE, and profitability while reducing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from maize-wheat systems in eastern Indo Gangetic Plains (IGP). © 2021 by the authors.

However, buildings in the UK are currently being designed and constructed to current building regulations which do not require net-zero performance, and these buildings will last well beyond 2050. This paper presents a case study of a housing development in Hertfordshire, UK, where a structured approach for achieving net-zero carbon performance homes was developed. The methodology was based on dynamic simulation modelling to design buildings which achieve net-zero operational emissions, and an industry standard inventory of carbon and energy database was used to evaluate embodied emissions in building materials. The approach comprised of developing dynamic simulation models to investigate the improvement in energy performance of the development through fabric-first approach, focusing on building envelope design prior to introducing renewable energy systems, in order to achieve operational net-zero carbon performance. Carbon emissions (operational and embodied) were investigated to assess the appropriateness of the deployed strategies. Dynamic simulation results combined with embodied emissions analysis illustrated that, by combining embodied and operational emissions, a net-zero carbon performance would be achievable by the 2050 target only if alternative building materials based on photosynthetic bio-composites are used. This analysis also highlighted the limitations of conventional retrofit interventions carried out 10 years after the construction as they resulted in increased embodied carbon emissions, thus lengthening the time period well beyond the 2050 target for achieving net-zero carbon performance. As the use of conventional materials appeared to delay the achievement of net-zero emissions by several decades, the only way to achieve net-zero targets before 2050 is to design new buildings to be carbon negative from the operational point of view and to use photosynthetic materials for their construction.

Herein, theoretical considerations guide state-of-the-art synthesis of well-defined catalysts to show that higher selectivity toward ethanol is achieved on Cu(110) edge sites compared to Cu(100) terraces. Specifically, we study the catalytic behavior of Cu nano-cubes (Cucub) of different sizes in the framework of tandem catalysis with CO-producing Ag nano-spheres. We predict and experimentally find that the smaller Cucub possess higher selectivity for ethanol in view of their larger edge-to-faces ratio and of the fact that ethylene is produced at terraces while ethanol is selectively produced at step edges. These results call for synthetic developments toward Cu nanostructures exposing only edge sites, such as hollow cubic nanocages, to further increase ethanol selectivity.

The present pandemic crisis made this issue even more important. It significantly increased the number of transport operations within the city area, as each order has to be delivered directly to the purchaser. Consequently, city authorities are confronted with the important challenge: how to fulfil the expectations and needs of city users in the context of transport system functioning in view of reducing the negative impacts of urban freight transport in terms of safety, air pollution or noise. This is one of the most important elements of social sustainability in cities. One of the solutions that help reduce the negative environmental impacts of urban freight transport is making use of vehicles that produce less air pollution, such as electric vans. It proved to be very effective in decreasing transportation footprint by reducing local emissions of e.g. PM or NOx. However, one of the key limitations is the potential short driving range of such vehicles, which results from the battery capacity and charging infrastructure availability. In recent years, some analyses related to that issue have been made. Nevertheless, the studies have taken into account passenger cars only. This paper presents the results of the research study aimed at verification of electric vans energy efficiency in real-life conditions, i.e. when delivering courier consignments. The electric van used for the purposes of the experiment was Nissan eNV200. This paper fulfils the important knowledge gap and could be helpful from both theoretical and practical perspectives. It should be emphasised that the experiment was carried out in real-life conditions, i.e. in the course of performing business processes in one of the worldwide known CEP companies. The research study was carried out under the EUFAL international project, funded under the Electric Mobility Europe programme. The results of the research shown high potential of electric vehicles and usefulness of electromobility in last mile deliveries. The business partner of the research is now on the stage of electric freight vehicles implementation into vehicles fleets. © 2021","City logistics; city sustainability; City users’ needs; Electric freight vehicles; Electro-mobility; Transport system impact; Urban freight transport","Air pollution; Electric automobiles; Energy efficiency; Freight transportation; Trucks; Urban transportation; City logistics; City sustainability; City user’ need; Condition; Electric freight vehicle; Electro mobilities; Last mile; Research studies; Transport system impact; Urban freight transport; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111502889

Various materials are used for Tech-nosols’ construction with a limited attention to their ecosystem services or disservices. The research focuses on the integral assessment of soil-like materials used for Technosols’ construction in Moscow megalopolis from the ecosystem services’ perspective. Four groups of materials (valley peats, sediments, cultural layers, and commercial manufactured soil mixtures) were assessed based on the indicators, which are integral, informative, and cost-effective. Microbial respiration, C-availability, specific respiration, community level physiological profile, and Shannon’ diversity index in the materials were compared to the natural reference to assess and rank the ecosystem services and disser-vices. The assessment showed that sediments and low-peat mixtures (≤30% of peat in total volume) had a considerably higher capacity to provide C-sequestration, climate regulation and functional diversity services compared to peats and high-peat mixtures. Urban cultural layers provided ecosystem disservices due to pollution by potentially toxic elements and health risks from the pathogenic fungi. Mixtures comprising from the sediments with minor (≤30%) peat addition would have a high potential to increase C-sequestration and to enrich microbial functional diversity. Their implementation in urban landscaping will reduce management costs and increase sustainability of urban soils and ecosystem. © 2021 by the authors.

For addressing climate change concerns, national governments have implemented incentive schemes for residential consumers, encouraging the installation of home PV panels for covering self-consumption needs. In the absence of adequate storage capacities, the surplus is sold back by these entities, called prosumers, to the grid operator or, in local markets, to other consumers. While these initiatives encourage the proliferation of green energy resources, and ample research is dedicated to local market designs for prosumer–consumer trading, the main concern of distribution network operators is the influence of power flows generated by prosumers’ surplus injection on the operating states of microgrids. The change in power flow amount and direction can greatly influence the economic and technical operating conditions of radial grids. This paper proposes a metaheuristic algorithm for prosumer surplus management that optimizes the power surplus injections using the automated control of three-phase inverters, with the aim of reducing the active power losses over a typical day of operation. A case study was performed on two real distribution networks with distinct layouts and load profiles, and the algorithm resulted efficient in both scenarios. By optimally distributing the prosumer generation surplus on the three phases of the network, significant loss reductions were obtained, with the best results when the generated power was injected in an unbalanced, three-phase flow. © 2021 by the authors.

Lockdowns have fuelled the intensification of low-carbon resources in terms of electricity production, yet a drastic upswing in electricity use in residential districts during the pandemic. By exploring economic renewable energy resources, the world is trying to overcome the crisis and one of them is wind energy, where this sustainable energy system is highly demanded, thus reducing global CO2 emissions. Researchers have carried out several findings on wind energy obtained from wind turbines at various potential locations, but most of it used natural sources as a wind stream. Therefore, a revolutionary concept on extracting clean energy from manufactured wind resources with wind turbine system for power generation is introduced in recent studies. The main goal of this review paper is to emphasize the performances of power generation through Exhaust Air Energy Recovery Wind Turbine. The potentiality of wind extractions is reviewed to achieve the clear overview of this new progressive ideas and the important configurations is accentuated. Most findings indicated that this energy recovery device converts wasted energy to a more profitable form by converting it to electricity, resulting in a rapid return on investment. Moreover, the enclosing the output area of wind turbines for recovering energy enhances overall efficiency. © 2021.

In addition, the formation of a carbonate complex has been confirmed in the Re photocatalytic system where DMF and TEOA are used as solvents. In this study, we survey the reaction pathways of the photocatalytic conversions of CO2 to CO + H2O and CO2 to CO + HCO3- by fac-Re(bpy)(CO)3Br in the presence of TEOA using density functional theory (DFT) and domain-based local pair natural orbital coupled cluster approach, DLPNO-CCSD(T). Under light irradiation, the solvent-coordinated Re complex is first reduced to form a monoalkyl carbonate complex in the doublet pathway. This doublet pathway is kinetically advantageous over the singlet pathway. To reduce carbon dioxide, the Re complex needs to be reduced by two electrons. The second electron reduction occurs after the monoalkyl carbonate complex is protonated. The second reduction involves the dissociation of the monoalkyl carbonate ligand, and the dissociated ligand recombines the Re center via carbon to generate Re-COOH species, which further reacts with CO2 to generate tetracarbonyl complex and HCO3-. The two-electron reduced ligand-free Re complex converts CO2 to CO and H2O. The pathways leading to H2O formation have lower barriers than the pathways leading to HCO3- formation, but their portion of formation must depend on proton concentration. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Bromine compounds; Carbonation; Density functional theory; Ligands; Numerical methods; Rhenium compounds; Carbonate complexes; Catalytic efficiencies; Density-functional-theory; Functional domains; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic reduction; Photocatalytic systems; Photochemical conversion; Re complex; Reaction pathways; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120646259

The structure and function of the fungal communities inhabiting the phyllosphere of hornbeam trees growing in two chronically polluted areas, the oilfield of Bóbrka and the city center of Warsaw, were compared to the ones growing in one nature reserve, the Białowieża National Park. Fungi were isolated and characterized both phylogenetically and functionally for their potential role in air pollution mitigation. Both culture-dependent (e.g., enzyme assays and tolerance tests) and culture-independent methods (e.g., ITS and shotgun sequencings) were used. Furthermore, the degradation potential of the fungi was assessed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Shotgun sequencing showed that the phyllosphere fungal communities were dominated by fungi belonging to the phylum Ascomycota. Aureobasidium was the only genus detected at the three locations with a relative abundance ≥1.0%.

Furthermore, Fusarium sporotrichioides AT11 and Phoma herbarum AT15 tolerated exposure to airborne naphthalene and benzene. Lophiostoma sp.

The monthly normalized precipitation index (SPI) was used in this study to assess the impact of climate change for wet events and droughts from a meteorological perspective. The GR2M model was used to project changes in the streamflow of the Daule River. The climate projection was based on the four rigorously selected models to represent the climate of the study area. On average, an increase in temperature (~2◦C) and precipitation (~6%) is expected. A 7% increase in precipitation would result in a 10% increase in streamflow for flood periods, while an 8% decrease in precipitation could result in approximately a 60% reduction in flow for dry periods. The analysis of droughts shows that they will be more frequent and prolonged in the highlands (Andes) and the middle part of the basin. In the future, wet periods will be less frequent but of greater duration and intensity on the Ecuadorian coast. These results point to future problems such as water deficit in the dry season but also increased streamflow for floods during the wet season.

However, previous estimates of the global CO2 concentration before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic are limited because they are based on energy consumption statistics or local specific in-situ observations. The aim of the study was to explore objective evidence for various previous studies that have claimed the global CO2 concentration decreased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are two ways to measure the global CO2 concentration: from the top-down using satellites and the bottom-up using ground stations. We implemented the time-series analysis by comparing the before and after the inflection point (first wave of COVID-19) with the long-term CO2 concentration data obtained from World Meteorological Organization Global Atmosphere Watch (WMO GAW) and Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT). Measurements from the GOSAT and GAW global monitoring stations show that the CO2 concentrations in Europe, China, and the USA have continuously risen in March and April 2020 compared with the same months in 2019. These data confirm that the global lockdown during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic did not change the vertical CO2 profile at the global level from the ground surface to the upper layer of the atmosphere.

However, the CAA provides California the ability to adopt and enforce its own new motor vehicle emission standards, if the EPA approves California’s standards via a preemption waiver. The CAA also allows other states to adopt California’s new motor vehicle emission standards for which the EPA has granted such a waiver providing other relevant criteria are met.

Washington subsequently amended its new motor vehicle emissions program to incorporate California’s LEV updates to its program. The purpose of this SIP revision is to implement programs to reduce vehicle emissions that contribute to formation of ground level ozone and fine particulate matter. Washington did not submit provisions related to greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles or zero-emission vehicles requirements for inclusion in the SIP.

Techniques to spatially map sedimentary OC must develop to form the basis of seabed management tools that consider carbon-rich sediments. While the natural burial of carbon (C) provides a climate regulation service, the disturbance of buried C could present a significant positive feedback mechanism to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. We present a regional Scottish case study that explores the suitability of integrating archived seafloor acoustic data (i.e., multibeam echosounder bathymetry and backscatter) with physical samples toward improved spatial mapping of surface OC in a dynamic coastal environment. Acoustic backscatter is a proxy for seabed sediments and can be collected over extensive areas at high resolutions. Sediment type is also an important predictor of OC. We test the potential of backscatter as a proxy for OC which may prove useful in the absence of exhaustive sediment data. Overall, although statistically significant, correlations between the variables OC, sediment type, and backscatter are relatively weak, likely reflecting a combination of limited and asynchronous data, sediment mobility over time, and complex environmental processing of OC in shelf sediments. We estimate linear mixed models to predict OC using backscatter and Folk sediment type as covariates. Our results show that incorporating backscatter in the model improves the precision of OC predictions by 14%. Backscatter discriminates between coarse and fine sediments, and therefore low and high OC regimes; however, was not able to discriminate amongst finer sediments. Although sediment type is a stronger predictor of OC, these data are available at a much lower spatial resolution and do not account for fine-scale variability. The resulting maps display varying spatial distributions of OC reflecting the different scales of the predictor variables, demonstrating a need for further methodological development. Backscatter shows considerable promise as a high-resolution predictor variable to improve the precision of surface OC maps, or to reduce the number of OC measurements required to achieve a specified precision. Applications of such maps have potential in improved C-stock estimates and the design of conservation and management strategies that consider marine sediments as valuable C stores.

Establishing a cover crop that absorbs reactive N compounds from soil could reduce N2O emissions, but adding manure that contains reactive N might increase the N2O emission. The objective of this study is to estimate soil N2O emissions in the spring freeze-thaw period from agricultural soils with cover crops and fall manuring, using the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model forced by recent-past baseline conditions (1981–2010) and by two plausible future climate scenarios (for 2071–2100). The DNDC model was calibrated and validated with data from a two-year field study (September 2017 – April 2019) in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Canada. Climatic conditions were set with nearby meteorological station data and two bias-adjusted simulations from the CRCM5/CanESM2 climate model (one for each of the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5). After validation, the DNDC model could reliably simulate many environmental properties, cover crop biomass and the temporal pattern of N2O fluxes, but overestimated the spring N2O emissions. In the future warmer climate, there was more cover crop biomass (13–40 kg N ha−1 in the RCP8.5 scenario vs. 6–17 kg N ha−1 in the baseline scenario) without additional N2O emissions from soil in the spring freeze-thaw period (3–62 g N ha−1 in the RCP8.5 scenario vs. 4–50 g N ha−1 in the baseline scenario). However, bare soil could not buffer the reactive N supplied by fall-applied solid manure, leading to higher estimated N2O emission from soils with solid manure (57–62 g N ha−1) than with liquid manure (13–18 g N ha−1) or no manure (2.6 g N ha−1) in the two future climate scenarios.

However, its long-term evolution history and driving forces during the relatively warm Miocene remain unclear, even conflicting in some intervals. Here, we present a new, and quantitative record of EASM precipitation during Miocene using the Bayesian approach of Climate Reconstruction Software (CREST) based on pollen flora from the Tianshui Basin located on the northwestern Tibetan Plateau (TP). The results demonstrate that a strong and relatively stable EASM precipitation period occurred during the Neogene in northern China at ~17.1–13.6 Ma, which was followed by a strong and gradual decreasing period between ~13.6 and 7.4 Ma. This trend was abruptly stopped at ~7.4 Ma with the beginning of a period of large amplitude precipitation increase. The comparison analysis reveals that the gradual decrease of EASM precipitation during the period of ~17.1–7.4 Ma was primarily controlled by the global cooling, whereas the significant increase period after ~7.4 Ma was mainly related to the late Miocene uplift of the TP, supporting climate model simulations, in which both the global temperature and palaeogeography play important roles in regulating the long-term evolution of EASM precipitation. © 2021 The Author(s)","Pollen; Probability density functions; Quantitative reconstruction; Tianshui basin","climate modeling; Miocene; Neogene; paleogeography; precipitation (climatology); China; Far East; Gansu; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Tianshui",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112578532

Decomposition analysis has been widely performed to identify the drivers of China's CO2 emissions. However, to date, no researchers have examined the drivers of the change in CO2 emissions under the progress of urbanization across all of its provinces. Using provincial statistical data and six key factors influencing CO2 emissions (carbon intensity, energy intensity, resident consumption, consumption inhibition, population urbanization, and population size), we applied the logarithmic mean Divisia index decomposition method to examine how urbanization affect CO2 emission changes across 30 provinces during 1990–2016. We elucidated that while urbanization's effects on CO2 emissions increased in China as a whole during this period, they were regionally differentiated. The energy intensity effect was the main driver of reduced CO2 emissions, with carbon intensity exerting weaker effects in the 30 provinces, differentiated by their energy structures. The resident consumption effect, strongly linked to advancing urbanization, was the primary driver of increased CO2 emissions in all the provinces. While the consumption inhibition and population urbanization effects were positive at the national level, they were negative in highly urbanized provinces and in highly industrial provinces. These findings highlight the need to promote environmentally friendly consumption and to design regionally differentiated policies and optimized energy structures tailored to particular urbanization contexts. Moreover, they can provide valuable inputs for other developing countries undergoing continuous urbanization, contributing to efforts to balance economic development and environmental sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide emissions; China; Decomposition; Provincial-level analysis; Resident consumption; Urbanization","Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon intensity; China; CO 2 emission; Decomposition analysis; Economic development; Energy intensity; Provincial-level analyse; Resident consumption; Urbanization; Global warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116208765

The primary driver of PM2.5 pollution in China is urbanization, and its relationship with PM2.5 concentration has attracted considerable recent academic interest. However, the spatial heterogeneity of the effect of urbanization on PM2.5 concentration has not been fully explored. This study sought to fill this knowledge gap by focusing on the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration. Urbanization was decomposed into economic urbanization, population urbanization, and land urbanization, and four corresponding indi-cators were selected. A geographically weighted regression model revealed that the impact of multidimensional urbanization on PM2.5 concentration varies significantly. Economically, urbanization is correlated positively and negatively with PM2.5 concentration in northern and southern areas, respectively. Population size showed a positive correlation with PM2.5 concentration in northwest-ern and northeastern areas. A negative correlation was found between urban land size and PM2.5 concentration from central to southern regions. Urban compactness is the dominant influencing factor that is correlated positively with PM2.5 concentration in a major part of the BTH urban ag-glomeration. On the basis of these findings, BTH counties were categorized with regard to local policy recommendations intended to reduce PM2.5 concentrations. © 2021 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: The indoor corrosion test was carried out by continuous salt spray in a salt spray chamber. Weight loss analysis, X-ray diffraction, cannon 1500 D, scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical techniques are used to analyze the results. Findings: It was found that thickness loss of Q235 carbon steel increases with higher temperature and it can reach 0.095 mm at 50°C. Compared with the Xisha exposure test, the acceleration rate can achieve 230 times. This phenomenon indicates that decreasing the experimental temperature is beneficial to the anti-corrosion of the Q235 carbon steel. It is fascinating to find that acceleration and simulation increase with temperature simultaneously, which shows that β-FeOOH promotes the corrosion rate and α-FeOOH provides high simulation. Meanwhile, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicates that the resistance of the rust layer improves with temperature. Practical implications: Through the study, the authors found that with the increase of temperature, the acceleration and simulation of indoor corrosion test improved, corrosion products and kinetics are the same as those in outdoor exposure test, and which means that the laboratory can achieve the long-term corrosion degree of outdoor exposure in a short time, and the similarity with outdoor exposure is high. This helps to the study of marine atmospheric corrosion, and indoor accelerated corrosion tests can largely eliminate regional differences by adjusting some environmental factors, and lay a foundation for marine atmospheric corrosion. Originality/value: The effects of temperature on the acceleration and simulation of indoor corrosion tests are discussed. Through laboratory experiments, the long-term service life of Q235 carbon in the Xisha marine atmosphere can be predicted effectively. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corrosion kinetics; FeOOH; Simulation; Temperature","Acceleration; Atmospheric corrosion; Atmospheric temperature; Corrosion rate; Corrosive effects; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; High temperature corrosion; Scanning electron microscopy; Steel corrosion; Steel testing; Corrosion behaviour; Corrosion kinetics; Corrosion tests; Design/methodology/approach; Effects of temperature; Indoor corrosions; Outdoor exposure; Q235 carbon steels; Salt spray; Simulation; Seawater corrosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115801141

In Lake Michigan, the in-situ wave observations suitable for long-term analysis are limited to two offshore MetOcean buoys. Since this distribution is inadequate to fully represent spatial patterns of wave climate across the lake, a series of high-resolution SWAN model simulations were performed for the analysis of long-term wave climate change for the entirety of Lake Michigan from 1979 to 2020. Model results were validated against observations from two offshore buoys and 16 coastal buoys. Linear regression analysis of significant wave height (Hs) (mean, 90th percentile, and 99th percentile) across the entire lake using this 42-year simulation suggests that there is no simple linear trend of long-term changes of Hs for the majority (&gt;90%) of the lake. To address the inadequacy of linear trend analysis used in previous studies, a 10-year trailing moving mean was applied to the Hs statistics to remove seasonal and annual variability, focusing on identifying long-term wave climate change. Model results reveal the regime shifts of Hs that correspond to long-term lake water level changes. Specifically, downward trends of Hs were found in the decade of 1990–2000; low Hs during 2000–2010 coincident with low lake levels; and upward trends of Hs were found during 2010–2020 along with rising water levels. The coherent pattern between the wave climate and the water level was hypothesized to result from changing storm frequency and intensity crossing the lake basin, which influences both waves (instantly through increased wind stress on the surface) and water levels (following, with a lag through precipitation and runoff). Hence, recent water level increases and wave growth were likely associated with increased storminess observed in the Great Lakes. With regional warming, the decrease in ice cover in Lake Michigan (particularly in the northernmost region of the lake) favored the wave growth in the winter due to increased surface wind stress, wind fetch, and wave transmission. Model simulations suggest that the basin-wide Hs can increase significantly during the winter season with projected regional warming and associated decreases in winter ice cover. The recent increases in wave height and water level, along with warming climate and ice reduction, may yield increasing coastal damages such as accelerating coastal erosion. © Copyright © 2021 Huang, Zhu, Ma, Meadows and Xue.","Great Lakes; ice cover; Lake Michigan; SWAN (Simulating Wave Nearshore); water level; wave climate change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119522297

To achieve the goals of carbon peak and carbon neutrality, China needs to address the challenge of the large and still growing CO2 emission base. This paper investigated the energy consumption and CO2 emission in Beijing from 2020–2035 based on the energy elasticity coefficient and contribution value of the sub-energy increment (CVSI) method. Beijing is one of the first cities in China to propose the ""carbon peak” target as of 2020. From 2020 Beijing will strive to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality. The results show that in 2035 the CO2 emission in Beijing may drop to 50% of 2020. This decline would be affected by economic growth, energy efficiency and the proportion of renewable energy use. Beijing’s energy supply mainly comes from outside the region. Therefore, for Beijing, in addition to increasing the proportion of renewable energy sources outside the region, its own energy acceptance also needs to be strengthened, including strengthening energy storage construction, actively researching and promoting carbon capture and utilization of gas-fired units, which are effective ways to achieve carbon neutrality target. © 2021 Hu et al.

Recent UK research has revealed public support for climate-adapted UGI, yet there is a lack of research focusing on the values underlying public perceptions, particularly in relation to climate change, and the socio-cultural factors driving these. This was addressed by asking 249 people to walk through one of three contrasting areas of planting: exotic (climate-adapted); traditional or cottage-garden, within a designed garden setting, whilst conducting a self-guided questionnaire assessing participants’ perceptions of aesthetics, self-reported restorative effect, and plant and invertebrate biodiversity. Participants’ held values in relation to climate change, non-native species, and nature-connectedness were also addressed. Findings indicated aesthetic preference for climate-adapted planting over the other two styles, providing further evidence of cultural acceptance for policymakers and land-managers seeking to ‘futureproof’ cities by introducing climate-adapted UGI. Planting of a cottage-garden style was perceived as the least attractive, but the most restorative. Socio-cultural characteristics including age, educational qualifications, and taking holidays overseas were drivers of perceptions. Professional involvement and interest in the environment, landscape, and horticulture were identified as drivers of perceptions and values. Values in relation to climate change were directly related to participants’ educational qualifications. This identifies a need to consider novel approaches to climate change education to promote wider understanding of the implications of climate-change and the potential for climate-adapted UGI to deliver ‘futureproofing’ benefits for climate-change mitigation and human mental wellbeing. © 2021 The Author","Aesthetic effect; Nature-based solutions; Perceived biodiversity; Restorative effect; Urban green infrastructure; Wellbeing","climate change; global climate; horticulture; invertebrate; perception; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116946150

We focus on the balancing act Svalbard tourism industry must play among sometimes competing demands of climate change mitigation and emissions from tourism, and of strict Norwegian environmental management policy and demands for increased tourism. While these are specific to Svalbard, the balancing act of competing needs is the core challenge of the UN Sustainability Goals giving this research global and pan-Arctic relevance. Through collaboration between two tourism organisations, the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO) and Visit Svalbard and an interdisciplinary team of scientists, we will co-produce knowledge about how to innovate new opportunities while protecting the wilderness, the very backbone of tourism. This collaboration considers how policy, climate change, and local attitudes together may affect the tourism industry and helps to define and develop sustainable tourism operations and products. For instance, tourists may participate in environmental and community-related activities or micro safaris rather than a sole focus on charismatic megafauna. Policy discussions about tourism growth need to consider how local and national governments anticipate and navigate rapid social, political, and environmental changes. ©","Co-production of knowledge; Local perspectives; Sustainable tourism; Svalbard; Transformation","economic growth; ecotourism; environmental management; governance approach; sustainability; tourism economics; Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120939335

However, climate change affects surface solar radiation and will therefore directly influence future PV power generation. We use scenarios from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) for a mitigation (SSP1-2.6) and a fossil-fuel-dependent (SSP5-8.5) pathway in order to quantify climate risk for solar PV in Europe as simulated by the Global Solar Energy Estimator (GSEE). We find that PV potential increases by around 5 % in the mitigation scenario, suggesting a positive feedback loop between climate change mitigation and PV potential. While increased clear-sky radiation and reduced cloud cover go hand in hand in SSP1-2.6, the effect of a decrease in clear-sky radiation is outweighed by a decrease in cloud cover in SSP5-8.5, resulting in an increase in all-sky radiation. Moreover, we find that the seasonal cycle of PV generation changes in most places, as generation grows more strongly in winter than in summer (SSP1-2.6) or increases in summer and declines in winter (SSP5-8.5). We further analyze climate change impacts on the spatial variability of PV power generation. Similar to the effects anticipated for wind energy, we report an increase in the spatial correlations of daily PV production with large inter-model agreement yet relatively small amplitude, implying that PV power balancing between different regions in continental Europe will become more difficult in the future. Thus, based on the most recent climate simulations, this research supports the notion that climate change will only marginally impact renewable energy potential, while changes in the spatiotemporal generation structure are to be expected and should be included in power system design. © 2021 The Author(s).",,"Climate change; Climate models; Fossil fuels; Photovoltaic cells; Risk perception; Solar power generation; Wind power; Clear sky; Climate change impact; Cloud cover; Decarbonising; Energy systems; Photovoltaic potentials; Photovoltaic power generation; Sky radiation; Solar photovoltaics; Spatial variability; Solar energy; alternative energy; climate change; CMIP; power generation; solar power; spatiotemporal analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119200949

In addition, construction products often induce significant environmental burden due to the use of emission-intensive materials. Therefore, continuous scientific efforts have been devoted in resource-efficient design with the incorporation of such secondary materials to help save the primary resources and reduce the environmental impacts. In this study, cement-free partition wall block is developed through a number of strategies, whereby emission-intensive Ordinary Portland cement is completely substituted by waste materials and supplementary cementitious materials, and this together with the use of recycled aggregates can make the blocks produced entirely based on secondary materials. The required mechanical performance of the blocks produced under different strategies is verified through laboratory tests. The carbon reduction potentials for such strategies are evaluated through the life cycle assessment (LCA) technique. The LCA results show that partition wall blocks produced with concrete slurry waste (CSW), fly ash and fine recycled concrete aggregates can reduce up to 82% of the total carbon emissions than other strategies. On the other hand, the reuse of CSW in the production of partition wall blocks can potentially save 80,000 m3 of landfill space and US$4 million of costs associated with landfill disposal in Hong Kong annually. To maximize the advantages of such secondary resources in partition wall blocks production, it is imperative to establish industrial symbiosis networks with relevant supply chain and to adopt the developed partition wall blocks widely in practice. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Lifecycle assessment; Material circularity; Partition wall blocks; Sustainable design","Carbon; Concretes; Ecodesign; Fly ash; Land fill; Portland cement; Recycling; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Assessment approaches; Carbon emissions; Industrial production; Landfill disposal; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Material circularity; Partition wall blocks; Production system; Recycled materials; Secondary materials; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111298258

Assessing the spatio-temporal distribution of plantation forest vegetation by analyzing Landsat land use/land cover (LULC) data can provide a logical basis for developing ecological and environmental policies to effectively manage ecosystem carbon storage in the future. The study aimed at assessing and predicting dynamics of plantation forest development and ecosystem carbon storage change in coastal Bangladesh over 1988–2041 under three future land management scenarios: business-as-usual (BAU), economic development (ED), and ecological protection-afforestation (EPA) by linking CA-Markov and InVEST models. Findings from LULC change analysis revealed that during 1988–2018, plantation forest increased by 984.9 km2 (68.34%) leading to an overall increase in regional carbon storage, of 3.30 Tg C. Over 2018–2041, plantation forest land could be increased by 249.90, 361.24, and 472.14 km2 under the BAU, ED, and EPA scenarios, respectively, that may potentially increase future carbon storage by 0.64 Tg C, 0.91 Tg C, and 3.77 Tg C, respectively. However, the three future land management scenarios may lead to shortages of regional food supply, of 5.96%, 13.69%, and 11.06% respectively. The suitability maps of different LULC types created in this study could be useful to find out the potential areas of plantation forest development in the future and would provide a scientific basis for further discussion by policymakers on future land use planning, to minimize the trade-offs between food security and climate change adaptation. © 2021 The Author(s)","CA-Markov model; Carbon storage; Ecological protection; InVEST model; Land use scenario; Plantation forest","Climate change; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Economics; Ecosystems; Environmental Protection Agency; Food supply; Markov processes; Reforestation; CA-markov model; Carbon storage; Ecological protection; Ecosystem carbons; Forest development; Forest ecosystem; InVEST model; Land-use scenario; Plantation forests; Storage changes; Land use; carbon cycle; carbon storage; economic development; ecosystem dynamics; forest ecosystem; land classification; land use change; land use planning; plantation forestry; trade-off; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111562722

This study addresses technical, societal, and policy issues for scaling deep decarbonization technologies, describing and extending the analysis presented at a National Academy of Sciences workshop convening modeling, industry, and other experts. Prominent modeling studies estimate that solar and wind electricity generation technologies must be deployed at more than four times their current highest annual rates, and solutions are needed for low-carbon firm generation and energy storage. These studies also show electric vehicle sales needing to increase from 300,000 vehicles per year to annual sales in the tens of millions. Scaling these technologies poses substantive challenges. Other more difficult emissions reductions will need to come from decarbonizing corporate value chains and the heavy industry sector. Negative emissions technologies will compete as mitigation options but scaling these pose substantial resource requirements. Further, decarbonization is not simply an issue of technologies. Reaching net-zero emissions is a transformation of society occurring over decades, not years. The societal aspects of decarbonization involves developing a social compact around the need to decarbonize and benefits that will accrue. Policy elements encompass federal, sub-national, economic, and regulatory approaches. Because technologies, political priorities, and societal opinions will change over this time, consensus-building scientific institutions including the National Academies will enable the independent technical and policy advice needed. © 2021 The Authors.

Major global agendas, such as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Sustainable Development Goals, address ways of developing effective management strategies for tackling such risks. Risk management is increasingly focusing on low probability but high impact events, next to the more traditional attention on expected losses. We focus on urban riverine flood risk across 200 countries for today, 2030, and 2080, and develop a risk-threshold approach for identifying whether a country is exposed to risk of extreme events and, if so, when and how much. Furthermore, we apply a risk-layer approach to delineate the kinds of risk reduction or financing instruments that may be needed to manage emerging risks at the national level. Based on these country-level results, we analyze the macroeconomic consequences of setting up a global fund as one international option for coping with floods today and in the future. An additional macroeconomic analysis of different funding schemes for capitalizing the global fund provides insights into linking national risk management efforts with global efforts to manage risks.

Such an increase has been consistently reported from Europe and North America, and it is, with high confidence, driven by climate change. We investigated how the scientific community in both continents responded to this situation by conducting a comprehensive search of the Scopus database from 1970 to 2020. Studies that investigated interactions between climate change and two prominent bark beetles in Europe and North America, the European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus (ESBB) and the mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae (MPB), were identified. We used several hierarchical search criteria, starting from general aspects of pest – climate change interactions, to studies with clear implications for management and policies. We found that authors investigating the two bark beetle species mentioned climate change in publications beginning in 1998, and have constituted 8.9 and 13.8 % of all studies on ESBB (N = 987) and MPB (N = 1479) recorded in Scopus. However, only part of these studies addressed climate change as a fundamental or integral part of their research design (59.1 % in ESBB and 38.7 % in MPB). We identified 30 studies on ESBB and 50 studies on MPB which informed efforts towards improving bark beetle management strategies to address climate change-affected ecosystem dynamics. Publications on both insects consistently highlighted the importance of vegetation management aiming to reduce the risk and severity of outbreaks and prevent large-scale population expansion. Only a minor portion of studies placed their findings into the context of relevant policies and legislation, and this connection was particularly lacking in studies on MPB. We conclude that research on bark beetle management under climate change has received inadequate attention and it lags behind observed and foreseen global-scale impacts. We suggest that focused and applied research with clear management implications is needed to develop new climate-adapted and evidence-based management strategies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; European spruce bark beetle; Forest management; Forest policy; Mountain pine beetle; Systematic literature review","Climate change; Bark beetle; European spruce bark beetle; Forest pest; Forest policy; High confidence; Ips typographus; Management strategies; Mountain pine beetle; Spruce bark beetles; Systematic literature review; Forestry; Bark; Documents; Forestry; Insects; Management; North America; Picea Abies; Research; Coleoptera; Dendroctonus ponderosae; Hexapoda; Ips typographus; Pinus mugo; Scolytinae; Scopus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113389164

Also, the growing oil demand and carbon emissions have created a huge scope for Electric Vehicle (EV) usage across the world which has resulted in blooming EV market. Photovoltaic (PV) powered EV charging can substantially reduce the carbon foot prints when compared to the conventional utility grid based EV charging. The amalgamation of solar power and EV charging is one of the best methods in sustainable development for EV market. Recent statistics suggest that usage of EVs in different cities in India has proliferated and the development of the charging infrastructure is a big challenge for the densely populated country. Firstly, theoretical demand model and stochastic model for EV traffic and resource utilization pattern is developed. Secondly, the optimal configuration and techno-economic assessment of Solar powered EV Charging Station (EVCS) in microgrid is analyzed for four different Indian cities (Shillong, Bengaluru, Jaipur and Kashmir) with varied solar radiation conditions. Lastly, the environment benefits of solar PV powered EVCS are assessed and analyzed. The results demonstrate that the optimal configuration and investment efficiency in each urban area is greatly affected by the solar irradiation and feed-in-tariff (FIT) price of rooftop solar power.

We present a framework which enables analysis of how different actor strategies (heating up and cooling down) contribute to shape relevance-making in specific political situations when IPCC knowledge is interpreted and used. Drawing on empirical evidence from the reception and use of the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) across three policy making levels, the paper demonstrates different examples of creating policy relevance. First, the paper analyses the origin of SR15 and the failed attempts to formally acknowledge SR15 in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process. Second, it investigates how SR15 has been used to develop and legitimize the EU net-zero target and the European Green Deal. Third, the paper demonstrates how SR15 has been used both for legitimizing and challenging climate policy at the national level, using the example of Norway. In sum, the reception of SR15 demonstrates that while IPCC outputs have resulted in controversy at the international level, they have been highly relevant at regional and national levels. The analysis shows that policy relevance is context-dependent and indirect—created through processes involving many actors, institutions, and types of knowledge. Situating these findings within the larger shift in the international climate regime implied by the Paris Agreement, the paper concludes with a set of empirically grounded recommendations for how the IPCC may approach the goal of policy relevance post-Paris. © 2021, The Author(s).","Climate policy; Cooling down; Heating up; IPCC; Policy relevance; Political situations","Environmental regulations; Climate policy; Cooling down; Heating up; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; National level; Paper analysis; Policy making; Policy relevance; Political situation; Target group; Global warming; environmental policy; global warming; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; policy making; United Nations; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118751210

Between 2013 and 2015, four plots (4.9 × 4.9 m) were annually located on a long-term (1916−2016), moderately stocked pasture at the Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory (USDA-ARS) near Mandan, North Dakota. All plots were located on loamy ecological with minimal microsite differences. Each site had areas that were visually observed to have the largest vegetative component dominated by either Kentucky bluegrass (KBG) or dominated by other species (CONT). Two 1/8 m2 quadrats were clipped by species, including detached plant material (litter), within each subplot between mid to late July 2013, 2014, and 2015. This period represents peak biomass production and offers the best opportunity to capture cool- and warm-season perennial species. In 2013, soil samples were taken at depths of 0−5, 5−10, and 10−20 cm within each plot and thatch samples were hand excavated after clipping. Carbon and N were determined on biomass, litter, thatch, and soil samples. KBG plots produced 28% more biomass annually than the CONT plots. In 2014 and 2015, species richness was 0.7−2.1 × greater in the CONT plots. Although N and C concentrations were similar between treatments for aboveground biomass, litter, and thatch when expressed on a g m−2 basis, N was 34% greater for aboveground biomass and 600% greater for litter in KBG plots. Soil organic C and total soil N at 0−5 cm were 26% and 22% greater in KBG plots, respectively. Our findings indicate that KBG plots had less diversity and greater aboveground and belowground N and C than CONT. More follow-on research is needed to understand how C and N stocks and dynamics influence Kentucky bluegrass invasion. © 2021","conceptual model; invasive grass; Kentucky bluegrass thatch; litter; Poa pratensis L","aboveground biomass; biological invasion; economic diversification; grass; rangeland; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; species diversity; species richness; Great Plains; Kentucky; Mandan; North Dakota; North Dakota; United States; Matthiola; Poa pratensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112558545

As not all customers tend to buy green products, several customer groups should be considered in terms of need type. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, a multi-objective hub location problem is developed for designing a sustainable supply chain network based on customer segmentation. It deals with the aspects of economic (cost reduction), environment (minimizing greenhouse gas emissions by the transport sector) and social responsibility (creating employment and community development). The epsilon-constraint method and augmented epsilon-constraint (AEC) method are used to solve the small-sized instances of this multi-objective problem. Due to the non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness of this problem, two non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (MOGWO) metaheuristic algorithms are also applied to tackle the large-sized instances of this problem. Findings: As expected, the AEC method is able to provide better Pareto solutions according to the goals of the decision-makers. The Taguchi method was used for setting the parameters of the two metaheuristic algorithms. Considering the meaningful difference, the MOGWO algorithm outperforms the NSGA-II algorithm according to the rate of achievement to two objectives simultaneously and the spread of non-dominance solutions indexes. Regarding the other indexes, there was no meaningful difference between the performance of the two algorithms. Practical implications: The model of this research provides a comprehensive solution for supply chain companies that want to achieve a rational balance between the three aspects of sustainability. Originality/value: The importance of considering customer diversity on the one hand and saving on hub transportation costs, on the other hand, triggered us to propose a hub location model for designing a sustainable supply chain network based on customer segmentation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Augmented epsilon-constraint (AEC); MOGWO; Multi-objective model; NSGA-II; Supply chain; Sustainable hub location","Cost reduction; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Location; NP-hard; Polynomial approximation; Sales; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Taguchi methods; Design/methodology/approach; Environmental pollutions; Epsilon-constraint method; Meta heuristic algorithm; Multi-objective problem; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Social responsibilities; Sustainable supply chains; Genetic algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098449186

To replace conventional vehicles, EVs must be able to deliver a similar level of comfort on long-distance travel. A key enabler here is an adequate charging infrastructure (CI). In this paper, we evaluate the current CI in Germany, a leading adopter of EVs in Europe. The goal of this evaluation is to understand where innovations and investments need to take place such that overall costs are minimized while user comfort is maximized. We perform this evaluation by analysing travel duration for five typical EVs on 60 routes through Germany. We include non-linear, state-of-charge-dependent charging power as well the non-linear velocity-dependent energy consumption. EVs are modelled after five typically used vehicles in Germany and charging stations are based on real-world data taken from the federal registry. This level of detail in modelling allows for representative results. In our sample, travel time is ∼8% longer when charging compared to non-stop driving. The delay strongly depends on route distance where many routes with <300 km length can be driven non-stop while some extreme cases through areas with unsuitable infrastructure result in 30% more driving time. The necessary breaks were in line with recommendations for truck drivers in Germany. To understand the impact of key technical data we perform a sensitivity analysis. The most relevant factors are start state of charge (SOC) since a low SOC means that typically an additional stop is necessary, often at unfavourable locations.

This study selected benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) as model to reveal the responses of anaerobic digestion of WAS to long-term stress of BACs. Results showed that the solubilization enhancement of WAS contributed by BACs was the acceleration of cell lysis, rather than the disruption of extracellular polymeric substances, and the accumulation improvement of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) attributed to hydrolysis improvement and methanogenesis inhibition at either medium -or high level of BACs. In addition, a low level had no significant effect on the production of methane compared to control, with averages of 0.059 and 0.055 m3/(m3·d), respectively, whereas a medium level reduced methane production to 20% of control, and a high level almost completely inhibited methanogenesis. Correspondingly, BACs could shift microbial communities related to SCFAs and methane productions. For the bacterial community, a high level of BACs led to abundance reductions of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi, but Synergistetes was increased to 10.5%, which was almost not detected either in control or at a low level of BACs. And for dominant archaeal community, they tended to be shifted from acetotrophic to hydrogenotrophic methanogens with BACs increasing from low to high level. These findings provided some new insights for the role of BACs in anaerobic digestion, as well as resource recovery from WAS. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic digestion; Benzalkonium chlorides; Extracellular polymeric substances; Microbial community structure; Waste activated sludge","Anaerobic digestion; Fatty acids; Methane; Microorganisms; Sludge digestion; Anaerobics; Benzalkonium chloride; Extracellular; Extracellular polymeric substance; Long-term stress; Microbial communities; Microbial community structures; Polymeric substance; Shorter chains; Waste activated sludges; Chlorine compounds; activated sludge; anaerobic digestion; chloride; community structure; environmental stress; fatty acid; methanogenesis; microbial community; polymer; waste; Acidobacteria; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; Chloroflexi; Firmicutes; benzalkonium; chloride; methane; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; microflora; sewage; Anaerobiosis; Benzalkonium Compounds; Bioreactors; Chlorides; Extracellular Polymeric Substance Matrix; Methane; Microbiota; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110123851

Given it strategic importance, there is no shortage of research studies on sustainable building retrofit globally in particular the retrofit measures and technologies for different types of buildings. Despite that, sustainable building retrofit is climate and location specific, and decision-makers are still facing challenges to identify an optimum set of retrofit measures for different climatic conditions according to the trade-off between energy saving and retrofit cost. One reason for that is because of the lack of available information especially those related to the cost of sustainable building retrofit measures. This study aims to develop an integrated energy-cost model for selecting the optimal retrofit solutions for existing high-rise residential buildings in various climatic zones in China. Based on in-depth literature review and analysis of published reports, different alternative retrofit measures for wall, window, shading system, heating and cooling systems, and renewable energy technologies for buildings in different climate zones of China are identified. The retrofit costs related to the identified sustainable building retrofit measures are analyzed by referring to the local renovation techniques and cost in each zone through developing a set of equations. A total 28 practical sustainable building retrofit measures along with a set of retrofit options are identified. A deterministic decision framework is developed to facilitate decision-makers achieving a specific energy saving target and evaluating the associated costs based on the identified retrofit measures for high-rise residential buildings in the studied climatic zones. The practical implications of the deterministic decision framework are examined through the prototype buildings in climatic zones being studies. The findings not only actively support the selection of cost-effective sustainable retrofit measures for high-rise residential buildings in China, but the methodological framework and its implications are also equally applicable to other countries with diverse climatic characteristics and standards of living. © 2021","Climate zones; Energy-cost model; High-rise residential building; Retrofit measures; Sustainable retrofit","Climate models; Cooling systems; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Housing; Intelligent buildings; Sustainable development; Tall buildings; Thermoelectric equipment; Building retrofits; Climate zone; Climatic zone; Cost modelling; Energy cost; Energy-cost model; High rise residential building; Retrofit measure; Sustainable building; Sustainable retrofit; Retrofitting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112524609

Considering the diversified pollution, regional heterogeneity and strong government intervention in China, this article investigates EKC's heterogeneity in a panel of 290 cities from 2001 to 2018. Through the investigation of the lag effect and spatial spillover effect of pollution emissions, the heterogeneity of EKC is examined among different pollutants and different regions. Moreover, such heterogeneity pattern also exists between pilot cities and non-pilot cities of three environmental policies (‘pollution rights trading (PRT)’, ‘low-carbon city’ and ‘SO2 emission trading’). The results show that different curve shapes and turning points are associated with EKC heterogeneity. Three regulations are considered effective to strike a balance between urban emission reduction and long-term economic growth. Pollution rights’ trading could contribute to the earlier ‘decoupling’ between urban pollution (both industrial pollution and haze pollution) and economic growth in the pilot cities significantly. The implementation of the ‘low-carbon city’ and ‘SO2 emission trading’ are considered conducive to reducing the emissions of industrial SO2, with the former also resulting in fewer industrial smog emissions. The main contributions of this study are to identify both the temporal and spatial effects of pollution, develop the multidimensional analysis framework on the heterogeneity of EKC and investigate the dual effects of institutional power upon EKC as well as EKC heterogeneity. The implications, nevertheless, are considered as 1) the coordinated environment prevention and control between different regions and 2) the strict inspection of existing policy implementation by respecting each of their heterogeneous effects between regions. © 2021","Chinese cities; Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC); Haze pollution; Heterogeneity; Industrial pollution","Carbon; Commerce; Environmental protection; Urban growth; Chinese cities; Emissions Trading; Environmental kuznet curve; Environmental Kuznet's curve; Haze pollutions; Heterogeneity; Industrial pollution; Low-carbon cities; Pilot city; SO$-2$; Emission control; emission control; environmental degradation; environmental economics; environmental policy; heterogeneity; Kuznets curve; policy implementation; trade-environment relations; urban politics; urban pollution; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113436177

However, red emitters generally demonstrated severe non-radiative emission due to energy gap law, and the development of efficient deep-red and near-infrared thermally activated delayed fluorescence (DR/NIR-TADF) materials was still under-researched by now. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of efficient red/DR TADF emitters. Their emission wavelengths were rationally regulated into DR region via introducing strong electron-withdrawing groups from pyridinyl (PY) to trifluoromethyl (CF3) and to cyano (CN). The internal conversion (IC) process of these emitters was suppressed greatly via the incorporation of fused polycyclic aromatics (dibenzo[a,c]phenazine). Furthermore, the structural relaxation of their excited states was also reduced due to the restricted σ bond rotation between donor (D) and acceptor (A) units. As a result, these red/DR emitters showed high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and excellent electrofluorescence performance. Particularly, OLEDs based on CN-TPA showed remarkably high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 22.80% at 668 nm, 18.41% at 688 nm and 15.05% at 698 nm, which were among the best values for reported TADF emitters. This result may provide a straightforward design strategy for efficient DR/NIR TADFs through optimizing the acceptor strength of rigidified polyaromatic frameworks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Acceptor strength; DR/NIR TADF emitter; Fused polycyclic aromatics; OLED; Rigid skeleton","Aromatization; Fluorescence; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED); Quantum efficiency; Acceptor strength; DR/NIR TADF emitter; Fused polycyclic aromatic; Lightemitting diode; Near Infrared; Near-infrared; Night vision; Organic light-emitting; Polycyclic aromatics; Rigid skeleton; Infrared devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110263249

When process air or oxygen is supplied, the MBfR is known as the membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR), which has high oxygen transfer rate and efficiency, promoting microbial growth and activity within the biofilm. Over the past few decades, laboratory-scale studies have helped researchers and practitioners understand the relevance of influencing factors and biological transformations in MABRs. In recent years, pilot- to full-scale installations are increasing along with process modeling. The resulting accumulated knowledge has greatly improved understanding of the counter-diffusional biological process, with new challenges and opportunities arising. Therefore, it is crucial to provide new insights by conducting this review. This paper reviews wastewater treatment advancements using MABR technology, including design and operational considerations, microbial community ecology, and process modeling. Treatment performance of pilot- to full-scale MABRs for process intensification in existing facilities is assessed. This paper also reviews other emerging applications of MABRs, including sulfur recovery, industrial wastewater, and xenobiotics bioremediation, space-based wastewater treatment, and autotrophic nitrogen removal. In conclusion, commercial applications demonstrate that MABR technology is beneficial for pollutants (COD, N, P, xenobiotics) removal, resource recovery (e.g., sulfur), and N2O mitigation. Further research is needed to increase packing density while retaining efficient external mass transfer, understand the microbial interactions occurring, address existing assumptions to improve process modeling and control, and optimize the operational conditions with site-specific considerations. © 2021 The Authors","Commercial application; Counter-diffusional biofilm; Membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR); Modeling; Nutrient removal; Wastewater treatment","Biochemistry; Biofilms; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Bioremediation; Industrial water treatment; Mass transfer; Nitrogen removal; Oxygen; Process engineering; Sulfur; Biofilm reactor; Biofilm reactor technology; Commercial applications; Counter-diffusional biofilm; Membrane aerated biofilm reactor; Membrane biofilm reactor; Modeling; Nutrient removal; Process-models; Recent progress; Wastewater treatment; carbon; nitrogen; nitrogen dioxide; oxygen; sulfur; xenobiotic agent; aeration; biofilm; design method; electron; membrane; wastewater treatment; activated sludge; aeration; Article; autotrophy; biofilm; bioreactor design; bioremediation; chemical oxygen demand; community ecology; community structure; concentration (parameter); denitrification; filtration efficiency; flow kinetics; industrial waste; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbial interaction; nonhuman; oxygenation; pollution transport; process design; process model; process optimization; reaction analysis; recycling; space research; species diversity; thickness; waste component removal; waste water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120527176

The flowering phenology of S. vernalis has significantly advanced by 11.8 days/°C and 27.8 days/°C increase in Tmax and Tmin respectively, indicating that the climate warming has led to substantial shifts in flowering phenology of the model plant species. We also observed a strong association of seasonal Tmax (December–February) and DTR on the early onset of spring flowering, however precipitation had no significant effect on the timing of flowering. The greenhouse experiment results further supported a significant effect of temperature in triggering the phenological shifts, wherein the model plant grown under different temperature treatments flowered 9–20 days earlier compared to the control. Our study showcases the integrated use of multiple methodological approaches for unravelling the long-term phenological shifts in response to climate change, and contributes in filling the knowledge gaps in the phenological research from the developing world in general and the Himalaya in particular. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Flowering; Kashmir Himalaya; Phenology; Sternbergia vernalis","Climate models; Developing countries; Plants (botany); Developing world; Experimental evidence; Flowering; Flowering phenology; Kashmir himalayum; Methodological approach; Plant phenology; Plant species; Sternbergium vernali; Climate change; angiosperm; climate change; decadal variation; experimental study; flowering; historical record; phenology; Amaryllidaceae; Article; climate change; climate warming; controlled study; environmental change; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; flowering; greenhouse; nonhuman; phenology; precipitation; seasonal variation; spring; Sternbergia vernalis; flower; reproduction; season; temperature; Himalayas; India; Jammu and Kashmir; Sternbergia; Climate Change; Flowers; Reproduction; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109210814

While our knowledge of livestock greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation has evolved, the prevailing focus has been—somewhat myopically—on technology applications associated with mitigation. Here, we (1) examine the global distribution of livestock GHG emissions, (2) explore social, economic and environmental co-benefits and trade-offs associated with mitigation interventions and (3) critique approaches for quantifying GHG emissions. This review uncovered many insights. First, while GHG emissions from ruminant livestock are greatest in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC; globally, 66% of emissions are produced by Latin America and the Caribbean, East and southeast Asia and south Asia), the majority of mitigation strategies are designed for developed countries. This serious concern is heightened by the fact that 80% of growth in global meat production over the next decade will occur in LMIC. Second, few studies concurrently assess social, economic and environmental aspects of mitigation. Of the 54 interventions reviewed, only 16 had triple-bottom line benefit with medium–high mitigation potential. Third, while efforts designed to stimulate the adoption of strategies allowing both emissions reduction (ER) and carbon sequestration (CS) would achieve the greatest net emissions mitigation, CS measures have greater potential mitigation and co-benefits. The scientific community must shift attention away from the prevailing myopic lens on carbon, towards more holistic, systems-based, multi-metric approaches that carefully consider the raison d'être for livestock systems. Consequential life cycle assessments and systems-aligned ‘socio-economic planetary boundaries’ offer useful starting points that may uncover leverage points and cross-scale emergent properties. The derivation of harmonized, globally reconciled sustainability metrics requires iterative dialogue between stakeholders at all levels. Greater emphasis on the simultaneous characterization of multiple sustainability dimensions would help avoid situations where progress made in one area causes maladaptive outcomes in other areas. © 2021 The Authors.

The fully sampled and velocity-resolved [C ii] images have 0.55 pc spatial and 1 km s-1 velocity resolutions. We find that Sgr B extends as a coherent structure spanning some 34 pc along the Galactic plane. Bright [C ii] emission encompasses Sgr B1 (G0.5-0.0) and the G 0.6-0.0 H ii region and passes behind and beyond the luminous star-forming cores toward Sgr B2 (G0.7-0.0). Sgr B is a major contributor to the entire Galactic center's [C ii] luminosity, with surface brightness comparable to [C ii] from the Arches region. [C ii], 70 μm, and 20 cm emissions share nearly identical spatial distributions. Combined with the lack of [C ii] self-absorption, this indicates that these probes trace UV on the near surfaces of more extended clouds visible in CO isotopologues and 160 μm continuum. Stars from regions of local star formation likely dominate the UV field. Photodissociation regions and H ii regions contribute similar amounts of [C ii] flux. The extreme star formation cores of Sgr B2 contribute negligible amounts to the total [C ii] intensity from the Sgr B region. Velocity fields and association with a narrow dust lane indicate that they may have been produced in a local cloud-cloud collision. The cores are likely local analogs of the intense star formation regions where ideas to explain the ""C+ deficit""in ultraluminous galaxies can be tested. © 2021. The American Astronomical Society.

The intense light and often hot environments in tropical regions present some of the greatest challenges for the bryophyte photosynthetic activities. It is critical for us to understand how bryophytes respond to the changing temperatures and light intensities to help predict responses of non-vascular plants to climate change scenarios. To this end, a controlled study was conducted to explore the effects of different temperature increases and light levels on the chlorophyll a/b ratio, health status, effective photochemical quantum yield of PS II and growth of bryophytes species, Hypnum plumaeforme, Brachythecium buchananii, Thuidium glaucinoides, Anomobryum julaceum, Pterobryopsis crassicaulis and Pseudosymblepharis angustata. Chlorophyll a/b ratios varied widely and ranged from 1.0 to 3.0. Chlorophyll a/b ratio was not an ideal indicator of shade plant for the examined species. Physiologically these bryophytes were well-acclimated to the temperature of their habitats during the growing season. Temperature increases of 1.5 and 3 °C had a significantly negative effect on the health status, photosynthetic performance and growth of the selected bryophytes. Excess and low photosynthetically active radiations (PARs) harmed their photochemical efficiency and growth. Vegetation growth carryover (VGC) may explain the subsequent growth of the six bryophyte species under environmental stress. However, prolonged periods of warming and excess/low PARs led to relatively poor thallus health and negative net photosynthetic rates that finally resulted in mortality. © 2021 The Authors","Bryophyte; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Climate change; Ecophysiology; Photochemical quantum yield; Photosystem II",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116657044

However, one challenge for these materials is their insufficient long-term stability in the acid environment. Herein, we systematically investigate both catalytic activity toward ORR and stability under acid conditions using density functional theory (DFT). Various local atomic structures around the MNx site and different metal atoms (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ru) are considered in this study to understand the relation between atomic structures, stability, and catalytic activity. The stability of the M−N−C catalyst is considered from the propensity of the metal atom center to dissolve from the carbon host structure. The calculations reveal that the considered MNx sites are thermodynamically unstable in acid ORR conditions. However, based on the calculated thermodynamic driving force toward the metal dissolution, the MN4 sites with Fe, Co, Ni, and Ru metal atoms embedded on the graphene plane and at the graphene edge are more stable in the acid ORR condition than the other considered MNx structures. Combining the stability and catalytic activity descriptor, we propose some acid-stable and active MNx structures toward ORR. This computational study provides helpful guidance for the rational modification of the carbon matrix hosting MNx moieties and the appropriate selection of a metal atom for optimizing the activity and stability toward the ORR reaction. © 2021 American Chemical Society","Carbon; Density functional theory; Dissolution; Oxygen reduction reaction; Single-atom catalyst; Stability","Atoms; Catalyst activity; Computation theory; Coordination reactions; Dissolution; Electrolytic reduction; Graphene; Metals; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Stability; Carbon catalysts; Condition; Density-functional-theory; Metal atoms; Nitrogen-carbon; Oxygen reduction reaction; Single-atom catalyst; Single-atoms; Stable metals; ]+ catalyst; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118127016

In this study, we investigated the relationship between the promotion of different CSA practices across four climate-smart villages (CSVs) in Myanmar. To determine the impact of the CSA practices on livelihoods and health, survey data were collected from agricultural households (n = 527) over three years. Within the time period studied, the results indicate that some the CSA practices and technologies adopted were significantly associated with changes in household dietary diversity scores (HDDS), but, in the short-term, these were not associated with improvements in the households’ food insecurity scores (HFIAS). Based on the survey responses, we examined how pathways of CSA practice adoption tailored to different contexts of Myanmar’s four agroecologies could contribute to the observed changes, including possible resulting trade-offs. We highlight that understanding the impacts of CSA adoption on household food security in CSVs will require longer-term monitoring, as most CSA options are medium- to long-cycle interventions. Our further analysis of knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) amongst the households indicated a poor understanding of the household knowledge, attitudes and practices in relation to nutrition, food choices, food preparation, sanitation and hygiene. Our KAP findings indicate that current nutrition education interventions in the Myanmar CSVs are inadequate and will need further improvement for health and nutrition outcomes from the portfolio of CSA interventions. © 2021 by the authors.

However, while drylands are known for their contribution to inter-annual atmospheric CO2 variability, they are sometimes overlooked in discussions of global carbon stocks. Here, in preparation for the November 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), we review dryland systems with emphasis on their role in current and future carbon storage, response to climate change and potential to contribute to a carbon neutral future. Current estimates of carbon in dryland soils and vegetation suggest they are significant at global scale, containing approximately 30% of global carbon in above and below-ground biomass, and surface-layer soil carbon (top 30 cm). As ecosystems that are limited by water, the drylands are vulnerable to climate change. Climate change impacts are, however, dependent on future trends in rainfall that include both drying and wetting trends at regional scales. Regional rainfall trends will initiate trends in dryland productivity, vegetation structure and soil carbon storage. However, while management of fire and herbivory can contribute to increased carbon sequestration, impacts are dependent on locally unique ecosystem responses and climate-soil-plant interactions. Similarly, while community based agroforestry initiatives have been successful in some areas, large-scale afforestation programs are logistically infeasible and sometimes ecologically inappropriate at larger scales. As climate changes, top-down prescriptive measures designed to increase carbon storage should be avoided in favour of locally-adapted approaches that balance carbon management priorities with local livelihoods, ecosystem function, biodiversity and cultural, social and economic priorities. © Copyright © 2021 Hanan, Milne, Aynekulu, Yu and Anchang.","carbon cycle; climate change; drylands; soil carbon (C) sequestration; vegetation carbon",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119505598

Because of global climate change and human activities, many lakes worldwide are facing severe challenges, such as ecological degradation and reductions in their water storage, levels, surface areas, and quality. Water diversion into lakes is considered an effective measure to address these challenges and has attracted much attention. Water has been diverted into Lake Ulansuhai through drainage channels from the Yellow River since 2013. This shallow lake is located in arid northern China and is greatly affected by high salinity and eutrophication. The lake is the lowest area in the Hetao basin and is a sink for terrestrial water in this region. High salinity in lake water, drainage channels, and groundwater caused by NaCl is an ongoing problem; however, water diversion has played an important role in dilution. The main hydrochemical type in the lake water is Cl·HCO3 –Na·Mg, while those in the drainage channels and the groundwater show more diversity because of spatial differences. The main source of water in the lake (52–60%) is that diverted through six drainage channels on the west bank, followed by meteoric precipitation (36–38%). Groundwater recharge to the lake is minimal (west bank: 2–7%, and east bank: 1–5%). Extensive evaporation occurs in the lake before the lake water is discharged into the Yellow River through a waste canal. The hydrochemical evolution and salinization of the lake are dominated by the six drainage channels, followed by evaporation from the lake surface. Thus, resolution of soil salinization in the Hetao irrigation area is key to addressing salinity issues in the lake.

It is important to master the spatiotemporal characteristics and driving factors of carbon emissions to achieve the goal of carbon emission reduction. Previous studies on carbon emissions mainly focused on the numerical changes in regional carbon emissions. There have been few studies on spatiotemporal characteristics, making it difficult to formulate carbon emission reduction strategies according to local conditions. This study is based on the carbon emission calculation method proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), taking the method of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), standard deviation ellipse (SDE) analysis and the geographically weighted regression model (GWR) to analyse the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and determinants and dividing regional types of carbon emissions. The results show that aggregate carbon emissions and other carbon emission indicators presented an upward trend from 2000 to 2016, and the growth momentum of carbon emissions was difficult to curb in the short term. The carbon emissions of the study area are relatively concentrated in spatial; the direction of carbon emissions presented a trend of “northeast–southwest”, and the main axis and centre of carbon emissions tend to move northward over time. There are six regional types of carbon emissions in the study area. The low total amount–low intensity–low pressure type (L-L-L) became the dominant regional type of carbon emissions. The results of the GWR model showed that the degree of influence of explanatory variables on carbon emissions in descending order is urbanization rate > industrial structure > population > population density > per capita GDP. © 2021 The Authors","Carbon emissions; Driving factors; Energy-enriched area; Regional types; Spatiotemporal evolution","Carbon; Climate change; Climate models; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Carbon emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Driving factors; Energy; Energy-enriched area; Geographically Weighted Regression modelling; Regional type; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Spatiotemporal evolution; Study areas; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118541935

However, little is known about how BSRs generalize to continental scales or how climate interacts with structure to drive local patterns in plant diversity. Resolving these research gaps in macrosystems ecology will strengthen our understanding of the biogeography of plant diversity, with implications for global-scale biodiversity mapping. Location: USA. Time period: Contemporary. Major taxa studied: Vascular plants and trees. Methods: We combined climate variables with field measurements and airborne lidar from all forest and woodland plots in the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) to characterize the role of climate in constraining BSRs across the United States. Spatial generalized linear mixed models were used to quantify the individual and joint effects of structure and climate on vascular plant and tree diversity. Results: These findings provide evidence for broad-scale BSRs across the USA; namely, between plant/tree diversity and forest structural metrics in the vertical and horizontal planes. Vascular plant diversity was positively related to horizontally heterogeneous and bottom-skewed canopies, whereas tree diversity was positively associated with canopy cover and structural heterogeneity. In addition, climate variables related to stress (negatively), energy (positively) and seasonality (negatively) affected broad-scale patterns in diversity, with water availability (but not temperature) exerting significant effects on structural conditions. Importantly, climate and structure interact to explain variance in BSRs along coldness, mean temperature and evapotranspiration gradients. Main conclusions: Our findings reinforce the importance of local context dependence in assessing non-stationary biogeographical patterns in forest biodiversity, as well as the unique ways that forest structure and climate interact to constrain plant diversity. Beyond these theoretical insights, this study provides an empirical foundation for generalizing remotely sensed estimates of climate and forest structure to model biodiversity over vast extents. © 2021 The Authors.

One approach is to fertilize forest land, but this can influence greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes within the ecosystem. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of forest N fertilization on soil CH4 and N2O fluxes in young Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands in southern Sweden. The gas fluxes were measured using flow-through non-steady-state dark chambers. In the first, long-term, experiment, half of the stand was fertilized twice (once in 2014 and once in 2016) with 150 kg ha−1 of N, and gas flux measurements were taken throughout 2014–2017. In the second, dose, experiment, 0, 150, 300, or 450 kg ha−1 of N was added to the stand in April 2016, and gas flux measurements were taken during April-December 2016. The dose experiment showed that the sink strength of CH4 decreased with increasing amounts of N; the long-term experiment indicated that repeated fertilization decreased the CH4 sink strength over time. Additionally, the long-term experiment indicated that, while significantly higher N2O emissions were recorded in the fertilization years, this was not detected in subsequent years, suggesting the effect to be short-lived. In the dose experiment, fertilization tended to increase the N2O emissions relative to the amount of fertilizer. However, despite the significant effects of fertilization on these GHGs, the summed fluxes were a fraction of the net uptake of C at the sites, as recorded in another study. These findings suggest that fertilizing forest land with commercial NP or NPK fertilizers corresponding to 150 kg ha−1 of N, the level used in operational forestry in Sweden today, can be conducted without changing CH4 and N2O fluxes to any great extent. © 2021 The Authors","Climate change mitigation; Forest management; GHG; Nitrogen availability","Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen fertilizers; Plants (botany); CH$-4$; Climate change mitigation; Fertilisation; Flux measurements; Forestlands; Gas flux; Greenhouses gas; Long-term experiments; N$-2$/O; Nitrogen availability; Forestry; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; coniferous tree; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; stand structure; Dosage; Fertilization; Forestry; Greenhouse Gases; Picea Abies; Sweden; Sweden; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112361101

In particular, the apparent insensitivity of soil respiration to emerging combined extreme events of heatwave and drought makes terrestrial ecosystems likely to shift from being carbon sinks to sources. Limited understanding of the interactions underlying this response represents one of the key sources of uncertainty in forecasts of atmospheric CO2. Here, we explore plant–microbe–soil interactions under heat and drought using a millifluidic setup that enables direct observations of hydration and oxygen content (the primary factors controlling soil respiration) in the root zone. Our observations reveal movement of water between soil regions via roots (termed root hydraulic redistribution), creating soil respiration hotspots and becoming a carbon source under combined heat and drought. © 2021 The Author(s)","Combined extremes; Hydraulic redistribution; Roots; Soil CO2 efflux; Soil respiration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111038497

With the global goal of building a climate-resilient future, strategies towards a greener manufacturing of ferrite magnets are of great interest. A new ceramic processing route for obtaining dense Sr-ferrite sintered magnets is presented here. Instead of the usual sintering process employed nowadays in ferrite magnet manufacturing that demands long dwell times, a shorter two-step sintering is designed to densify the ferrite ceramics. As a result of these processes, dense SrFe12O19 ceramic magnets with properties comparable to state-of-the-art ferrite magnets are obtained. In particular, the SrFe12O19 magnet containing 0.2% PVA and 0.6% wt SiO2 reaches a coercivity of 164 kA/m along with a 93% relative density. A reduction of 31% in energy consumption is achieved in the thermal treatment with respect to conventional sintering, which could lead to energy savings for the industry of the order of 7.109 kWh per year. © 2021","Ferrites; Hard-soft composites; Magnetic properties; Permanent magnets; Sintering","Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Ferrite; Iron compounds; Magnetic properties; Permanent magnets; Rare earths; Silica; Strontium compounds; Annual production; Ceramic processing; Ferrite magnet; Future strategy; Green manufacturing; Green processing; Hard-soft composites; Property; Rare-earths; Two-step sintering; Sintering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112572602

The XPS analyses revealed that the co-presence of ZnO and Al2O3 into the Cu-based catalyst stabilize the CuO crystalline structure and introduce basic sites on the ternary as-synthesized catalyst. In contrast, the as-prepared CuZn-and Cu-based materials contain a higher amount of superficial Cu0 and Cu1+ species. The CuZnAl-catalyst exhibited enhanced catalytic performance for the CO and H2 production, reaching a Faradaic efficiency (FE) towards syngas of almost 95% at −0.89 V vs. RHE and a remarkable current density of up to 90 mA cm−2 for the CO2 reduction at −2.4 V vs. RHE. The physico-chemical characterizations confirmed that the pyramidal mesoporous structure of this material, which is constituted by a high pore volume and small CuO crystals, plays a fundamental role in its low diffusional mass-transfer resistance. The CO-productivity on the CuZnAl-catalyst increased at more negative applied potentials, leading to the production of syngas with a tunable H2/CO ratio (from 2 to 7), depending on the applied potential. These results pave the way to substitute state-of-the-art noble metals (e.g., Ag, Au) with this abundant and cost-effective catalyst to produce syngas. Moreover, the post-reaction analyses demonstrated the stabilization of Cu2O species, avoiding its complete reduction to Cu0 under the CO2 electroreduction conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

This is crucial in order to meet environmental requirements aiming at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. In some countries (e.g., Poland) reduction of air pollution is also an important reason behind the implementation of low/zero emission UPT. The aim of this study is to investigate the factors and mechanisms influencing the development of modern electromobility in Polish UPT. We have examined all 242 UPT systems in the country in terms of the characteristics of the relevant urban municipalities, such as size, economic prosperity, level of human and social capital, development paths of urban public transport in the long term as well as the institutional context and proximity and connections to other cities with experience in electromobility. Classification and statistical methods are used based on a vari-ety of approaches, as assigning a score to various preliminarily identified indicators or applying correlation between quantities to verify the formulated hypotheses. Our analysis demonstrates that electromobility adoption is the result of a combination of favourable economic, urban, social and technological characteristic features of a given city. Zero or low emission buses are more common in large cities which are highly positioned in urban hierarchy, economically sound and which are characterized by a well‐developed tertiary economy as well as by high human capital. An addi-tional factor that positively influences the implementation of electromobility—in particular at the very first stage—is proximity to the location of low emission bus producers. The leadership in modern electromobility can be understood as part of a broader, proactive development policy of the cities aimed at improving the quality of life of their residents. This is especially important in medium‐sized towns where utilizing electric vehicles can be an instrument to maintain or even develop their role and status. The results of the article may provide a basis for creating sustainable urban policies, especially sustainable mobility and improving environmental quality. © 2021 by the authors.

The PE was pyrolysed to produce a hydrocarbon wax that was subsequently oxidised to produce a mixture of fatty acids, purified, and used as a PHA substrate for the growth and selection of microorganisms. Based on the shaken flask screening, a production strain, i.e., Pseudomonas putida KT2440, was selected for conducting bioreactor studies. Feeding PE-derived fatty acids in a 20-L setup resulted in high mcl-PHA yields (83.0 g L−1 CDW with 65% PHA in 25 h). Furthermore, life-cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to determine the environmental advantages of the proposed process and its impacts compared to those of other technologies for treating PE-derived waste streams. We conclude that processing waste PE into PHA, rather than incineration, produces biodegradable material while also reducing the additional emissions that arise from traditional PE waste treatment processes, such as incineration to gain energy. © 2021 The Authors","Bioconversion; Fermentation; High cell density; Polyethylene; Polyhydroxyalkanoate; Pseudomonas putida","Bioconversion; Biomass; Bioreactors; Effluents; Environmental technology; Fatty acids; Fermentation; Life cycle; Mixtures; Polyethylenes; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Biodegradable plastics; Biotechnological approaches; Chains length; Fatty acid mixture; High cell density; Higher yield; Optimisations; Polyethene; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Pseudomonas putida; Bacteria; biodegradable plastic; fatty acid; hydrocarbon; polyethylene; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; polyethylene; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; bacterium; biodegradation; biotechnology; fatty acid; fermentation; growth response; hydrocarbon; optimization; polymer; purification; substrate; wax; Article; bacterial growth; bacterium culture; bioaccumulation; biomass; biotechnological procedures; biotransformation; controlled study; environmental factor; environmental impact; fed batch fermentation; feeding; incineration; life cycle assessment; microbial community; nonhuman; oxidation; process optimization; Pseudomonas putida; pyrolysis; waste management; biotechnology; Pseudomonas putida; Pseudomonas putida; Pseudomonas putida KT2440; Biodegradable Plastics; Biotechnology; Polyethylene; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Pseudomonas putida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113935205

Nevertheless, molecular systems with these properties are scarce because most of them suffer from aggregation caused quenching emission (ACQ). One approach to address this shortcoming is by inhibiting the molecular motions/vibrations by employing a fixed matrix as afforded by a metal-organic framework (MOF). There, the organic chromophores are confined in a crystalline framework, and the structure-property relationship can be designed to get RTP/TADF. Inspired by this, the present work explores the relationship between the linker arrangement and the physicochemical properties of two isochemical MOFs with different crystalline structures. The denser MOF exhibits a long-lived green RTP due to a hyperfine coupling of the linkers. On the other hand, the more porous MOF presents a long-lived temperature-dependent turquoise emission, reflecting the influence of the TADF. Hence, this study provides a huge advance about the potential of MOFs to undergo RTP and TADF emission, and at the same time, demonstrates their potential applicability in a wide range of photonic technologies, including physical and chemical sensing and the first example of a MOF-LED based on RTP-MOFs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Chemical sensors; Chromophores; Fluorescence; Lighting; Organic polymers; Organometallics; Physicochemical properties; Emissive materials; Material-based; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Molecular motions; Molecular systems; Property; Room temperature phosphorescence; Sensor securities; Solid state lighting; Thermally activated delayed fluorescences; Crystalline materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119854256

From a technical point of view, essential components have an operational life span of more than 20 years and allow for an extended operation. However, a profitable extension would require suitable follow-up concepts and depends on the underlying plant-specific setup, the regional conditions, as well as the regulatory and economic framework. Based on an expert evaluation, four promising follow-up concepts were identified in a multistage process consisting of expert interviews, workshops, and an online survey. These follow-up concepts are “Basic flexibilization,” “Substrate change,” “Seasonal flexibilization,” and “Biomethane upgrading.” They were assessed with a plant-specific biogas repowering model for a heterogeneous data set of 2,508 BGPs and were compared in three scenario frameworks to derive robust development paths. To capture the heterogeneity of the existing BGPs in Germany, the model was developed further regarding regional parameters such as power output, substrate mix, and emission factors. Across all the scenarios, “Seasonal flexibilization” proves to be the most promising follow-up concept for more than 50% of the BGPs. This is followed by “Substrate change,” which is particularly suitable for larger BGPs with high shares of energy crops and no heat utilization. Biomethane upgrading is usually the second choice compared to participation in extended public support schemes for electricity production. However, it is the only concept that is profitable under current market conditions due to the high CO2-quota prices in the German fuel sector. The development pathways also show a significant potential to increase the net GHG reduction, which on BPG average can be nearly doubled. Our approach shows that the interplay of the heterogeneous BGP structure, the applied economic decision variable, and the nonuniform framework conditions in different energy markets is of crucial importance when assessing similar biogas markets, identifying robust follow-up pathways, or designing framework policies. © Copyright © 2021 Güsewell, Scherzinger, Holstenkamp, Vincent and Eltrop.","biogas plants; biomethane upgrading; extended operation; follow-up concepts; regional scenario analysis; seasonal flexibilization; support scheme","Commerce; Crops; Greenhouse gases; Profitability; Biogas plants; Biomethane; Biomethane upgrading; Extended operations; Follow up; Follow-up concept; Regional scenario analyse; Scenarios analysis; Seasonal flexibilization; Support scheme; Biogas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119417160

Policy and programs to enhance adaptation can alleviate these impacts, but to be effective they require an understanding of mountain community perceptions of climate change impacts on NTFPs and the perceived barriers to climate change adaptation. Here, we explored mountain communities' adaptation responses to the perceived impacts of climate change on NTFPs and people's barriers to adaptation using a structured questionnaire delivered as a field-based survey of 278 forest-dependent households from the Upper Madi Watershed of Nepal. We present a quantitative graphical exploration of the results to provide a simple overview of climate change impacts of NTFPs and local adaptation. The most common adaptation practices adopted by the mountain communities in the study area include the self-regulation of over-collection of NTFPs, alternative income generating activities, improved stoves, agroforestry, and sourcing alternative tools and materials. However, adaptation options to deal with increased invasive plant species and pest insect outbreaks appear to be challenging despite having the highest perceived impact on NTFPs. Adaptation practices are constrained by several factors such as the lack of predictability of extreme events and climate-related hazards, lack of technical knowledge, fatalistic beliefs and perceived lack of agency, and limited government support. Our results can inform policies and programs required for addressing the impacts of climate change on mountain communities in Nepal and other developing nations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation barriers; Agroforestry; Ecosystem services; Mountain communities; Perceptions","Climate change; Ecosystems; Forestry; Landforms; Sensory perception; Surveys; Adaptation barrier; Agroforestry; Climate change adaptation; Climate change impact; Community perceptions; Ecosystem services; Himalayas; Mountain community; Non-timber forest products; Well being; Timber; adaptive management; agroforestry; climate change; ecosystem service; environmental planning; environmental policy; perception; agroforestry; article; autoregulation; climate change; forest; government; household; human; human experiment; local adaptation; Nepal; perception; pest insect; structured questionnaire; watershed; acclimatization; family size; income; Nepal; Hexapoda; Acclimatization; Climate Change; Family Characteristics; Forests; Humans; Income",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109939993

This kind of plant residue can be used as a substrate for anaerobic digestion (AD) to reduce the content of HM-containing biomass, but high concentrations of HMs will inhibit the digestion efficiency and reduce the conversion efficiency of plant residues. Bioaugmentation may be an effective method to improve the degradation efficiency and methane yield of plant residues rich in HMs. In this study, a cellulose-degrading anaerobic bacteria Paracoccus sp. Termed strain LZ-G1 was isolated from cow dung, which can degrade cellulose and simultaneously adsorb Cd2+. The Cd2+ (10 mg/L)-adsorbtion efficiency and cellulose (463.12 g/kg)-degradation rate were 65.1 % and 60.59 %, respectively. In addition, using the strain LZ-G1 bioaugmented Cd2+-containing plant residues and cow manure mixed AD system, the system's biogas and methane production significantly increased (98.97 % and 142.03 %, respectively). During the AD process, the strain LZ-G1 was successfully colonized in the digestion system. Furthermore, the microbial community analysis revealed that LZ-G1 bioaugmentation alleviates the toxicity of free Cd2+ to the microbial community in the AD system, regulates and restores the archaea genus dominant in the methanogenesis stage, and restores the relative abundance of dominant bacteria associated with biomass hydrolysis. The restoration of the microbial community increased the biogas yield and methane production rate. Thus, bioaugmentation provides an easy and a feasible method for the actual on-site treatment of HM-rich phytoremediation residues. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Bioaugmentation; Cadmium; Paracoccus; Phytoremediation","Anaerobic digestion; Bacteria; Biodegradation; Biogas; Cadmium; Cellulose; Degradation; Efficiency; Fertilizers; Manures; Methane; Restoration; Anaerobic co-digestion; Anaerobics; Bio-augmentation; Cow manure; Digestion efficiency; Methane production; Microbial communities; Paracoccus; Phytoremediation; Plant residues; Bioremediation; anaerobic digestion; bioaugmentation; cadmium; cellulose; heavy metal; manure; methanogenesis; microbial activity; microbial community; phytoremediation; plant residue; Bacteria; Biodegradation; Biogas; Cadmium; Cellulose; Efficiency; Archaea; Paracoccus sp.; cadmium; cellulose; anaerobic growth; animal; bovine; digestion; female; manure; Anaerobiosis; Animals; Cadmium; Cattle; Cellulose; Digestion; Female; Manure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113194959

The results show that urban land use and anthropogenic heat emissions can reduce the accumulation of snowfall by 17%–22% within the fifth ring road, which depends on the aerosol number concentration and size. The increase in aerosols (same land use and anthropogenic heat emissions) can increase the accumulated snowfall within fifth ring road, especially for accumulated and coarse mode. Urban land use, anthropogenic heat emissions, and aerosols have different effect on snowfall, which depend mainly on relatively humidity. Urban land use and anthropogenic heat emissions lead to the formation of an “urban heat and dry island,” which is not favorable to snowfall processes during the initial snowfall processes and leads to a decrease in ice crystals and snow by 47% averaged. At this time, the increase in aerosol number concentrations has less impact (increase by 5% averaged) on snowfall because of higher supersaturation required for activation. With the development of snowfall processes, the feedback of cloud microphysics decrease temperature and increase relative humidity, which is favorable to snowfall process and increase snowfall slightly by 5% averaged. Meanwhile, the critical radius of aerosols that can be activated decrease, smaller particle aerosols are activated to form supercooled cloud water and further to form ice crystals and snow, which leads to an increase in accumulated snowfall by 11% averaged. © 2021.

The Funiu Mountain water conservation area is located in the densely populated central region of China, where human disturbance to the ecosystem is strong and ecosystem services are facing a very serious situation. Identifying and evaluating the factors leading to changes in the ecosystem service value (ESV) of the Funiu Mountain water conservation area can provide scientific guidance for ecological management and sustainable development. Using multi-source data and machine learning methods, our research reveals the characteristics of the spatio-temporal variation in the ESV, constructs a system of ESV influencing factors from the comprehensive perspectives of the natural environment and human activities, and discusses the comprehensive effects of the influencing factors on the Funiu Mountain area from 2000 to 2015. The results are as follows. (1) From 2000 to 2005, the ESV increased 375 million yuan, and from 2005 to 2015, it decreased 154 million yuan. (2) Hydrological regulation, biodiversity maintenance, soil conservation, gas regulation, and climate regulation were the main types of ecosystem services in the Funiu Mountain area. (3) The ESV was influenced by the comprehensive effects of the natural environment and human activities. Population was the most important influencing factor of the ESV; in addition, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), precipitation, and economic factors had important influences on the ESV. (4) With the intensification of human activities, humanistic factors have surpassed the relatively stable natural factors, becoming the main factors of the ESV. With economic development, the effect of human activities on the ESV may be further intensified in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

The accuracy of energy statistics is essential for mitigation strategies and evaluating the performance of low carbon energy transition efforts. This study provides the most up-to-date emission inventories for China and its provinces for 2018 and 2019. We also update the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission inventories of China and 30 provinces since 2012 based on the newly revised energy statistics. The inventories are compiled in a combined accounting approach of scope 1 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change territorial emissions from 17 types of fossil fuel combustion and cement production by 47 socioeconomic sectors) and scope 2 (emissions from purchased electricity and heat consumption). The most recent energy revision led to an increase in reported national CO2 emissions by an average of 0.3% from 2014 to 2017. The results show that data revisions raised China's carbon intensity mitigation baseline (in 2005) by 5.1%–10.8% and thus made it more challenging to fulfill the mitigation pledges. However, the 2020 carbon intensity mitigation target was achieved ahead of schedule in 2018. A preliminary estimate of China's national emissions for 2020 shows that the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown was not able to offset China's annual increase in CO2 emissions. These emissions inventories provide an improved evidence base for China's policies toward net-zero emissions. © 2021 The Authors.

In case of China this paper examined how the transformation of inclusive green growth, from a “beggar-thy-neighbor” approach to a “neighbor-friendly” approach, can be realized. From the perspective of a “pollution paradise”, this study regarded haze pollution as a mediator to examine the driving mechanism underlying the influence of economic policy uncertainty on inclusive green growth. Moreover, media attention was introduced as a moderator to explore the institutional scenario that drives inclusive green growth in China. This study used panel data from 30 provinces for the period 2006–2016, and employed the Spatial Durbin model for empirical testing. The findings showed that the influence of EPU on inclusive green growth was multi-dimensional, and this included the direct “policy-economic” effect, the partial intermediary effect of a beggar-thy-neighbor model which was reflected by haze pollution, and the moderating effect of a neighbor-friendly approach via media attention. Furthermore, the results revealed an inverted-U-shaped relationship between haze pollution and inclusive green growth. Finally, media attention can effectively regulate the negative impact of economic policy uncertainty and haze pollution on inclusive green growth, and realize the transformation of inclusive green growth from a beggar-thy-neighbor policy to a neighbor-friendly policy. This study presents a new perspective for understanding the economic consequences of economic policy uncertainty and provides an empirical framework that guide local governments about climate governance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Economic policy uncertainty; Haze pollution; Inclusive green growth; Mediating effect; Moderating effect","Digital storage; Economic analysis; Pollution; Public policy; Economic policies; Economic policy uncertainty; Green growths; Haze pollutions; Inclusive green growth; Industrialized countries; Media attention; Mediating effect; Moderating effect; Uncertainty; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115164818

Upon the comparison of electrochemical performance of Ni-YSZ anode and TiO2 modified Ni-YSZ anode in the state-of-the-art single cell (Ni-YSZ/YSZ/LSCM), the modified anodes exhibit markedly improved peak powder density with simulated biogas fuel (70% CH4+ 30% CO2) at 850 °C with less coking after 40 h operation. The high activity and carbon deposition resistance of the modified anode is possibly attributed to the in situ generated hydroxyl radical from the reduced TiOx powder under high temperature infrared light excitation, which is supported by detailed analysis of microstructural information of anodes and the powder-based thermo-photocatalytic experiments. © 2021","Biogas utilization; Carbon removal; Infrared light excitation; Solid oxide fuel cells; Thermo-photocatalysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102454975

The aim of this research is to investigate the CO2 emissions caused by a trip to Latvia's Western coast at the Baltic Sea for recreational fishing in order to create information basis for intensifying the development of the specific tourism industry on a Baltic Sea states scope. In this research a hybrid (top-down and bottom up) and regression method was used for determination of CO2 emissions and interlinked relations. Research results: Altogether travelling forth and back to fishing destinations totalled 22 546 km, emitting 5.796 tCO2 emissions; vehicle occupation rates for vehicles vary - for car - 28.9 %, for motorhome - 50 %, for vans - 25 %. Renewal of car fleet to more fuel-economy vehicles would help comply with the CO2 95 g/km goal, would reduce the emissions by 684.49 kg, 847 kg and by 570.84 kg accordingly. The emission reduction per passenger with 60 % seat occupancy depend on the car CO2 emission ratio - 155 g/km, 147 g/km or 131 g/km, and would correspond to the cumulative effect of CO2 6.77 kg, 5.01 kg and 5.40 kg. Annual journey to fishing destinations per passenger, with 95 g/km emissions and 60 % vehicle occupancy rate with given registered CO2 emissions at 155 g/km, 147 g/km or 131 g/km: would produce CO2 297.7 kg, 322.7 kg and 280.2 kg accordingly. Use of seat-sharing of newer cars would allow for a reduction of emissions, specifically within Latvia's Western coast of Baltic Sea recreation fishing area, where due to the scarce population, public transport is less available. © 2020 Tamara Grizane et al., published by Sciendo 2020.","CO2emissions; recreation fishing; transportation","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; environmental economics; sport fishing; tourism development; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Latvia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099106833

It captures the entire northern Galactic plane within the Galactic coordinate range |b|< 5° and 30° < ℓ < 215°. From the beginning, the incorporation of narrow-band Hα imaging has been a unique and distinctive feature of this effort. Alongside a focused discussion of the nature and application of the Hα data, we present the IGAPS world-accessible database of images for all five survey filters, i, r, g, URGO, and narrow-band Hα, observed on a pixel scale of 0.33 arcsec and at an effective (median) angular resolution of 1.1-1.3 arcsec. The background, noise, and sensitivity characteristics of the narrow-band Hα filter images are outlined. Typical noise levels in this band correspond to a surface brightness at full ∼1 arcsec resolution of around 2 × 10-16 erg cm-2 s-1 arcsec-2. Illustrative applications of the Hα data to planetary nebulae and Herbig-Haro objects are outlined and, as part of a discussion of the mosaicking technique, we present a very large background-subtracted narrow-band mosaic of the supernova remnant Simeis 147. Finally, we lay out a method that exploits the database via an automated selection of bright ionised diffuse interstellar emission targets for the coming generation of wide-field massive-multiplex spectrographs. Two examples of the diffuse Hα map output from this selection process are presented and compared with previously published data. © ESO 2021.","Astronomical databases: miscellaneous; HII regions; ISM: general; ISM: supernova remnants; Planetary nebulae: general; Surveys","Database systems; Galaxies; Median filters; Supernovae; Astronomical databases: miscellaneous; Galactic plane; Galactic plane surveys; High resolution; HII region; Isaac newton telescope; ISM: supernova remnants; ISM:general; Narrow bands; Planetary nebulae:general; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119830454

Although various fireproof coating systems are commonly used to protect steel structures from high temperatures, a combination of fire protection and cryogenic spillage protection, i.e., protection from liquefied natural gas (LNG), is rather an international practice novelty regulated by standards ISO 20088. Thanks to their outstanding features, i.e., ability to sustain chemical and climatic impact, these epoxy-based materials are able to ensure positive fireproof performance for steel structures in the case of potential cryogenic impact. The article discusses tests on steel structures coated with epoxy fireproof compounds, specifically PREGRAD-EP, OGRAX-SKE and Chartek 2218. The test records show the time from the start of cryogenic exposure to the said sample reaching the limit state, as well as the time from the start of heat impact to the sample reaching the limit state in case of hydrocarbon fire temperature. © 2021 by the authors.

This logarithmic radiative response also means that atmospheric CO2 changes of a given mass will have smaller temperature effects on higher pCO2 planets. Ocean pH is linked to atmospheric pCO2 through seawater carbonate speciation and calcium carbonate dissolution/precipitation, and the response of pH to changes in pCO2 also decreases at higher initial pCO2. Here, we use idealized climate and ocean chemistry models to demonstrate that CO2 perturbations large enough to cause catastrophic changes to surface temperature and ocean pH on temperate, low-pCO2 planets in the innermost region of the HZ are likely to have much smaller effects on planets with higher pCO2, as may be the case for terrestrial planets with active carbonate-silicate cycles receiving less instellation than the Earth. Major bouts of extraterrestrial fossil fuel combustion or volcanic CO2 outgassing on high-pCO2 planets in the mid-to-outer HZ should have mild or negligible impacts on surface temperature and ocean pH.

On the one hand, it is experiencing a rapidly increasing demand for energy. At the same time, it is subject to the pressure of the climate policy due to environmental issues. For the same reason, the energy sector is forced to undertake costly investments to transform production from black to green energy. The issue of financing has become one of the key problems of the energy sector, especially in those countries in which energy production traditionally is based on fossil fuels, i.e., coal. The paper aims to investigate the impact of corporate governance on the capital structure of companies from the energy industry. We use three proxies of corporate governance quality: institutional investors, the board size, and state ownership and investigate their impact on capital structure. Our findings suggest that the latter two negatively impact debt levels. In our model, we control for financial factors and CEO personal characteristics. We use a Polish setting since transformational problems of the energy sector in Poland are especially visible. At the same time, energy companies in Poland are subject to the strict EU climate policy. © 2021 by the authors.

Jasmonic acid (JA) and its methyl ester, MeJA, are endogenous plant hormones, known collectively as jasmonates, that have signalling roles in plant defence and consequently are often used to prime plant defence systems. Here, we use exogenous jasmonate application to mature source leaves of Chardonnay grapevines to elucidate the prioritisation strategy of carbon allocation between plant defence and growth. Our results demonstrate that jasmonate application to Chardonnay leaves can elicit a defence response to Botrytis cinerea, but the effect was localised to the jasmonate-treated area. We found no evidence of a systemic defence response in non-treated mature leaves or young growing tissue. JA application reduced the photosynthetic rate of the treated leaf and reduced the export rate of recently fixed carbon-11 from the leaf. Following JA application, a greater proportion of available recently fixed carbon was allocated to the roots, suggesting an increase in sink strength of the roots. Relative sink strength of the berries did not change; however, an increase in berry sugar was observed seven days after JA treatment. We conclude that the data provide evidence for a “high sugar resistance” model in the mature treated leaves of the vine, since the export of carbon was reduced to ensure an elevated defence response in the treated leaf. The increase in berry sugar concentration seven days after treatment can be explained by the initial prioritisation of a greater portion of the exported carbon to storage in the roots, making it available for remobilisation to the berries once the challenge to defence had passed. © 2021 by the authors.

Land degradation has reduced ecosystem services provisioning, released carbon from disturbed soils into the atmosphere, and significantly diminished resilience to climate change. Private land managers in the region have developed methods to reverse degradation and restore biodiversity and ecosystem function. Land managers have used rock detention structures (RDS), technology adapted from traditional Indigenous practices in the region, as a tool for reversing desertification and watershed degradation. The structures were installed primarily for erosion control and water management, but they have had positive impacts on multiple biophysical systems. In this study, we analyze watershed-scale installation of RDS as a nature-based solution for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Case studies include four properties that offer examples of structures that have been in place over a period ranging from 1 to 40 years. We reviewed journal articles and other studies conducted at the four sites, supplemented with interviews, to catalogue the nature-based solutions provided by RDS. This study documents positive impacts on overall stream flow, reduction in peak runoff during inundation events, and increased sedimentation, which increase resilience to drought, erosion, and flooding. Data suggest potential impacts for climate change mitigation, though further research is needed. In addition, results suggest that watershed restoration with RDS offers a host of co-benefits, including an increase in biodiversity and wildlife abundance, an increase in vegetative cover, and increased surface water provisioning over time to support the land-based livelihoods of downstream neighbors. In the discussion, we consider barriers to replication and scalability using the strategy of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration as a guiding framework, discussing issues of awareness, legislation and policy, technical capacity, finance, and gaps in knowledge. © Copyright © 2021 Gooden and Pritzlaff.","carbon market; carbon sequestration; conservation finance; ecosystem services (ES); erosion control structure; natural climate solution; riverine; wetlands",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119426432

The main objective of this study is to gain insights about future water level changes based on different climate change scenarios using machine learning algorithms, while addressing the following research questions: (a) how will the water table be affected by climate change in the future based on different socio-economic pathways (SSPs)?: (b) do machine learning models perform well enough in predicting changes of the groundwater in Denmark? If so, which ML model outperforms for forecasting these changes? Three ML algorithms were used in R: artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). The ML models were trained with time-series data of groundwater levels taken at wells in the Hovedstaden region, for the period 1990–2018. Several independent variables were used to train the models, including different soil parameters, topographical features and climatic variables for the time period and region selected. Results show that the RF model outperformed the other two, resulting in a higher R-squared and lower mean absolute error (MAE). The future prediction maps for the different scenarios show little variation in the water table. Nevertheless, predictions show that it will rise slightly, mostly in the order of 0–0.25 m, especially during winter. The proposed approach in this study can be used to visualize areas where the water levels are expected to change, as well as to gain insights about how big the changes will be. The approaches and models developed with this paper could be replicated and applied to other study areas, allowing for the possibility to extend this model to a national level, improving the prevention and adaptation plans in Denmark and providing a more global overview of future water level predictions to more efficiently handle future climate change scenarios. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the interactions of these three factors and the primary controls on N2O fluxes in peatlands are not well-known. Here, the three factors were manipulated in a boreal bog in western Newfoundland, Canada for 5 years. We found that warming mitigated the positive N effect on N2O fluxes in the mid-growing season under intact vegetation owing to the increase of available N uptake by vegetation and less N for N2O production. In contrast, warming strengthened the N effect on N2O fluxes in the early growing season under the absence of graminoids or shrubs, which could be attributed to the increase of available carbon and nitrogen for N2O production. It should be noted that these effects were not observed under the condition of low carbon availability. In addition, gross primary production was found as a critical control on N2O fluxes under N addition. Our findings emphasize that the interaction of abiotic (warming and elevated nitrogen deposition) and biotic factors (vegetation composition change) on N2O fluxes should be taken into account in order to project N2O fluxes in peatland ecosystems accurately. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","global warming; N deposition; N2O; vegetation composition","atmospheric deposition; bog; community composition; global warming; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide; peatland; vegetation; Canada; Newfoundland; Newfoundland and Labrador; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; climate change; ecosystem; season; soil; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Seasons; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114052799

However, the production of electric vehicles is accompanied by high environmental impacts, mainly due to the resource intensive high-voltage battery systems. Hence, a prerequisite for sustainable electro-mobility – beside the provision of renewable energy for vehicle charging – is a well-functioning and efficient circular use system of electric vehicle battery systems (EVBs). While the production of EVBs has been continuously improved in recent years with high levels of automation to reduce production costs and to increase capacities, end-of-life (EoL) treatment of EVBs is still rather simplistic with rough manual disassembling before in most cases pyro-metallurgical treatment. In this paper, we argue for the need of industrial disassembly systems to reach higher levels of circularity. In the best case, these systems are highly automated and use lifecycle information including production and use-phase data for decision support to enable optimum utilization at a module or even cell level. These pathways include both second-life concepts such as repurposing or reconditioning and high-level direct recycling of active materials. To demonstrate the advantages of an industrial disassembling in EoL battery treatment, we systematically analyze different utilization pathways and we compare state-of-the-art treatment with an advanced disassembly system. The qualitative argumentation is substantiated by quantitative stochastic simulation as well as cost and lifecycle data. We show that only with a well-functioning industrial disassembling, efficient closed-loop-supply-chains (CLSCs) for EVBs can be achieved. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Circular Economy; Electric Vehicle Battery System; Electro-Mobility; Industrial Disassembling; Recycling; Remanufacturing; Repurposing; Reuse","Costs; Decision support systems; Electric vehicles; Electronic Waste; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Secondary batteries; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Battery systems; Circular economy; Disassembly systems; Electric vehicle batteries; Electric vehicle battery system; Electro mobilities; Industrial disassembling; Remanufacturing; Repurposing; Reuse; Recycling; electric vehicle; electronic waste; manufacturing; recycling; sustainability; waste management; art therapy; article; automation; cell level; controlled study; decision support system; economic aspect; recycling; simulation; stochastic model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111025509

The benefits of electrification are enormous, but the growing demand also comes with challenges with respect to associated greenhouse gas emissions. Although continuing progress in energy research has brought up new technologies in energy generation, storage, and distribution, most of those technologies focus on increasing efficiency of individual components. Work on integration and coordination abilities between individual components in micro-grids will lead to further improvements and gains in efficiency that are necessary to reduce carbon footprints and slow down climate change. To this end, the CityLearn environment provides a simulation framework that allows the control of energy components in buildings that are organized in districts. In this paper, we propose an energy management system based on the decentralized actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm MARLISA but integrate a centralized critic and call it MARLISADSCC. In this way, we are training a model to autonomously control the energy storage of individual buildings in a CityLearn district to improve demand response guided by a better informed training signal. We show performance increases over baseline control techniques for a district but also discuss the resulting action selection for individual buildings. © 2021 Owner/Author.","citylearn; energy management; multi-agent; reinforcement learning","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Learning algorithms; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Centralised; Citylearn; Decentralised; Demand response; Energy demands; High energy consumption; Individual components; Industrialisation; Multi agent; Technology adoption; Energy management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120957478

Here we assess the influence of historical variation in the temperature–humidity index (THI) on milk yields using monthly state-level yield data and high-resolution daily weather data over 1981–2018. We find that milk yields are compromised by exposure to both extreme heat (>79 THI) and cold (<39 THI), causing average daily yield decreases of around 3.7% and 6.1%, respectively, relative to optimal conditions (65–69 THI). Colder regions are more sensitive to heat extremes, and warm regions are more sensitive to cold extremes. Sensitivity to THI has reduced dramatically over time. Climate trends contributed modestly (around 0.1% over 38 years) to rising yields in most states via alleviating cold stress, although more extreme future conditions may negate these benefits. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117528956

Objectives: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess whether purifying the air of the classrooms produced short-term changes in attention processes of adolescents. Methods: We recruited a total of 2,123 adolescents (13–16 years old) in 33 high schools in Barcelona metropolitan area (Spain). In each school, adolescents from each class were randomly split into two equal-sized groups and assigned to two different classrooms. A set of two air cleaner devices with the same appearance (one recirculating and filtrating the air and the other only recirculating the air) was used. Each one of the devices was placed at random at one of the two classrooms. Students were masked to intervention allocation and had to complete several computerized activities for 1.5 h, including an attention test (Flanker task) to be performed at baseline and at the end of the intervention. The response speed consistency, expressed as hit reaction time standard error (HRT-SE, in ms), was measured as the primary outcome. Analyses were conducted using conditional linear regressions with classroom as strata, adjusted for variables that may differ from one class to another such as temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide concentration. Results: Average levels of PM2.5 and black carbon throughout the 1.5 h of experiment were 89% and 87%, respectively, lower in the classrooms with air cleaner than in the control classrooms. No differences were found in the median of HRT-SE between classrooms with cleaned air and normal air (percent change: 1.37%, 95% confidence interval: −2.81%, 5.56%). Sensitivity analyses with secondary attention outcomes resulted in similar findings. Conclusions: Cleaning the air of a classroom to reduce exposure to air pollutants for 1.5 h did not have an impact on the attention function of adolescents. Still, in light of previous evidence suggesting an association between air pollution and attention, further experimental studies should explore other short-term timescales of exposure and age ranges. © 2021 The Author(s)","Adolescents; Air pollution; Attention; High school; Randomized controlled trial","Air cleaners; Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Sensitivity analysis; Students; Adolescent; Attention; Attention functions; Barcelona; Cognitive functions; Higher School; Observational study; Randomized controlled trial; Short term; Short-term effects; Air pollution; black carbon; carbon dioxide; adolescence; atmospheric pollution; cognition; concentration (composition); particulate matter; pollution exposure; secondary education; student; adolescent; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; attention; attention test; concentration (parameter); environmental exposure; environmental temperature; female; high school; hit reaction time; human; humidity; male; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; reaction time; school hygiene; sensitivity analysis; Spain; urban area; adverse event; air pollutant; attention; controlled study; particulate matter; randomized controlled trial; school; Barcelona [Barcelona (PRV)]; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain; Adolescent; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Attention; Humans; Particulate Matter; Schools; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105885447

The goal was to evaluate the system's efficiency and investigate the need for one or two CW stages to reach the national effluent reuse standard. The CW were planted with local species (Arundo donax, Cortaderia selloana, Phragmites australis) and received 20 m3/day from a university dormitory at a hydraulic loading rate of 5 cm/day. The facility proved to be effective and removed 88.9%, 86.0%, 92.2%, 63.5%, 66.5%, and 65.7% of BOD5, COD, TSS, PO4-P, NH4-N, and NO3-N, respectively, while the effluent complied with the reuse standard. This study showed that hybrid CW can be effectively used under dry and warm climates using native plant species providing a technically feasible, cost-effective, and sustainable wastewater treatment solution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Arid climate; Arundo donax; Hybrid constructed wetland; Phragmites australis; Reuse; University dormitory wastewater","Cost effectiveness; Efficiency; Effluents; School buildings; Wastewater; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Anaerobic baffled reactor; Arid climates; Arundo donax; Hybrid constructed wetland; Phragmites australis; Reuse; University dormitories; University dormitory wastewater; Warm climates; Wastewater treatment and reuse; Wetlands; constructed wetland; feasibility study; grass; socioeconomic impact; subsurface flow; wastewater treatment; Iran; Arundo donax; Cortaderia selloana; Phragmites australis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110260198

We aimed to conduct an extensive sensitivity analysis of the RBZ designs to climate change nutrient and sediment loadings to streams. We designed 135 simulation scenarios starting with the six baselines RBZs (grass, urban, two-zone forest, three-zone forest, wildlife, and naturalized) in three 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code watersheds within the Albemarle-Pamlico river basin (USA). Using the hydrologic and water quality system (HAWQS), we assessed the sensitivity of the designs to five water quality indicator (WQI) parameters: dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorous (TP), total nitrogen (TN), sediment (SD), and biochemical oxygen demand (BD). To understand the climate mitigation potential of RBZs, we identified a subset of future climate change projection models of air temperature and precipitation using EPA’s Locating and Selecting Scenarios Online tool. Analyses revealed optimal RBZ designs for the three watersheds. In terms of watershed ecosystem services sustainability, the optimal Urban RBZ in contemporary climate (1983–2018) reduced SD from 61–96%, TN from 34–55%, TP from 9–48%, and BD from 53–99%, and raised DO from 4–10% with respect to No-RBZ in the three watersheds. The late century’s (2070–2099) extreme mean annual climate changes significantly increased the projected SD and BD; however, the addition of urban RBZs was projected to offset the climate change reducing SD from 28–94% and BD from 69–93% in the watersheds. All other types of RBZs are also projected to fully mitigate the climate change impacts on WQI parameters except three-zone RBZ. © 2021 by the authors.

Throughout pregnancy, the placenta plays a central role in fetal programming; it regulates the in utero environment and acts as a gatekeeper for nutrient and waste exchange between the mother and the fetus. Maternal exposure to air pollution, including heavy metals, can reach the placenta, where they alter DNA methylation patterns, leading to changes in placental function and fetal reprogramming. This review explores the current knowledge on placental DNA methylation changes associated with prenatal air pollution (including heavy metals) exposure and highlights its effects on fetal development and disease susceptibility. Prenatal exposure to air pollution and heavy metals was associated with altered placental DNA methylation at the global and promoter regions of genes involved in biological processes such as energy metabolism, circadian rhythm, DNA repair, inflammation, cell differentiation, and organ development. The altered placental methylation of these genes was, in some studies, associated with adverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight, small for gestational age, and decreased head circumference. Moreover, few studies indicate that DNA methylation changes in the placenta were sex-specific, and infants born with altered placental DNA methylation patterns were predisposed to developing neurobehavioral abnormalities, cancer, and atopic dermatitis. These findings highlight the importance of more effective and stricter environmental and public health policies to reduce air pollution and protect human health. © 2021 by the authors.

The COVID-19 data (cumulative, confirmed cases and deaths), air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and SO2) and meteorological data (temperature and relative humidity) were collected from January 2020 to August 2020 for all 28 states and the union territory of India during the pandemic. Now, to understand the relationship between air pollutant concentration, meteorological factor, and COVID-19 cases, the nonparametric Spearman's and Kendall's rank correlation were used. The COVID-19 shows a favourable temperature (0.55–0.79) and humidity (0.14–0.52) over the Indian region. The PM2.5 and PM10 gave a strong and negative correlation with COVID-19 cases in the range of 0.64–0.98. Similarly, the NO2 shows a strong and negative correlation in the range of 0.64–0.98. Before the lockdown, the concentration of pollution parameters is high due to the shallow boundary layer height. But after lockdown, the overall reduction was reported up to 33.67% in air quality index (AQI). The background metrological parameters showed a crucial role in the variation of pollutant parameters (SO2, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5) and the COVID-19 infection with the economic aspects. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts derived monthly average wind speed was also plotted. It can see that January and February of 2020 show the least variation of air mass in the range of 1–2 m/s. The highest wind speed was reported during July and August 2020. India's western and southern parts experienced an air mass in the range of 4–8 m/s. The precipitation/wet deposition of atmospheric aerosols further improves the AQI over India. According to a study, the impact of relative humidity among all other metrological parameters is positively correlated with Cases and death.

PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and CO during the COVID-19 pandemic over eight most polluted Indian cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Kolkata, and Ahmedabad). A significant reduction in the PM2.5 (63%), PM10 (56%), NO2 (50%), SO2 (9%), and CO (59%) were observed over Major Dhyan Chand Stadium. At Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, a decline of 44% in PM2.5 and 50% in PM10 was seen just a week during the initial phase of the lockdown. Gaseous pollutants (NO2, SO2 &amp; CO) dropped up-to 36, 16, and 41%, respectively. The Air Quality Index (AQI) shows a dramatic change from 7% to 67% during observation at Chandigarh and Ballygunge during the inspection. Whereas, Ahmedabad, Worli, Income Tax Office, Talkatora, Lalbagh, and Ballygaunge have showed a significant change in AQI from 25.76% to 68.55%. However, Zoo Park, CST, Central School, and Victoria show relatively low variation in AQI in the range of 3.0% to 14.50% as compare to 2019 after lockdown. Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) analysis suggested that long range transportation of pollutants were also a part and parcel contributing to changes in AQI which were majorly coming from the regions of Iran, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, as well as a regional grant from Indian Gangatic plains and Delhi Non-capital region. © 2021, Korean Meteorological Society and Springer Nature B.V.","Air quality index; Back trajectories; Coronavirus; COVID-19; India",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100100733

Forest-based bioenergy has the potential to offset carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, thereby playing a role in climate change mitigation. Despite having an established commercial forestry industry, with large quantities of residue generated each year, there is limited use for forest biomass for renewable energy in Queensland, and Australia more broadly. The objective of this study was to identify the carbon dioxide mitigation potential of replacing fossil fuels with bioenergy generated from forest harvest residues harnessed from commercial plantations of Pinus species in southeast Queensland. An empirical-based full carbon accounting model (FullCAM) was used to simulate the accumulation of carbon in harvest residues. The results from the FullCAM modelling were further analysed to identify the energy substitution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions offsets of three bioenergy scenarios. The results of the analysis suggest that the greatest opportunity to avoid or offset emissions is achieved when combined heat and power using residue feedstocks replaces coal-fired electricity. The results of this study suggest that forest residue bioenergy is a viable alternative to traditional energy sources, offering substantive emission reductions, with the potential to contribute towards renewable energy and emission reduction targets in Queensland. The approach used in this case study will be valuable to other regions exploring bioenergy generation from forest or other biomass residues. © 2021 by the authors.

Grape pomace (GP) and walnut shells (WS) are organic waste generated in Chile. Within the last decade, the potential benefits and application of biomass have received significant attention, both in terms of producing functionalized carbon materials, and the various potential applications in the field of energy storage and environmental protection. The proposed research motivation is on the development of carbonous materials through thermal decomposition processes. Few researchers have addressed the idea of developing a multipurpose carbonaceous matrix from hydrochar, and there remains a need for an efficient method to obtain hydrochar specially from grape pomace. Hence, the general objective of this research is to study the potential of grape pomace and walnut shells treated with hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) as an alternative low-cost and efficient carbonous matrix. Proximate and elemental analysis was determined to distinguish the nature of the feedstock along with the hydrochar produced. Yield and reaction severity were also studied to study the impacts of temperature and residence time for both feedstocks.

The vital rates linked to recruitment by seed are impacted by amplified drought induced by climate change. In the Mediterranean region, autumn and winter seedling emergence and mortality may have strong impact on the overall seedling recruitment. However, studies focusing on the temporal dynamic of recruitment during these seasons are rare. This study was performed in a deciduous Mediterranean oak forest located in southern France and quantifies the impact of amplified drought conditions on autumn and winter seedling emergence and seedling mortality rates of two herbaceous plant species with meso-Mediterranean and supra-Mediterranean distribution (respectively, Silene italica and Silene nutans). Seedlings were followed from October 2019 to May 2020 in both undisturbed and disturbed plots where the litter and the aboveground biomass have been removed to create open microsites. Amplified drought conditions reduced seedling emergence and increased seedling mortality for both Silene species but these negative effects were dependent on soil disturbance conditions. Emergence of S. italica decreased only in undisturbed plots (−7%) whereas emergence of S. nutans decreased only in disturbed plots (−10%) under amplified drought conditions. The seedling mortality rate of S. italica was 51% higher under amplified drought conditions in undisturbed plots while that of S. nutans was 38% higher in disturbed plots. Aridification due to lower precipitation in the Mediterranean region will negatively impact the seedling recruitment of these two Silene species. Climate change effects on early vital rates may likely have major negative impacts on the overall population dynamic. © 2021 The Authors.

Foreseeing the trajectory of such changes is critical to implementing adequate management practices and defining long-term strategies. This study investigated future shifts in temperate forest species composition and abundance expected to occur due to climate change. It also identified the ecological mechanisms underpinning such changes. Using an altitudinal gradient in the Romanian Carpathian temperate forests encompassing several vegetation types, we explored forest change using the Landis-II landscape model coupled with the PnET ecophysiological process model. We specifically assessed the change in biomass, forest production, species composition and natural disturbance impacts under three climate change scenarios, namely, RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. The results show that, over the short term (15 years), biomass across all forest types in the altitudinal gradient will increase, and species composition will remain unaltered. In contrast, over the medium and long terms (after 2040), changes in species composition will accelerate, with some species spreading (e.g., Abies alba Mill.) and others declining (e.g., Fagus sylvatica L.), particularly under the most extreme climate change scenario. Some forest types (e.g., Picea abies (L.) karst forests) in the Southern Carpathians will notably increase their standing biomass due to climate change, compared to other types, such as Quercus forests. Our findings suggest that climate change will alter the forest composition and species abundance, with some forests being particularly vulnerable to climate change, e.g., F. sylvatica forests. As far as productivity and forest composition changes are concerned, management practices should accommodate the new conditions in order to mitigate climate change impacts. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the average brake thermal efficiency of this concept is like that found with conventional diesel operation. The powertrain electrification using electric motors and battery packages appears as a potential solution to reduce the CO2 emissions. For this reason, several solutions for the powertrain electrification can be found currently in the market as the parallel, series and power split powertrain architectures. The aim of this work is to evaluate the hybrid architecture impact on the fuel consumption and emissions of a delivery truck (Volvo-FL) intended for urban and urban–rural applications. The truck equipped with a reactivity-controlled compression ignition diesel-gasoline engine is evaluated and compared against the conventional diesel case. In addition, to evaluate the impact of new e-fuels on the well-to-wheel CO2 emissions, a synthetic gasoline coming from carbon capture and green electricity is evaluated. The results show that hybridization allows reducing the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions above 15% with the parallel hybrid set-up. The series and power split architectures show CO2 benefits of 12% with respect to the baseline diesel non-hybrid case. Using synthetic gasoline as low reactivity fuel allows to achieve a 50% well-to-wheel CO2 reduction in the P2 and 70% well-to-wheel CO2 reduction for the series and power split cases due to the higher average gasoline fraction used in the driving cycle. © 2021 The Authors","Driving cycles; Dual-fuel; E-Components; Emissions regulations; Mild hybrid","Carbon dioxide; Electric utilities; Gasoline; Ignition; Powertrains; Trucks; Wheels; CO$-2$/ emission; Compression ignition; Delivery trucks; Driving cycle; Dual-fuels; E-component; Emissions regulations; Mild hybrid; Power splits; Well-to-wheel; Emission control; carbon emission; detection method; electric vehicle; electricity; fuel consumption; performance assessment; reduction; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111937743

Additionally, synthetic fuels have become an important way of reaching carbon neutral utilization of hydrocarbon-based fuels and internal combustion engines. Specifically, poly-oxymethylene dimethyl ethers (OMEx) have demonstrated great advantages in combination with conventional fuels with higher energy content to compensate that aspect to reduce NOx emissions below the EU VI homologation normative while maintaining ultra-low soot emissions with a great benefit in CO2 emissions in a well-to-wheel basis. Nonetheless, the properties of this fuel in single-fuel combustion strategies are not thoroughly investigated in the literature. The objective of this work is to investigate the capabilities of OMEx fuel under conventional combustion modes compared to those of conventional diesel combustion. To do this, an experimental characterization under stoichiometric combustion has been carried out to evaluate the impact on engine hardware demand and total emissions. Additionally, a brief exploration under leaner conditions is performed. The results obtained from this work point out that, even under ultra-high EGR rates to reach high fuel-to-air ratios, OMEx fuel can emit ultra-low soot and NOx emissions with more than 90% reduction compared to diesel on engine out emissions. Under stoichiometric conditions, a significant increase appears on CO, UHC due to excessive usage of EGR and equivalent fuel consumption is penalized from 15% to 40% depending on the operating condition, but under slightly leaner conditions, a region where equivalent fuel consumption is improved with respect to CDC appears, and the four main pollutants investigated are almost EU VI compliant, exposing a very high potential for this fuel. © 2021","Engine-out emissions; EURO VI; OMEx; Synthetic fuels","Diesel engines; Ignition; Petroleum prospecting; Soot; Synthetic fuels; Temperature; Combustion mode; Condition; Engine-out emissions; Equivalent fuel consumption; EURO VI; Fuel combustion; Lean condition; NOx emissions; OMEx; Soot emissions; Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108083452

Advancing a calibrated understanding of these fluid-silicate interactions is essential for developing scalable processes. One of the challenges in developing predictive controls over these interactions is the compositional and morphological heterogeneity of naturally occurring, heterogeneous magnesium silicate minerals. To address this challenge, the synthesis of architected mesoporous crystalline magnesium silicate (Mg2SiO4) is proposed. While synthesis routes for producing amorphous mesoporous magnesium silicates have been developed via sol-gel methods, approaches to synthesize crystalline magnesium silicates with well-controlled pore size distributions have not been explored. The conventional approaches of converting matter that is amorphous to crystalline states at elevated temperatures results in a heterogeneous pore size distribution. To develop controls on pore size distribution, amorphous mesoporous magnesium silicates are coated with carbon. This approach retains the pore structure during the amorphous to crystalline transformations of Mg-silicates at elevated temperatures. The carbon coating is removed on heating. Magnesium silicate particles produced using this approach have highly ordered pores around 2.58 nm and a specific surface area of 124.25 m2/g. In this study, we report the chemical compositions, morphologies, phase transitions, and pore structures of the intermediate materials produced during the synthesis of crystalline mesoporous magnesium silicates.

Since previous studies have mostly explored the relationship between the two from the perspective of technological innovation, the endogeneity problem makes the research results lack credibility. This study attempts to fill this gap. Constructing a quasi-natural experiment based on the national innovative city policy, this study explores the impact and mechanism of innovation-driven development on pollution reduction using propensity score matching(PSM) and difference-in-differences(DID) models. The results demonstrate that the construction of national innovative cities has a positive effect on the reduction of pollution emissions intensity, which is mainly achieved through the improvement of urban innovation level and industrial R&D personnel concentration but has not effectively promoted pollution reduction through the advanced industrial structure. Additionally, national innovative city policy exhibits heterogeneous effects on pollution reduction. Specifically, the pollution reduction effect of big cities is weaker than that of small and medium-sized cities. The greater the manufacturing scale and the degree of financial support for science and technology, the stronger the pollution reduction effects. The pollution reduction effect shows a non-linear mechanism as pollution emissions intensity increases, and the overall trend is upward. Accordingly, corresponding policy recommendations are put forward based on the current weakness. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Difference-in-differences model; Innovation-driven development; National innovative city policy; Pollution reduction; Propensity score matching","Industrial emissions; Difference-in-differences models; Economic growths; Emissions intensity; Innovation-driven development; National innovative city policy; Natural experiment; Pollution emissions; Pollution reduction; Propensity score matching; Reduction effects; Economics; economic growth; empirical analysis; environmental quality; experimental study; innovation; pollution control; urban policy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111481332

However, due to the tight symmetry between the number and distribution of electric vehicles and their corresponding charging facilities, the layout of charging facilities has higher requirements. This paper collects travel data in the form of a traffic travel questionnaire for electric vehicle users. Based on the vehicle parking demand model of the queuing theory and Monte Carlo simulation, the paper gives the number of stopping vehicles and the time of vehicles stopping in different places such as residential areas, workplaces, supermarket parking and roadside. In addition, based on the Bass prediction model, the main parameters are modeled in the model, and the price correction coefficient is introduced. The improved Bass model is used to predict the growth trend of electric vehicles in different regions in different years and in different incentive sites. By predicting the ownership of urban electric vehicles and accurately grasping the distribution and operation of electric vehicles, this paper can provide guidance and suggestions for the planning and construction of charging facilities in different regions, effectively reduce the investment cost of charging facilities and guide local governments to formulate reasonable planning schemes. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aims to examine the impact of air pollution on fiscal sustainability in the short and long run. We conducted an empirical analysis based on air pollution and local government debt data on China’s prefecture-level cities in 2014–2019, using regression discontinuity design (RDD) and a panel data model. The results show that air pollution reduces the debt burden of governments in the short run. However, in the long run, addressing the negative impacts of air pollution adds to the debt burden of local governments, hindering fiscal sustainability. Fiscal freedom and the level of public services significantly moderate the negative impact of air pollution on fiscal sustainability. A higher level of fiscal freedom generally indicates a greater incentive for local governments to raise pollutant emission standards, strengthen the construction of green infrastructure, and subsidize green enterprises. Furthermore, a higher level of public services reflects better infrastructure and higher levels of investment in environmental protection, which help to reduce the negative impact of air pollution. The governments are suggested to take measures to effectively control air pollution, so as to enhance fiscal stability in the long run. © 2021 by the authors.

However, few in situ studies have been carried out to evaluate the effect of freeze-thaw cycle on soil respiration. Here, a field experiment was conducted to explore the response of winter soil respiration to freeze-thaw cycle and the underlying mechanisms in larch and Chinese pine plantation forests in a mid-temperate region. These results indicated that CO2 emissions during the freeze-thaw period accounted for 18.89–18.94% and 0.79–1.00% of the cumulative winter CO2 emissions and the annual soil CO2 emissions, respectively. Soil respiration rates during the thawing phase were 1.54–3.95 times higher than those during the freezing phase, which was mainly due to the increase of soil microbial biomass upon thawing. This effect declined during the second freeze-thaw cycle compared to the first freeze-thaw cycle due to the exhaustion of resources for microbes. The different responses of soil CO2 flux to freeze-thaw cycle between the two types of forests were mainly because of the difference in the thickness of litter layer, which plays an important role in regulating soil temperature and enzyme activity. These results suggest the intensity and frequency of freeze-thaw cycle strongly affect soil carbon emissions during the freeze-thaw cycle period. Therefore, these factors should be considered in laboratory studies and model simulations under climate change scenarios. © 2021","CO2 flux; Field experiment; Freeze-thaw cycle; Soil enzymatic activity; Soil microbial biomass","Carbon; Climate change; Climate models; Enzyme activity; Forestry; Freezing; Soils; Thawing; CO$-2$/ emission; CO2 flux; Field experiment; Freeze-thaw cycles; Plantation forests; Soil CO; Soil enzymatic activities; Soil microbial biomass; Soil respiration; Temperate regions; Carbon dioxide; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; enzyme activity; freeze-thaw cycle; plantation forestry; soil microorganism; soil respiration; soil temperature; breathing; forest; freezing; season; soil; Forests; Freezing; Respiration; Seasons; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109572716

At the same time, four new geometries in the shape of vertical spirals with diameters of 6, 8 and 10 m were designed and simulated to occupy a smaller area while maintaining performance similar to classical geometries. Due to climate change, heat pumps are becoming an important proxy in the heating of buildings and are an important part of decarbonisation plans; thus, it is essential to adapt them to urban and metropolitan conditions. Ground source heat pumps possess high efficiency but require a lot of space for their collectors. The collector geometries proposed in this work are a combination of horizontal and vertical technologies and are feasible. Only one geometry achieved performance similar to classical geometries: spiral with 10 m diameter. Factors significantly influencing collector operation were confirmed, namely season, soil type, soil water content, geometry and collector placement. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper investigates the factors that hinder the application of renewable energy technologies (RETs) in existing university buildings in Spain and Portugal. Following a qualitative methodology, 33 technicians working in the infrastructure management offices of 24 universities have been interviewed. The factors identified have been classified into economic-financial, administrative and legislative barriers, architectural, urban planning, technological, networking, social acceptance, institutional and others. It is concluded that there have not been sufficient economic incentives to carry out RETs projects in this type of building. Conditioning factors can act individually or jointly, generating a greater effect. Most participants consider that there are no social acceptance barriers. Knowledge of these determinants can facilitate actions that help implement this technology on university campuses in both countries. © 2021 by the authors.

Determination of sources is a key challenge. With respect to the South Pacific's largest and longest operating metallurgic smelter in Nouméa, New Caledonia, determining the environmental impact and subsequent human health risk associated with local ferronickel smelting is complicated by natural geological enrichment of Ni and Cr. This study applies a multi-method and multi-matrix approach to disentangle smelter emissions from geogenic sources and model the consequent health risk from industrial activity. Dust wipes (n = 108), roadside soil (n = 91), garden soil (n = 15) and household vacuum dust (n = 39) were assessed to explore geospatial trace element (As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, S, V and Zn) variations across outdoor and indoor environments. Enrichment factors (EF) identified elevated levels of smelter-related trace elements: S (EF = 7), Ni (EF = 6) and Cr (EF = 4), as well as Zn (EF = 4). Smelter-related elements in soil and dust deposits were negatively correlated with distance from the facility. Similarity of Pb isotopic compositions between dust wipes, surface soil and vacuum dust indicated that potentially toxic trace elements are being tracked into homes. Non-carcinogenic health risk modelling (Hazard Index, HI) based on 15 spatial nodes across Nouméa revealed widespread exceedance of tolerable risk for children (0–2 years) for Ni (HI 1.3–15.8) and Mn (HI 0.6–1.8). Risk was greatest near the smelter and to the north-west, in the direction of prevailing wind. Given the elevated cancer risk documented in New Caledonia, disentanglement of environmental from industrial sources warrants further attention to ensure community health protection. Our analysis illustrates how the confounding effects from complex environmental factors can be distilled to improve the accuracy of point source apportionment to direct future mitigation strategies. © 2021","Chromium; Ferronickel smelting; Human health risk; Nickel; Pacific islands","Chromium; Dust; Ferroalloys; Health; Industrial emissions; Lead alloys; Lead smelting; Nickel; Risk assessment; Soil pollution; Soils; Trace elements; Enrichment factors; Ferronickel; Ferronickel smelting; Hazard indices; Human health risks; Metallurgical industry; New Caledonia; Pacific islands; Trace elements contaminations; Traces elements; Health risks; chromium; dust; enrichment; geogenic source; health risk; nickel; smelting; soil pollution; trace element; New Caledonia [Melanesia]; New Caledonia [New Caledonia (DPN)]; Noumea; ferronickel; heavy metal; iron; nickel; trace element; child; dust; environmental monitoring; human; metallurgy; risk assessment; soil; Child; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Iron; Metallurgy; Metals, Heavy; Nickel; Risk Assessment; Soil; Trace Elements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109167415

As a mechanistic tool, we used the Unified Reaction Valley Approach (URVA) complemented with the Local Mode Analysis (LMA) assessing the strength of the CN bonds formed in these reactions. Our URVA studies could provide a comprehensive overview on bond formation/cleavage processes relevant to the specific mechanism of eight reactions R1– R8 that occur across the three pathways. In addition, we could explain the formation of CH2NH2+ and the appearance of HCNH+ and CHNH2+ along these paths. Although only smaller molecules are involved in these reactions including isomerization, hydrogen atom abstraction, and hydrogen molecule capture, we found a number of interesting features, such as roaming in reaction R3 or the primary interaction of H2 with the carbon atom in HCNH+ in reaction R8 followed by migration of one of the H2 hydrogen atoms to the nitrogen which is more cost effective than breaking the HH bond first; a feature often found in catalysis. In all cases, charge transfer between carbon and nitrogen could be identified as a driving force for the CN bond formation. As revealed by LMA, the CN bonds formed in reactions R1–R8 cover a broad bond strength range from very weak to very strong, with the CN bond in protonated hydrogen cyanide HCNH+ identified as the strongest of all molecules investigated in this work. Our study demonstrates the large potential of both URVA and LMA to shed new light into these extraterrestrial reactions to help better understand prebiotic processes as well as develop guidelines for future investigations involving areas of complex interstellar chemistry. In particular, the formation of CN bonds as a precursor to the extraterrestrial formation of amino acids will be the focus of future investigations.

Despite efforts to reduce nutrient pollution, carbon and nutrient concentrations have increased or remained high in many regions. Here, we applied a new ecohydrological framework to ~12,000 water samples collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from streams and lakes across the contiguous U.S. to identify spatial and temporal patterns in nutrient concentrations and leverage (an indicator of flux). For the contiguous U.S. and within ecoregions, we quantified trends for sites sampled repeatedly from 2000 to 2019, the persistence of spatial patterns over that period, and the patch size of nutrient sources and sinks. While we observed various temporal trends across ecoregions, the spatial patterns of nutrient and carbon concentrations in streams were persistent across and within ecoregions, potentially because of historical nutrient legacies, consistent nutrient sources, and inherent differences in nutrient removal capacity for various ecosystems. Watersheds showed strong critical source area dynamics in that 2–8% of the land area accounted for 75% of the estimated flux. Variability in nutrient contribution was greatest in catchments smaller than 250 km2 for most parameters. An ensemble of four machine learning models confirmed previously observed relationships between nutrient concentrations and a combination of land use and land cover, demonstrating how human activity and inherent nutrient removal capacity interactively determine nutrient balance. These findings suggest that targeted nutrient interventions in a small portion of the landscape could substantially improve water quality at continental scales. We recommend a dual approach of first prioritizing the reduction of nutrient inputs in catchments that exert disproportionate influence on downstream water chemistry, and second, enhancing nutrient removal capacity by restoring hydrological connectivity both laterally and vertically in stream networks.

Although increased fire activity is expected to promote plant invasion, over longer time periods, frequent fire can shift the nutrient status of ecosystems, which may alter interactions between invasive plants and soil microbial decomposers. Here, we applied a fire treatment to plots embedded in deciduous forests under regimes of either fire exclusion or frequent fire and invaded by the most widespread invasive grass in the eastern USA (Microstegium vimineum) to determine how frequent fire affects plant–soil interactions while controlling for time after fire. We predicted that frequent fire would increase microbial nitrogen (N) limitation, leading to lower Microstegium productivity and reduced soil carbon (C) and N loss. We found that Microstegium leaf, root, and microbial biomass C/N ratios were significantly wider under frequent fire than fire exclusion. Consistent with these patterns, dissolved organic N concentration was 22% lower and the activity of an exoenzyme targeting N acquisition was 59% higher under frequent fire, indicating that frequent fire increased microbial N limitation. Higher surface soil C and N and fire-induced increases in particulate soil organic matter N suggest that frequent fire in these grass-invaded forests enhanced microbial N limitation through the accumulation of microbially resistant pyrogenic N. A structural equation model confirmed that these changes were interrelated and associated with 87% lower Microstegium aboveground biomass and 85% higher fine root biomass. These findings provide new insights into how frequent fire impacts plant–soil microbial interactions and thus may feedback to plant invasion over longer time periods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Ecosystem stoichiometry; Exotic species; Grass-fire cycle; Microbial metabolism; Microstegium vimineum; Nitrogen limitation; Plant–soil feedback; Plant–soil interactions","aboveground biomass; deciduous forest; decomposition; fire; forest soil; grass; invasive species; soil microorganism; soil-vegetation interaction; temperate forest; United States; Microstegium; Microstegium vimineum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101779284

Plant-associated microbiota play a crucial role in plant growth and fitness, but we still have a limited understanding of the response of the crop-microbiota complex under extreme weather events, such as flooding. Soil microbes are highly sensitive to abiotic disturbance, and shifts in microbial community composition, structure and functions are expected when soil conditions are altered due to flooding events (e.g., anoxia, pH alteration, changes in nutrient concentration). Here, we established a pot experiment to determine the effects of flooding stress on the spring wheat-microbiota complex. Since plant phenology could be an important factor in the response to hydrological stress, flooding was induced only once and at different plant growth stages (PGSs), such as tillering, booting and flowering. After each flooding event, we measured in the control and flooded pots several edaphic and plant properties and characterized the bacterial community associated to the rhizosphere and roots of wheat plant using a metabarcoding approach. In our study, flooding caused a significant reduction in plant development and we observed dramatic shifts in bacterial community composition at each PGS in which the hydrological stress was induced. However, a more pronounced disruption in community assembly was always shown in younger plants. Generally, flooding caused a (i) significant increase of bacterial taxa with anaerobic respiratory capabilities, such as members of Firmicutes and Desulfobacterota, (ii) a significant reduction in Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, (iii) depletion of several putative plant-beneficial taxa, and (iv) increases of the abundance of potential detrimental bacteria. These significant differences in community composition between flooded and control samples were correlated with changes in soil conditions and plant properties caused by the hydrological stress, with pH and total N as the soil, and S, Na, Mn, and Ca concentrations as the root properties most influencing microbial assemblage in the wheat mircobiota under flooding stress. Collectively, our findings demonstrated the role of flooding on restructuring the spring wheat microbiota, and highlighted the detrimental effect of this hydrological stress on plant fitness and performance. © Copyright © 2021 Francioli, Cid, Kanukollu, Ulrich, Hajirezaei and Kolb.","bacteria; flooding; metabarcoding; plant traits; plant-microbe interactions; spring wheat","abscisic acid; auxin; calcium; chlorophyll; iron; manganese; phytohormone; sodium; zinc; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; Bacteroidetes; Betaproteobacteria; biofilm; Burkholderiales; Caulobacteraceae; Chloroflexi; climate change; Clostridia; discriminant analysis; DNA extraction; drought stress; Firmicutes; Flavobacterium; flooding; flower development; Gammaproteobacteria; hydrology; Lachnospiraceae; Mesorhizobium; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbiome; microflora; Nitrospira; nonhuman; phylogeny; physiological stress; Planctomycetes; plant microorganism interaction; Proteobacteria; Rhizobiales; shoot growth; soil treatment; spring wheat; Streptomyces; Verrucomicrobia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119438117

Approaches to mitigate these challenges and able to provide an alternative for the use of the space are deemed to be multidisciplinary, combining architecture, vegetation integration, circular economy and information and communications technologies (ICT). University campuses are a key scenario to evaluate such solutions as their student and research community is intrinsically willing to support these experiences and provide a wide knowledge on the fields necessary for their design and implementation. However, the creation of areas combining usability and sustainability is commonly lacking a multidisciplinary approach combining all these different perspectives. Hence, the present work aims to overcome this limitation by the development of a novel integrated approach for campus spaces for co-working and leisure, namely a “Smart Tree”, where novel architecture, furniture design, flora integration, environmental sensoring and communications join together. To this end, a survey of the literature is provided, covering related approaches as well as general principles behind them. From this, the general requirements and constraints for the development of the Smart Tree area are identified, establishing the main interactions between the architecture, greening and ICT perspectives. Such requirements guide the proposed system design and implementation, whose impact on the environment is analyzed. Finally, the research challenges and lessons learned for their development are identified in order to support future works. © 2021 by the authors.

Reference climatic elements for both periods were obtained and the impacts of the reservoir water mass on the region’s microclimate were evaluated. For this purpose, Sen’s slope estimate non-parametric test was used to detect the meteorological variables’ trends over 10 years, considering the division into the construction (2011–2015) and exploration (2016–2020) phases. A network of meteorological stations located close to the dam, in addition to a control station relatively distant from the dam, was used to collect the meteorological data. The control station is still integrated into the same regional climatic context but not exposed to the direct influence of the resulting reservoirs. As a result, temporal differences were determined for temperature and relative humidity. The results show a statistically significant increase in the minimum relative humidity, accompanied by a statistically significant decrease in the daily and seasonal temperature amplitudes between the construction and the exploration phase periods. These outcomes thereby suggest that large reservoirs affect the local climate and may create new microclimates, in the surrounding area, with both positive and negative potential effects. © 2021 by the authors.

They are used mainly as refrigerants or as foam-blowing agents. HFCs do not deplete the ozone layer, but they are very potent greenhouse gases, already contributing to global warming. Since 2019 HFCs are regulated under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which demands reliable emission estimates to monitor the phase-down. Quantification of emissions is performed with two methods: bottom-up from product inventories or data on chemical sales; or top-down, inferred from atmospheric measurements by inverse modelling or interspecies correlation. Here, we review and compare the two methods and give an overview of HFC emissions from different parts of the world. Emission estimates reported by the different methods vary considerably. HFC emissions of developed countries (Annex I) are reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. These bottom-up estimates add up to only half of global emissions estimated from atmospheric data. Several studies with regional top-down estimates have shown that this gap is not owed to large-scale underreporting of emissions from developed countries, but mostly due to emissions from developing countries (non-Annex I). China accounts for a large fraction of the emissions causing the gap, but not entirely. Bottom-up and top-down estimations of emissions from other developing countries that could identify other large emitters are largely unavailable. Especially South America, West-, Central- and East-Africa, India, the Arabian Peninsula and Northern Australia are not well covered by measurement stations that could provide atmospheric data for top-down estimates. © 2021 The Authors","Bottom-up estimation; Emission verifications; Global warming; Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); Hydrofluoroolefines (HFOs); Top-down estimation","Environmental regulations; Fluorocarbons; Greenhouse gases; Ozone layer; Refrigerants; Bottom up; Bottom-up and top-down; Bottom-up estimations; Developed countries; Emission verification; Hydrofluorocarbon; Hydrofluorocarbons; Hydrofluoroolefine; Top-down estimation; Topdown; Global warming; fluorinated hydrocarbon; chlorofluorocarbon; ozone; bottom-up approach; developing world; estimation method; global warming; greenhouse gas; hydrofluorocarbon; literature review; Montreal Protocol; pollution monitoring; top-down approach; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Africa; Article; Australia; China; climate change; developing country; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; India; South America; United Nations; Rwanda; Arabian Peninsula; Australia; China; India; Kigali; Rwanda; South America; Varanidae; Chlorofluorocarbons; Climate Change; Global Warming; Ozone; Rwanda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109076167

In practice, however, regulatory power is often constrained, making implementing the first-best policy portfolio difficult or impossible. We analyze analytically and numerically how available policy instruments should be adjusted vis-à-vis the first-best to account for under-internalized secondary market failures. Consider, for example, the power sector: alongside the external costs of emissions, evidence suggests that consumers undervalue energy efficiency investments, and knowledge spillovers hamper research and development (R&amp;D) and learning-by-doing in low-carbon technologies. By exploring the potential and limits of policy instrument substitution, we provide suggestions for adjusting policies in second-best situations. We calibrate the theoretical model to the European electricity sector and find that, compared with the first-best policy portfolio, relying on carbon dioxide (CO2) pricing alone increases the policy cost of the EU CO2 emissions target by about 30%. Uninternalized R&amp;D spillovers contribute the most to this increase, and are the most difficult to address indirectly, even with subsidies supporting learning-by-doing. By contrast, almost 40% of the additional cost created by the absence of optimal energy efficiency subsidies can be recuperated by a second-best electricity tax. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate and energy policy; Multiple market failures; Second-best policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117605121

With greater numbers of walruses hauling out in large aggregations, new opportunities are presented for monitoring the population. Here we evaluate different types of satellite imagery for detecting and delineating the peripheries of walrus aggregations at a commonly used haulout near Point Lay, Alaska, in 2018–2020. We evaluated optical and radar imagery ranging in pixel resolutions from 40 m to ~1 m: specifically, optical imagery from Landsat, Sentinel-2, Planet Labs, and DigitalGlobe, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X. Three observers independently examined satellite images to detect walrus aggregations and digitized their peripheries using visual interpretation. We compared interpretations between observers and to high-resolution (~2 cm) ortho-corrected imagery collected by a small unoccupied aerial system (UAS). Roughly two-thirds of the time, clouds precluded clear optical views of the study area from satellite. SAR was unaffected by clouds (and darkness) and provided unambiguous signatures of walrus aggregations at the Point Lay haulout. Among imagery types with 4–10 m resolution, observers unanimously agreed on all detections of walruses, and attained an average 65% overlap (sd 12.0, n 100) in their delineations of aggregation boundaries. For imagery with ~1 m resolution, overlap agreement was higher (mean 85%, sd 3.0, n 11). We found that optical satellite sensors with moderate resolution and high revisitation rates, such as PlanetScope and Sentinel-2, demonstrated robust and repeatable qualities for monitoring walrus haulouts, but temporal gaps between observations due to clouds were common. SAR imagery also demonstrated robust capabilities for monitoring the Point Lay haulout, but more research is needed to evaluate SAR at haulouts with more complex local terrain and beach substrates. © 2021 by the authors.

Borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) provides a solution for long-term thermal energy storage and its operational optimization is crucial for fully exploiting its potential. This paper presents a novel linearized control-oriented model of a BTES, describing the storage temperature dynamics under varying operating conditions, such as inlet temperature, mass-flow rate and borehole connection layouts (e.g. in-series, in-parallel or mixed). It supports an optimization framework, which was employed to determine the best operating conditions for a heat pump-driven BTES, subject to different CO2 intensity profiles of the electricity. It was demonstrated that this boundary condition, due to its seasonal variation, is critical for the optimal operation of the system, as increasing heat pump efficiency in winter while accepting a lower one in summer can be beneficial. Results for an exemplary district case, subject to two different CO2 intensity profiles, show that a lower relative intensity in summer compared to the one in winter leads to a higher optimal operating temperature of the storage. The district system studied is heating-dominated, effectively enabling the BTES to cover only 20% of the total heat demand, leading to limited total yearly CO2 emissions savings of 2.2% to 4.3%. When calculating the benefits associated with the heating and cooling demand handled by the BTES, a higher CO2 emission reduction in the range of 12.8%–19.9% was found. This highlights the BTES potential when subject to more balanced loads. © 2021 The Authors","Borehole thermal energy storage; CO2 emissions reduction; Energy flexibility; Operational optimization; Seasonal load shift; Seasonal thermal energy storage","Boreholes; Carbon dioxide; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Thermal energy; Borehole thermal energy storage; CO2 emission reduction; Control oriented models; Energy flexibility; Load shift; Operating condition; Operational optimization; Seasonal load shift; Seasonal thermal energy storage; Thermal energy storage; Heat storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115129632

To address this knowledge gap, the geochemical and microbial composition of a high-temperature, circumneutral hot spring in Yellowstone National Park was examined to identify the sources of solutes and their effect on the ecology of microbial inhabitants. Metagenomic analysis showed that populations comprising planktonic and sediment communities are archaeal dominated, are dependent on chemical energy (chemosynthetic), share little overlap in their taxonomic composition, and are differentiated by their inferred use of/tolerance to oxygen and mode of carbon metabolism. The planktonic community is dominated by putative aerobic/aerotolerant autotrophs, while the taxonomic composition of the sediment community is more evenly distributed and comprised of anaerobic heterotrophs. These observations are interpreted to reflect sourcing of the spring by anoxic, organic carbon-limited subsurface hydrothermal fluids and ingassing of atmospheric oxygen that selects for aerobic/ aerotolerant organisms that have autotrophic capabilities in the water column. Autotrophy and consumption of oxygen by the planktonic community may influence the assembly of the anaerobic and heterotrophic sediment community. Support for this inference comes from higher estimated rates of genome replication in planktonic populations than sediment populations, indicating faster growth in planktonic populations. Collectively, these observations provide new insight into how mixing of subsurface waters and atmospheric oxygen create dichotomy in the ecology of hot spring communities and suggest that planktonic and sediment communities may have been less differentiated taxonomically and functionally prior to the rise of oxygen at;2.4 billion years ago (Gya). IMPORTANCE Understanding the source and availability of energy capable of supporting life in hydrothermal environments is central to predicting the ecology of microbial life on early Earth when volcanic activity was more widespread. Little is known of the substrates supporting microbial life in circumneutral to alkaline springs, despite their relevance to early Earth habitats. Using metagenomic and informatics approaches, water column and sediment habitats in a representative circumneutral hot spring in Yellowstone were shown to be dichotomous, with the former largely hosting aerobic/ aerotolerant autotrophs and the latter primarily hosting anaerobic heterotrophs. This dichotomy is attributed to influx of atmospheric oxygen into anoxic deep hydrothermal spring waters.

Most of these processes result in the evolution of elastic waves which can be detected by appropriate sensors. The analysis of several parameters characterizing the waves offers valuable information about the possible deformation mechanism. The acoustic emission testing of composites may yield very different number of signals from a few hundred to more than 100,000. This latter was proved to be affected mainly by particle size, interfacial adhesion and composition, but other factors, such as matrix modulus and specimen size, also influence it. Local deformation processes are claimed to have a strong effect on macroscopic properties. Indeed, a close correlation was found between the initiation stress of the dominating particle related process derived from acoustic emission testing and the tensile strength in both polypropylene (PP) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites. However, in polyamide (PA)-based heterogeneous polymer systems, deformations related to the matrix dominated composite properties. Besides forecasting failure, the method makes possible the determination of the inherent strength of lignocellulosic fibers being around 40 MPa as well as the quantitative estimation of adhesion strength for composites in which interactions are created by mechanisms other than secondary forces. The proposed approach based on acoustic emission testing proved that in PP/CaCO3 composites, the strength of adhesion can be increased by ten times from about 100 mJ/m2 to almost 1000 mJ/m2 in the presence of a functionalized polymer. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we selected a rapidly developing Chinese megacity, Chengdu, as the study area to investigate the spatiotemporal and policy-related variations of PM2.5 composition and sources based on long-term observation at multiple sites. A total of 836 samples were collected from 19 sites in winter 2015-2019. According to the specific characteristics, 19 sampling sites were assigned to three layers. Layer 1 was the most urbanized area and referred to the core zone of Chengdu, layer 2 was located in the outer circle of layer 1, and layer 3 belonged to the outermost zone with the lowest urbanization level. The average PM2.5 concentrations for 5 years were in the order of layer 2 (133μgm-3) >layer 1 (126μgm-3) >layer 3 (121μgm-3). Spatial clustering of the chemical composition at the sampling sites was conducted for each year. The PM2.5 composition of layer 3 in 2019 was found to be similar to that of the other layers 2 or 3 years ago, implying that urbanization levels had a strong effect on air quality. During the sampling period, a decreasing trend was observed for the annual average concentration of PM2.5, especially at sampling sites in layer 1, where the stricter control policies were implemented. The SO42-/NO3- mass ratio at most sites exceeded 1 in 2015 but dropped to less than 1 since 2016, reflecting decreasing coal combustion and increasing traffic impacts in Chengdu, and these values can be further supported by temporal variations of the SO42- and NO3- concentrations. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was applied to quantify PM2.5 sources. A total of five sources were identified, with average contributions of 15.5% (traffic emissions), 19.7% (coal and biomass combustion), 8.8% (industrial emissions), 39.7% (secondary particles), and 16.2% (resuspended dust). From 2015 to 2019, a dramatic decline was observed in the average percentage contributions of coal and biomass combustion, but the traffic emission source showed an increasing trend. For spatial variations, the high coefficient of variation (CV) values of coal and biomass combustion and industrial emissions indicated their higher spatial difference in Chengdu. High contributions of resuspended dust occurred at sites with intensive construction activities, such as subway and airport construction. Combining the PMF results, we developed the source-weighted potential source contribution function (SWPSCF) method for source localization. This new method highlighted the influences of spatial distribution for source contributions, and the effectiveness of the SWPSCF method was evaluated. © 2021 Xinyao Feng et al.",,"chemical composition; environmental policy; megacity; particulate matter; source apportionment; spatial variation; temporal variation; Chengdu; China; Sichuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118807668

However, the fate and cycling dynamics of BC, particularly in marine environments, are poorly understood. Herein, soot BC was determined in the semi-enclosed Jiaozhou Bay to examine the seasonal variability, residence timescale in seawater, and settling flux to sediments, together with particle-reactive 234Th. Soot BC ranged from 0.39 to 4.26 μmol-C L−1. On average, spring produced the highest value of 1.88 ± 0.31 μmol-C L−1, followed by winter (1.59 ± 0.18 μmol-C L−1), summer (0.94 ± 0.09 μmol-C L−1), and autumn (0.90 ± 0.09 μmol-C L−1). The seasonality of soot BC was similar to the activity concentration of particulate 234Th (i.e., 234ThP). The close relationships between soot BC and 234ThP (p &lt; 0.01) provide the basis for the application of 234Th to trace the fate of soot BC. Based on the 234Th deficit with respect to 238U, the residence times of soot BC were estimated to be 41 ± 6 d and 36 ± 5 d for May–August and August–November, respectively. The shorter residence times of soot BC than that of seawater indicated that soot BC delivered to Jiaozhou Bay settled in the local sediments. Furthermore, soot BC concentrations were higher in the inflow seawater from the Yellow Sea than the outflow water from Jiaozhou Bay, implying a net input of soot BC from the Yellow Sea to Jiaozhou Bay. The soot BC fluxes were 0.266 ± 0.035 mmol-C m−2 d−1 and 0.0472 ± 0.0065 mmol-C m−2 d−1 for May–August and August–November, respectively. From the bay-scale perspective, Jiaozhou Bay had buried 0.101 ± 0.010 Gg of soot BC each year. These results indicate that the semi-enclosed Jiaozhou Bay acts as an effective trap for soot BC and particle-reactive contaminants. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Black carbon; Jiaozhou Bay; Persistent organic pollutant; Soot; Yellow Sea","Carbon; Dust; Organic pollutants; Seawater; Aquatic environments; Black carbon; Case-studies; Hot spot; Jiaozhou Bay; Marine environment; Organics; Residence time; Seasonal variability; Yellow sea; Soot; black carbon; radioisotope; sea water; thorium 234; unclassified drug; uranium 238; carbon; black carbon; concentration (composition); marine pollution; persistent organic pollutant; residence time; seasonal variation; soot; Article; autumn; bay; China; concentration (parameter); environmental impact; pollution transport; quality control; retention time; seasonal variation; sediment; soot; spring; summer; time; water contamination; water flow; water sampling; winter; Yellow Sea; China; environmental monitoring; China; Jiaozhou Bay; Pacific Ocean; Shandong; Yellow Sea; Bays; Carbon; China; Environmental Monitoring; Seawater; Soot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110670348

We take the 2008 snow disaster in China as an extreme climate shock, calculate the GAD index by the entropy weighting method, and use the difference-in-difference method to study the extreme climate shock’s impact on GAD. The results show that: (1) Extreme climate shocks are detrimental to GAD, with the snow disaster decreasing China’s GAD level by 3.07%. (2) The impacts of extreme climate shocks are heterogeneous across climate and economic zones, with greater impact in humid and developed regions. (3) Extreme climate shocks affect GAD mainly by reducing farmers’ willingness to cultivate, and increasing energy consumption, fertilizer, and pesticide input. (4) Extreme climate shocks do not reduce agricultural yields in the long run. Still, they reduce the total value of agricultural production and decrease the quality of agricultural products expressed in terms of unit value.

However, the relatively recent discovery of direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) brings a new opportunity to improve the efficiency of biogas technology. DIET may replace mediated interspecies electron transfer (MIET) by efficient electron transfer between exoelectrogens and electrotrophic methanogens, thereby enhancing yields and rates of biogas production. Ethanol, as the initial electron donor in the discovery of the DIET pathway, is now a “hot topic” in the literature. Recent studies have indicated that ethanol in AD functions not only as the substrate, but also as the precursor to stimulate DIET by enriching exoelectrogens and electrotrophic methanogens for co-digesting complex organic wastes. This review aims to highlight the state of the art and recent advances in ethanol-based DIET in AD. The DIET associated reactions of ethanol oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction are assessed by thermodynamic analysis to reveal the extent of the potential for improvement of the AD processes that utilizes DIET pathways. Three ethanol-based DIET strategies are discussed: (1) ethanol as the sole substrate supplemented with conductive materials in AD, (2) ethanol co-digestion with complex substrates and (3) ethanol-type fermentation prior to AD.

While general agreement exists about the importance of assessing vulnerability to understand climate risks, there is still a tendency to neglect global and regional vulnerability patterns because they are hard to quantify, despite their value in informing adaptation, disaster risk and development policies. Several approaches to quantifying global vulnerability exist. These differ in terms of the indicators they use and how they classify countries or regions into vulnerability classes. The paper presents the structure of selected approaches and explores two indices in depth. The aim of this paper is to assess the level of agreement between selected international indicator-based assessments of vulnerability, at the level of climate regions. Results suggest that the two major global vulnerability assessments analysed largely agree on the location of the most and least vulnerable regions when these assessments are aggregated to a regional scale using the IPCC’s climate regions. The paper then discusses the robustness of the information derived and its usefulness for adaptation, disaster risk and development policies. Measuring progress towards reducing vulnerability to climate change and hazards is key for various agencies and actors in order to be able to develop informed policies and strategies for managing climate risks and to promote enabling conditions for achieving the SDGs and building resilience. © 2021, The Author(s).","Climate change; Global mapping; Hotspots; Indicators; Vulnerability","Disasters; Hazards; Risk assessment; Climate change impact; Climate regions; Climatic hazards; Development policies; Global mapping; Hotspots; Risk policies; Vulnerability; Vulnerability assessments; Vulnerable regions; Climate change; adaptive management; assessment method; climate change; disaster management; global perspective; natural disaster; vulnerability; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114385685

Design/methodology/approach: This purpose of this study aimed to assess the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis following the ecological footprint perspective with a data set covering the period 1995–2018. It is well-established that anthropogenic human activities are the root cause of environmental deterioration. To this end, the current study is fitted in a multivariate framework to ameliorate for omitted variable bias for the data set from 1995–2018 on a quarterly frequency using autoregressive distributive lag methodology. Subsequently, the stationarity status of the study underlines series were examined with a conventional unit root test and the Pesaran’s bounds test for cointegration analysis. Findings: Empirical evidence from the bounds test to cointegration traces the co-integration relationship between ecological footprint, conventional energy use, foreign direct investment, international tourism arrival and water resources over the sampled period. The study, in the long run, affirms the N-shaped relationship between ecological footprint and foreign direct investment in Vietnam. Additionally, the present study validates the hypothesis of energy consumption-induced pollution emissions. The relationship between international tourism arrival and quality of the environment is statistically positive in both the short-run and long-run, as 1% in international tourism arrival worsens the quality of the environment by 0.45% and 0.4% in the short-run and long-run, respectively. Interestingly, water resource's major environmental issues that have plagued the Vietnam economy are inversely related to ecological footprint. Based on findings, Vietnamese policymakers may need to consider drafting appropriate environmental policies to tackle global warming while concurrently boosting economic development. Originality/value: The present study focuses on Vietnam on the determinant of environmental quality measured by a broader indicator (ecological footprint). It is well-established that anthropogenic human activities are the root cause of environmental deterioration. The present study claims to distinct from previous literature in two-folds, namely, in terms of scope. Vietnam holds a very interesting energy mix and environmental dynamics, which has been ignored in the literature. Second, we argue to be the first based on our survey to explore the theme by incorporation of water resources and foreign direct investment intensification in the conventional pollution determinant model. This is in a bid to highlights the policy blueprint for the country (Vietnam), which is currently plagued with high pollution issues and the region at large. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ecological footprint; Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC); N-shape; Tourism; Vietnam","Deterioration; Economics; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Global warming; Investments; Tourism; Water pollution; Water resources; Climate change mitigation; Cointegration analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Environmental deterioration; Environmental dynamics; Environmental kuznets curve hypothesis; Environmental sustainability; Foreign direct investments; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110166115

Ternary diagrams of texture analysis, A–CN–K, and A–CNK–FM including mafic index of alteration (MIA) and elemental ratios, suggest that most of the sediments are sandy-silt to silty-sand in nature and show incipient to moderate degree of chemical weathering. Additionally, the higher concentrations of lithic fragments (17%), feldspar (9%), and the presence of pyroxene and amphibole are also suggestive of increased physical weathering rather than chemical weathering. An increase in silt, clay and organic carbon contents register an increase in immobile elements (Al2O3, TiO2, FeOt, K2O, REEs, and Al2O3/SiO2), suggesting grain size control in the sediment geochemistry. The increase in sand and secondarily produced carbonates reduces the absolute concentration of all other elements due to the quartz and calcite dilution effect, respectively. Four major tectonoclimatic zones, namely 1 to 4 (oldest to youngest), have been identified based on the observed changes. The extrapolated Bayesian-base age model suggests that the bottom zone 1 (~25–17.64 m depth) was deposited between &gt;115 and 60 ka (MIS-5a-e) during the enhanced phase of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), as indicated by higher Rb/Sr ratio and dominance of kaolinite-illite over smectite. However, the deposition of gravel/coarser sediment horizons is also linked to base level change due to localized tectonic activities. The terminal part of zone 1 shows relatively drier conditions that continued through zone 2 (~60–54 ka; MIS-4), represented by lower values of immobile elements and Rb/Sr and kaolinite/smectite ratios. However, during Zone 3 (~54–38 ka; MIS-3), the sediment became coarser, implying enhanced rainfall or tectonic activity and a higher sedimentation rate. The top-most zone 4 (~38.0–6.7 ka MIS-3, 1) marks a fluctuating trend as indicated by the presence of gravely sand in the lower part of this zone (at ~5 m and ~3 m depth) due to intense rainfall or tectonic activity at ~37–38 ka. However, the upper part of this zone is dominated by sand and silt as evidenced by the decreasing chemical index of alteration (CIA) values and lower Rb/Sr ratio (&lt;0.5), shows a reduction in the monsoon precipitation and stable tectonic conditions, besides the initiation of an arid phase in western India. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Gujarat alluvial plain; Indian summer monsoon; Multiproxy data; Palaeoclimate; Sediment geochemistry","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Calcite; Chemical analysis; Erosion; Feldspar; Geochemistry; Isotopes; Kaolinite; Organic carbon; Sandstone; Sediments; Tectonics; Textures; Titanium dioxide; Watersheds; Weathering; Alluvial plains; Gujarat; Gujarat alluvial plain; Indian summer monsoon; Mahi River basins; Multi proxies; Multiproxy data; Palaeoclimate; Sediment geochemistries; Tectonic activity; Silt; alluvial deposit; alluvial plain; amphibole; calcite; concentration (composition); dilution; feldspar; illite; kaolinite; marine isotope stage; mineralogy; sediment chemistry; texture; weathering; Gujarat; India; Mahi River",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115606440

The proposed system is incorporated with solar-thermal, conventional-thermal, wind, and electric vehicle (EV) and is provided with appropriate system nonlinearities for a realistic approach. In addition to renewables, the inclusion of EVs helps to reduce CO2 emissions and dependence on fossil fuels, resulting in a cleaner environment. Such a class system requires a robust controller. In this regard, the transient and steady-state dynamics with respect to various classical and cascaded secondary controllers have been evaluated. The response comparison among different secondary controllers reports the cascaded ID-PD controller as the optimal one. Magnetotactic bacteria optimization (MBO) technique is used for parallely optimizing the secondary controller gains. A new study is explored to inspect the impact of EVs in regulating the system stability for the proposed system. The analysis confirms the inclusion of EVs in both the control area for better system dynamics. Sensitivity analysis is done to reflect the robustness of MBO-optimized cascaded ID-PD controller gains. It shows that optimized gains do not need to be rearranged for variations in system parameters. A separate study is carried out for any alterations in DISCO participation matrix (DPM), which is inevitable in a practical deregulated power system.

The low carbon heat recovery technologies such as heat recovery from sewage via heat pump can play an important role. It is based on recovering heat from the sewage that is added by the consumer, used and flushed in the sewer. This technology is currently successfully operating in many cities around the world. In the UK, there is also a rising interest to explore this technology after successful sewage heat recovery demonstration project at Borders College, Galashiels, Scotland.2 However, further experimental research is needed to build the evidence base, replicate, and de-risk the concept elsewhere in the UK. The Home Energy 4 Tomorrow (HE4T) project at London South Bank University was created to address this evidence gap. This is the fourth article in the series of outputs on sewage heat recovery and presents some results using sewage data from the UK’s capital London. These data are scarce and provide useful information on the variation of flows and temperatures encountered in the sewers of the UK’s capital. Lastly, we discuss the recoverable heat potential along with policy implications for the UK heat strategy. Practical application: This work focuses and accentuate that in order to meet climate change targets, substantial improvements can come by heat recovery from the raw (influent) and treated wastewater (effluent from wastewater treatment plant) that is still unexploited in the UK. The estimation presented indicates that there is much theoretical potential in the UK with significant opportunity for future energy and revenue retrieval along with GHGs emission reduction in the longer term to fulfil the ‘net zero’ objective. This work aims to raise awareness and seek support to promote pilot scale studies to help demonstrate technical and economic feasibility in the building industry. © The Author(s) 2021.","heat pump; low carbon heat; raw wastewater; treated wastewater; Wastewater heat recovery; wastewater temperature; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant","Binary alloys; Carbon; Climate change; Construction industry; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Sewage; Sewers; Waste heat; Wastewater treatment; Demonstration project; Economic feasibilities; Experimental research; Low-carbon technologies; Policy implications; Recovery technology; Treated wastewater; Wastewater treatment plants; Sewage treatment plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111709687

Therefore, we studied the spatial patterns and potential drivers of leaf stoichiometry and herb biomass from 15 sites spanning from south to north along a 500 km latitudinal gradient of the Loess Plateau. We found that leaf N and P stoichiometry and the biomass of herb plants varied greatly on the Loess Plateau, showing spatial patterns, and there were significant differences among the four vegetation zones. With increasing latitude (decreasing mean annual temperature and decreasing mean precipitation), aboveground and belowground biomass displayed an opening downward parabolic trend, while the root–shoot ratio gradually decreased. Furthermore, there were significant linear relationships between the leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contents and latitude and climate (mean annual rainfall and mean annual temperature). However, the leaf N/P ratio showed no significant latitudinal or climatic trends. Redundancy analysis and stepwise regression analysis revealed herb biomass and leaf N and P contents were strongly related to environmental driving factors (slope, soil P content and latitude, altitude, mean annual rainfall and mean annual temperature). Compared with global scale results, herb plants on the Loess Plateau are characterized by relatively lower biomass, higher N content, lower P content and a higher N/P ratio, and vegetative growth may be more susceptible to P limitation. These findings indicated that the remarkable spatial distribution patterns of leaf N and P stoichiometry and herb biomass were jointly regulated by the climate, soil properties and topographic properties, providing new insights into potential vegetation restoration strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, O3 source impacts and contributions were comprehensively assessed over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China using brute-force method (BFM), response surface modeling with BFM (RSM-BFM) and differential method (RSM-DM) respectively, high-order decoupled direct method (HDDM), and ozone source apportionment technology (OSAT). The multi-modeling comparison results indicated that under typical nonlinear atmospheric conditions during the O3 formation, BFM, RSM-BFM, and HDDM seemed to be appropriate for assessing the impact of single source emissions; however, the results of HDDM could deviate from those of BFM when the emission reduction ratio was higher than 50 %. Under multi-source control scenarios, the results of source contribution analyses obtained from RSM-DM and OSAT were reasonably well, but the performance of OSAT was limited by its capability in representing the nonlinearity of O3 response to emission reductions of its precursors, particularly NOx. The results of this pilot study in the PRD showed that the RSM-DM appeared to replicate the nonlinearity of O3 chemistry reasonably well (e.g., O3 disbenefits due to local NOx emission reductions in Guangzhou city). Based on the source contribution results, on-road mobile (including both NOx and VOC emissions) and industrial process (mainly VOC emissions) sources were identified as two major contribution sectors by both RSM-DM and OSAT, contributing an average of 31.5 % and 11.4 % (estimated by RSM-DM) and 29.2 % and 13.0 % (estimated by OSAT) respectively to O3 formation in 9 cities of the PRD. Therefore, the reinforced emission reductions on NOx and VOC from on-road mobile and industrial process sources in the central cities (i.e., Guangzhou, Foshan, Dongguan, Shenzhen, and Zhongshan) were suggested to effectively mitigate the ambient O3 levels in the PRD.

The arid and semi-arid regions of China are undergoing the effects of climate change across the entire northern hemi-sphere. Their ecological environments are fragile and in conflict with anthropogenic activities, which significantly altered more ecosystems services in these regions. Therefore, estimating the effects of anthropogenic activities on ecosystem services is important for formulating ecological policy and regional environmental mitigation plans of these regions. This study employed the model of ecosystem service value (ESV) assessment and the bivariate spatial autocorrelation method to reveal the spatiotemporal variations in the characteristics of ecosystem value in the arid and semi-arid ecological regions of China and its interaction with human activities. Results showed that (1) the total value of ES of the study area increased from USD 487,807 billion in 2000 to USD 67,831,150 billion 2020; (2) the ES value provided by forest land first increased by 5.60% from 2000 to 2020; (3) the ESV provided by grassland showed an overall decline over the 20 years. Food and raw material production showed the lowest ES value, and climate regulation and soil conservation decreased from 2000 to 2020; (4) the index of human footprint patches decreased from 45.80% in 2000 to 17.63% in 2020, while the high and very high human footprint index areas increased significantly, mainly due to the rapid urbanization and improvement of railway networks in these areas. Spatially, the regions with high human footprint were mostly dispersed in the northeastern of China such as Shanxi and Gansu, whereas the regions with a low human footprint remained mainly located in the central and southwestern parts of China; (5) significant spatial dependencies between changes in ESV and the human footprint index were recorded. Our study could provide a scientific basis for ecosystem functions regulation and land development security in arid and semi-arid ecological regions. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to unveil the dependence of the radiant field on the features of the urban fabrics, this study analyses the space distribution of the Mean Radiant Temperature (TMRT) and the radiant field in various urban tissues of the city of Catania (Italy) in a typical Mediterranean climate. The study is based on simulations through the Solar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry model (SOLWEIG) implemented in UMEP. Results show that the worst conditions occur in areas with moderately deep urban canyons, abundant impervious surfaces and lack of vegetation: here, the TMRT can easily reach 78 °C while in more than 80% of the area it exceeds 60 °C. By modelling the time trends of the shortwave and longwave radiant heat fluxes perceived by a pedestrian, it has been possible to observe that the highest contribution to the outdoor radiant field comes from the downward solar irradiance. However, the downward and upward longwave radiant flux closely follows: this suggests the importance of providing shading rather than using highly reflective surfaces that can exacerbate heat stress by means of the increased reflected shortwave radiation. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Licence.",,"Heat flux; Histology; Sols; Tissue; Case-studies; Comfort conditions; Heat balance; Long waves; Mean radiant temperature; Mediterranean climates; Outdoor comforts; Space distribution; Urban areas; Urban fabrics; Climatology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120847700

For laboratory tests, strain constraints can be generated using disk-shaped rubber samples, that is, pancake specimens. Due to suppressed transverse contractibility, the dominating hydrostatic tensile stress, which is the highest in the center part of a pancake specimen, causes an internal failure process controlled by the formation and growth of cavities. Laboratory X-ray microtomography (μCT) is a powerful tool to monitor the evolution of a cavity population considering various aspects of geometrical as well as microstructural constraints. In the case of carbon black–reinforced styrene-butadiene rubber, microscopic cavities are surrounded by a region of significantly lower material density. Due to detection limits, this region cannot be analyzed in depth with μCT. In this study, synchrotron X-ray microtomography (SRμCT) in combination with a modular load frame is used, for the first time, to investigate the damaging phenomenon of cavitation in rubbers. Due to the high phase contrast that can be achieved only by SRμCT, the microstructure of regions of lower material density can be analyzed and, as a result, tiny satellite cavities are identified in the walls of neighboring microscopic cavities. © 2021 The Authors.

Elkofale, Keto Shan and Komba were chosen and 128 farmers from each kebeles were involved in a survey. A simple random sampling technique was used to select representative farmers of the study area. In this study, interview, focus group discussion, questionnaires and site observation were employed as data collection tools. SPSS Version 20 was used for data analysis. The majority of the respondent farmers revealed that their productivity status had fluctuated patterns due to untimely rainfall and scarcity of water occasionally. The present study confirmed that choices of agricultural activities by farmers were linked with the change in climate and irregular distribution of rainfall patterns. The ecology of farmland in Sadi Chanka has been degraded critically. This work had also clearly demonstrated the existence of farmers’ choices of agricultural activities, including coffee production, poultry production and production of fruits like mango and papaya.

We examine whether “debt-for-climate” swaps, instruments whereby debtor countries are relieved from their contractual debt obligations in return for local climate-related spending commitments, may be helpful in tackling worrying debt levels and climate concerns simultaneously. We point out that debt swaps do not have a great historical track record but that common flaws such as their piecemeal nature, lack of additionality and creation of parallel implementation structures, could be overcome by scaling up and careful design. To realize swaps’ full potential, a distinction needs to be made between situations where debt is clearly unsustainable and where it is high but sustainable. In the former case, deep and comprehensive debt restructuring should be the primary focus, rather than closely matching debt service savings with increased climate spending; in the latter case, stand-alone debt swaps may be used to transfer resources from creditors to debtor countries that are committed to climate investments but lack fiscal space. Another helpful differentiation is that between middle-income debtor countries, where debt swaps could finance climate mitigation interventions, and low-income debtors, where investments in adaption deserve prioritization. Finally, debt swap proposals need to be mindful of creditor incentives, including positive reputational payoffs, achieving greater scale using a multi-creditor set-up, at the same time as carefully considering governance credentials in each country context. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate finance; Debt restructuring; Debt sustainability; Debt swaps; Developing countries","climate change; developing world; prioritization; sustainability",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118486949

In C4 plants, primary carboxylation occurs in mesophyll cytosol, and little is known about the role of CO2 diffusion in facilitating C4 photosynthesis. We have examined the expression, localization, and functional role of selected plasma membrane intrinsic aquaporins (PIPs) from Setaria italica (foxtail millet) and discovered that SiPIP2;7 is CO2-permeable. When ectopically expressed in mesophyll cells of S. viridis (green foxtail), SiPIP2;7 was localized to the plasma membrane and caused no marked changes in leaf biochemistry. Gas-exchange and C18O16O discrimination measurements revealed that targeted expression of SiPIP2;7 enhanced the conductance to CO2 diffusion from the intercellular airspace to the mesophyll cytosol. Our results demonstrate that mesophyll conductance limits C4 photosynthesis at low pCO2 and that SiPIP2;7 is a functional CO2 permeable aquaporin that can improve CO2 diffusion at the airspace/mesophyll interface and enhance C4 photosynthesis. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

Previous research has investigated microfiber capture close to the source (i.e., the washing machine), and demonstrated washing machine filters as a potential mitigation strategy. Widespread deployment into homes may be an effective solution to prevent microfiber emissions. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of washing machine filters at the level of a community. We installed filters in 97 homes in a small town, representing approximately 10% of households connected to the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). We evaluated treated final effluent and found a significant reduction in microfibers after filter installation. Furthermore, lint samples from filters revealed an average weekly lint capture of 6.4 g, equivalent to 179,200–2,707,200 microfibers. This research shows that microfiber filters on washing machines are effective at scale, and this result can help inform policy decisions to reduce microfiber emissions from laundering textiles.

For emissions inventories and for research, the influences of some extended driving conditions on emissions are an interesting issue. In the present work, some examples of RDE results from two common passenger cars with gasoline and diesel propulsion are given. The varying driving conditions were ""winter/summer"", ""mild/aggressive"", and ""higher altitude/slop"". The driving conditions: ""winter"", ""aggressive"", and ""higher slope/altitude"" generally require more energy, cause higher fuel consumption, and therefore, higher CO2-emissions. The condition of ""winter driving"", especially in the urban type of operation, may cause some longer phases with not enough warmed-up exhaust aftertreatment and consequently some increased gaseous emissions. The DPF eliminates the nanoparticles (PN) independently on the driving conditions. Nevertheless, the DPF regeneration has an influence on the CO2-normality of the trip.

Egypt has started the National Road Project to add 7000 km new roads to the 23.500 km existing network. The present study aimed at assessing anthropogenic impacts of the establishment and development of one of the newly developed arterial roads (Wadi Al-Natroun Al-Alamin road) on the LULC of surrounding region in relation to climate change during the period from 1986 to 2019. Using RS (remote sensing) techniques and four satellite images from 1986, 1999, 2011, and 2019, five classes were identified (vegetation, urban, water, agriculturally affected soils, and bare soils). The study area was divided based on different human activities into six areas of interest (AOIs). Results showed that massive changes have occurred during the 33-year period along the six AOIs and the five identified classes. Four climatic variables (annual mean temperature, maximum temperature of the warmest month, annual precipitation, precipitation of the wettest month) have been used to investigate climatic conditions of the study area in 1986 and 2018 and link it to the continuous development in the study area. Results showed an average increase of 2°C in annual temperature and maximum temperature of the hottest month. In contrary, a significant decrease in the annual precipitation and precipitation of the wettest month has been documented. Statistical analysis results showed significant correlations between climatic conditions and economic development along the study area. Climate change and human development stress on both natural and artificial ecosystems of the study area have been discussed, and recommended measures for sustainable development and natural resources perseveration have been provided. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Anthropogenic impacts; Arterial roads; Climate change; Economic development; Environmental monitoring; Remote sensing, Sustainability","anthropogenic effect; climate change; economic development; environmental monitoring; land use change; road construction; satellite imagery; statistical analysis; sustainable development; Egypt; climate change; ecosystem; Egypt; environmental monitoring; human; soil; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Egypt; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109301819

While multi‐objective optimization can be used to solve complicated problems, its use is not yet widespread in the indus-try. This study first aims to develop an efficient and applicable multi‐objective building energy system optimization method, used to dimension energy production and storage retrofit components in a case campus building in Lahti, Finland. Energy consumption data of the building are obtained with a dynamic energy model. The optimization model includes economic and environmental ob-jectives, and the approach is found to function satisfactorily. Second, this study aims to assess the feasibility and issues of multi‐objective single‐building energy system optimization via the analysis of the case optimization results. The results suggest that economically beneficial local energy production and storage retrofits could not always lead to life cycle CO2‐eq emission reductions. The recognized causes are high life cycle emissions from the retrofit components and low Nordic grid energy emissions. The performed sensitivity and feasibility analyses show that correctness and methodological comparability of the used emission factors and future assumptions are crucial for reliable optimization results. © 2021 by the authors.

This measure requires data from metrological stations that can be used in the optimization of the thermal insulation. The main objectives of this study are to construct thermal climatic zones for Libya and to specify the optimum insulation thickness for external walls for the different zones. This work is comprehensive as the metrological data from all existing 33 weather stations has been collected and used for identifying thermal zones. For the optimization of the construction of external walls, the most commonly used local wall structures are investigated: hollow concrete block, limestone block and hollow brick. In addition, four thermal insulation materials: extruded polystyrene, expanded polystyrene, rock wool and foamed polyurethane are used with every wall type. Optimum insulation thickness, energy savings, energy cost and payback periods were estimated for the 33 locations using life cycle cost analysis. A map is constructed for the thermal zones based on degree-day values for the entire country. The results show that limestone blocks with expanded polystyrene insulation form the optimum wall construction as it provides the minimum total cost for all locations. Depending on the Degree-day values, the optimum insulation thickness varies between 5.4 and 15.3 cm across the country with energy saving varies between 28 and 178 $/m2. Using the optimum thickness, the average CO2 emissions can potentially be reduced by about 85%. Finally, a contour map represents the optimum thickness of expanded polystyrene is presented in this work. © The Author(s) 2020.","carbon emission; degree-days map; optimum insulation; Thermal climate zones; wall insulation","Carbon dioxide; Concrete blocks; Cost benefit analysis; Energy efficiency; Investments; Life cycle; Lime; Limestone; Mineral wool; Polystyrenes; Walls (structural partitions); Expanded polystyrene; Extruded polystyrenes; Foamed polyurethane; Optimum insulation thickness; Optimum thickness; Thermal insulation materials; Wall construction; Weather stations; Thermal insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098285274

The desire to obtain relatively cheap energy by burning mainly coal often wins over the need to maintain a good state of the environment. In recent years, Poland has been catching up with economic development in relation to the countries that were members of the EU before 2004. Despite the good economic indicators that Poland has achieved in recent years, much remains to be done to ensure sustainable low-carbon development. Expenditures on the development of innovative technologies that would contribute to reducing excessive emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere are not sufficient. The article presents the determinants of innovative activity in Poland and indicates the main problems associated with the implementation of sustainable low-carbon development. The article also presents the perspectives of low-carbon development in Poland in relation to the innovation potential, with particular emphasis on renewable energy sources, and indicates the main factors that may contribute to a faster departure from inefficient technologies of energy production based on fossil fuels.

A highly efficient gas turbine means a higher inlet temperature and requires a more efficient cooling structure. Due to the limitations of aerodynamics, structure and strength, cracks, fractures and ablation easily form at the trailing edge of gas turbines. Thus, it is vital to enhance the heat transfer in the trailing edge of gas turbines. In practical applications, internal cooling structures (pin fins, latticework ducts) and film cooling are used simultaneously. In addition, some innovative cooling structures have been proposed, such as dimples/protrusions, labyrinth channels and so on. Research progress on turbine trailing edge cooling structures is presented in this paper. For pin finned duct, the heat transfer and flow structure characteristics are introduced for single rows, multirows, static and rotating conditions. Investigations on latticework ducts are quite inadequate. Therefore, only the main flow and heat transfer characteristics are shown in this paper.

In this study, we present an empirical work for assessing ecological responses with botanical legacy data in the Qilian Mountains of China. Plot-scale and transect-wide survey was conducted for alpine shrub communities along an elevational gradient 20 years ago. Recently, we resampled the permanent plots to investigate how the community changes may be linked to climatic variability. We found no significant temporal shifts in species richness; but the community structure underwent substantial changes, as indicated by visible shifts in the relative density of dominant shrub species and the frequency of occurrence of understory herbaceous species. This reshuffling of plant community composition reflected a series of complex responses to climate change. Specifically, wet-demanding species have become more frequent due to the recently enhanced precipitation, while the replacement of some low-statured plants with different requirements for light was indirectly regulated by climate warming via reshaping the altitudinal patterns of dominant shrubs. Climate-mediated shifts in shrub species distribution altered the expected evolutional trajectory of alpine community, which increased the complexity and nonlinearity of the responses of the communities at different altitudes to climatic variability. Our results suggested that in-depth knowledge of indirect effects can facilitate to lessen the uncertainty in predicting future community dynamics in a changing climate. © 2021, ISB.","Alpine community; Altitudinal pattern; Climate change; Habit preference; Resurvey study; Species richness","altitude; China; climate change; ecosystem; plant; Altitude; China; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105861367

However, few modeling studies have been performed on the sources of PM2.5, especially the impacts of emission reduction strategies. In this study, the Nested Air Quality Prediction Model System (NAQPMS) with an online tracer-tagging module was adopted to investigate source sectors of PM2.5 and a series of sensitivity tests were conducted to investigate the impacts of different sector-based mitigation strategies on PM2.5 pollution. The response surfaces of pollutants to sector-based emission changes were built. The results showed that resident-related sector (resident and agriculture), fugitive dust, traffic and industry emissions were the main sources of PM2.5 in Zhengzhou, contributing 49%, 19%, 15% and 13%, respectively. Response surfaces of pollutants to sector-based emission changes in Henan revealed that the combined reduction of resident-related sector and industry emissions efficiently decreased PM2.5 in Zhengzhou. However, reduced emissions in only the Henan region barely satisfied the national air quality standard of 75 μg/m3, whereas a 50%–60% reduction in resident-related sector and industry emissions over the whole region could reach this goal. On severely polluted days, even a 60% reduction in these two sectors over the whole region was insufficient to satisfy the standard of 75 μg/m3. Moreover, a reduction in traffic emissions resulted in an increase in the O3 concentration. The results of the response surface method showed that PM2.5 in Zhengzhou decreased by 19% in response to the COVID-19 lockdown, which approached the observed reduction of 21%, indicating that the response surface method could be employed to study the impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on air pollution.

We used a 28 yr record of δ15N values from two Mojave Desert populations of Encelia farinosa to clarify sources of population-level variability. We leveraged &gt; 3500 foliar δ15N observations collected alongside structural, physiological, and climatic data to identify plant and environmental contributors to δ15N values. Additional sampling of soils, roots, stems, and leaves enabled assessment of the distribution of soil N content and δ15N, intra-plant fractionations, and relationships between soil and plant δ15N values. We observed extensive within-population variability in foliar δ15N values and found plant age and foliar %N to be the strongest predictors of individual δ15N values. There were consistent differences between root, stem, and leaf δ15N values (spanning c. 3‰), but plant and bulk soil δ15N values were unrelated. Plant-level variables played a strong role in influencing foliar δ15N values, and interannual relationships between climate and δ15N values were counter to previously recognized spatial patterns. This long-term record provides insights regarding the interpretation of δ15N values that were not available from previous large-scale syntheses, broadly enabling more effective application of foliar δ15N values. © 2021 The Authors.

We applied a Markov state-switching model to telemetry data of a long-distance migrant, the barnacle goose, to detect migratory movement and relate it to three proximate environmental factors: photoperiod, daily mean temperature and forage plant phenology. Spring migratory movements towards the breeding grounds were most closely related to forage plant phenology (measured by accumulated growing degree days, GDDs); high GDDs values were associated with a greater probability of transiting to a more northerly site, suggesting that spring migration is closely aligned with primary productivity. Autumn migration from the breeding grounds was most closely related to temperature; higher temperature values were associated with a greater probability of remaining settled at the current site, suggesting that autumn migration is closely aligned with atmospheric conditions. Understanding the relative influence of different environmental factors on migratory patterns may in turn provide us with insight into how continued climate disruption could influence northern migratory systems. © 2021 Nordic Society Oikos.

However, the capacity of urban soils to support successful afforestation and sequester carbon is poorly understood. This study quantified soil carbon in a series of experimental restoration sites established between 2009 and 2011 as part of the MillionTreesNYC Afforestation Project in New York City. Soil cores (0–100 cm) were collected at 10 sites and analyzed for total carbon content. Data were analyzed with respect to depth (0–10, 10–30, 30–70, 70–90, 90–100 cm), high (six species) versus low (two species) diversity planting palettes, and afforestation success (high or low). Results were compared with data from regional reference forest, degraded urban sites in New York City, and disturbed and undisturbed sites in other cities. High success afforestation sites had significantly larger carbon pools than low success afforestation sites and degraded NYC sites. We suggest that these differences were created by interactions between initial site conditions that facilitated plant community establishment and growth, which in turn increased soil carbon accumulation. These initial site conditions include land use history that influences soil physical and chemical factors, as well as proximity to existing forest stands. Diversity treatments had no effect on soil carbon levels, but these may need a longer time period to emerge. These results suggest that afforestation may enhance the capacity of urban soils to store carbon compared to urban degraded soils, but that urban soil properties and site characteristics constrain this capacity. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Carbon storage; Cities; MillionTreesNYC; Urban forest management; Urban forest restoration","afforestation; carbon sequestration; land use; soil carbon; urban area; New York [New York (STT)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115153793

Potential pathways for decarbonizing the built environment can be discovered through the aid of building energy modeling, which helps identify potential retrofit strategies and simulate integration with renewable energy sources. Energy modeling is complicated however, due to compound interactions between building materials, structural design, and urban form. Significant domain knowledge, modeling expertise, and extensive time investment are required for accurate modeling to accommodate this complexity. In this work, we explore the potential of accurately modeling building energy consumption at scale through the application of modern computer vision algorithms. We demonstrate that our computer vision system can accurately predict energy consumption through the extraction of meaningful features contained in satellite imagery. To accomplish this, we introduce a data-collection pipeline and a computer vision architecture to process satellite photos and contextual information from the urban texture. We also demonstrate a method of comparing the relative significance of the automatically extracted features in informing building decarbonization decision making and policy. Our results indicate that this approach reveals valuable insights into the dynamics of building energy consumption on the city scale and enables the rapid analysis of urban energy dynamics with readily available data. © 2021 ACM.","building energy modelling; computer vision; convolutional neural network; feature extraction","Computer vision; Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Domain Knowledge; Extraction; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Structural design; Textures; Building energy consumption; Building energy model; Built environment; Convolutional neural network; Decarbonising; Energy analysis; Energy-consumption; Features extraction; Holistic model; Retrofit strategies; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120963722

The present work proposes a new set of Pitzer interaction parameters through the set of CO2 solubility data in saline systems such as CO2-H2O-NaCl and CO2-H2O-Na2SO4. The determined model is capable of covering a wide T − P − I range (273.15–473.15 K, 0.1–40 MPa and 0–6 mol/kg).

However, this approach has not been validated for non-precious metal catalysts such as Cu-based bimetallic catalysts. Moreover, the morphology of sharpened catalysts was relatively random and non-uniform, making it difficult to quantify the curvature of nanostructures. Here, we experimentally studied the relationship between sharpness of Sn/Cu catalysts with their activity through the fabrication of Sn/Cu foil, rods, and cones. The Sn/Cu catalysts were fabricated by template-based nanoimprint lithography, electroplating of Cu film, and electroless coating of Sn nanoparticles. The finite-element-based simulation provides evidence that the local electric field intensified as the curvature of catalysts increased. As a result, Sn/Cu cones exhibited much better faradaic efficiency of CO (FECO) = 82.7% and current density of CO (jCO) = 5.43 mA/cm2 than Sn/Cu foil (FECO = 41.3% and jCO = 2.29 mA/cm2) and Sn/Cu rods (FECO = 59.7% and jCO = 3.87 mA/cm2). This work reveals that the local electric field induced by the sharp tip plays a significant role in improving the FECO and lowering the onset potential of CO2 reduction reaction. © 2021","Bimetallic; Carbon dioxide reduction; Carbon monoxide; Geometric structure; Local electric field; Sn/Cu catalyst","Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Electric fields; Electrolytic reduction; Nanoimprint lithography; Pollution control; Precious metals; Tin compounds; Bimetallics; Carbon dioxide reduction; CO$-2$/ reduction; Cu catalyst; Cu catalysts; Cu-catalysts; Geometric structure; Local electric field; Sn/cu catalyst; ]+ catalyst; Carbon monoxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110034650

The ability to ensure sustainable economic development and prosperity while significantly reducing consumption of energy resources and generated greenhouse gas emissions is a global challenge that affects every country in the world. To assess whether economies are ready for this challenge, there is an urgent need to examine this dual relationship between economic growth and climate change measures. European Green Deal strategy has set the ambitious goal of Europe becoming the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, boosting competitiveness and long-term prosperity of the economy. Kaya identity and LMDI decomposition is applied to examine how European Union countries have been coping with these countereffects historically. The decomposition analysis is conducted for the EU-28 (including the UK) countries for a 10-year study period from 2010 to 2019. This study analyses the main drivers of changes in GHG emissions in European Union and estimates the progress made in implementing the Green Deal targets. The results show that in the EU, energy efficiency improvements have twice the effect on reducing GHG emission compared to RES strategies. The effect of economic growth was the main offsetting factor hindering the achievement of larger GHG emission reductions. More in-depth ex-ante and ex-post investigation is performed for the Baltic States. A novel forecasting technique is applied to project GHG emissions under three different development scenarios, such as the scenario with existing measures, the scenario with additional measures, and the business-as-usual scenario. The results show that the current climate policies in the Baltic States are not sufficient to achieve the 2030 emission reduction targets and that greater efforts should be made to enforce climate mitigation measures in the economies. © 2021 The Authors","Forecasting; GHG emissions; Green Deal; Kaya identity; LMDI","Binary alloys; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Baltic state; Economic growths; Emission reduction; GHG emission; GHGs emissions; Global economies; Green deal; Kayum identity; LMDI; Reduction measures; Forecasting; climate change; decomposition analysis; economic development; economic growth; emission control; European Union; global economy; Baltic States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114020035

Methods: We created a local Urban Mobility Consortium with experts from different disciplines to discuss the development of healthy, accessible communities, electri-fication, ride-sharing, and overarching issues related to urban mobility. A workshop and survey data collected during COVID-19 are presented in this paper. Results: Several evidence-informed recommendations are provided. Broadly, these were: (1) support the creation and development of accessible and safe active-transportation infrastructure; (2) incentivize and prioritize the use of active, public, and shared transportation over use of personal vehicles; (3) ensure connectivity of active transportation infrastructure with major destinations and public transportation options; (4) work towards electrification of personal and public transportation; and (5) work across siloes to improve integrated mobility to impact climate and health related outcomes, and enhance overall efficiency. Conclusions: An integrated approach is needed to improve mobility, access, and environmental impact. This needs to be carried out in the local context and requires government and non-governmental leadership. © 2021 by the authors.

Vietnam consumed of 65.5 million tons coal in 2020, whilst a large amount of MSW was not able to use for energy production. Therefore, a searching for alternative fuels that could replace fossil fuel and reduce gases emission is an urgent need. In this study, the conversion of MSW into solid fuel was performed using hydrothermal treatment. Our results revealed that MSW treating by hydrothermal method at 220 °C produced solid fuel with calorific value of 4491 kcal/kg. As compared to coals using for thermal power plants, the quality of solid fuel was better. This implies the potential uses of solid fuel, which could be combusted independently or co-combusted with coals at the power sector. The simulation of MSW treatment by hydrothermal process with 240 MT/d was evaluated, two scenarios of treatment plant for solid fuel (HRtS) and electricity production (HRtE) were modeled and analyzed in terms of techno-economic feasibility. HRtS plant would generate 26,667 MT/y of solid fuel and total sale revenue of 2.47 million USD/y. Meanwhile, the HRtE plant would generate 19,880 MWh/y with 3.4 million USD/y. © 2021, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Hydrothermal reaction; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Techno-economic analysis (TEA)","Alternative fuels; Coal; Coal industry; Developing countries; Fossil fuel power plants; Thermoelectric power plants; Waste treatment; Electricity production; Hydrothermal methods; Hydrothermal process; Hydrothermal processing; Hydrothermal treatments; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Techno-economic feasibility; Thermal power plants; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113906230

This paper presents a case study conducted in Na Nhan commune in the northwest montane region of Vietnam to assess land-use strategies toward multiple ecosystem services, through integrated land-use planning. The assessment employed the Land-Use Planning for Multiple Ecosystem Services (LUMENS) framework and a number of methods and tools, including land-use mapping, GIS-based land-use change analysis, survey questionnaire, rapid carbon-stock appraisal for different land uses, qualitative ecosystem services assessment, and a backcasting technique. Our findings suggest that a lack of participation and acknowledgement of customary land-use practices inhibit successful implementation of current land-use planning and relevant policies such as payment for forest environmental services and the nationally determined contributions. The study also confirmed the contributions of forests and the land-use sector in achieving national emission reduction targets, especially when local stakeholders are involved early in the planning process. Other findings with important policy implications are: (i) tree-based land uses such as agroforestry are key to securing multiple ecosystem services and are highly relevant to local stakeholders, yet their potentials were not made explicit in current debates at the local level; (ii) local stakeholders are highly aware of the co-benefits of ecosystem services to climate-change mitigation and this should be considered in nationally determined contributions; and (iii) an approach for integrated, participatory land-use planning can help catalyze stakeholder engagement, and hence improve governance in rural landscapes. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Ecosystem services; Land-use planning; Multifunctional landscapes; Nationally determined contributions; Participatory scenario development; Vietnam","Climate change; Ecosystems; Emission control; Forestry; Mapping; Public policy; Surveys; Back-casting techniques; Climate change mitigation; Emission reduction targets; Environmental services; Land use change analysis; Land-use strategies; Participatory land use planning; Stakeholder engagement; Land use; ecosystem service; GIS; land use change; land use planning; landscape change; landscape planning; mountain region; participatory approach; rural area; Viet Nam; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; forest; Viet Nam; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Vietnam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093983497

Due to the impulse force of low-carbon regulation, the measurement of input–output efficiency changed into green total factor productivity (GTFP) which considers environmental factors. Past research on GTFP focused on enterprise investments to promote green innovation for their resource allocation efficiency, but green investments are often limited from marketization that is interactively influenced by low-carbon regulation. Therefore, handing green investment to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions for green economics recovery is a big challenge. Then these hypotheses are tested by the main study of 170 cities in China. Results suggested that GTFP has an inverted S-shaped curve with three inflection points and four development stages under the influence of low-carbon regulation. It means that improving green productivity is costly toward making green investments without the driving of green innovation. However, the inflection point of the growth curve—when enterprise investment activities ignore the interaction between low-carbon regulation and green investment policy—will come slowly to a period of high-quality development. Moderating results suggested that the green productivity would be weakened and the inflection point would be delayed by the low-carbon marketization index if the low-carbon regulation intensity was neglected. Therefore, this research advanced an effectively co-ordinate growth curve to search for the inflection point of green economics recovery. © 2021 by the authors.

Specifically, this paper differs from previous studies in two aspects. First, the extant literature has focused on how economic processes accompanying rapid urbanization affect carbon emissions in urban areas but gives little attention to the other dimensions of urbanization, including social and environmental changes, which may have important effects on carbon emissions. We assessed the effects of 17 key processes accompanying urbanization in a full range of economic, social, and environmental dimensions on carbon dioxide emissions in urban areas. The results showed that social processes accompanied with rapid urbanization had distinct effects on carbon emissions, compared to economic and environmental processes. Specifically, improvement in public services, indicated by education and cultural developments, reduces the increase in carbon emissions during urbanization, while economic growth and urban construction reinforces the growth in carbon emissions. Second, we examined the impact of various urbanization processes on carbon dioxide emissions using a unique dataset of 182 prefecture-level cities that covers a wide span of regions in China. The results of our analyses on the city level have important implications for the formulation of comprehensive policies aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emission in urban areas, focusing on different urbanization processes in economic, social, and environmental phases. © 2021 by the authors.

Furthermore, the ESIPT was more competitive under the exposure of pulsed pumping near-IR femotosecond laser in DMF. The further survey showed that the target dyes yielded gradually the regular molecular aggregates in the mixed DMF/H2O (the water volume fractions, 60–80%) with evolving time. In particular, the target molecular aggregates exhibited the strong enol emission but the quenched keto emission under one-photon exposure and near-IR two-photon irradiation, respectively. In addition, the near-IR two-photon absorption (TPA) induced enol emission of the target dyes showed an enhancement in the aggregation state. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to strengthen TPA induced emission of enol phototautomers of some ESIPT compounds by the molecular aggregation under the irradiation of near-IR femotosecond laser. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","AIEE; ESIPT; Molecular aggregation; Near-IR two-photon absorption; Phototautomer","Aggregates; Chromophores; Excited states; Irradiation; Luminescence of organic solids; Optical pumping; Photons; AIEE; Excited-state intramolecular proton transfer; Femotosecond lasers; Molecular aggregate; Molecular aggregation; Near-IR; Near-IR two-photon absorption; Open chain; Phototautomer; Two photon absorption; Two photon processes; Article; chromatophore; hydrogen bond; irradiation; light absorption; light exposure; nonhuman; proton transport; steady state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114157374

To understand how to organize a global coal phase-out, it is crucial to go beyond cost-effective climate mitigation scenarios and learn from the experience of previous coal transitions. Despite the relevance of the topic, evidence remains fragmented throughout different research fields, and not easily accessible. To address this gap, this paper provides a systematic map and comprehensive review of the literature on historical coal transitions. We use computer-assisted systematic mapping and review methods to chart and evaluate the available evidence on historical declines in coal production and consumption. We extracted a dataset of 278 case studies from 194 publications, covering coal transitions in 44 countries and ranging from the end of the 19th century until 2021. We find a relatively recent and rapidly expanding body of literature reflecting the growing importance of an early coal phase-out in scientific and political debates. Previous evidence has primarily focused on the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany, while other countries that experienced large coal declines, like those in Eastern Europe, are strongly underrepresented. An increasing number of studies, mostly published in the last 5 years, has been focusing on China. Most of the countries successfully reducing coal dependency have undergone both demand-side and supply-side transitions. This supports the use of policy approaches targeting both demand and supply to achieve a complete coal phase-out. From a political economy perspective, our dataset highlights that most transitions are driven by rising production costs for coal, falling prices for alternative energies, or local environmental concerns, especially regarding air pollution. The main challenges for coal-dependent regions are structural change transformations, in particular for industry and labor. Rising unemployment is the most largely documented outcome in the sample. Policymakers at multiple levels are instrumental in facilitating coal transitions. They rely mainly on regulatory instruments to foster the transitions and compensation schemes or investment plans to deal with their transformative processes. Even though many models suggest that coal phase-outs are among the low-hanging fruits on the way to climate neutrality and meeting the international climate goals, our case studies analysis highlights the intricate political economy at work that needs to be addressed through well-designed and just policies. © 2021 The Author(s).

In this study, we utilize the MixSIAR package in R for source apportionment based on Pb isotopic signatures in lichen and road sediment in two urban-industrial centers in SW Ohio (OH). We show that ranges of pollutant contributions are more useful than only visualizing mean or raw values of source apportionment, because this avoids overinterpretation of data when certain sources have a large range of uncertainty. We point out both the dominance of industrial pollution as well as the legacy of leaded gasoline pollution in typical mid-sized U.S. cities, which is evident in both road sediment and lichens. Leaded gasoline contribution to Pb in Middletown, OH lichens mostly vary between ~10 and 25%, while in Hamilton, OH the contribution to lichens and road sediment tends to be relatively negligible except for two road sediment samples and one lichen sample, where median contributions are ~20–30%. Industrial combustion pollution source contributions vary between ~25 and 75% in Hamilton, and ~50–100% in Middletown, OH. Furthermore, comparing pollution sources in lichens to modern particulate matter can provide a record of how pollutant sources change over time, such as our traffic lichen (Sample Li-9) plotting closer to leaded gasoline on a bivariate mixing diagram than modern traffic particulate matter, or our coke plant lichen containing slightly less Pb contribution from industrial combustion sources relative to modern coke plant particulate matter. Lastly, when applicable, multi-source mixing models should be complimented in future studies with additional isotopic source tracers such as Cu, Zn, Nd, and Os to further elucidate unique sources of metal pollutants in addition to Pb. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Lichens; MixSIAR; Pb isotopes; Pollution source apportionment; Road dust; Urban pollution","Coke; Combustion; Fungi; Gasoline; Mixing; Pollution; Roads and streets; Sediments; Leaded gasoline; MixSIAR; Multi-Sources; Particulate Matter; Pb isotopes; Pollution source apportionments; Pollution sources; Road dusts; Road sediments; Urban pollutions; Isotopes; dust; isotopic analysis; lead isotope; lichen; sediment pollution; source apportionment; urban pollution; Middletown; Pennsylvania; United States; isotope; lead; environmental monitoring; lichen (organism); pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Isotopes; Lead; Lichens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111006331

While numerous studies indicate a positive effect of species diversity on a wide range of ecosystem functions and services, little is known about how species interactions influence tree responses to climatic variability. We quantified the intraspecific variation in 16 leaf and wood physiological, morphological and anatomical traits in mature beech trees (Fagus sylvatica L.) at six sites located along a climatic gradient in the French Alps. At each site, we studied pure beech and mixed stands with silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) or downy oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.). We tested how functional traits differed between the two species mixtures (pure vs. mixed stands) within each site and along the climatic gradient. We found significant changes in many traits along the climatic gradient as conditions progressively got drier and warmer. Independent of the mixture, reduced leaf-level CO2 assimilation, stomatal size and thicker leaf cuticles, consistent with a more conservative resource use strategy, were found. At the drier sites, higher foliar stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13C), thicker mesophyll tissues and lower specific leaf area (SLA) in pure stands suggest that beech had more acquisitive traits there compared to mixed stands. At the wetter sites, trees in beech-silver fir mixtures had higher chlorophyll concentration, lower δ13C, larger xylem vessels and higher SLA, suggesting a more acquisitive resource use strategy in mixed stands than in pure stands. Our work revealed that species interactions are significant modulators of functional traits, and that they can be just as important drivers of intraspecific trait variation as climatic conditions. We show that downy oak mixtures lead to an adaptive drought response by common beech in dry environments. In contrast, in milder climates, interactions with silver fir seem to increase beech resource acquisition and productivity. These findings highlight a strong context dependency and imply that incorporating local interspecific interactions in research on climate impacts could improve our understanding and predictions of forest dynamics.

APSIM-Sugar was recently upgraded to simulate sugarcane in Brazil and to cater for climate impacts under water-limited environments. In this context, our first objective was to evaluate the recent upgrade on determined traits for the most cultivated Brazilian variety under water-limited conditions. As a second objective, we applied these model settings to project the sugarcane crop performance under likely changing climates in important producing regions. The stalk mass estimates for four published experiments across Brazil were satisfactory, with a R2 of 0.96, the agreement d index of 0.99, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.8 t/ha. Future climate projections (until 2099), considered two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), were derived based on a recently proposed subset approach of five climate models (GCMs) from CMIP5. The subset aimed to capture the full ensemble of temperature and rainfall changes by considering basic classes of climate changes (relatively cool/wet, cool/dry, middle, hot/wet, and hot/dry). A typical system with 12-month old crops was simulated for rainfed and irrigated sites. The ensemble of future projections indicated that cane yields would decline compared to the present average simulations (1980−2009) for rainfed sites, mainly due to increased water stress. Yields at fully irrigated sites are also projected to decline slightly. However, the expected changes were highly variable between GCMs with the End-of-Century period presenting large uncertainty. In short, while providing an up-to-date projection of future climate change impacts on sugarcane in Brazil, such results should be interpreted with caution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Climate variability; Crop modelling; Reduced growth phenomenon; Saccharum spp.","Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Mean square error; 'Dry' [; Climate impacts; Climate variability; Climate variability and change; Crop model; Rainfed; Reduced growth phenomenons; Saccharum spp.; Sugarcane yield; Under water; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; crop yield; simulation; sugar cane; Brazil; Saccharum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113386029

The advances in phenology matching models provide a feasible means to monitor crop phenological progress using remote sensing observations, with a priori information of reference shapes and reference phenological transition dates. Yet the underlying geometrical scaling assumption of models, together with the challenge in defining phenological references, hinders the applicability of phenology matching in crop phenological studies. The objective of this study is to develop a novel hybrid phenology matching model to robustly retrieve a diverse spectrum of crop phenological stages using satellite time series. The devised hybrid model leverages the complementary strengths of phenometric extraction methods and phenology matching models. It relaxes the geometrical scaling assumption and can characterize key phenological stages of crop cycles, ranging from farming practice-relevant stages (e.g., planted and harvested) to crop development stages (e.g., emerged and mature). To systematically evaluate the influence of phenological references on phenology matching, four representative phenological reference scenarios under varying levels of phenological calibrations in terms of time and space are further designed with publicly accessible phenological information. The results indicate that the hybrid phenology matching model can achieve high accuracies for estimating corn and soybean phenological growth stages in Illinois, particularly with the year- and region-adjusted phenological reference (R-squared higher than 0.9 and RMSE less than 5 days for most phenological stages). The inter-annual and regional phenological patterns characterized by the hybrid model correspond well with those in the crop progress reports (CPRs) from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Compared to the benchmark phenology matching model, the hybrid model is more robust to the decreasing levels of phenological reference calibrations, and is particularly advantageous in retrieving crop early phenological stages (e.g., planted and emerged stages) when the phenological reference information is limited.

It is highly desirable but challenging to create a local polarization field to accelerate charge separation and build reactive sites for CO2 reduction dynamics. Herein, atomic level bismuth-oxygen vacancy pairs are engineered into Bi24O31Br10 (BOB) atomic layers to create a local polarization field. It facilitates photogenerated electrons to migrate from BOB to vacancy pair sites and favors the activation of CO2 molecules. Simultaneously, it works as reactive sites to tune the non-covalent interaction of intermediates and optimizes the reaction process. The vacancy pairs tuned surface atomic structures enable the formation of a highly stable Bi−C−O−Bi intermediate state and consecutive Bi−C−O intermediate, thus changing the rate-determining step from CO* formation to COOH* formation. Benefiting from these features, the VBiO-BOB delivers a 20.9-fold CO2 photoreduction activity enhancement relative to highly crystalline BOB in pure water with highly stability.

This paper adopted the perspective of value-added trade to calculate the amount of embodied carbon trade of China from 2006 to 2015 and perform a structural decomposition analysis of the changes in China's embodied carbon trade. This study found that: (1) China's embodied carbon exports are much larger than its embodied carbon imports, and there are differences between countries. China imported the largest amount of embodied carbon from South Korea, and it exported the largest amount of embodied carbon to the United States. (2) The structural decomposition analysis shows that changes in the valueadded carbon emission coefficient during the study period would have caused China's embodied carbon trade to decrease, and changes in value-added trade would have caused China's embodied carbon trade to increase. Therefore, countries trading with China need to strengthen their cooperation with China in energy conservation, emission reduction, and product trade. In order to accurately reflect China's embodied carbon trade, it is necessary to calculate embodied carbon trade from the perspective of value-added trade. © 2021 Deng et al.

Sustainable renewable fuels are used to further reduce their Well-to-Wheels greenhouse gas emissions. The novel aspect of this paper is the compatibility investigation of existing advanced emission control technologies for achieving low pollutant emissions with the use of sustainable renewable fuels with vehicle tests. This is done on a diesel demonstrator vehicle, equipped with Lean NOx trap and dual-SCR technologies in combination with a 48V mild-hybrid powertrain. Tailpipe pollutant and CO2 emissions are measured for market diesel fuel with 7% renewable fatty-acid-methyl-ester (FAME) (B7), diesel fuel with 30% FAME (B30), and 100% renewable hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO). Results show no significant difference in pollutant emissions between the different fuels used. In a second part of the study, a Well-to-Wheels (WTW) analysis is conducted. This includes different pathways for the biomass-to-liquid fuels that were tested on the vehicle, as well as a power-to-diesel (e-diesel) assessment. Results show that significant WTW CO2 reductions are possibly compared to the state-of-the-art market diesel fuel. Part of this reduction is already possible for the existing fleet as most of paraffinic compounds are drop-in for market diesel fuel. © 2021 by the authors.

A high efficiency natural gas furnace (NGF) and an electric air source heat pump (ASHP) were coupled together to meet the space heating demand of the house. This integrated system is called the cloud based Smart Dual Fuel Switching System (SDFSS) that considers time-of-use (TOU) pricing, fuel cost, short-term weather forecast, and equipment efficiencies and capacities. This multi-variable decision-making process defines an optimal schedule for the hybrid system to run more cost effectively. This paper analyses two separate SDFSSs. According to these analyses, the SDFSS systems showed lower operating cost with respect to the furnace or the ASHP system alone with various carbon tax (CT) levels from $0 to $250/tonne of CT with an increment of $10/tonne of CT that were simulated, along with a significant GHG emission reduction relative to the conventional heating systems. Furthermore, with these technologies, Canada's residential sector could potentially meet Canada's Paris Agreement goals.

The article highlights how the state circulated the imaginaries of support towards coal import, domestic mining, and combustion for electricity using the scripts of energy security for national development. At the same time, it also sheds light on how proponents of an anti-coal imaginary used their scripts of energy transition, energy justice, and energy democracy. Using primary data from interviews, supplemented by a review of policy documents, news reports, and popular articles, this paper maps the scripts that proponents employ to produce these imaginaries. On the one hand, scripts on affordability, access, and reliability have shored up the pro-coal imaginary in the Philippines, which, altogether, converge into a grand imaginary of securing domestic energy supply to address the country's economic development. On the other hand, the scripts of polycentric social mobilizations for just and democratizing energy transition against pollution, human rights abuses (especially on Indigenous Peoples), and climate action buttressed an anti-coal imaginary.

To understand the formation and composition of planetary systems, it is essential to have insights into the chemical composition of their host stars. In particular, C/O elemental ratios are useful for constraining the density and bulk composition of terrestrial planets. Aims. We study the carbon abundances with a twofold objective. On the one hand, we want to evaluate the behaviour of carbon in the context of Galactic chemical evolution. On the other hand, we focus on the possible dependence of carbon abundances on the presence of planets and on the impact of various factors (such as different oxygen lines) on the determination of C/O elemental ratios. Methods. We derived chemical abundances of carbon from two atomic lines for 757 FGK stars in the HARPS-GTO sample, observed with high-resolution (R ∼ 115 000) and high-quality spectra. The abundances were derived using a standard Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium analysis with automatically measured Equivalent Widths injected into the code MOOG and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9 atmospheres. Oxygen abundances, derived using different lines, were taken from previous papers in this series and updated with the new stellar parameters. Results. We find that thick-and thin-disk stars are chemically disjunct for [C/Fe] across the full metallicity range that they have in common. Moreover, the population of high-α metal-rich stars also presents higher and clearly separated [C/Fe] ratios than thin-disk stars up to [Fe/H] ∼ 0.2 dex. The [C/O] ratios present a general flat trend as a function of [O/H] but becomes negative at [O/H]≳ 0dex. This trend is more clear when considering stars of similar metallicity. We find tentative evidence that stars with low-mass planets at lower metallicities have higher [C/Fe] ratios than stars without planets at the same metallicity, in the same way as has previously been found for α elements. Finally, the elemental C/O ratios for the vast majority of our stars are below 0.8 when using the oxygen line at 6158 Å, however, the forbidden oxygen line at 6300 Å provides systematically higher C/O values (going above 1.2 in a few cases) which also show a dependence on Teff. Moreover, by using different atmosphere models the C/O ratios can have a non-negligible difference for cool stars. Therefore, C/O ratios should be scaled to a common solar reference in order to correctly evaluate its behaviour. We find no significant differences in the distribution of C/O ratios for the different populations of planet hosts, except when comparing the stars without detected planets with the stars hosting Jupiter-type planets. However, we note that this difference might be caused by the different metallicity distributions of both populations. Conclusions. The derivation of homogeneous abundances from high-resolution spectra in samples that are modest in size is of great utility in constraining models of Galactic chemical evolution. The combination of these high-quality data with the long-term study of planetary presence in our sample is crucial for achieving an accurate understanding of the impact of stellar chemical composition on planetary formation mechanisms. © 2021 ESO.","Galaxy: disk; Galaxy: evolution; Planetary systems; Planets and satellites: composition; Stars: abundances; Stars: fundamental parameters","Astrophysics; C (programming language); Carbon; Metals; Oxygen; Planets; Satellites; Chemical abundance; Chemical compositions; Galaxy evolution; Galaxy: disks; Metallicities; Oxygen line; Planetary system; Planets and satellites: compositions; Stars abundances; Stars:fundamental parameters; Stars",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120901437

To understand how societies can undertake this transition, energy models have been developed to explore future energy scenarios. These models often focus on the techno-economic aspects of the transition and overlook the long-term implications on both society and the natural environment. Without a holistic approach, it is impossible to evaluate the trade-offs, as well as the co-benefits, between decarbonisation and other policy goals. This paper presents the Energy Scenario Evaluation (ESE) framework which can be used to assess the impact of energy scenarios on society and the natural environment. This conceptual framework utilises interdisciplinary qualitative and quantitative methods to determine whether an energy scenario is likely to lead to a publicly acceptable and sustainable energy transition. Using the SDGs, this paper illustrates how energy transitions are interconnected with human development and the importance of incorporating environmental and socio-economic data into energy models to design energy scenarios which meet other policy priorities. We discuss a variety of research methods which can be used to evaluate spatial, environmental, and social impacts of energy transitions. By showcasing where these impacts will be experienced, the ESE framework can be used to facilitate engagement and decision-making between policymakers and local communities, those who will be directly affected by energy transitions. Outputs of the ESE framework can therefore perform an important role in shaping feasible and energy transitions which meet the Paris Agreement targets and SDGs. © 2021 The Authors","Decarbonisation; Energy policy; Energy scenario; Energy transition; Environment; Sustainable development goals","article; conceptual framework; decision making; France; human; human development; quantitative analysis; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116497965

Viticulture is an important economic activity in the Castilla y León region, and is an element capable of halting the flight from the countryside and favouring demographic settlement in rural areas. A new integrated methodology for characterizing and delimitating areas suitable for vineyard cultivation is proposed here. The approach combines traditional climate indices with others used in bioclimatology and with soil variables, and applies various statistical analyses to select the predictors that best characterize the vineyards. These predictors are then integrated in species distribution models and a geographic information system. The methodology was tested in the Denomination of Origin León (hereafter DO León) in northwest Spain. Ten single models using the maximum entropy modelling algorithm were run for each of the six wine-grape varieties. Single-model projections built as a consensus of the ten models into an ensemble-forecasting approach were later used to generate maps of suitable areas for each variety. The results confirm the delimitation of the DO León as a Denomination of Origin. The bioclimatic variables Compensated Thermicity Index and Continentality Index and the soil variables pH, Clay Content, Soil Retention Capacity and Soil Saturation Humidity are defining for all the varieties studied.

Suitability maps revealed that the DO could be extended into neighbouring areas up to 30 km around it. The proposed methodology is a useful tool for agronomic and oenological management; it allows a more effective selection of sites for new vineyards, improves vineyard management, and can even be used to protect territories with a historical and cultural heritage of grape cultivation, thus favouring demographic settlement in rural areas and avoiding depopulation. © 2021","Bioclimatic indices; GIS; Habitat suitability; Spain; Species distribution models; Viticulture","algorithm; bioclimatology; cultivation; cultural heritage; economic activity; entropy; land use; vineyard; wine; wine industry; Castilla y Leon; Spain; Castilla; Vitis vinifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115797361

In this study, the benefits of slow steaming are studied using the example of a container ship on a typical sailing route passing through the Mediterranean Sea. Thus, the reduction of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions is assessed in calm water and in waves for the design speed and slow steaming speed. Resistance and propulsion characteristics in calm water are determined by means of computational fluid dynamics based on the viscous flow theory for a full-scale ship. The added resistance in waves is calculated by the potential flow theory. The propeller operating point is determined for the design speed and slow steaming speed and for sea states with the highest probability of occurrence in the Mediterranean Sea. The fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are then calculated for an engine powered by both low sulphur marine gas oil and liquefied natural gas. For the investigated route, the potential reduction in CO2 emissions could be up to 286 t for an engine fuelled by low sulphur marine gas oil and up to 448 t for an engine fuelled by liquefied natural gas. © 2021 The Authors","CO2 emission; Container ship; Fuel consumption; Liquefied natural gas; Low sulphur marine gas oil; Mediterranean Sea; Slow steaming approach","Computation theory; Computational fluid dynamics; Fuel consumption; Gas emissions; Marine engines; Ocean currents; Ship propulsion; Ships; Speed; Sulfur; % reductions; CO$-2$/ emission; Container ships; Design speed; Low sulfurs; Low sulphur marine gas oil; Mediterranean sea; Short term; Slow steaming; Slow steaming approach; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107699901

We focused on two opposite potential externalities caused by wind turbines. The first relates to the contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emission through the production of green energy. The second concerns the degradation of rural landscape assets. In the sample, we identified factors for or against the installation of the wind farm. People in favor of the wind farm were asked to state their willingness to pay for reducing the effect of global warming by purchasing electricity produced by wind turbines. People against it were solicited to declare their willingness to pay to avoid landscape loss. Welfare measures were elicited using a payment card elicitation format and quantified through different estimation models. An analysis of data revealed high heterogeneity in attitudes, beliefs, and preferences of citizens towards the two potentially competing environmental goods.

In the present day, many greenhouses in Northwestern Europe are equipped with combined heat and power plants (CHPs) and gas boilers to complete three main needs, i.e., heat, power for lighting and carbon dioxide as a fertilizer. The redundant electric power can eventually be sold on the electricity market. However, these three main needs do not allow much flexibility to profit, for example, from opportunities on the energy spot market. Recently, large SHS devices have become commercially available. The present study was conducted to examine their impact on acclimatization costs and carbon dioxide emissions. A real-world case study, comprising data from nine greenhouses and 21 CHPs, was used. The novelty of this research is that it quantifies the impact of SHS on operational costs in the horticulture industry. Accordingly, the simulation was based on an optimal control problem that was cast as a linear programming problem. In brief, the heating costs can be reduced by 0.5 €/m2/y to 6.12 €/m2/y if an SHS system is installed. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was performed, and (i) the cost reduction with respect to insulation was examined. This seems not to be a critical parameter. Under current circumstances, the storage device is mainly used for relatively short periods (up to 50 days); therefore, (ii) the size of storage was optimized. The optimal size of the storage was around 550 m³/hectare or 50 000 m³ for this case study; (iii) carbon capture techniques were found to have a modest impact on the operational costs (−3 c€/m2/y), while (iv) the most critical parameter was the gas price. The main finding is that SHS systems are already efficient under current market conditions. © 2021","Combined heat and power; District energy system; Energy conservation; Greenhouse horticulture; Simulation and modelling; Thermal energy storage","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost reduction; Emission control; Energy conservation; Gas plants; Greenhouse effect; Heat storage; Linear programming; Sensitivity analysis; Thermal energy; 'current; Case-studies; Combined-Heat and Power; District energy systems; Energy; Greenhouse horticulture; Heat and power plants; Heat storage systems; Simulation and modeling; Thermal energy storage; Greenhouses; carbon dioxide; combined heat and power; electricity; energy storage; exploration; horticulture; linear programing; sensitivity analysis; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111295408

The city of Curitiba in Brazil is no exception. In December 2020, the city published PlanClima (Plano Municipal de Mitigação e Adaptação às Mudanças Climáticas), a climate plan developed with local and international organizations. PlanClima aims to guide policies and actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change. This study focuses on selecting and qualitatively evaluating transport policies that contribute to the city’s 2030 climate and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With PlanClima’s analysis for the transport sector in mind, nine targets for 2030 are identified and connected to different transport policies. To evaluate the possible interactions between the policies and the different dimensions of the SDGs, four types of linkages were designed: essential, uncertain, limited, and opposite. These categories were developed to evaluate the several dimensions in which a policy can have a positive or negative impact. The results show that the implementation of zero emission zones/low emission zones, green public procurement, subsidy schemes for the uptake of clean vehicle technology, and the digitalization of the transport system through smarter public transport and digital platforms that couple bike sharing, taxis, and public transport are some of the measures that can contribute to the achievement of Curitiba’s targets and ensure a positive impact on the sustainable development of the city. The study highlights how different policy instruments can contribute to achieve the city’s targets, thus providing guidance to policymakers. © 2021 by the authors.

Efforts to stem this decline often focus on protecting pristine habitats or returning farmland to forest, yet such approaches fail to protect vulnerable taxa reliant on habitats within low-intensity farmland. We assess the economic viability of carbon-based payments for ecosystem services (PES) to protect farmland trees and fallowing in Ghana, which provide vital wintering sites for imperiled Afro-palearctic migrant birds and enhance landscape-level carbon storage. We estimate the carbon breakeven prices (BEPs) associated with alternative agricultural management scenarios that protect existing farmland trees. BEPs associated with tree protection on existing farmland were very low, ranging from US$2.49 to US$6.45 t-1 CO2. Extending and reintroducing fallow periods also carried competitive BEPs, US$4.67 - US$15.45 t-1 CO2, when combined with the protection of 50 trees per hectare. Accounting for leakage and economic uncertainty increased BEPs considerably, but scenarios protecting farmland trees and extending fallow periods remained below EU Emissions Trading Scheme prices. Protecting low-intensity farmland habitats and associated biodiversity is cost-effective under carbon-based PES. Implementation should be combined with efforts to close yield gaps, providing greater local food security and resilience. © 2021 The Author(s).

Thepresentstudy sought to determine the risk factors associated with wheezing among school children aged 6–7 and 13–14 years living in Khuzestan Province, Iran. Study design: Cross-sectional. Methods: Data for this cross-sectional study is the history of wheeze in the last 12 months. The participants included 6-7- and 13-14-year-old girls and boys studying in urban schools in Khuzestan Province in 2019. We collected the data using the multi stage sampling technique as suggested in the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). The research reviewed the literature and consulted experts to collect the risk factors for demographic and clinical information, environmental exposure and lifestyle. Results: Eight thousand questionnaires were handed out to both age groups, of which 7344 were completed. Two hundred ninety-nine (4.1 %) of the participants had current wheeze. Three-point four percent (124 individuals) in the 6–7 year age group and 4.8 % in the 13–14-year-old age group had current wheezing. The results of the logistic regression model suggest that the most significant risk factors associated with the chance of developing current wheeze in the both age groups are: being male (OR: 1.46, 95 % CI: 1.12–1.88), being from employed mother families (OR: 1.50, 95 %, CI:1.05–2.08), property ownership (OR:1.36, 95 %, CI:1.04–1.79) bugs in the property (OR: 1.29, 95 %, CI:0.99–1.70) mold in the property (OR: 1.75, 95 %, CI:1.12–2.76), pet(s) in the student's bedroom (OR: 1.75, 95 %, CI: 0.97–3.14), a family history of asthma and allergic diseases (OR: 2.20, 95 %, CI: 1.69–2.87), tobacco smoke exposures in the property (OR: 1.43, 95 %, CI:1.04–1.96), having allergic rhinitis (OR: 7.86, 95 % CI: 5.89–10.50) and eczema (OR: 3.85, 95 % CI: 2.10–7.08).

Many hoped Pope Francis's 2015 encyclical Laudato Si' would spark widespread climate action. However, our quantitative and qualitative content analyses show that U.S. Catholic bishops responsible for leading the Church were silent and denialist about climate change around Laudato Si'. Using a newly constructed dataset of 12 077 columns published by U.S. Catholic bishops in the official publications for 171 of the 178 U.S. Catholic dioceses between June 2014-June 2019, we find that (a) as a group, U.S. Catholic bishops were generally silent about climate change and (b) as a group, when U.S. Catholic bishops did mention climate change, they often: (a) diminished and distanced themselves from Church teaching on this issue; (b) downplayed parts of Laudato Si' that conflict with a conservative political identity/ideology; and (c) emphasized parts of Laudato Si' that correspond to a conservative political identity/ideology. On climate change, our findings indicate individual U.S. Catholic bishops' diocesan communications have collectively snuffed out the spark of Laudato Si'. Our findings suggest politics may trump religion in influencing climate change beliefs even among religious leaders, and that the American Catholic Church subtly engages in climate denialism even though its top religious leader (Pope Francis) has emphasized the scientific reality and urgency of climate change. © 2021 The Author(s).

This study modified a model based on carbon balance to forecast carbon stored and CO2, CH4 emissions in four types of typical tidal flats—Phragmites australis (PA), Spartina alterniflora (SA), Suaeda japonica (SJ), and Bare Tidal Flat (BTF) in Korea’s Ganghwa province from 2017 to 2047. The model was built using biomass data from salt plant species collected in different locations. The results indicate that the total annual simulated flow of CH4 increased over time in all four areas, most notably in SA, while CO2 remained relatively stable. The mean CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the four types of representative tidal flats were in the range of 0.03 to 19.1 mg m−2 d−1 and 0.007 to 5.23 mg m−2 d−1, respectively, across all seasons. Besides, the results indicate that the amount of carbon accumulated in the top soil increases linearly over time in nearly all areas studied, ranging from 0.01 to 0.13 (kgC m−2 yr−1 ). In general, the study provides a model for Korean tidal flats that incorporates carbon storage and GHG emissions in the intertidal zone in order to develop potential GHG reduction scenarios. © 2021 by the authors.

However, distinguishing the effects of these two factors on BC variation has proven difficult. In this study, we used the China Black Carbon Observational Network data set to assess the diurnal, seasonal, and long-term BC trends at Mt. Waliguan (WLG) from 2008 to 2017. The mean BC concentration at WLG was 449 ± 366 ng/m3, with a decreasing trend of 2 %yr−1, which was mainly related to emission reduction measures in China. The BC concentration at WLG was higher under easterly air masses than that under westerly air masses, which suggests that the former are conducive to BC transport from the highly polluted eastern regions. Due to the origin and velocity of air masses, the BC concentration at WLG in summer is higher than that in winter. The intensity of the Tibetan Plateau monsoon had an important positive influence on the easterly air masses frequency, which modulated BC transport to WLG in summer. According to the concentration-weighted trajectory analysis, the high-potential BC source regions were distributed in Lanzhou, Chengdu, and Xi'an urban agglomerations as well as in northern India. Community Atmosphere Model 5 simulations with a BC-tagging technique inferred North Central China, Northwest China, and Indian Peninsula to be the major BC source regions to WLG, accounting for 56.1%, 17.5%, and 12.1% of the total BC, respectively. © 2021.

We take advantage of observational data collected at Bermuda to seasonally assess the sensitivity of aerosol mass concentrations and volume size distributions to accumulated precipitation along trajectories (APT). The mass concentration of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm normalized by the enhancement of carbon monoxide above background (PM2.5/δCO) at Bermuda was used to estimate the degree of aerosol loss during transport to Bermuda. Results for December-February (DJF) show that most trajectories come from North America and have the highest APTs, resulting in a significant reduction (by 53 %) in PM2.5/δCO under high-APT conditions (> 13.5 mm) relative to low-APT conditions (< 0.9 mm). Moreover, PM2.5/δCO was most sensitive to increases in APT up to 5 mm (-0.044 μg m-3 ppbv-1 mm-1) and less sensitive to increases in APT over 5 mm. While anthropogenic PM2.5 constituents (e.g., black carbon, sulfate, organic carbon) decrease with high APT, sea salt, in contrast, was comparable between high- and low-APT conditions owing to enhanced local wind and sea salt emissions in high-APT conditions. The greater sensitivity of the fine-mode volume concentrations (versus coarse mode) to wet scavenging is evident from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) volume size distribution data. A combination of GEOS-Chem model simulations of the 210Pb submicron aerosol tracer and its gaseous precursor 222Rn reveals that (i) surface aerosol particles at Bermuda are most impacted by wet scavenging in winter and spring (due to large-scale precipitation) with a maximum in March, whereas convective scavenging plays a substantial role in summer; and (ii) North American 222Rn tracer emissions contribute most to surface 210Pb concentrations at Bermuda in winter (ĝ1/4 75 %-80 %), indicating that air masses arriving at Bermuda experience large-scale precipitation scavenging while traveling from North America. A case study flight from the ACTIVATE field campaign on 22 February 2020 reveals a significant reduction in aerosol number and volume concentrations during air mass transport off the US East Coast associated with increased cloud fraction and precipitation. These results highlight the sensitivity of remote marine boundary layer aerosol characteristics to precipitation along trajectories, especially when the air mass source is continental outflow from polluted regions like the US East Coast. © Author(s) 2021.",,"aerosol; carbon monoxide; concentration (composition); particulate matter; precipitation (climatology); size distribution; trajectory; Bermuda; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118104695

There are over 2000 of them in the world. It is estimated that the combustion of 1 ton (Mg) of waste produces about 250–300 kg of slag. Due to the large amounts of this waste, the construction industry’s demand for raw materials and the reduction of CO2 emissions, research was undertaken to use slags as a cement component. The problem was complex because slags generated in the thermal treatment of municipal waste have different chemical compositions and physical properties and contain variable amounts of impurities. The choice of chemical analyses of slag was dictated by the potential influence on the properties of cement mortars. The total moisture of raw slag (4–10%), the bulk density (600–1267 kg/m3) and the specific surface after grinding (over 3000 cm2 /g) were determined. The pH (11.9) and the content of sulphates (3.5% by weight), chlorides (0.3% by weight) and selected heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb) were measured in the aqueous extract. The obtained results of the washing test were compared with the values resulting from the currently binding legal regulations. In the next step, cement mortars with 30% addition of tested slags were designed and made. The article presents the results of compressive strength tests, which were compared with the results of samples without the addition of slag. The addition of slag to the cement mortar decreased S_MSWI 1 by 64% and S_MSWI 2 by 31%. The high loss of strength and the swelling of the S_MSWI 1 test led to the activation of the NaOH slag. In the endurance test, an increase from 16 to 32 MPa was recorded. Preliminary studies show that the addition of slag in the cement mortar allows obtaining the strength at the level of 30–32 MPa. © 2021 by the authors.

For this, it is necessary to know the various determinants of energy consumption. Until now, the main factor affecting energy consumption in healthcare facilities studied in the literature was hospital capacity. However, the commonly used variables connected with hospital size and the number of beds do not take into account the medical activities carried out in these buildings. Assuming that energy consumption in hospitals is multiple and shaped by many factors that overlap, not only on an individual level but also on a higher scale level, this study devises a more integrated approach to its determinants. This study aims to investigate the determinants of electrical energy costs (EEC) and thermal energy costs (TEC) in Polish hospitals with regard to factors related to their size, work intensity and climate zones. The analysis was carried out using financial and resource data from all Polish hospitals for the years 2010–2019. The study used a multivariate backward stepwise regression analysis. In order to use climate as a moderating variable, a sample of Polish hospitals from 16 Polish NUTS 2 was divided into four climate zones. This article provides new empirical evidence on the determinants of electricity consumption in Polish hospitals related to their size and medical activity, taking into account climate zone as a moderating variable. The results of the analysis show that both electricity and heat consumption in hospitals are positively related to the number of doctors, beds and the number of medical operations performed. As expected, larger hospitals seem to use more energy. Moreover, there is regional heterogeneity in energy consumption in hospitals related to the climatic zone in which they operate. The conducted analysis shows that Polish hospitals located in the warmest climatic zone are characterized by higher energy consumption than hospitals in the coldest zone. It especially regards EEC in surgery hospitals. The warmer the climate zones, the higher intensity in terms of the number of surgeries, the higher EEC. In terms of nonsurgical hospitals, the influence of climate zone on EEC was not observed. Knowing the factors influencing energy consumption in hospitals can facilitate the correct adoption of an energy‐saving strategy in the health sector, which is a reasonable response to climate change and supports a healthy and sustainable future. © 2021 by the authors.

Many past studies employed random and semi-random methods for developing driving cycles, by which the driving cycles aligned with real world driving characteristics may not be obtained. Besides, most of the existing methodologies were proposed for relative long trajectories, and cannot handle short trajectories “chopped” for road segments. Therefore, a new Simulated Annealing (SA) based method is proposed, resulting in a speed-acceleration pattern better aligned with real-world driving characteristics. The speed-acceleration status transitions are directly derived from the sample snippets rather than idealized trip trajectories based on SA optimization. In a case study in Fujian Province, China, the SA-based method could stably converge to observed values as the number of iterations increases and it greatly reduces the error by up to 23% over traditional methods. Finally, the accuracy of fuel consumption estimation is improved by imposing restriction on the starting and ending speeds of driving cycles. The method could improve fuel consumption estimation and also provide a better understanding on regional driving pattern, it can be used as a valuable tool for supporting energy and climate policies. © 2021","Driving cycle; Fuel consumption; Optimization; Representativeness; Simulated annealing","Fuel consumption; Fuels; Trajectories; Driving characteristics; Driving cycle; Optimisations; Optimization based methods; Real-world; Real-world drivings; Representativeness; Speed accelerations; Test cycles; Vehicle tests; Simulated annealing; fuel consumption; optimization; China; Fujian",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110759029

However, the effect of GEs on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil microbial diversity is highly controversial and needs further research across different regions. Methods: We investigated the impacts of short-term GEs (4–7 years) on SOC and soil bacterial diversity in sagebrush desert pastures on the northern slopes of Mt. Tianshan, Northwest China, with a paired experimental design. Five sagebrush desert sites were selected, namely, the Xinyuan plot, Bole plot, Manas plot, Hutubi plot, and Qitai plot. The SOC content was determined by using the Walkley-Black method, and soil bacterial diversity was analyzed by high-throughput gene detection. Results: Compared with freely grazed plots, short-term GEs decreased the SOC content and SOC stock in the 0–10 cm layer. GEs significantly decreased the SOC in the 0–10 cm layer by 14.94% and 53.42% in the Xinyuan and Qitai plots, respectively, and significantly increased the SOC by 14.7% in the 0–5 cm layer of the Bole plot (P < 0.05). The dominant phyla of the soil bacterial community in the sagebrush desert were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi, and GEs altered their relative abundances. GEs increased the relative abundance of Acidobacteria by 1.18–6.16% and decreased that of Bacteroidetes by 16.25–31.51% (P > 0.05). The relative abundances of Acidobacteria and Firmicutes in the 0–5 cm layer increased by 7.40% and 10.37% in the GE plots, while those in the 5–10 cm layer decreased by 5.08% and 69.62%, respectively (P > 0.05). GEs reduced the Chao1 index, Shannon index and Pielou index of the soil bacterial communities (P > 0.05). GEs reduced the effect of soil bacterial diversity on SOC content. Conclusion: The short-term GEs decreased the SOC content and SOC stock in the 0–10 cm layer in the sagebrush desert, and these values were even significantly reduced at some sites. Nevertheless, the short-term GEs had no significant effect on soil bacterial diversity or dominant bacteria such as Actinobacteria. Our results suggested that short-term GEs exhibited weak negative impacts on soil organic carbon and soil bacterial diversity in the sagebrush desert, and ecological restoration needs to be longer under grazing exclusions. © 2021","Bacterial community diversity; Grazing exclusion; Sagebrush desert; Soil organic carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117119458

However, accurate assessments of mitigation potential are limited by uncertainty and variability in direct emission factors (EFs). To assess where and why EFs differ, we created high-resolution maps of crop-specific EFs based on 1,507 georeferenced field observations. Here, using a data-driven approach, we show that EFs vary by two orders of magnitude over space. At global and regional scales, such variation is primarily driven by climatic and edaphic factors rather than the well-recognized management practices. Combining spatially explicit EFs with N surplus information, we conclude that global mitigation potential without compromising crop production is 30% (95% confidence interval, 17–53%) of direct soil emissions of N2O, equivalent to the entire direct soil emissions of China and the United States combined. Two-thirds (65%) of the mitigation potential could be achieved on one-fifth of the global harvested area, mainly located in humid subtropical climates and across gleysols and acrisols. These findings highlight the value of a targeted policy approach on global hotspots that could deliver large N2O mitigation as well as environmental and food co-benefits. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117458755

Based on the carbon peak simulation, this study develops a framework to assess the carbon emission uncertainty, aiming to explore the potential low-carbon paths. The STIRPAT model is firstly introduced to explore the influence of population, economic and technology factors on carbon emissions, which is followed by emission peaks simulation. The resilience theory is then introduced to define the concept of low-carbon resilience (LCR), which refers to the ability to maintain a low level of carbon emissions. The uncertainty of carbon emission changes between different scenarios is identified by considering peaking time, cumulative increase and mitigation process. This study taking 10 Chinese coastal provinces as an example, and results show that all provinces can achieve the target of carbon emission peak in low-emissions scenario, the cumulative growth of carbon emissions is low and can be mitigated over a relatively short term, showing a strong LCR. In high-emissions scenario, Liaoning, Tianjin, Fujian and Guangxi may not have a peak before 2050, the uncertainty of carbon emission changes is relatively high, while Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanghai and Guangdong show relatively low uncertainty for the clear peaking time. The study also designs intermediate scenario to reduce the uncertainty of carbon emission changes to provide reference for each province's emission reduction path. These findings help to understand carbon uncertainty to reduce the risk of increasing cumulative emissions under the scenario of only focusing on peaking times, and provide a basis for future carbon resilience and sustainable emission reduction policies. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon simulation; Low-carbon resilience; Peaking time; Uncertainty","Emission control; Fading (radio); Risk perception; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon emissions; Chinese Government; Cumulative emissions; Development path; Emission reduction; Emission reduction policies; Emissions scenarios; Technology factors; Carbon; assessment method; carbon emission; emission control; environmental economics; government; pollution policy; simulation; uncertainty analysis; China; Fujian; Guangdong; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Hebei; Jiangsu; Liaoning; Shanghai; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112465243

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form mutualistic associations with most terrestrial plants, which can help plant nitrogen (N) uptake and have also been shown to reduce soil N2O emissions. However, the development and species community composition of AM fungi are influenced by warming and N deposition. To date, the mechanism by which warming, N deposition, and AM fungi interactively affect soil N2O emissions in the field is still poorly understood. We implemented elevated temperature and N addition treatments in a 5-year experiment in a semiarid temperate meadow to examine the impact of AM fungi on soil N2O fluxes under the treatment conditions. Both elevated temperature and N deposition and the combination of the two significantly increased soil N2O emissions. AM fungi reduced soil N2O emissions under elevated temperature and N deposition. The decrease in soil N2O emissions by AM fungi was lower under elevated temperature than N deposition. Under elevated temperature, the AM fungal decrease in soil N2O emissions was mainly determined by the abundance of the functional genes ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nosZ, while the AM fungal reduction in soil N2O emissions was mainly affected by soil microbial biomass carbon under N deposition. These results indicate that although AM fungi could reduce soil N2O emissions the pathway by which AM fungi regulate soil N2O emissions might vary under different global change contexts with elevated temperature or nitrogen deposition. Our results highlight the negative effect of AM fungi on soil N2O emissions under elevated temperature and N deposition and show that the influence of AM fungi on N2O emissions might be simultaneously determined by warming, N deposition and ecosystem types. The results of the study help to evaluate the potential role of AM fungi in reducing N2O emissions from grassland ecosystems in the context of future global change and provide a theoretical basis for sustainable grassland management. © 2021 The Authors","Greenhouse gas; Nitrogen fertilization; Semiarid grassland; Soil microbe; Warming","Ammonia; Bacteria; Ecosystems; Forestry; Fungi; Gas emissions; Global warming; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Elevated temperature; Greenhouses gas; N-deposition; Nitrogen deposition; Nitrogen fertilization; Semi-arid grasslands; Soil microbes; Temperature deposition; Warming; Greenhouse gases; arbuscular mycorrhiza; community composition; fungus; global change; meadow; microbial activity; nitrous oxide; soil microorganism; soil-vegetation interaction; Nitrosomonadales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114780295

Following the Paris Agreement in 2015, there has been a coordinated effort to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and prevent the excessive warming of the climate. The study uses annual regional data across China and a dynamic panel data approach for estimating an EKC model which includes measures of the increased use of fossil fuels and the spending across China to reduce environmental damage. The results suggest that the policies have been effective in controlling emissions across a variety of pollutants and that the EKC tends to hold in China but varies according to the pollutant. This suggests that these policies should be continued and where possible, extended. © 2021 by the authors.

The current work aimed to quantify the changes due to the lockdown in NOx, O3 and PM2.5 in two contrasting cities in India (Delhi and Hyderabad) using a boosted regression tree model to account for the influence of meteorology. The median NOx and PM2.5 concentrations were observed to decrease after lockdown in both cities, up to 57% and 75% for PM2.5 and NOx, respectively when compared to previous years. After normalization due to meteorology the calculated reduction after lockdown for PM2.5 was small (<8%) in both cities, and was likely less attributable to changes in local emissions, but rather due changes in background levels (i.e. regional source(s)). The reduction of NOx due to lockdown varied by site (on average 5-30%), likely reflecting differences in relative proximity of local sources to the monitoring site, demonstrating the key influence of meteorology on ambient levels post-lockdown. Ozone was observed to increase after lockdown at both sites in Delhi, likely due to changes in relative amounts of precursor concentrations promoting ozone production, suggesting a volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited regime in Delhi. Thus, the calculated reduction in air pollutants due to lockdown in the current work cannot be extrapolated to be solely from a reduction in emissions and instead reflects the overall change in ambient levels, as meteorology and atmospheric chemical processes also contributed.

However, other rotational states are possible, including spin-orbit resonant configurations, particularly when higher eccentricity orbits can be maintained in a system. Additionally, the oscillating strain as a planet moves from periastron to apoastron results in friction and tidal heating, which can be an important energy source. Here, we simulate the climate of ocean-covered planets near the inner edge of the habitable zone around M to solar stars with the NASA GISS ROCKE-3D general circulation model, and leverage the planetary evolution software package, VPLanet, to calculate tidal heating rates for Earth-sized planets orbiting 2600 and 3000 K stars. This study is the first to use a 3D general circulation model that implements tidal heating to investigate habitability for multiple resonant states. We find that for reference experiments without tidal heating, the resonant state has little impact on the radial position of the inner edge because for a given stellar flux, higher-order states tend to be warmer than synchronous rotators, but for a given temperature, have drier upper atmospheres. However, when strong tidal heating is present, the rotational component implies a strong dependence of habitable conditions on the system evolution and rotational state.

In contrast to climate forecasting approaches, we track integrated signals of change for example populations in a climatically forced region and use stochastic dynamic programming to compare the performance of a range of management-ready policies over all possible future states. Our main results highlight: (i) that biomass-linked harvest control rules (HCRs) can partially compensate for changing production, even if the HCR is time invariant; and (ii) that the form of utility (e.g. risk neutral or risk averse) can result in remarkably different optimal decision paths. Performance over future horizons degrades marginally from dynamic HCRs to static HCRs (except at low productivity where differences are more pronounced) but markedly when the biomass level is ignored altogether, as is the case in many managed fish populations globally. Understanding the processes whereby climate affects productivity is important for interpreting past data, but forecasts are not needed for tactical decision making now. Instead, we argue that the priorities for managing fish stocks influenced by climate change are to: measure the current productivity, assess the current abundance of the stock, and respond with a dynamic HCR. © 2021 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2021.","biological reference points; climate change; fish recruitment; harvest strategy","abundance; biomass; climate change; decision making; fishery management; stock assessment; strategic approach; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119479204

Using this panel dataset, we use an event study design to estimate the socioeconomic and biophysical impacts over decades of these programmes. We find that tree plantings have not, on average, increased the proportion of forest canopy cover and have modestly shifted forest composition away from the broadleaf varieties valued by local people. Further cross-sectional analysis, from a household livelihood survey, shows that tree planting supports little direct use by local people.

Scholars have long called for integrating local knowledge in the design and implementation of climate change adaptation policy responses. Yet integrating local knowledges requires addressing issues related with power and authority, and critically examining which knowledge counts and at which scale. In this regard, a relatively under-explored research area is to assess how local representations and experiences of vulnerability fit with or disrupt dominant policy discourses. This is the focus of our study, conducted in the Tarai-Madhesh region of Nepal. We relied on an original methodology, combining participatory video research with a discourse analysis of national policy documents and of the films produced by farmers. Our analysis shows that farmers’ discourses appear on the surface congruent with some features of national policy story-lines. Yet their underlying narratives seriously challenge several core assumptions of national and international climate change adaptation policies, rooted in ecological modernization, technocentrism and neoliberalism. This seeming contradiction indicates both knowledge co-production and performance, underlying the need to closely understand the context in which local knowledges on climate change vulnerability are produced. We conclude with a few promising research areas to explore strategies to increase the authority of local knowledge into political arenas across scales. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Discourses; Farmers; Nepal; Participatory video; Vulnerability","adaptive management; climate change; ecological modernization; farmers knowledge; neoliberalism; power relations; technology adoption; traditional knowledge; vulnerability; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111622692

While designing effective strategies for non-reactive primary pollutants is straightforward, this is not the case for secondary pollutants for which the relationship between emission changes and the resulting concentration changes can be nonlinear. Under such conditions, strategies targeting the largest emitting sources might not be the most effective. In this work, we provide elements to better understand the role of the main emission precursors (SO2, NOx, NH3) on the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols. By quantifying the PM2.5 sensitivity to emission reductions for each of these three precursors, we define and quantify the intensity of PM2.5 formation chemical regimes across Europe. We find that for emission reductions limited to 25%, the relation between emission and PM concentration changes remain mostly linear, with the exception of the Po Valley where non-linearities reach more than 30% in winter. When emission reductions increase to 50%, non-linearity reaches more than 60% in the Po Valley but stay below 30% in the rest of Europe. In terms of implications on abatement strategies, our findings can be summarized in the following key messages: (1) reducing SO2 emissions where abundant is always efficient (e.g. eastern Europe and Balkans); (2) reducing NH3 emissions is more efficient where it is less abundant (e.g. the Po basin) than where it is abundant, given the limiting role of NH3 in the PM formation; (3) reducing NOx emissions where NOx are abundant can be counter-productive with potential increases of PM due to the increased oxidant capacity of the atmosphere (e.g. Po valley); (4) because regions with both NH3 and NOx sensitive chemical regimes are mixed within countries, both need to be reduced together, as pollution reduction policies need at least to be defined at a country level; (6) while for NH3 the focus is clearly on wintertime, it is the whole year for NOx. The simulations proposed in this work could be used as benchmark for other models as they constitute the type of scenarios required to support air quality strategies. In addition, the straight and systematic emission reductions imposed for the scenarios in this work are well suited for a better understanding of the behavior of the model, in terms of responses to emission reductions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Chemical regimes; European air quality planning; Non-linearity; PM formation","Ammonia; Benchmarking; Emission control; Landforms; Nitrogen oxides; Chemical regimes; Emission reduction; European air quality planning; NH$-3$; NO$-x$; Non-linearity; PM formation; PM$-2.5$; PO Valley; Quality strategy; Air quality; ammonium nitrate; methane; nitric oxide; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; aerosol; air quality; ammonia; concentration (composition); emission; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; pollutant; sulfur dioxide; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; Article; atmosphere; controlled study; Eastern Europe; Europe; marine environment; nonhuman; nonlinear system; osseointegration; particulate matter 2.5; principal component analysis; seasonal variation; air pollutant; air pollution; Balkan Peninsula; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; prevention and control; Italy; Po Valley; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Balkan Peninsula; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108323651

The Influent Distribution System (IDS) is a critical structure for generating granules in a UASB reactor since it provides the required flow hydrodynamics for their formation. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the efficiency of five IDS configurations to generate ideal granulation conditions using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The IDS configurations were as follows: (C1) single radial inflow, (C2) upward axial inflow, (C3) downward distributed axial inflow, and two novel configurations in the form of (C4) double opposite radial inflow and (C5) downward tangential inflow. The hydrodynamic response of configuration C1 was validated in a physical model with dynamic Froude similitude. The granulation measurement was velocity-based in the reactor reaction zone using steady-state CFD simulations. The novel IDS configuration C4 was the one that resulted in the highest granulation volume, with up to 45.5% of the potential granulation volume of the UASB reactor, in contrast to the IDS C2 that obtained the lowest granulation with only 10.8%. Results confirm that the IDS directly impacts the hydrodynamics of the reactor and that model-based design can be used to ascertain IDS configurations that better promote granulation in UASB reactors. © 2021 by the authors.

Today, green roofs (GRs) represent a viable solution for enhancing energy and urban resilience in the face of climate change, as they can have a positive impact on the building's indoor thermal comfort and energy demand, as well as inducing various environmental benefits (easing urban heat island effects, improving the management of runoff water, reducing air pollution, etc.). Thus, it is important to be able to assess their effectiveness, both today and under future climate conditions, in order to evaluate whether they can also provide a valid long-term solution. In this paper, a simulation approach is proposed to evaluate the energy and indoor-comfort efficacy of GRs installed on a cluster of buildings with respect to climate change and demographic growth. To illustrate the proposed methodology, it has been applied to two European urban environments characterized by very different climatic conditions (Esch-sur-Alzette in Luxembourg and Palermo in Italy) considering their behaviour over a period of 60 years (2020, 2050, 2080). Results showed that, with respect to standard existing roofs (i.e., without the presence of green coverage), and considering the rising temperatures due to climate change, during cooling seasons GRs enabled significant energy savings (ranging from 20% to 50% for Esch-sur-Alzette and from 3% to 15% for Palermo), improvement of the indoor comfort (reduction of the average predicted mean votes − PMVs) and attenuation of the ceiling temperatures (2–5 °C for both contexts) of the buildings' top floors. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change adaptation; Energy building simulation; Energy savings; Green roofs; Indoor thermal comfort; Urban buildings resilience","Buildings; Climate change; Roofs; Thermal comfort; Urban growth; Water pollution; Climate change adaptation; Energy; Energy savings; Energy building simulation; Energy-savings; Green roof; Indoor comforts; Indoor thermal comfort; Urban building resilience; Urban buildings; Energy conservation; building; climate change; energy use; roof; temperature effect; urban area; Diekirch; Esch sur Sure; Italy; Luxembourg [Benelux]; Palermo [Palermo (ADS)]; Palermo [Sicily]; Sicily",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111825082

The placement of inert porous material to confine the combustion region is being recently explored as a possible mitigation system for this kind of pollution. However, given the complexity of biomass thermochemical decomposition processes, it is challenging to justify the performance of these systems on the basis of a physicochemical understanding. A foundational experiment-based study is carried out in this work to understand how combustion confinement affects the particulate emissions production mechanisms. A combustion unit was designed and built to systematically test ceramic foams with different porosities: keeping constant airflow and fuel feed rates. A comprehensive characterisation study was carried out on the solid biomass fuel, the temperature profile, the particulate emissions, and the remaining solid residue. The results evidenced that the use of foams has a substantial impact on the temperature distribution in the combustion chamber. The higher the cell density of the foam, the higher and more homogeneous are the temperatures reached in the combustion bed. This fact improved the thermal decomposition process of the pellets due to a better air-fuel mixture, leading to a reduction of the solid particulate matter emissions by more than 70%. These findings suggest that the use of an inert porous material above the combustion region might be a feasible solution for particulate emission control in small-size biomass combustion technology. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Domestic heating; Flame confinement; Particulate matter emissions; Solid biomass combustion","Biomass; Ceramic foams; Combustion; Decomposition; Emission control; Fuels; Particles (particulate matter); Biomass combustion; Combustion systems; Domestic heating; Domestic heating systems; Flame confinement; Mitigation systems; Particulate matter emissions; Particulates; Solid biomass combustion; Thermochemical decomposition; Particulate emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109735113

For achieving this goal, an interesting model of analysis was elaborated, which takes into consideration three levels and dimensions: strategic (with executive and legislative dimensions), administrative (national and regional dimensions) and outcomes (assessed from a well-being lens and public opinions surveys). The model will be applied at the European and national levels (Romania). It uses qualitative research strategies and methods. The transversal character of the EGD strategy, the coordination needed for its implementation, and the interdependencies and regional approach are important components that pave the way for the elaboration of the National Green Deal Plan, which becomes compulsory for an adequate design of the sustainable, adaptive, and mature Romanian administrative capacity. In addition, the article proposes a few recommendations at the national and local levels for the preparation of a better implementation of the EGD. © 2021 by the author.

It also produced billions of tonnes of alkaline materials that have the potential to react with some of that CO2, and this carbon capture potential may be used to help prevent climate change. Here we assess the carbon capture potential of legacy iron (Fe) and steel wastes in South Wales, the United Kingdom, and show that between 0 and 77% of total carbonation potential has been reached in the samples (equating to maximum potential between 40 and 608 kg CO2 /t of slag has been removed from the atmosphere by direct carbonation) across 10 historic works (out of 48 that operated in the region), even after &gt; 140 years. The current work suggests that there is a capture potential of up to 17 Mt CO2 by direct carbonation which represents a potential carbon sink for future emissions. Iron and steel slag contains Ca silicate minerals, often dominated by melilite group phases (gehlenite, Ca2Al2SiO7 and akermanite, Ca2MgSi2O7), but also includes minor phases like olivine (fayalite, (Fe,Mn)2SiO4 and fosterite, Mg2SiO4). The presence of mineral carbonate phases such as calcite, magnesite, ankerite, and kutnohorite in the material demonstrates carbonation reaction has occurred after slag formation. Given that there is still carbonation potential to be realised, and that materials produced in the future from the iron and steel industry could play an important role in meeting our climate targets, then new management strategies are needed to maximise the use of this resource. © 2021","Ca silicate minerals; Carbon capture potential; Carbon sequestration; Direct carbonation; Historical iron and steel works; Legacy deposits","Aluminum alloys; Calcite; Calcium alloys; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Climate change; Gas industry; Magnesite; Silicate minerals; Silicon; Silicon alloys; Slags; Steelmaking; Ca silicate mineral; Carbon capture potential; Carbon sequestration; Direct carbonation; Historical iron and steel work; Iron and steel; Iron and steel works; Iron slags; Legacy deposit; South Wales; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116314318

Political blue sky is unsustainable because conflict of interest in China's authoritarian environmentalism leads to failure of joint prevention and control in air pollution regulations. This study aims to explore policy mechanisms that would integrate intergovernmental join efforts in air pollution control. A non-cooperative tripartite evolutionary game is employed to model the dynamic interactions among the central government, Beijing municipality, and local governments for fighting air pollution. A double-payment with dual-supervision mechanism is proposed for air pollution control in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. Simulations are conducted to examine the effectiveness of air pollution regulations involving multiple policy instruments for yielding the ideal outcome. It is shown that appropriate coordination of these policy instruments can address the intergovernmental challenge in collective action against air pollution. In addition, two long-term scenarios per the Porter hypothesis are investigated regarding environmental tax reform and enterprise innovations. It is found that such long-term inspirations can improve regulatory flexibility and efficacy. The double-payment with dual-supervision mechanism can effectively engage all governmental stakeholders for promoting sustainable air pollution governance in China.

This hypothesis is based on changes in spring phenology and therefore active growing season length, which would not be indicative of possible changes in growth as would changes in cumulative forcing temperatures (growing degree days/hours) in the Northern Hemisphere. In this study we analysed the effects of a moderate climate warming (2°C warmer than the 1981–2010 baseline) on the leaf-out of hypothetical species without chilling restriction and actual plant species with different chilling and forcing requirements in different parts of the globe. In both cases, early season species had larger phenological shifts due to low leaf-out temperatures, but accumulated fewer forcing gains (changes in cumulative forcing temperatures by warming) from those shifts because of their early spring phenology. Leaf-out time was closely associated with leaf-out temperatures and therefore plant phenological responses to climate warming. All plant species would be equally affected by climate warming in terms of total forcing gains added from higher temperatures when forcing gains occurring between early and late season species are included. Our findings will improve the understanding of possible mechanisms and consequences of differential responses in plant phenology to climate warming.

The former are dominated by the effect of temperature during the colder months of the year, with the energy demand increasing as the temperature decreases. Warming of the UK climate under the influence of anthropogenic forcings is therefore expected to lead to a reduction in domestic energy consumption. Here, we present an end-to-end attribution study that investigates whether the anthropogenic effect on consumption is already evident in the United Kingdom. We analyse data of gas and electricity use in UK households during 2008–2019 and use a simple linear model to express the temperature dependence. Uncertainties in the resulting transfer functions are derived with a recent methodology, originally introduced for downscaling purposes, but adapted here for use in impact studies. The transfer functions are applied to temperature data from simulations with and without the effect of human influence on the climate, generated by 11 state-of-the-art climate models. We thus assess the anthropogenic impact on energy consumption during the reference period by comparing it with what it might have been in a climate without anthropogenic climate change, but at the same level of adaptation. We find that without human influence on the climate, UK households would consume on average about 1,400 kWh more per year, which would increase the annual energy bills by about 70 GBP. Our attribution assessment provides useful evidence of an impact that has already emerged, which can help inform UK's adaptation plans as the climate continues to warm. © 2021 Crown copyright.

For an increased understanding of the CO2 emission sources, patterns, and trends, a link between the emission inventories and observed CO2 concentrations is best established via Earth system modelling and data assimilation. Bringing together the different pieces of the puzzle of a very different nature (measurements, reported statistics, and models), it is of utmost importance to know their level of confidence and boundaries well. Inversions disaggregate the variation in observed atmospheric CO2 concentration to variability in CO2 emissions by constraining the regional distribution of CO2 fluxes, derived either bottom-up from statistics or top-down from observations. The level of confidence and boundaries for each of these CO2 fluxes is as important as their intensity, though often not available for bottom-up anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This study provides a postprocessing tool CHE_UNC_APP for anthropogenic CO2 emissions to help assess and manage the uncertainty in the different emitting sectors. The postprocessor is available under 10.5281/zenodo.5196190 (Choulga et al., 2021). Recommendations are given for regrouping the sectoral emissions, taking into account their uncertainty instead of their statistical origin; for addressing local hot spots; for the treatment of sectors with small budget but uncertainties larger than 100 %; and for the assumptions around the classification of countries based on the quality of their statistical infrastructure. This tool has been applied to the EDGARv4.3.2_FT2015 dataset, resulting in seven input grid maps with upper- and lower-half ranges of uncertainty for the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System. The dataset is documented and available under 10.5281/zenodo.3967439 (Choulga et al., 2020). While the uncertainty in most emission groups remains relatively small (5 %-20 %), the largest contribution (usually over 40 %) to the total uncertainty is determined by the OTHER group (of fuel exploitation and transformation but also agricultural soils and solvents) at the global scale. The uncertainties have been compared for selected countries to those reported in the inventories submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and to those assessed for the European emission grid maps of the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research. Several sensitivity experiments are performed to check (1) the country dependence (by analysing the impact of assuming either a well- or less well-developed statistical infrastructure), (2) the fuel type dependence (by adding explicit information for each fuel type used per activity from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), and (3) the spatial source distribution dependence (by aggregating all emission sources and comparing the effect against an even redistribution over the country). The first experiment shows that the SETTLEMENTS group (of energy for buildings) uncertainty changes the most when development level is changed. The second experiment shows that fuel-specific information reduces uncertainty in emissions only when a country uses several different fuels in the same amount; when a country mainly uses the most globally typical fuel for an activity, uncertainty values computed with and without detailed fuel information are the same. The third experiment highlights the importance of spatial mapping. ©",,,Data Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119668868

Taking into account the changing climate, the engaged emission reduction policies and the expected increase in population, the health risks associated with this phenomenon may also change significantly in the near future. In regions such as the Mediterranean, exposed to multiple forms of air pollution and highly sensitive to climate change, it is obviously critical to define trends in human exposure to air pollutants. The objective of this article is to explore the features of population exposure to air pollution in the French Mediterranean coast, under different climatic situations, using distinct emission configurations, and for divergent scenarios of population growth. The use of contrasting situations for these 3 parameters makes it possible to better address the variability of exposure in the different areas of the territory, as a global risk for populations. For this purpose, five 12 month-duration simulations have been carried out as case studies in the Provence Alpes Côtes d'Azur (PACA) region, located in the south-east of France: a 2005 simulation is used as the reference situation, and two more years of simulation are used as samples of time horizons 2030 and 2050, each of which was simulated twice sampling representative future climate years according to representative concentration pathway scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Estimates of population change were prepared for the study area, using shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) scenarios. The results show that albeit the growing population, the exposure to most atmospheric components decreases because of emission reduction policies. This, however, is not true for all species. The population exposure to dust species increases for spring, when most dust episodes occur. In addition, exposure to ozone – while decreasing on the average - shows an increase in urban areas. Finally, while the concentrations of BSOA (secondary organic aerosol of biogenic origin) increase in the future scenarios, this tendency is not marked enough to offset the population decrease in rural areas in most SSP scenarios. On the reverse, exposure to BSOA does show an increase in urban areas where population is expected to grow. A county per county analysis is conducted, showing that the three coastal counties of the PACA region will experience higher ozone, PM10 and PM2.5, dust and BSOA exposure. The purpose of our work is to produce a case study in which we compare pollutant concentration changes and population weighed exposure changes on a meteorological situation that goes out of the current distribution. For this case study, we propose to distinguish the part of exposure changes due pollutant concentration and population changes. The choice of the study case (weather and horizon) is discussed in the text. This approach differs from the scenario approach, which focuses on the analysis of a trend representative of future years. © 2021","Atmospheric pollution modeling; Future atmospheric scenarios; Future scenarios; Mediterranean","Climate change; Dust; Economics; Emission control; Health risks; Ozone; Population statistics; Air pollutants; Atmospheric pollution models; Case-studies; Cote d'Azur; Emission reduction policies; Future atmospheric scenario; Future climate; Future scenario; Mediterranean; Population exposure; Air pollution; chemical compound; ozone; volatile organic compound; atmospheric pollution; climate change; emission control; future prospect; health risk; pollution exposure; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; atmosphere; cardiovascular disease; case study; climate; climate change; concentration (parameter); France; global health; health hazard; human; meteorology; mortality; particulate matter; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; population density; population exposure; population growth; rural area; seashore; secondary organic aerosol; simulation; socioeconomics; Southern Europe; spatial analysis; spring; urban area; weather; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114134813

Understanding climate change and its consequences on forests and the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities could support forest-based strategies for responding to climate change. Using perception-based assessment principles, we assessed the effects of climate change and extreme weather events on forests and forest-based livelihood among the forest-dependent communities around the Mchinji and Phirilongwe Forest Reserves in the Mchinji and Mangochi districts in Malawi. Content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. The impact of erratic rainfall, high temperatures, strong winds, flooding, and droughts was investigated using logistic regression models. The respondents perceived increasing erratic rainfall, high temperatures, strong winds, flooding, and droughts as key extreme climate events in their locality. These results varied significantly between the study sites (p < 0.05). Erratic rainfall was perceived to pose extended effects on access to the forest in both Phirilongwe in Mangochi (43%) and Mchinji (61%). Climate change was found to be associated with reduced availability of firewood, thatch grasses, fruits and food, vegetables, mushrooms, and medicinal plants (p < 0.05). Erratic rainfall and high temperatures were more likely perceived to cause reduced availability of essential forest products, and increased flooding and strong winds were less likely attributed to any effect on forest product availability. The study concludes that climate change and extreme weather events can affect the access and availability of forest products for livelihoods. Locally based approaches such as forest products domestication are recommended to address threats to climate-sensitive forest-based livelihoods. © 2021 by the authors.

We propose a novel sources and patterns detection technique to analyze the complex physical mechanisms of PM2.5 in central Taiwan. The procedure started with the auto-selecting events mechanism composed of moving average and local extrema calculations, followed by diffusion pattern extraction, which combined the lag-time spatial distribution calculation results from wavelet coherence with principal component analysis to yield the six main diffusion patterns. Finally, representative events were analyzed to discuss the influence of meteorological conditions on the PM2.5 diffusion patterns. The results showed that the general daily PM2.5 concentration variation displayed a bimodal pattern. Among the high PM2.5 events, the cumulative amount was ∼21.35 μg/m3, and the average rise time was ∼8–9 h. Principal Component 1 (PC1) shows the pattern from the coast to inland under the influence of the northeast wind with the highest daily average wind speed (1.56 m/s) and concentration increase percentage (72%); the most serious pollution situation happened in PC5, which is under the influence of weak synoptic, with the highest daily PM2.5 concentration (55.31 μg/m3) and minimum wind speed (1.17 m/s). PM2.5 events with other diffusion patterns (PC2––6) were more likely under the influence of the continental high-pressure peripheral circulation and high-pressure reflux.

Iron ore sinter production is an important source of carbon emissions in China. Indeed, the uneven heat distribution in a sintering bed is a long-standing problem that significantly increases the consumption of energy. In the present study, we numerically examined the heat/mass transfer in multi-layer sintering process assisted with gaseous fuel injection in order to improve the energy efficiency. Computational results showed that solid fuel segregation had considerable positive effects on the achievement of a more reasonable and balanced heat pattern distribution due to the increased melting quantity index in the near-inlet region under segregated conditions. The results also indicated that gaseous fuel (vol. 1.0–3.0%) could greatly enhance the heat generated in the melting zone in the near-inlet region by influencing the dynamics of the primary and secondary reaction zones. These findings extend our understandings of the heat/mass transfer under gaseous fuel injection conditions. According to our computations, combined coke segregation and gaseous fuel injection is a feasible and energy-efficient solution that can contribute to reduce carbon emissions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Heat/mass transfer; Melting zone; Multi-layer sintering; Numerical model; Reactive porous media","Carbon; Energy efficiency; Fuel injection; Fuels; Heat transfer; Iron ores; Porous materials; Carbon emissions; Chinese Government; Gaseous Fuel; International community; Melting zones; Multi-layer sintering; Multi-layers; Porous medium; Reactive porous medium; Sintering process; Sintering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116865341

These changes are obtained by dynamical downscaling using a Bering Sea regional model. Surface atmospheric and ocean boundary forcing from three Earth System Models (ESMs) in CMIP6, and a low and a high emission scenario of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP126 and SSP585) of each of the ESMs are considered. Ensemble mean results suggest that, contrary to an anticipated increase in ocean stratification under warming, diminishing ice cover in response to climate forcing and resultant reduced surface freshening weakens EBS stratification in the melt season. Modeled ensemble mean phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass on the EBS exhibits subsurface maxima during the growing season; the amplitude of these maxima decreases with warming, along with a reduction in primary productivity and oxygen concentration over much of the EBS water column. Phenology of both phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass on the EBS shifts earlier, leading to an increase (decrease) in biomass averaged between April–July (August–November), while annually averaged biomass decreases under warming. Projected changes of primary and secondary plankton biomass at the end of the 21st century are not well separated between the SSP126 and SSP585 scenario in light of the large across model spread under each scenario. The projected ensemble mean warming amplitude of the EBS summer bottom temperature is largely unchanged between results forced by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 5 Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (CMIP5 RCP8.5) and CMIP6 SSP585 scenarios. Likewise, the reduction rate of annual mean phytoplankton and large zooplankton biomass are comparable between RCP8.5 and SSP585 projections, even though the absolute amplitudes of biomass are sensitive to modeling parameters such as the solar irradiance attenuation curve. Hence, within the Bering Sea dynamical downscaling framework, projected long-term warming trends in EBS bottom temperature and plankton biomass reduction rates are robust responses to climate forcing. © 2021","Dynamical downscaling; Eastern bering sea; Living marine resources; Marine biogeochemistry","Biomass; Climate models; Oceanography; Phytoplankton; Plankton; Temperature; Bering sea; Climate forcings; Coupled models; Dynamical downscaling; Eastern bering sea shelves; Eastern bering seas; Living marine resource; Marine biogeochemistries; Marine resources; Model inter comparisons; Marine biology; amplitude; biomass; climate forcing; CMIP; downscaling; environmental response; ice cover; phytoplankton; seasonal variation; solar radiation; stratification; trophic level; zooplankton; Bering Sea; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116019263

To prevent GHGs emissions, it is important to assess and quantify the correlation of GHGs emission and microbial carbon and nitrogen transformations. In this study, two typical wetland substrate samples (mud sampled from Xiaomei River CW and sand sampled from Dongwen River CW) were used to build lab-scale vertical subsurface flow CW microcosms, labeled as XRCW and DRCW, respectively. The mean COD removal rate of the DRCW group (76.1%) was higher than that of XRCW group (60.6%). Both groups achieved a high extent of nitrogen nutrient removal, indicating a higher metabolic activity of nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms in the system, especially in XRCW. The mean emission fluxes of N2O, CH4 and CO2 in the XRCW group were 52.7 μg/m2-h, 1.6 mg/m2-h and 100.4 mg/m2-h, which were higher than that in the DRCW group (30.0 μg/m2-h, 1.0 mg/m2-h and 28.0 mg/m2-h, respectively). The relation of GHG emissions to microbial carbon and nitrogen transformation was assessed by genomics and functional analysis. The release of GHGs by the XRCW group had a positive correlation with the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, while for the DRCW group a positive correlation was found with the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria. Nitrogen fixation by Cyanobacteria could be an approach to reduce GHG emissions. The release of CH4 and CO2 was positively correlated with glucose metabolism. N2O gas emission was affected by the species of denitrifiers. This study is of great importance to clarify the emissions of GHGs in vertical subsurface flow CWs, as it is relating to microbial carbon and nitrogen transformation. The connection is of great significance to control the emission of GHGs in wetlands. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon cycle; Constructed wetlands; Greenhouse gases; Metabolic pathways; Nitrogen removal","carbon; genomic DNA; glucose; nitrite reductase; nitrogen; nitrogen derivative; organic nitrogen; surface water; carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; genomics; glucose; greenhouse gas; metabolism; nitrogen fixation; relative abundance; subsurface flow; Article; carbon footprint; carbon metabolism; Chlorobi; Chloroflexi; chloroplast; constructed wetland; cyanobacterium; denitrification; denitrifyer; DNA extraction; effluent; genomics; glucose metabolism; microbial community; microcosm; nitrification; nitrogen fixation; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; oxidation; Proteobacteria; sediment; Thiobacillus; wetland; genomics; greenhouse gas; wetland; Cyanobacteria; Proteobacteria; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Genomics; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110780839

Here, we demonstrate a modular design strategy to engineer an efficient heterostructured electrocatalyst FeS2/TiO2 (S-FTO) via a sulfidation process on natural ilmenites (FTO), which integrates high OER activity, good conductivity, and high stability. The modular catalyst, S-FTO catalyst, shows a low overpotential of 230 mV to achieve 10 mA cm-2, as well as excellent stability in alkaline solution. Typically, S-FTO exhibits OER activity 19 times higher than FTO at an overpotential of 300 mV. In-depth investigations indicate that the high OER activity of S-FTO mainly originates from accelerated surface self-reconstruction induced by lattice S etching within the OER potential region, and the newly formed FeOOH on the outer layer acts as the active species for the OER. The remaining FeS2 regulates the surface electronic properties and enhances the conductivity, while TiO2 improves the stability. The modular design strategy demonstrated here will enable the design of low-cost heterostructures as high-efficiency catalysts for challenging energy storage/conversion reactions in an eco-friendly and sustainable manner.

Plant litter is an important source of SOC, but the knowledge gap between SOC fractions and plant litter input remains inconsistent. Here, a litter input control experiment was conducted at three subalpine forest types (coniferous forest, mixed forest, and broadleaved forest). We assessed the variations of total organic C, active organic C (easily oxidizable C, labile organic C), recalcitrant organic C, and microbial biomass C under litter input or removal. The results showed that soil total organic C decreased greatly under litter input. It was mainly caused by the change of easily oxidizable C and labile C, while the influence of recalcitrant C was small. At the same time, this effect varied among different forest types. Among them, the effect of litter input on SOC was weak and slow in the coniferous forest with low-quality litter input, while a quick effect was observed in the mixed and broadleaved forests with high-quality litter input. Microbial biomass C declined under litter input in most cases, and its variation was strongly controlled by soil temperature and freeze-thaw events. Overall, our results provide new evidence that forest type would strongly control SOC dynamics, in concert with litter quality shifts, with potential consequences for long-term C sequestration. We highlighted that litter input could reduce microbial biomass carbon which might limit the native SOC decomposition, but the loss of active C ultimately changed the SOC in the subalpine forests. It suggested that the interaction of multiple mechanisms should be considered in the study of SOC in this region. © 2021 by the authors.

The study on the energy efficiency of the construction industry is of great significance for improving development quality and achieving the goal of energy saving and emission reduction. In this paper, a three-stage undesirable SBM-DEA model was employed to measure the energy efficiency in the construction industry during 2005-2016. The CO2 directly emitted by the construction industry and indirectly emitted in the production of building materials were used as the undesirable output and the three-stage framework was employed to analyze and eliminate the influence of external environment. The empirical results showed that low efficiency of management in the construction industry is an important factor leading to the low level of energy efficiency in China’s construction industry. For the energy efficiency value before and after adjustment, the “high-high” provinces have made full use of the superior external environment by their high management level, while the “high-low” provinces need to fully realize the potential in promoting energy efficiency of its external environment by improving its own management of the construction industry. On the contrary, the “low-high” provinces need to improve the external environment to ease its restrictions on the level of management in the construction industry. Environmental factors and management level should be considered simultaneously for different provinces to improve energy efficiency of the construction industry. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Construction industry; Environmental-adjusted energy efficiency; Management inefficiency; Three-stage undesirable SBM-DEA","construction industry; data envelopment analysis; emission control; energy efficiency; energy use; national economy; numerical model; China; building industry; China; energy conservation; pollution; productivity; China; Conservation of Energy Resources; Construction Industry; Efficiency; Environmental Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107792324

At present, China’s economic transformation is urgent, and green finance is being widely concerned. This paper measured the development level of China’s green finance from the perspective of green credit, green securities, green investment, and green insurance. Then, it used a spatial dynamic panel model to empirically test the mechanism of the impact of green finance on carbon emissions with panel data of 30 Chinese provinces from 2005 to 2018. The following can be seen from the results: (1) The development of green finance contributes to carbon emission reduction. (2) The spatial spillover effect of green finance is significant. Specifically, the development of green finance can not only reduce the carbon emissions of the local region but also inhibit that of adjacent areas. (3) The development of green finance indirectly leads to a decrease in carbon emissions by reducing financing constraints and boosting green technology innovation. In order to stimulate the carbon emission reduction effect of green finance to a greater extent, we should further support the development of green finance, reduce the financing constraints of energy-saving and environmental-protection enterprises, and encourage the research and development of green innovative technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

Previous studies demonstrated the uptake of dicarbonyls and semivolatile process of primary organic aerosol (POA) emissions are the significant sources of SOA. However, the uptake coefficients of dicarbonyls have large uncertainties and the SOA from the semivolatile process of POA emission remains unclear. We applied the revised reactive uptake parameterization, with “salting effects” for dicarbonyls, and updated approaches for POA to the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ) simulations for October 2014 to study their impacts on modeling the SOA formation over eastern China. We introduce a method of quantifying crystalized or deliquescent aerosols to further improve the parameterization. The revised glyoxal uptake coefficients results in higher glyoxal SOA in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, where is typically under low relative humidity (RH) and high aerosol pH conditions. It gives lower glyoxal SOA in the Pearl River Delta region, where is typically under high RH and low pH conditions. The updated parameterization gives negligible methylglyoxal SOA due to the low uptake coefficients. The implementation of semivolatile process of POA and the approach for potential SOA from combustion sources will largely decrease the predicted POA and increase the modeled SOA concentrations over eastern China. The increased SOA from POA emissions could improve the model performance for organic carbon and SOA. It slightly improves the performance in PM2.5 modeling by compensating the reduction of modeled POA. This study indicates the mixed impact of a parameterization considering “salting effects” on modeling the dicarbonyls SOA in key regions of eastern China. It also demonstrates the improved performance by implementing the POA approaches in aerosol modeling using CMAQ. Meanwhile, the uncertainty in the revised reactive uptake parameterization and POA approaches is discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","CMAQ; Dicarbonyls; POA; SOA; Uptake coefficients","Aerosols; Atmospheric movements; Organic carbon; Parameterization; pH; Uncertainty analysis; Aerosol emissions; Community multiscale air quality modeling system; Dicarbonyls; Eastern China; Organic aerosol; Organic aerosol formation; Primary organic aerosol; Secondary organic aerosol; Semivolatiles; Uptake coefficients; Air quality; aerosol composition; aerosol formation; air quality; atmospheric pollution; organic carbon; parameterization; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta; carbon; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; chemical model; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon; Models, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110384014

Southwest area in China has various climate conditions and abundant plant biodiversity (crop, forest, grassy, orchard and arable areas). Nevertheless, the potential of soil-inhabitant EF as insect pest biocontrol agents, is unknown. In this study, first the EF biodiversity from soil of three provinces (Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan) was surveyed. Then, the virulence of 29 isolated strains against Bemesia tabaci and Spodoptera litura was assessed. After analyzing 212 soil samples, 497 isolated fungi were identified. Out of them, 490 isolates were classified in 45 species of 24 genera, whereas the other seven isolates, belonging to Paecilomyces and Purpureocillium genera, were not identified under species level. Furthermore, the EF biodiversity from soil of Sichuan, Yunan, and Guizhou areas, analyzed by Shannon Wiener Index (SWI) was rated at 2.98, 1.89, and 2.14, while SWIs-biodiversity in crop, forest, grassy, orchard and arable areas was rated at 2.88, 2.74, 3.05, 2.39, and 2.47. SWI data suggested that soil from Sichuan area and grassy had higher EF biodiversity compared with other analyzed provinces and areas. Virulence bioassay results indicated that, out of the 29 isolates tested, 24 were pathogenic against B. tabaci and S. litura, resulting in mortality rates >10%. In conclusion, this study reports the EF distribution and biodiversity in soil from three provinces located at Southwest China, whereas their potential use as a tool for the B. tabaci and S. litura biocontrol must be further investigated. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there are increasing concerns regarding the sustainability of plantation ecosystems under climate change. In this study, we developed tree-ring width chronologies of Pinus tabulaeformis at seven sites along a precipitation gradient from south to north in the LP. Correlation analysis was performed to investigate the climate (temperature, precipitation, self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index)-growth relationship. Moreover, the tree resilience components were computed to study the adaptability of trees to extreme drought during the growth periods. The results showed that the differences in radial growth to climate change along the precipitation gradient and the cluster analysis of the tree ring width index (RWI)-scPDSI correlation coefficient illustrated that the climate-growth response pattern along the LP was divided into southern and northern regions. Tree growth in the southern region is limited by humid environment conditions, while tree growth in the early and middle growing seasons of the northern region is limited by warming-induced drought. As the temperature rising over the past fifty years, the growth was found to be negatively correlated with temperature, especially in the spring and autumn seasons of the northern region. In contrast, the effect of precipitation on tree growth became more negative in the southern region, but more positive in the middle and late growing seasons of the northern region. Moreover, tree resilience analysis showed that the high resistance of Pinus tabulaeformis in the southern region, whereas high recovery in the northern region. It was difficult for the growth of Pinus tabulaeformis to recover from drought in the southern region, but stronger adaptability to extreme drought events in the northern region. Our study illustrated that there are different climate response patterns and limiting factors of Pinus tabulaeformis along the precipitation gradient in the LP; thus, different ecological restoration and regional forestry management strategies should be initiated in the LP. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Drought stress; Growth response; Loess Plateau; Resilience pattern","Climate change; Cluster analysis; Drought; Ecology; Forestry; Plants (botany); Sediments; Sustainable development; Drought stress; Growing season; Growth response; Loess Plateau; Northern regions; Pinus tabulaeformis; Precipitation gradients; Resilience pattern; Response patterns; Tree growth; Landforms; climate change; correlation; drought; pine; plantation; precipitation assessment; resilience; sustainable development; tree ring; Drought; Ecology; Forestry; Growing Season; Pinus Tabulaeformis; Sediments; China; Loess Plateau; Plateau [Nigeria]; Pinus tabuliformis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113395198

Here, based on a stringent TC selecting criterion, robust increase of TC-related inland impacts between 1979 and 2016 over East and Southeast Asian regions have been detected. The storms sustained for 2–9 h longer and penetrated 30–190 km further inland, as revealed from different best track datasets. The most significant increase of the TC inland impacts occurred over Hanoi and South China. The physical mechanism that affects TC-related inland impacts is shortly discussed. First, the increasing TC inland impacts just occur in the WNP region, but it is not a global effect. Second, besides the significant WNP warming effects on the enhanced TC landfall intensity and TC inland impacts, it is suggested that the weakening of the upper-level Asian Pacific teleconnection pattern since 1970s may also play an important role, which may reduce the climatic 200 hPa anti-cyclonic wind flows over the Asian region, weakening the wind shear near the Philippine Sea, and may eventually intensify the TC intensity when the TCs across the basin. Moreover, the TC inland impacts in the warming future are projected based on a high-resolution (20 km) global model according to the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. By the end of the 21st century, TC mean landfall intensity will increase by 2 m/s (6%). The stronger storms will sustain 4.9 h (56%) longer and penetrate 92.4 km (50%) farther inland, thereby almost doubling the destructive power delivered to Asian inland regions. More inland locations will therefore be exposed to severe storm–related hazards in the future due to warmer climate.

Here, we investigated such organic compounds in marine aerosols collected at Chichijima Island, the western North Pacific for two 4-year periods: 1990–1993 and 2006–2009. A homologous series of lipid biomarkers including C18–C37 n-alkanes, C9–C34 fatty acids, and C14–C35 fatty alcohols were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The atmospheric levels of these tracers increased from 1990–1993 to 2006–2009. Their seasonal trends were clearly characterized by winter–spring maxima and summer–fall minima. The relative abundance of the high-molecular-weight (HMW) n-alkanes (C25–C37) and n-alcohols (C20–C35) in total HMW lipids peaked in winter and winter/fall, respectively, whereas those of HMW fatty acids (C20–C34) peaked in summer. Air-mass backward trajectory analyses suggest that the Asian continent, Southeast Asia including tropical regions, and the Central Pacific are the main source regions. The seasonal shift and distribution of the carbon preference index and average chain length for the HMW lipids were controlled by the changes in climatic factors and source regions. The higher abundance of terrestrial lipids during 2006–2009 than 1990–1993 indicates a higher emission from terrestrial plantation in the 2000s than in the early 1990s in upwind regions of East Asia. Furthermore, HMW lipid compounds exhibited much stronger positive correlations with levoglucosan, a biomass-burning tracer, during 2006–2009 than 1990–1993, suggesting that biomass-burning emissions contributed more significantly in this century. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Average chain length; Fatty acids; Fatty alcohols; Lipid biomarkers; Marine aerosols","Alcohols; Atmospheric aerosols; Biomarkers; Chain length; Gas chromatography; Lipids; Paraffins; Average chain length; Fatty alcohols; High molecular weight; Homologous series; Lipid biomarkers; Marine aerosols; n-Alkanes; Organics; Source region; Western North Pacific; Fatty acids; aerosol; alcohol; biomarker; biomass burning; fatty acid; gas chromatography; lipid; marine atmosphere; mass spectrometry; seasonality; trend analysis; Bonin Islands; Chichijima; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Tokyo [Kanto]; biological marker; lipid; aerosol; air pollutant; biomass; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Biomarkers; Biomass; Environmental Monitoring; Lipids; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111328998

Previous studies have come to inconsistent conclusions on both the quantification of the response of CH4 uptake to N addition and understanding of its underlying mechanisms, probably due to the lack of experimental data. Here, we conduct a broad meta-analysis of 90 papers to quantify the responses of CH4 uptake to N addition in upland soil. The results show that N addition has a significant negative impact on soil CH4 uptake (−19.25%), which is termed the N inhibition effect. Soil pH is identified as the dominant factor, with the other factors affecting the CH4 uptake through the alteration of soil pH. The N inhibition effect is observed to be large and significant in forest and grassland, but small and insignificant in farmland, because of the distinct composition of their methanotrophic communities. A threshold of the N addition level is identified at about 68 kg N ha−1 year−1, which indicates the lowest N inhibition effect. Furthermore, the convex relationship between response ratio of CH4 uptake (negative) and N addition duration indicates that a medium level of N addition duration has the largest N inhibition effect, and longer or shorter durations will both reduce the effect. Our analysis of the N inhibition effect implies that controlling the N addition level could effectively reduce the CH4 concentration in the atmosphere and thus relieve global warming. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Fertilization experiments; Meta-analysis; Methane uptake; Nitrogen addition; Upland soil","Global warming; Methane; Nitrogen; pH effects; Soils; Anthropogenic activity; CH$-4$; Climate process; Fertilization experiment; Inhibition effect; Meta-analysis; Methane uptake; Nitrogen additions; Soil pH; Upland soil; Landforms; methane; nitrogen; methane; fertilizer application; inhibition; meta-analysis; methane; nutrient uptake; pH; soil nitrogen; agricultural land; Article; calculation; chemical composition; environmental impact assessment; forest; grassland; greenhouse effect; mathematical analysis; plantation; soil acidity; soil pollution; structural equation modeling; taiga; temperate deciduous forest; tropical rain forest; water content; climate; meta analysis; soil; Climate; Forests; Methane; Nitrogen; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109450940

The results indicate that the total amount of water used in the YREB tends to be stable overall although it varies from region to region; the water consumption index is still high, especially in the central area, which still has great water saving potential. In the face of major issues that affect water supply safety such as water shortages in quality, water shortages in drought years, and increasing water supply security rates, it is recommended that not only the shortcomings of water engineering construction should be supplemented, and joint control of water conservancy projects should be strengthened. More important is to strengthen water pollution control, save water and reduce emissions, and improve the construction and protection of local water sources and backup water sources.

Many meteorological-based models can estimate global downward solar radiation (DSR), but they are with limited applications due to the point-based estimation and low temporal resolution. Satellite remote sensing-based models can estimate DSR with better spatial coverage. However, most previous models are restricted to estimate clear-sky or monthly scale DSR at several sites, limiting the solar energy monitoring of nationwide scale. In this study, using high spatiotemporal resolution Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-16 satellite data, an iterative random forest (RF) model was developed to estimate and map half-hourly DSR at 1-km spatial resolution over the Continental United States (CONUS). The results show that the iterative RF model performed better than multiple linear regression (MLR) and traditional RF models. The accuracy of estimating half-hourly DSR is that R2 = 0.95, root-mean-square-error (RMSE) = 66.92 W/m2, and mean-bias-error (MBE) = 0.06 W/m2. Half-hourly and daily DSR with spatial resolution 1-km over the CONUS were mapped. The GOES-16 estimated DSR showed the similar spatial patterns with the results from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) DSR product. This study demonstrated the potential of GOES-16 data for mapping DSR over the CONUS, and hence can be further used in solar energy related applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Global solar radiation; Half-hourly; Iterative random forest; Satellite remote sensing; Solar energy","Decision trees; Geostationary satellites; Image resolution; Linear regression; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Solar radiation; Carbon emissions; Downward solar radiation; Energy; Geostationary operational environmental satellites; Half-hourly; Iterative random forest; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Satellite remote sensing; Spatial resolution; Solar energy; algorithm; carbon emission; estimation method; GOES; mapping method; regression analysis; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; satellite data; solar radiation; spatial analysis; spatial resolution; United States; Satellites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109093626

Research on urban ventilation corridors is a hotspot in the field of urban planning. Traditional studies on ventilation corridors mostly focus on qualitative or simulated research on urban climate issues such as the intensified urban heat island effect, serious environmental pollution, and insufficient climate adaptability. Based on the highprecision urban remote sensing image data obtained by aeromagnetic oblique photography, this paper calculates the frontal area density of the city with reference to the urban wind statistics. Based on the existing urban patterns, template matching technology was used to automatically excavate urban ventilation corridors, which provides scientific and reasonable algorithmic support for the rapid construction of potential urban ventilation corridor paths. It also provides technical methods and decision basis for low‐carbon urban planning, ecological planning and microclimate optimization design.

The comparison with published Devonian δ18Oapatite data shows a considerable offset between records from different paleocontinents. This difference can be interpreted by regional variations in salinity, with the epicontinental seas having a distinctly lower salinity and δ18Oseawater than the open ocean due to the influence of fresh-water runoff. Our findings suggest that the oxygen isotope record from open ocean settings is the preferred archive for reconstructing the history of ocean temperature and/or ice volume over the Phanerozoic. Despite regional differences, the South China and European records show similar long-term trends characterized by a pronounced cooling during the Pragian to Eifelian followed by significant warming over the Eifelian/Givetian to Frasnian, and a further cooling starting in the Famennian, accelerating in the earliest Carboniferous. The Early Devonian cooling coincided with early vascular plant root − soil interactions and a significant diversity increase in both spores and megaplant fossils, suggesting that the rise of rooted vascular plants may have played a key role in triggering climate cooling. Subsequent climatic warming over the Middle to Late Devonian transition may have been linked to metamorphic CO2 input from the Acadian Orogeny, while Famennian cooling occurred in a context of exposure and weathering of basalts and ophiolites and coincided with the advent of seed plants. We conclude that climate changes during the Devonian were likely driven by a combination of plant evolutionary advances and changes in tectonics.

However, paddy rice fields are one of the largest anthropogenic sources of methane (CH4 ) emissions. Therefore, suitable crop management practice is necessary to reduce CH4 emissions while rice grain yield is maintained. This study aimed to evaluate appropriate options of fertilizer and water management practices for Thai rice cultivation with regards to improving rice grain yield and reducing CH4 emissions. The Denitrification–Decomposition (DNDC) model was used to simulate grain yield and the emission of CH4 under the three fertilizer options (chemical fertilizer (F), manure (M) and chemical fertilizer + manure (F + M)) with three water management options (continuous flooding (CF), mid-season drainage (MD) and alternate wet and dry (AWD)) during the years 2011–2050. Rain-fed and irrigated rice cropping systems were used. A total of 24 sites distributed in 22 provinces were studied. The data sets of daily climate, soil properties, and rice management practices were required as inputs in the model. Model validation with observation data in a field experiment indicated that simulated grain yields (R2 = 0.83, slope = 0.98, NRMES = 0.30) and cumulative seasonal CH4 emissions (R2 = 0.83, slope = 0.74, NRMES = 0.43) were significantly and positively correlated with the observation. At the end of the simulation period (2046–2050), fertilizer management options of F and F + M gave more grain yield than the M management option by 1–44% in rain-fed rice cropping and 104–190% in irrigated rice cropping system, respectively. Among options, the lower CH4 emissions were found in AWD water management options. The appropriate options with regard to maintaining grain yield and reducing CH4 emissions in the long term were suggested to be F + M with AWD for the rain-fed rice, and F with AWD for the irrigated rice cropping systems. © 2021 by the authors.

We investigate the impact of COVID-19 on air pollution in the two largest cities in Taiwan, which were not subject to economic or mobility restrictions. Using a difference-in-differences approach and real-time data on air quality and transportation, we estimate that anthropogenic air pollution from local sources increased during working days and decreased during non-working days during the COVID-19 pandemic. This led to a 3–7 percent increase in CO, O3, SO2, PM10 and PM2.5. We demonstrate that the increase in air pollution resulted from a shift in preferred mode of travel away from public transportation and towards personal motor vehicles during working days. In particular, metro and shared bicycle usage decreased between 8 and 18 percent, on average, while automobile and scooter use increased between 11 and 21 percent during working days. Similar COVID-19 prevention behaviors in regions or countries emerging from lockdowns could likewise result in an increase in air pollution. Taking action to reduce the transmissibility of COVID-19 on metro cars, trains and buses could help policymakers limit the substitution of personal motor vehicles for public transit, and mitigate increases in air pollution when lifting mobility restrictions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic air pollution; COVID-19; Disease prevention; Transportation demand","cobalt; oxide; sulfur oxide; air quality; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; pollution control; public transport; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; Article; car; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; econometric model; elasticity; environmental policy; human; infection prevention; lockdown; motor vehicle; pandemic; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; Taiwan; traffic and transport; travel; virus transmission; air pollutant; city; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; pandemic; particulate matter; prevention and control; Taiwan; Coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112755157

Objectives: To delineate the relationship between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a key constituent of atmospheric pollution, and immunity/skin pigmentation pathways. Methods: We exposed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to PAHs and performed cytokines/chemokine profiling. We then examined the effect of immune activation on pigmentation by co-culturing PBMC and Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) with reconstructed human pigmented epidermis (RHPE). To study the mechanism, we treated keratinocytes with conditioned medium from BaP-exposed PBMC and studied DNA damage responses, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation and pro-pigmentation factor, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) secretion. Results: PAHs induced up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines/chemokine in PBMC. Co-culturing of RHPE with PBMC+BaP resulted in increased melanin content and localization. BaP-conditioned medium significantly increased DNA damage, p53 stabilization, AhR activation and POMC secretion in keratinocytes. We found that IFNγ induced DNA damage, while TNFα and IL-8 potentiated POMC secretion in keratinocytes. Importantly, BaP-conditioned medium-induced DNA damage and POMC secretion is prevented by antioxidants vitamin E, vitamin C and sulforaphane, as well as the prototypical corticosteroid dexamethasone. Finally, vitamin C and sulforaphane enhanced the genome protective and depigmentation effects of dexamethasone, providing proof-of-concept for a combinatorial approach for the prevention and/or correction of PAH-induced pigment spots formation. Conclusion: Our study reveals the importance of systemic immunity in regulating PAH-induced skin pigmentation, and provide a new keratinocyte DNA damage response mechanistic target for the prevention or reversal of pollution-associated skin pigmentation. © 2021 The Authors","AhR pathway; Benzo(a)pyrene; DNA damage responses; Pollution; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Skin pigmentation","alpha tocopherol; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; ascorbic acid; benzo[a]pyrene; cell protein; dexamethasone; gamma interferon; interleukin 8; melanin; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; proopiomelanocortin; protein p53; protein propigmentation factor; sulforaphane; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; air pollution; Article; cell culture; cell protection; cellular distribution; coculture; concentration (parameter); controlled study; DNA damage; drug effect; environmental impact; epidermis; human; human cell; immune response; immunity; keratinocyte; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; protein secretion; protein stability; skin pigmentation; upregulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117782988

Modelling of thermal energy decarbonisation becomes increasingly complex as additional technology options are included. Spatial aspects become increasingly important when considering heat transport, for example using district heating. This study develops a model for heating energy decarbonisation that makes use of a techno-economic model applied to a large geographic area (Western Switzerland) at high spatial resolution. Global sensitivity analysis is applied to quantify the variance characteristics of the model. Heating energy services provided by retrofits, decentralised heat pumps, and thermal networks are considered. Final energy demand reductions ranges of 70–80% and emissions reductions of 90% were found with levelized costs of providing the heat service of 0.14–0.22CHF/kWh. High sensitivities were found with respect to efficiency parameters (retrofit potentials and seasonal performance factors). The spatial distribution of costs and sensitivities was shown to be highly variable, with a strong correlation with building density. This raises important questions, notably on equitable distribution of energy transition costs. © 2021","Building stock; Decarbonisation; Efficiency; Geospatial; Heat; Sensitivity analysis","Decarbonization; Heating; Retrofitting; Sensitivity analysis; Building stocks; Decarbonisation; Decarbonising; Energy; Energy services; Geo-spatial; Global sensitivity analysis; Heat; Heat energy; Heating energy; Efficiency; carbon emission; emission control; global change; numerical model; sensitivity analysis; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112806709

Using survey data collected in Guinea in 2012, the paper investigates the factors affecting households’ strategies to face adverse climate change impacts. A three-step methodology is applied: (1) assessment of the magnitude of real climatic trends in the study area together with farmers’ perception of climate change; (2) identification of physical and socioeconomic variables influencing farmers’ adaptation propensity; and (3) analysis of factors affecting adaptation choices, including climate change perception. The climatic data analysis confirms increase in minimum and maximum temperature trends, increase in annual average millimeters of rain, and decrease in average number of storms per year. Farmers’ perception of climate change turned out to be aligned with historical climatic trends and represents an important determinant for the adoption of adaptation strategies. The regression model results suggest that the propensity to adapt is positively influenced by the level of education and a limited access to water resources and agricultural inputs, forcing households to adopt new cropping calendars. Effective policy action should consider different areas, including climate change awareness, education, access to natural and physical assets, and availability of economic resources to local communities. © 2021 The Authors.

Starting from the available standards and scientific literature on life cycle assessment (LCA), this paper advances an operational definition for CNB on the basis of an explicit calculation approach. It then applies the definition to an urban case study, comparing it against a state-of‐the‐art nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB) scenario, with the intent of highlighting the major practical limitations connected to the application of a methodologically sound carbon neutrality cal-culation. The case study shows that carbon neutral objectives can hardly be achieved by single urban buildings because of the lack of spaces that can provide onsite carbon offsetting actions. Carbon neutrality may be better approached at the city, regional, or national scales, where overarching policies may be defined. © 2021 by the authors.

The continued tropical deforestation warrants a re-examination of this approach in order to customize its application for a particular location. Our paper contributes to this by exploring the spatial associations between deforestation and the production of cacao, coffee, and oil palm in the Amazon region in Peru. The geographical overlaps between deforestation, and the distribution of these commodity crops, indicate four types of spatial associations: (1) a high degree of deforestation and a high degree of commodity production (high-high); (2) a high degree of deforestation and a low degree of commodity production (high-low); (3) a low degree of deforestation and a high degree of commodity production (low-high); and (4) a low degree of deforestation and a low degree of commodity production (low-low). On the basis of these associations, we present four scenarios in which zero-deforestation supply chain interventions may operate in Peru and argue that broadening the perspective of such interventions by adopting a global value chain lens can improve the use of previously deforested lands, prevent unintended or future deforestation and, in turn, ensure that no forest area is left behind. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, it is crucial to understand the real impact of climate on track behavior to provide the best design and performance to a railroad, in terms of safety, production, and lower maintenance costs. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the influence of the water content and suction changes on the hydro-mechanical behavior of a railroad track subgrade considering a tropical climate (southeast of Brazil). Therefore, climate-railroad track substructure interaction was evaluated through numerical analysis (FEM). Geotechnical material parameters were obtained from laboratory tests and from the literature. The numerical model was developed to evaluate water content/suction variation in the subgrade induced by local climatic actions over time. Numerical results were compared with data obtained from suction sensors installed at the subgrade of an experimental track section built in an existing railroad. Water content/suction outputs from the model and field monitoring were applied to resilient modulus tests in laboratory to simulate and to evaluate climate impacts on the subgrade mechanical behavior. The results highlighted the importance of climate aspects to the hydraulic behavior of a railroad track substructure. An important variation of soil suction over time was observed. In addition, suction directly influences the subgrade soil resilient modulus which may contribute to the railroad track geometry deterioration. This paper contributed to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the actual climatic influence on the hydro-mechanical behavior of a railroad track subgrade over time. It could be concluded that climate significantly impacts the hydro-mechanical behavior of the track subgrade, highlighting that the soil studied is not appropriate for the local climatic condition. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate actions; FEM modeling; Railroad substructure; Suction; Unsaturated soil","climate effect; data; finite element method; hydromechanics; numerical model; railway; suction; unsaturated medium; water content; Brazil",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116067937

Highly spatially resolved information on pollution levels and disease rates is necessary to characterize inequities in air pollution exposure and related health risks. We leverage recent advances in deriving surface pollution levels from satellite remote sensing and granular data in disease rates for one city, Washington, DC, to assess intra-urban heterogeneity in fine particulate matter (PM2.5)- attributable mortality and morbidity. We estimate PM2.5-attributable cases of all-cause mortality, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, and asthma emergency department (ED) visits using epidemiologically derived health impact functions. Data inputs include satellite-derived annual mean surface PM2.5 concentrations; age-resolved population estimates; and statistical neighborhood-, zip code- and ward-scale disease counts. We find that PM2.5 concentrations and associated health burdens have decreased in DC between 2000 and 2018, from approximately 240 to 120 cause-specific deaths and from 40 to 30 asthma ED visits per year (between 2014 and 2018). However, remaining PM2.5-attributable health risks are unevenly and inequitably distributed across the District. Higher PM2.5-attributable disease burdens were found in neighborhoods with larger proportions of people of color, lower household income, and lower educational attainment. Our study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the inequity in air pollution exposure levels and pollution health risks between population sub-groups, and highlights the need for both high-resolution disease rates and concentration estimates for understanding intra-urban disparities in air pollution-related health risks. © 2021 The Authors.

Yet, no prior studies have assessed disparities in exposure to methane superemitters with respect to race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and civic engagement. To do so, we obtained the location, category (e.g., landfill, refinery), and emission rate of California methane superemitters from Next Generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) flights conducted between 2016 and 2018. We identified block groups within 2 km of superemitters (exposed) and 5-10 km away (unexposed) using dasymetric mapping and assigned level of exposure among block groups within 2 km (measured via number of superemitter categories and total methane emissions). Analyses included 483 superemitters. The majority were dairy/manure (n= 213) and oil/gas production sites (n= 127). Results from fully adjusted logistic mixed models indicate environmental injustice in methane superemitter locations. For example, for every 10% increase in non-Hispanic Black residents, the odds of exposure increased by 10% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.17). We observed similar disparities for Hispanics and Native Americans but not with indicators of socioeconomic status. Among block groups located within 2 km, increasing proportions of non-White populations and lower voter turnout were associated with higher superemitter emission intensity. Previously unrecognized racial/ethnic disparities in exposure to California methane superemitters should be considered in policies to tackle methane emissions. © 2021 The Authors.

However, on average, NGCCs are running only 54 percent of the time. Utilizing excess NGCC capacity, as a substitute for coal generation, is a short-term policy solution for reducing greenhouse gases. In this research, we evaluate the impact of a carbon tax on substitution of natural gas for coal in the U.S. electricity sector. Through fixed effects regression and counterfactual calculations, we analyze data from 2003 to 2017 to evaluate the impact of a carbon tax on NGCC utilization, carbon emissions, and federal tax revenue between 2020 and 2030. We find the highest marginal increase in NGCC utilization happens with a carbon tax priced at $10/ton. Depending on future estimated changes in natural gas capacity, a $10 carbon tax would reduce carbon emissions between 1.39 and 1.55 billion metric tons per year and generate $106.47 to $118.33 billion in net revenue. The carbon tax we propose would be simpler to implement than an economy-wide policy and would still lead to significant carbon reductions and federal tax revenue in the short-run. © 2021","Carbon tax; Electricity; Environmental policy; Natural gas","Carbon; Coal; Electric industry; Emission control; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Taxation; A-carbon; Carbon emissions; Carbon taxes; Electricity sector; Emission taxes; Environmental policy; Federal tax; Natural gas combined cycles; Short term; Tax revenue; Natural gas; carbon emission; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; natural gas; tax system; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113543774

This paper evaluates whether the conservation of their values can coexist with the current energy efficiency requirements and be included in urban decarbonization plans to prevent neglect and degradation. For this, a comprehensive decarbonization plan was drawn up based on the results of a previous energy audit on the case study selected, an 18th-century listed residential building in Seville, Spain. Envelope improvement was combined with mechanical ventilation and an integrated heat pump combining RESs and electricity from the public grid to cover all thermal needs in order to reach NZEB performance in the building. Despite the complexity of integrating demanding energy efficiency standards into heritage buildings, which requires case-by-case analysis and dynamic simulation, findings show a notable degree of approximation to NZEB performance. The main obstacles stem from the large amount of energy consumed by auxiliary systems and the relatively low presence of RESs in the national electricity mix. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Built heritage decarbonization; Energy retrofit; Heritage housing; Hybrid energy system; RES building integration; Thermal comfort","Decarbonization; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy efficiency; Housing; Hybrid systems; Ventilation; Build heritage decarbonization; Case-studies; Energy retrofit; Heritage buildings; Heritage housing; Hybrid energy system; RES building integration; Seville; Thermal; Thermal comfort",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111541119

In light of increased renewable energy share in the electricity mix, it is crucial to boost residential electrification for building decarbonization. Consequently, building regulation ought to send the proper signals to the market to encourage electrification and avoid establishing new fossil fuel-based infrastructure, which may lock in future interventions and seriously compromise climate change mitigation. This paper studies short-term residential electrification with electric water tanks in Spain using a parametric analysis considering several water heater configurations with various sizes and management strategies, using different draw-off profiles, actual time-dependent electricity prices, and CO2 factors. The results demonstrate significant GHG savings when substituting fossil fuel boilers for any water heater configuration. However, current electricity prices are such that technology change is only cost effective for low hot water demands (1–2 people) and the provided fossil fuel supply is completely removed from dwellings. The exploitation of implicit demand response increases cost-effectiveness. The analysis of Spanish regulation shows that some elements of current policies on energy efficiency in buildings hamper residential electrification, consequently policy changes are proposed. © 2021 by the authors.

These resources have been strongly impacted by the increases in temperature and in the variation in precipitation. Despite many advances, the relationship between climate change and the dynamics of aquifer recharge is still poorly understood. This study includes an analysis of 211 papers using the biblioshiny function in the bibliometric R Package. Additionally, specific papers were selected to identify limits, trends and negative and positive impacts. The results indicated an average growth of 14.38% and a significant increase in research from 2009. In total, 52 countries have undertaken studies in this field, just over 26% of the total number of countries. In the papers examined, the worst projections related to reductions in recharge were i for arid and desert areas; the highest recharges were identified in the northern regions and in areas at high altitudes, where recharge capacity is maintained or increases due to rapid snow and glacial melting resulting from temperature increases. Despite the advances achieved, more studies should be extended to analyse groundwater assessment at other latitudes to reach a complete and comprehensive understanding.

The paper aims to study the vegetal landscape around Manot Cave in the context of climate changes that characterized the last part of the Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) and to address the issue of firewood and food procurement among Paleolithic hunter-gatherers. Charcoal samples recovered from the archaeological layers at Manot Cave shed light on the fuel and food procurement strategies while radiocarbon dating and stable carbon isotope analysis (Δ13C) of selected charcoals provide information about the ancient climate. The results show that five woody taxa were exploited at the site; Amygdalus sp. was the most common species, whereas Quercus ithaburensis, Tamarix sp., Pomoideae indet., and Pistacia atlantica were relatively rare. The representations of the recovered wooden species suggest that an open forest of almonds and oaks existed in the area during MIS 3. Radiocarbon dating of Amygdalus sp. charcoals, coupled with stable carbon isotope analysis (Δ13C) of modern and archaeological Amygdalus sp. clearly indicate variations in rainfall that could have decreased the density of tree cover. These analyses provide high-resolution data on the climate changes affecting the surroundings of Manot Cave between ∼46 and 28 ka cal BP and indicate two drier phases corresponding to the Ahmarian and post-Levantine Aurignacian cultures while a more humid period identified during the Levantine Aurignacian. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon isotopes; Climate; Early Upper Paleolithic; Firewood; Manot Cave","archaeology; carbon isotope; climate change; human settlement; hunter-gatherer; isotopic analysis; marine isotope stage; Paleolithic; stable isotope; wood; Israel; Manot Cave; Northern District; Pistacia atlantica; Prunus; Prunus dulcis; Quercus ithaburensis; Tamarix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091867853

Secondary aerosols converted from precursor gases (i.e., nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds) evidently account for a large fraction of the PM2.5. Conventional control methods, such as dust removal, desulfurization, and denitrification, help reduce emissions from stationary combustion sources, but these measures have not led to decreases in haze events. Recent advances in nanomaterials and nanotechnology provide new opportunities for removing fine particles and gaseous pollutants from ambient air and reducing the impacts on human health. This review begins with overviews of air pollution and traditional abatement technologies, and then advances in ambient air purification by nanotechnologies, including filtration, adsorption, photocatalysis, and ambient-temperature catalysis are pre-sented—from fundamental principles to applications. Current state-of-the-art developments in the use of nanomaterials for particle removal, gas adsorption, and catalysis are summarized, and practical applications of catalysis-based techniques for air purification by nanomaterials in indoor, semi-enclosed, and open spaces are highlighted. Finally, we propose future directions for the development of novel disinfectant nanomaterials and the construction of advanced air purification devices. © 2021 by the authors.

However, high stand density could increase the negative effects of warming-induced drought through inter-tree competition. How neighborhood competition impacts tree growth responding to climate change remains unclear. Here, we utilized the Changbai Mountain region in northeastern Asia as our study area. We quantified individual tree growth using tree-ring samples collected from three dominant tree species growing in three forest stand density levels. We estimated the effects of climate warming and forest stand density on growth processes and tested for a species-specific response to climate. Our results demonstrated that overall 25% of Korean pine, but only ~3% of Mongolian oak and ~ 4% of Manchurian ash experienced growth reduction. Increased forest density can also exacerbate growth reduction. We identified a climate turning point in 1984, where warming rapidly increased, and defined two groups, “enhance group” (EG) and “decline group” (DG), according to the individual tree growth trend after 1984. For the EG, climate warming increased temperature sensitivity, but the temperature sensitivity declined with increasing stand density for the whole study period. For the DG, tree growth sensitivity shifted from temperature to precipitation after 1984, driven by increased competition pressure under climate warming. Our study concludes that growth decline from warming-induced drought might be amplified by high forest stand density, was especially pronounced in conifer trees. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate-growth relationships; Coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest; Forest stand density; Tree growth and decline","Climate change; Forestry; Climate warming; Climate-growth relationship; Coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest; Forest stand; Forest stand density; Growth decline; High forests; Stand densities; Tree decline; Tree growth; Drought; broad-leaved forest; climate change; coniferous forest; coniferous tree; drought; growth rate; mixed forest; stand structure; temperate forest; tree; warming; article; ash; Asia; climate warming; competition; conifer; drought; forest stand; nonhuman; precipitation; Quercus mongolica; temperature sensitivity; tree growth; Asia; climate change; forest; pine; tree; vascular plant; Baekdu Mountain; Changbai Mountains; Northeast Asia; Coniferophyta; Fraxinus mandshurica; Pinus koraiensis; Quercus mongolica; Asia; Climate Change; Forests; Pinus; Tracheophyta; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109214927

We aimed to explore the associations of air pollutants and meteorological factors with COVID-19 confirmed cases during the outbreak period throughout China. The number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, air pollutant concentrations, and meteorological factors in China from January 25 to February 29, 2020, (36 days) were extracted from authoritative electronic databases. The associations were estimated for a single-day lag as well as moving averages lag using generalized additive mixed models. Region-specific analyses and meta-analysis were conducted in 5 selected regions from the north to south of China with diverse air pollution levels and weather conditions and sufficient sample size. Nonlinear concentration–response analyses were performed. An increase of each interquartile range in PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO at lag4 corresponded to 1.40 (1.37–1.43), 1.35 (1.32–1.37), 1.01 (1.00–1.02), 1.08 (1.07–1.10), 1.28 (1.27–1.29), and 1.26 (1.24–1.28) ORs of daily new cases, respectively. For 1°C, 1%, and 1 m/s increase in temperature, relative humidity, and wind velocity, the ORs were 0.97 (0.97–0.98), 0.96 (0.96–0.97), and 0.94 (0.92–0.95), respectively. The estimates of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and all meteorological factors remained significantly after meta-analysis for the five selected regions. The concentration–response relationships showed that higher concentrations of air pollutants and lower meteorological factors were associated with daily new cases increasing. Higher air pollutant concentrations and lower temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity may favor COVID-19 transmission. Controlling ambient air pollution, especially for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, may be an important component of reducing risk of COVID-19 infection. In addition, as winter months are arriving in China, the meteorological factors may play a negative role in prevention. Therefore, it is significant to implement the public health control measures persistently in case another possible pandemic. © The Author(s) 2021.","ambient air pollutants; China; COVID-19; meteorological factors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119958813

However, its cultivated area in the Mediterranean rim steadily increased during the last 20 years due to its good adaptation to a wide range of soils. Nevertheless, under Mediterranean cultivation conditions, oats have to face high temperatures and drought episodes that reduce its yield as compared with northern regions. Therefore, oat crop needs to be improved for adaptation to Mediterranean environments. In this work, we investigated the influence of climatic and edaphic variables on a collection of 709 Mediterranean landraces and cultivars growing under Mediterranean conditions. We performed genotype–environment interaction analysis using heritability-adjusted genotype plus genotype–environment biplot analyses to determine the best performing accessions. Further, their local adaptation to different environmental variables and the partial contribution of climate and edaphic factors to the different agronomic traits was determined through canonical correspondence, redundancy analysis, and variation partitioning. Here, we show that northern bred elite cultivars were not among the best performing accessions in Mediterranean environments, with several landraces outyielding these. While all the best performing cultivars had early flowering, this was not the case for all the best performing landraces, which showed different patterns of adaption to Mediterranean agroclimatic conditions. Thus, higher yielding landraces showed adaptation to moderate to low levels of rain during pre- and post-flowering periods and moderate to high temperature and radiation during post-flowering period. This analysis also highlights landraces adapted to more extreme environmental conditions. The study allowed the selection of oat genotypes adapted to different climate and edaphic factors, reducing undesired effect of environmental variables on agronomic traits and highlights the usefulness of variation partitioning for selecting genotypes adapted to specific climate and edaphic conditions.

In addition, the recycling rates of current municipal waste management are low. In this regard, this study aims at estimating the climate change impact of current food delivery packaging and its waste treatment, by performing a Life Cycle Assessment with a cradle-to-grave approach. In addition, this article explores the potential benefits of increasing the current recycling rates, the recycled content of the packaging as well as the use of reusable packaging. For this study, the food packaging of a typical dumpling-based meal of the popular Chinese restaurant Xijiade was selected. Based on this menu and the current Chinese consumption patterns, the food delivery packaging in China would have emitted about 13 million tons of CO2eq. Increasing current recycling rates to 35% would reduce 16% the emissions of single-use packaging, and further decrease (60%) could be found if half of the packaging was made of recycled material. In addition, if single-use packaging was replaced by reusable PP-based packaging (food container and carrier bag), the emissions would potentially be 63% lower than the current situation. In this case, doubling the recycling rates and the recycled content of the reusable food packaging would represent an extra 6 and 17% reduction of emissions, respectively. © 2021","Climate change; Life cycle assessment; Recycled content; Recycling rate; Reusable food container","Climate change; Containers; Life cycle; Packaging; Packaging machines; Waste treatment; 'current; Case-studies; Delivery service; Food delivery; Food packaging; Recycled content; Recycling rate; Reusable food container; Reusable packaging; Single use; Recycling; climate change; climate effect; life cycle analysis; solid waste; waste management; China; China; environmental protection; food packaging; packaging; recycling; waste management; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Food Packaging; Product Packaging; Recycling; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109595063

However, few studies explored the influences of land use polices on carbon storage and sequestration in a rapidly urbanizing region. Through Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, the spatial-temporal pattern of carbon storage altered by LULC transformation and its linkage with land use policies were analyzed in five periods (1990–1995, 1995–2000, 2000–2005, 2000–2010, 2010–2015) in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) Region. The results indicated that: (1) the carbon storage in the YRD was substantially altered by continuous LULC transformation, totally decreased by 1.49 × 107 Mg during 1990–2015. (2) The total amount of carbon storage increased from 2.91 × 109 Mg in 1990 to 2.95 × 109 Mg in 1995, and then decreased to 2.90 × 109 Mg in 1995–2015. Thus, the total economic value of carbon storage increased approximately from 467.42 million dollars in 1990 to 472.99 million dollars in 1995, and then decreased to 465.01 million dollars in 2015. (3) The carbon storage and sequestration were influenced by LULC transformation driven by land use policies in five periods: large areas of grassland converted to woodland in 1990–1995 led by Forest Law, then clustered areas of cropland converted to built-up land in 1995–2015 around large cities of YRD Region led by Land Management Law and Development Plans, and finally, the conversion of cropland to built-up land was decreased and scattered in the entire region influenced by land use polices led by early stage of ecocivilization construction.

In this study, the effects of various parameters in the regeneration of CO2 gasification of residual char were studied. Since the CO2 gasification of residual char was an endothermic reaction, the reaction rate increased with temperature. The maximum reaction rate appeared at a CO2 partial pressure of 80%. The carbon conversion rate of residual char increased upon increasing the CO2 capture capacity of sorbent. The CO2 gasification of residual char complied with the shrinking core model instead of the volumetric reaction model, and the municipal solid waste (MSW) char after CO2 gasification was cylindrical shape. The apparent activation energy decreased after adding a sorbent, showing that the CO2 gasification of residual char was improved by adding a sorbent. These results provide an approach to enhance the CO2 utilization in regenerator, outlets and help reduce the oxygen demand and heat losses. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Calcium‒based looping gasification; CO2 gasification behaviors; Regenerator; Residual char","Activation energy; Calcium; Carbon; Gasification; Reaction rates; Regenerators; Sorbents; Calcium‒based looping gasification; Carbon conversion rate; Carbon-based fuels; Chemical looping; CO2 gasification behavior; Endothermic reactions; Maximum reaction rate; Reactions rates; Residual char; Shrinking core model; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111221743

The question of what the future holds for these aquifers is one of global importance. Without better information about subsurface conditions, it will be difficult to reliably assess an aquifer's response to management actions and climatic stresses. One important but underutilized source of information is the data from monitoring well networks that provide near-continuous records of water levels through time. Most organizations running these networks are, by necessity, primarily focused on network maintenance. The result is that relatively little attention is given to interpretation of the acquired hydrographs. However, embedded in those hydrographs is valuable information about subsurface conditions and aquifer responses to natural and anthropogenic stresses. We demonstrate the range of insights that can be gleaned from such hydrographs using data from the High Plains aquifer index well network of the Kansas Geological Survey. We show how information about an aquifer's hydraulic state and lateral extent, the nature of recharge, the hydraulic connection to the aquifer and nearby pumping wells, and the expected response to conservation-based pumping reductions can be extracted from these hydrographs. The value of this information is dependent on accurate water-level measurements; errors in those measurements can make it difficult to fully exploit the insights that water-well hydrographs can provide. We therefore conclude by presenting measures that can help reduce the potential for such errors. © 2021 National Ground Water Association.",,"Agricultural robots; Hydrogeology; Potable water; Pumps; Water levels; Water supply; Water wells; Anthropogenic stress; Climatic stress; Hydraulic connection; Irrigated agriculture; Monitoring wells; Network maintenances; Subsurface conditions; Well networks; Aquifers; agriculture; aquifer; drinking water; information; monitoring; pumping; Great Plains; Kansas; United States; ground water; well water; agriculture; geology; water supply; Agriculture; Geology; Groundwater; Water Supply; Water Wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108995272

Operational scenarios are analysed using different types of on-demand solutions that can complement the existing GO Transit commuter train system. Various use cases of demand-responsive vehicles are explored in terms of vehicle capacity and fleet-size. It is assumed that the existing car-based trips to the four train stations in Markham would be replaced by an on-demand rideshare transit system. The on-demand transit system is simulated using the PTV MaaS Modeller in combination with a mesoscopic simulation, involving 1,865 trip requests within the morning peak from 7AM to 10AM. Wait-time, travel time, demand served, cost, and environmental impact are used as indicators to rate various options. Evaluating the results we came to the conclusion that three cases using vans are providing favourable outcomes. The van-based scenario using 75% of an optimal fleet size and a low detour factor turned out to be very appropriate with regard to the case study. A passenger in this scenario would at an average spend 3 min waiting for the service to arrive and 10 min in the vehicle, costing 7CAD for the ride. With a typical level of public transit subsidies applied, a 7% monthly saving is expected compared to using a private car and paying for parking fees. The scenario also results in 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions when compared to current personal vehicle based trips. Based on the simulation, policy suggestions for implementing the on-demand transit in Markham are presented. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","First-mile transit; Greenhouse gas emissions; On-demand; Ridesharing; Scenario analysis; Simulation","Environmental impact; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Mass transportation; Trucks; Urban transportation; Case-studies; First mile; First-mile transit; Greenhouse gas emissions; Markham; On demands; Ride-sharing; Scenarios analysis; Simulation; Transit systems; Travel time; carbon emission; commuting; greenhouse gas; public transport; scenario analysis; simulation; suburban area; travel demand; Canada; Markham; Ontario [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116021471

Transmitted by direct contact and by several biting insect species, this disease results in quarantines and animal movement restrictions in horses, cattle and swine. As changes in climate drive shifts in geographic distributions of vectors and the viruses they transmit, there is considerable need to improve understanding of relationships among environmental drivers and patterns of disease occurrence. Multidisciplinary approaches integrating pathology, ecology, climatology, and biogeophysics are increasingly relied upon to disentangle complex relationships governing disease. We used a big data model integration approach combined with machine learning to estimate the potential geographic range of VS across the continental United States (CONUS) under long-term mean climate conditions over the past 30 years. The current extent of VS is confined to the western portion of the US and is related to summer and winter precipitation, winter maximum temperature, elevation, fall vegetation biomass, horse density, and proximity to water. Comparison with a climate-only model illustrates the importance of current processes-based parameters and identifies regions where uncertainty is likely to be greatest if mechanistic processes change. We then forecast shifts in the range of VS using climate change projections selected from CMIP5 climate models that most realistically simulate seasonal temperature and precipitation. Climate change scenarios that altered climatic conditions resulted in greater changes to potential range of VS, generally had non-uniform impacts in core areas of the current potential range of VS and expanded the range north and east. We expect that the heterogeneous impacts of climate change across the CONUS will be exacerbated with additional changes in land use and land cover affecting biodiversity and hydrological cycles that are connected to the ecology of insect vectors involved in VS transmission. © 2021 by the authors.

However, research has found that while today’s BEVs typically reduce GHGs, they can increase certain CAPs, though with significant regional variability based on the electric grid mix. In addition, the environmental performance of electric and gasoline vehicles is not static, as key factors driving emissions have undergone significant changes recently and are expected to continue to evolve. In this study, we perform a cradle-to-grave life cycle analysis using state-level generation mix and vehicle operation emission data. We generated state-level emission factors using a projection from 2020 to 2050 for three light-duty vehicle types. We found that BEVs currently provide GHG benefits in nearly every state, with the median state’s benefit being between approximately 50% to 60% lower than gasoline counterparts. However, gasoline vehicles currently have lower total NOx, urban NOx, total PM2.5, and urban PM2.5 in 33%; 15%; 70%; and 10% of states, respectively. BEV emissions will decrease in 2050 due to a cleaner grid, but the relative benefits when compared to gasoline vehicles do not change significantly, as gasoline vehicles are also improving over this time. © 2021 by the authors.

The new build stock contributed approximately 55 % of the total office building sector carbon footprint. Operational energy use accounted for 86 % and 36 % of the existing and new build stock carbon footprints, respectively. Raw material supply, construction and manufacture contribute 53 % of the new build stock carbon footprint.

The potential ozone uptake to vegetation through open stomata can be quantified using stomatal conductance measurements under the local environmental conditions. This study compares the ozone stomatal conductance to vegetation obtained with a modified Jarvis formula adopted from the Vegetation Manual of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, and experimental field measurements’ data. The stomatal conductance was measured by a portable photosynthesis and gas exchange analyzer system LiCOR6400. The measurements were performed in the submontane environment of the High Tatra Mountains in Slovakia on Swiss pine (Pinus cembra), as a native species of the local flora. According to previous studies, Swiss pine is considered as an ozone-sensitive species. The modified Jarvis model for the ozone stomatal conductance is compared with the field measurements. The suitable parameterization of the modified Jarvis model for Swiss pine is obtained. The parameterization of stomatal conductance for Swiss pine in the local environment would help understand its specificity and similarity to other conifer species. In the case of using parameterization for a boreal coniferous from the Vegetation Manual of the International Cooperative Programme on Effects of Air Pollution on Natural Vegetation and Crops, validation of the model with the measurements without temperature adjustment of the conifer chamber achieved a coefficient of determination of R2 = 0.75. This result is not in contradiction with the previous researches. With the optimal set of parameters, obtained in this paper, the Jarvis model reaches R2 = 0.85. The data suggest that Jarvis-type models with appropriate parameterization are applicable for stomatal conductance estimation for Pinus cembra when the measurements do not modify the temperature regime. © 2021 by the authors.

While in some regions fisheries management systems address wider ecosystem dynamics within management frameworks and decision-making, which may facilitate resilience to climate change, there remains a shortfall in terms of directly incorporating climate change adaptation into fisheries management legislation and implementation. This review assesses the current state of implementation of climate change adaptation into fisheries management policies and legislation across 11 national case studies, based on government documents and the primary literature. The overarching goal is to understand the key elements and gaps in existing fisheries management policies and legislation in the context of climate change. Given recent reforms of fisheries management policies and/or legislation across the nations examined, political recognition of the need to address climate change adaptation in fisheries management appears to be increasing; albeit formal mandates of climate-adaptation objectives in fisheries management are largely missing. Based on our review, recommendations for achieving climate-adaptive fisheries management regimes are developed. Overall, this study will help to inform and broaden the scope of management approaches and tools to accelerate the move towards adaptive fisheries management that accounts for climate change impacts on fish stocks, fisheries and the societies that depend upon them. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change impacts; commercial fisheries; governance; management tools; marine ecosystems; mitigation strategies","adaptive management; climate change; detection method; ecosystem dynamics; fishery management; fishery policy; policy approach; policy implementation; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109175974

In addition to estimating the size of the DR gap, we identify its causes and consequences. By modifying parameters of the U.S. flagship National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), we generate a baseline DR forecast with a default 4% maximum on-peak demand reduction, an achievable case with a DR limit of 20%, and a technical scenario that also halved the cost of storage. The results document many benefits of DR including a demand-reduction induced price effect (DRIPE), which makes DR more equitable than many other clean-energy policies that shift costs to non-participants. Our modeling results, literature review, and focus group analysis enable identification of DR barriers and motivators related to financial costs, electricity rates, consumer bills, pollution emissions, public health, energy equity, and inclusion. Our results suggest that the DR gap is caused less by technology limitations than by the need for financing initiatives, market innovations, infrastructure modernization, and enablers of socio-economic inclusion. By studying a state that lags in DR implementation, other countries and sub-national entities where DR is under-utilized can learn from our findings and methods. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon reduction; Demand-response gap; Distributed energy resources; Energy equity; Smart appliances","Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Economics; Energy resources; Investments; Carbon reduction; Demand reduction; Demand response; Demand-response gap; Distributed Energy Resources; Energy equity; Georgia; Modifying parameters; Policy options; Smart appliances; Modernization; demand-side management; energy resource; energy storage; equity; scenario analysis; Georgia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115363761

This has led to the design of new injection-combustion strategies working on more risky and problematic operating points such as those close to the lean extinction limit. In This context, the Lean Direct Injection (LDI) concept has emerged as a promising technology to reduce NOx for future aircraft power plants. The study of liquid fuel injection, atomization, evaporation and later interaction with air by means of a numerical approach is deemed to provide a detailed description of these phenomena affecting the overall engine cycle efficiency and emissions. In this context, the aim of this research is to use Large Eddy Simulation for the characterisation of the structure of a liquid non-reacting spray immersed in a strong swirling field in the CORIA Spray LDI burner. An Eulerian formulation is considered for the continuous phase and is coupled with a Lagrangian description for the dispersed phase. A precise description of the fuel droplet size distribution and size-classified velocity, as well as the characterisation of the instantaneous, mean and fluctuating air velocities is presented and compared to the available experimental data. The fuel spray model is shown to accurately reproduce the computed Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) and the velocity of the droplets. Moreover, the main flow structures generated within the combustor (e.g., Precessing Vortex Core, Vortex Breakdown Bubble, recirculation zones, etc.), which play a crucial role in the fuel-air mixing process, are quantitatively characterised through advanced frequency analysis such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). The characteristic swirling frequency of a single-branched PVC presenting two different phase-shifted POD modes with the same associated spectrum is detected. Finally, POD and DMD techniques are also applied to the numerical spray data to further investigate the spray-turbulence interactions inside the combustion chamber. In ths regard, DMD analysis has confirmed how the swirl-acoustic interactions led in the VBB and PVC oscillations play a crucial role in the way the fuel spray is internally forced by the PVC wavemaker travelling downstream the swirler and synchronised with its dominant frequency. This will contribute to a better understanding of the mixing quality and local equivalence ratios before the subsequent ignition process. © 2021 The Author(s)","Dynamic Mode Decomposition; Gas turbine combustor; Large Eddy Simulation; Proper Orthogonal Decomposition; Swirling flow","Air; Combustion; Combustion chambers; Combustors; Direct injection; Drops; Efficiency; Fuels; Gas turbines; Lagrange multipliers; Large eddy simulation; Liquids; Spectrum analysis; Vortex flow; Analysis and models; Decomposition modes; Dynamic mode decompositions; Fuel sprays; Gas turbine combustor; Large-eddy simulations; Lean direct injections; Orthogonal decomposition; Proper Orthogonal; Spray liquids; Principal component analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112261020

Our result highlights the potential to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from agricultural soils by the application of specific organic amendments (especially digestate + compost). Unexpectedly, also the addition of mineral fertilizer in our mesocosms led to similar combined GHG emissions than one of the specific organic amendments. However, the application of organic amendments has the potential to increase soil C, which is not the case when using mineral fertilizer. While GHG emissions from cover crop residues were significantly higher compared to mineral fertilizer and the other organic amendments, crop growth was promoted. Furthermore, all organic amendments induced a shift in the diversity and abundances of key microbial groups. We show that organic amendments have the potential to not only lower GHG emissions by modifying the microbial community abundance and composition, but also favour crop growth-promoting microorganisms. This modulation of the microbial community by organic amendments bears the potential to turn soils into more climate-smart soils in comparison to the more conventional use of mineral fertilizers. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agricultural soils; Flux measurements; Greenhouse gases; Microbial community abundance and compositions; Organic amendment; Plant growth","abundance index; agricultural soil; cover crop; crop plant; microbial community; microorganism; relative abundance; soil microorganism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115666213

We hypothesize that unimodal response of biomass accumulation through increased species richness leads to greater tree above ground carbon (AGC) stocks and thus climate regulation but not necessarily higher timber volume production for human consumption across portions of North American and European forests. We first evaluated the biodiversity-productivity pattern and assessed if the addition of potential confounding variables altered the response. Afterwards, we integrated direct and indirect effects of species richness and confounding factors in the modelling of aboveground carbon stock and timber volume. We confirm an increase in carbon stocks concomitant with an increase in tree species richness up to an optimum biomass value in both regions. Tree species richness had a marginal effect on both aboveground carbon stocks and timber volume with a trade-off in the eastern US. Biomass accumulation is lower in tree plantations than in natural forests, although volume increased with species richness. Naturally-regenerated forests needed as much as double the number of tree species than plantations to reach the same carbon stocks. Distinct ecosystem services (AGC and timber volume) showed unique pathways of achieving their maximum provisioning. As increasing forest resilience to global change requires a fundamental understanding of how tree species combine with changing climatic conditions to drive the provisioning of various ecosystem services, further examination of this study's findings across additional biogeographical regions may lead the way to unraveling such dynamics and empowering adaptive management. © 2021 The Authors","Ecosystem services trade-offs; Forest carbon; Species richness; Timber production; Tree biomass","Biodiversity; Carbon; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Productivity; Reforestation; Timber; Above-ground carbons; Carbon stocks; Ecosystem service trade-offs; Ecosystem services; Forest carbons; Species richness; Timber production; Timber volume; Tree biomass; Tree species; Biomass; biomass allocation; carbon storage; community dynamics; forest canopy; forest dynamics; species richness; timber; trade-off; Spain; United States; Matthiola; carbon; biodiversity; biomass; ecosystem; forest; human; Spain; tree; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans; Spain; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108315400

A tool to identify priority regions for interventions is needed. Methods: Eye care provider (ECP) density, self-reported visual disability, and demographics were calculated using census data and professional registries. The relationship between visual disability and ECP density was explored in fractional regression models. These data were compared with state telemedicine policy favorability. Results: For each additional ECP per 100,000 population, there was 0.0111% less disability in the county (95% confidence interval -0.0150% to -0.00719%) in an adjusted model. Of 3,142 counties, 1,078 (34%) were in the worst population-weighted quartile for ECP density and visual disability. Conclusions: Low ECP density is associated with higher visual disability, suggesting an opportunity for ocular telehealth.

Through an analysis of the impact of the interaction between fossil fuel import dependency and geopolitical conflict upon energy security-driven policy options, we identify the possibility that China's energy policies fit within a general strategy of conflict pre-emption. A “winning without fighting” orientation that generally sidesteps potential conflict while maintaining progress toward the strategic objective of China's continued rise. In addition, we analyze the domestic politicization of local air pollution, which represented a possible threat to the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). By responding to this politicization in a timely and highly effective manner, the CCP has side-stepped domestic conflict and enhanced its domestic legitimacy. As the largest global consumer and importer of fossil fuels and emitter of greenhouse gases, China's energy policy will be a core part of any low-carbon energy transition. However, our analysis finds that climate change is at best a minor independent determinant of China's energy policy. Ultimately, we argue that China's energy policies are intertwined and optimized with many other policy objectives, requiring an inter-disciplinary and holistic approach to fully understand their determinants. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Energy security; Energy transition; Great power politics; United States","Climate change; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; China; Energy transitions; Global consumers; Great power politic; Local air pollutions; Policy options; Potential conflict; Power politics; Strategic objectives; United state; Energy security; energy policy; fossil fuel; geopolitics; party politics; political power; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114424281

Based on panel data of 15 nations from 1980 to 2017, this study empirically investigates the impact of energy consumption, economic growth, urbanization, and energy consumption on carbon emission using panel co-integration tests and pooled mean group ARDL (PMG-ARDL) techniques. We augment the model with urbanization to establish the role urbanization plays in energy consumption, economic growth, and carbon emission nexus. Findings confirm that in the long run and short run, urbanization has no significant effect on the environment quality. On the other hand, energy consumption was found to enhance environmental destruction significantly in the short run and long run. Additional findings confirmed that economic growth causes environmental distortion in the long run for the sampled nations. Government officials and policymakers need to pay special attention to enhance adequate energy, urban planning, and emission reduction without affecting the economic development to achieve urban-economic-energy sustainability, which is key to attaining a green and clean environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emission; Economic growth; Energy consumption; Energy economics; Environmental economics; Panel Co-integration; PMG-ARDL; Urbanization","carbon emission; detection method; economic development; economic growth; environmental economics; estimation method; greenhouse gas; panel data; sustainability; urbanization; carbon; carbon dioxide; economic development; urbanization; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108793156

One of the important technologies to remove CO2 from different gas streams is solvent-based CO2 capture. Modelling and simulation of solvent-based CO2 capture processes have been attracting a lot of attention in recent years. Thermodynamic models play a vital role in these modelling and simulation studies. Hence, this study critically reviews the thermodynamic models applied in the modelling of solvent-based CO2 capture systems over the past years, to provide a guideline for the selection of the optimum models for future studies. These models have wide applications in two main areas: Equilibrium modelling [vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) (physical) and speciation equilibrium (chemical)], and calculation of some thermodynamic properties. VLE and speciation modelling methods are classified rigorously. VLE modelling methods are classified as homogeneous, heterogeneous, and empirical, and speciation modelling methods are classified as iterative (which could be stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric) and non-iterative. Thermodynamic models are categorised into three key families: Activity-coefficient based, equation of state based, and quantum mechanical based. Theory and concepts of different thermodynamic models are presented. Some selected studies that used each family of thermodynamic models are reviewed. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","CO2absoprtion modelling; speciation equilibrium; thermodynamic model; vapour-liquid equilibrium","Carbon dioxide; Chemical speciation; Emission control; Equations of state; Iterative methods; Quantum theory; Solvents; Emission reduction targets; Equilibrium modelling; Modelling and simulations; Non-stoichiometric; Quantum mechanical; Thermodynamic model; Vapour liquid equilibria; Vapour liquid equilibriums; Thermodynamic properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082202602

In this regard, supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, and Li-S batteries have evolved as the most plausible storage systems with excellent commercial adaptations. Intending to get the best performance from these systems, researchers all over the world have been engaging to develop various new methods for the synthesis of advanced carbon materials with a target of economical viability, abundance, low cost, and ease of preparation. Among them, activated carbon has proven to be an attractive electrode material due to its many advantageous properties such as a large surface area, high pore density, good conductivity, low cost, and good mechanical and chemical stability compared to other alternatives, such as high-cost graphene, carbon nanotubes, Mxenes, transition metal complexes, and conducting polymers. Among the numerous synthetic and biological resources that are used for the synthesis of activated carbon, coal/coal-like materials have found tremendous importance in recent times due to their relative abundance, extremely low cost, and excellent large-scale production possibilities. The present review attempts to collect all the significant innovations carried out for the use of cheap and economically viable coal-derived/-based activated carbon and its composites in supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, and Li-S batteries and to critically evaluate their comparative performances. The progress in advanced three-dimensional printing technology for these energy storage applications is also discussed. The highlight of this review is also to assess the challenges that remain for the synthesis of high-performance electroactive-activated carbon materials from coal-based resources as alternative electrode materials, which would become promising candidates in the foreseeable future. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"3D printers; Activated carbon; Additives; Chemical stability; Costs; Electrodes; Energy storage; Global warming; Ions; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Sulfur compounds; Supercapacitor; Transition metals; Adverse effect; Battery applications; Carbon material; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrode material; Energy demands; Exponential growth; Low-costs; Performance; Storage systems; Coal",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119424853

Traditionally, CCS projects targeted mostly high permeability sandstone formations, despite the numerous carbonate fields undergoing CO2 injection for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) in the United States or Canada. Because of the reactivity between calcite minerals and CO2 saturated water, chalk formations, characterized by high porosity and low permeability, have been previously portrayed as infeasible CO2 storage sites. Although previous laboratory investigations were carried out to assess the performance of CO2-EOR in North Sea chalk fields, these studies did not result in any field-scale demonstration projects; this may soon change since a positive movement towards CO2 storage in depleted oil fields has been recently initiated. In this work, we reviewed existing studies on CO2 injection in chalk to address the suitability of this type of formation for CCS. Although the evidence on the thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical behaviour of chalk in the presence of CO2-saturated aqueous solutions is mixed, the majority of flooding tests performed on reservoir core samples do not support further weakening relative to water injection conditions nor significant changes in the petrophysical properties. Along with the weakening effect and using the Danish North Sea chalk fields as a case study, we addressed events that impact the storage site safety such as fault reactivation, and caprock and well integrity. Furthermore, monitoring techniques relevant to offshore locations are also discussed. Based on studies on other types of carbonates, and considering the characteristics of chalk (e.g., permeability, wettability, and reactivity) we analysed the relevance of different trapping mechanisms (i.e., solution, capillary, and mineral) but also several effects (i.e., chemical, biological, mechanical) that can lead to loss of injectivity. The main observations and conclusions in this work can be easily extrapolated to other chalk formations worldwide. © 2021 The Authors","Carbon neutrality; Chalk; CO2 storage; Decarbonisation; Depleted oil fields; Fluid-rock interactions; North Sea; Trapping mechanisms; Weakening","carbon dioxide; carbon storage; chalk; enhanced oil recovery; fluid injection; oil field; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117082585

In this study, we examine the spatial and demographic response of a keystone endemic plant of the Namib Desert (Welwitschia mirabilis), for which displacement and reduction of suitable climate has been foreseen under future conditions. The main aim is to assess the association between ongoing climate change and geographical patterns of welwitschia health, reproductive status, and size. We collected data on welwitschia distribution, health condition, reproductive status, and plant size in northern Namibia. We used ecological niche models to predict the expected geographic shift of suitability under climate change scenarios. For each variable, we compared our field measurements with the expected ongoing change in climate suitability. Finally, we tested the presence of simple geographical gradients in the observed patterns. The historically realized thermal niche of welwitschia will be almost completely unavailable in the next 30 years in northern Namibia. Expected reductions of climatic suitability in our study sites were strongly associated with indicators of negative population conditions, namely lower plant health, reduced recruitment and increased adult mortality. Population condition does not follow simple latitudinal or altitudinal gradients. The observed pattern of population traits is consistent with climate change trends and projections. This makes welwitschia a suitable bioindicator (i.e. a 'sentinel') for climate change effect in the Namib Desert ecosystems. Our spatially explicit approach, combining suitability modeling with geographic combinations of population conditions measured in the field, could be extensively adopted to identify sentinel species, and detect population responses to climate change in other regions and ecosystems. © 2021 Bombi et al.

Under the Paris Agreement, countries have committed to emission reduction targets – so-called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – in order to combat global warming. The study suggests that aligning NDCs with the commonly agreed 2°C temperature target will induce global economic costs of roughly 1% in 2030. However, these costs are unevenly distributed across regions. Countries exporting fossil fuels are most adversely affected from the transition towards a low-carbon economy. In order to reduce adjustment costs at the global and regional level, comprehensive emissions trading which exploits least-cost abatement options is strongly desirable to avoid contentious normative debates on equitable burden sharing. Lump-sum recycling of revenues from emissions pricing, in equal amounts to every household, appeals as an attractive strategy to mitigate regressive effects and thereby improving the social acceptability of stringent climate policy. © 2021 The Author(s)","Emissions pricing and trading; Paris Agreement; Revenue recycling","Commerce; Cost reduction; Economic analysis; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Adjustment costs; Climate policy; Economic costs; Emission pricing and trading; Emission reduction targets; Energy model; Global economics; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Paris agreement; Revenue recycling; Recycling; carbon emission; emissions trading; energy policy; environmental economics; global warming; policy implementation; recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109191176

The UK National Health Service is committed to being a net zero emitter by 2040, and a potential contribution to this target could come from reductions in patient travel. Achieving this will require actions at many levels. We sought to determine potential savings and risks over the short term from telemedicine through virtual clinics. Methods: During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-2-CoV) pandemic, scheduled face-to-face epilepsy clinics at a specialist site were replaced by remote teleclinics. We used a standard methodology applying conversion factors to calculate emissions based on the total saved travel distance. A further conversion factor was used to derive emissions associated with electricity consumption to deliver remote clinics from which net savings could be calculated. Patients’ records and clinicians were interrogated to identify any adverse clinical outcomes. Results: We found that enforced telemedicine delivery for over 1200 patients resulted in the saving of ~224 000 km of travel with likely avoided emissions in the range of 35 000–40 000 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) over a six and half month period. Emissions arising directly from remote delivery were calculated to be &lt;200 kg CO2e (~0.5% of those for travel), representing a significant net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Only one direct adverse outcome was identified, with some additional benefits identified anecdotally. Significance: The use of telemedicine can make a contribution toward reduced emissions in the health care sector and, in the delivery of specialized epilepsy services, had minimal adverse clinical outcomes over the short term. However, these outcomes will likely vary with clinic locations, medical specialties and conditions. © 2021 The Authors.

Here, we demonstrate the mechanistic insight of oxygen reduction on the uniformly dispersed Ru nanoparticles on N-doped carbon support (Ru@NC). The promotion of energy efficient inner-sphere electron transfer mechanism with reduced HO2- generation demonstrates as the crucial descriptor for appreciable activity and remarkable stability. In terms of the mass activity, the developed catalyst outperforms other previously reported state-of-the-art catalysts.

Nature-first approaches that use natural habitats, particularly marshes, are being promoted globally as ecologically-beneficial alternatives to grey infrastructure. The ability of these novel shorelines to provide nursery habitat to blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), an ecologically and economically important species along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, has not been fully evaluated. We quantified the abundance and size distribution of juvenile blue crabs from a chronosequence of living shorelines (created fringing marshes) spanning 2 to 16 years in age since construction compared with paired natural fringing marshes in the southern Chesapeake Bay. Both created and natural fringing marshes are used by blue crabs as primary nursery habitats. Despite interannual differences in abundance, young blue crabs (≤ 2.5 cm carapace width) were observed in similar densities and sizes at living shoreline and natural marshes. The age of the living shoreline was not related to blue crab density, indicating that even the youngest living shorelines (2 years) provided nursery habitat. The potential for living shorelines to serve as nursery habitat for an economically important species may provide additional incentive to implement these nature-based approaches for climate change adaptation. © 2021","Callinectes sapidus; Chesapeake Bay; Fringing marsh; Living shorelines; Nursery habitat; Shorescape","Climate change; Ecosystems; Shellfish; Callinectes sapidu; Chesapeake Bay; Coastal development; Fringing marsh; Habitat use; Living shoreline; Natural habitat; Nursery habitat; Shoreline protection; Shorescape; Wetlands; chronosequence; climate change; coastal development; coastal protection; crab; habitat use; incentive; marsh; shoreline change; size distribution; Chesapeake Bay; United States; United States; Callinectes sapidus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111041201

The livestock environment plays a key role in pigs’ health and wellbeing. A poor farm environment increases the toxic GHGs, which might deteriorate pigs’ health and welfare. In this study a computer-vision-based automatic monitoring and tracking model was proposed to detect pigs’ short-term physical activities in the compromised environment. The ventilators of the livestock barn were closed for an hour, three times in a day (07:00–08:00, 13:00–14:00, and 20:00–21:00) to create a compromised environment, which increases the GHGs level significantly. The corresponding pig activities were observed before, during, and after an hour of the treatment. Two widely used object detection models (YOLOv4 and Faster R-CNN) were trained and compared their performances in terms of pig localization and posture detection. The YOLOv4, which outperformed the Faster R-CNN model, was coupled with a Deep-SORT tracking algorithm to detect and track the pig activities. The results revealed that the pigs became more inactive with the increase in GHG concentration, reducing their standing and walking activities. Moreover, the pigs shortened their sternal-lying posture, increasing the lateral lying posture duration at higher GHG concentration. The high detection accuracy (mAP: 98.67%) and tracking accuracy (MOTA: 93.86% and MOTP: 82.41%) signify the models’ efficacy in the monitoring and tracking of pigs’ physical activities non-invasively. © 2021 by the authors.

It combines the Norwegian Earth System Model version 1 (NorESM1) - which features interactive aerosol-cloud schemes and an isopycnic-coordinate ocean component with biogeochemistry - with anomaly assimilation of sea surface temperature (SST) and T/S-profile observations using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). We describe the Earth system component and the data assimilation (DA) scheme, highlighting implementation of new forcings, bug fixes, retuning and DA innovations. Notably, NorCPM1 uses two anomaly assimilation variants to assess the impact of sea ice initialization and climatological reference period: the first (i1) uses a 1980-2010 reference climatology for computing anomalies and the DA only updates the physical ocean state; the second (i2) uses a 1950-2010 reference climatology and additionally updates the sea ice state via strongly coupled DA of ocean observations. We assess the baseline, reanalysis and prediction performance with output contributed to the Decadal Climate Prediction Project (DCPP) as part of the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The NorESM1 simulations exhibit a moderate historical global surface temperature evolution and tropical climate variability characteristics that compare favourably with observations. The climate biases of NorESM1 using CMIP6 external forcings are comparable to, or slightly larger than those of, the original NorESM1 CMIP5 model, with positive biases in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strength and Arctic sea ice thickness, too-cold subtropical oceans and northern continents, and a too-warm North Atlantic and Southern Ocean. The biases in the assimilation experiments are mostly unchanged, except for a reduced sea ice thickness bias in i2 caused by the assimilation update of sea ice, generally confirming that the anomaly assimilation synchronizes variability without changing the climatology. The i1 and i2 reanalysis/hindcast products overall show comparable performance. The benefits of DA-assisted initialization are seen globally in the first year of the prediction over a range of variables, also in the atmosphere and over land. External forcings are the primary source of multiyear skills, while added benefit from initialization is demonstrated for the subpolar North Atlantic (SPNA) and its extension to the Arctic, and also for temperature over land if the forced signal is removed. Both products show limited success in constraining and predicting unforced surface ocean biogeochemistry variability. However, observational uncertainties and short temporal coverage make biogeochemistry evaluation uncertain, and potential predictability is found to be high. For physical climate prediction, i2 performs marginally better than i1 for a range of variables, especially in the SPNA and in the vicinity of sea ice, with notably improved sea level variability of the Southern Ocean. Despite similar skills, i1 and i2 feature very different drift behaviours, mainly due to their use of different climatologies in DA; i2 exhibits an anomalously strong AMOC that leads to forecast drift with unrealistic warming in the SPNA, whereas i1 exhibits a weaker AMOC that leads to unrealistic cooling. In polar regions, the reduction in climatological ice thickness in i2 causes additional forecast drift as the ice grows back. Posteriori lead-dependent drift correction removes most hindcast differences; applications should therefore benefit from combining the two products. The results confirm that the large-scale ocean circulation exerts strong control on North Atlantic temperature variability, implying predictive potential from better synchronization of circulation variability. Future development will therefore focus on improving the representation of mean state and variability of AMOC and its initialization, in addition to upgrades of the atmospheric component. Other efforts will be directed to refining the anomaly assimilation scheme - to better separate internal and forced signals, to include land and atmosphere initialization and new observational types - and improving biogeochemistry prediction capability. Combined with other systems, NorCPM1 may already contribute to skilful multiyear climate prediction that benefits society. © Copyright:",,"climate modeling; climate prediction; CMIP; data assimilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120363049

N2O is a long-lived greenhouse gas and an ozone-depleting substance, while NH3 is a precursor of secondary aerosols in the atmosphere. Certain regions, e.g., the EU and the USA, have introduced limits to the emissions of NH3 or N2O for vehicles tested in the laboratory. However, due to the lack of on-board systems that allow for the measurement of these compounds when the regulations were developed, these vehicles’ real-world emissions have not been regulated. This work evaluates on-board systems that could allow measuring real-world emissions of NH3 and N2O from heavy-duty vehicles. In particular, emissions of NH3 or N2O from a Euro VI Step D urban/interurban bus fueled with Compressed Natural Gas were measured using the HORIBA’s OBS-ONE-XL, which is based on a specifically developed technique called Infrared Laser Absorption Modulation, and uses a Quantum Cascade Laser as a light source. They were also measured using the PEMS-LAB, which is a more conventional FTIR-based system. Emissions were measured under real-world driving conditions on the road and in a climatic test cell at different ambient temperatures. For most of the conditions tested, the on-board systems correlated well with a laboratory-grade FTIR used as reference. In addition, a good correlation with R2 &gt; 0.9 was found for the N2O concentrations measured by OBS-ONE-XL and PEMS-LAB during on-road testing. © 2021 by the authors.","Ammonia; Nitrous oxide; Portable emissions measurements; Transport emissions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119019683

The study uses primary household data selected randomly from three districts in Ethiopia’s Oromia region. The data was collected using a mix of contingent and choice experiment methods of valuation. The former used a double-bounded value elicitation method, while the latter used a fractional factorial design to efficiently generate an attribute and level combination for the improved cook stoves. The study also used various discrete choice models for data analysis and also used models which account for scale and preference heterogeneity. The findings show that the sample households were aware of the effects of using traditional cook stoves and the benefits of using improved cook stoves. However, they were constrained by the availability of the new technology and discouraged by the low-quality of the products that they had used so far. The estimated mean willingness to pay ranged from about 150 Birr to 350 Birr which is lower than the market price of the improved cook stoves. Emission reduction, reducing fire risks, and the durability of the cook stove positively affected its adoption, while price discouraged its use. Higher levels of education, higher incomes, non-farm employment, and having more livestock increased the probability of adopting the new gas stoves. The study recommends that policymakers and product designers should use the mean willingness to pay and marginal rate of substitution for the different attributes as a benchmark for product design and pricing that fit households’ preferences and ability to pay. The lower mean willingness to pay means that a public subsidizing policy is needed for effectively disseminating improved cook stoves in rural Ethiopia. © 2021, The Author(s).","Choice experiment; Contingent valuation; Cook stove; Energy-efficient technology; Ethiopia","cooking appliance; discrete choice analysis; household survey; policy making; preference behavior; pricing policy; rural area; willingness to pay; Ethiopia; Oromia; domestic chemical; cooking; Ethiopia; family size; household; human; Cooking; Ethiopia; Family Characteristics; Household Articles; Household Products; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107735154

Index-based agricultural insurance (IBAI) is a particularly key example. Recent critical work has pointed to the deeply neoliberal character of IBAI and like interventions. However, the promotion of new financial instruments in response to crises of agrarian production has a much longer history in Africa and elsewhere. This article draws on Marx's concept of ‘latent’ surplus populations to trace out and explain parallels between IBAI and colonial interventions in Senegal's groundnut basin. Approaching the question in this way, the article highlights the long-run historical co-production and interdependence of the Senegalese state and a political ecology of groundnut production in which relations of indebtedness and the exposure to variable rainfall of a fragile relative surplus population has often been crucial to the mobilization of cheap labour for groundnut production.

Using the system Generalized Moments Method (GMM), this study reveals that the pollution haven hypothesis (PHV) is considered only for developing countries, while the pollution halo hypothesis (PHL) is considered for developed countries. The empirical results do not valid the hypothesis of Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) in developing countries, but do valid it in developed countries. It can be said that an increase in trade and foreign direct investment increases the developed countries’ polluting projects which are destined for the developing countries, thus pushing the developed countries to achieve emission reductions at the expense of the developing countries. It is recommended to continue to attract such entries while putting in place mechanisms and instruments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions within the framework of rigorous environmental policies. © 2021","CO2 emissions; Economic growth; EKC; Trade openness","Air quality; Commerce; Developing countries; Emission control; Environmental protection; Global warming; CO$-2$/ emission; Comparative analysis; Developed countries; Direct and indirect impacts; Economic growths; Environmental Kuznet's curve; Environmental measures; Generalized moment method; Halo effect; Trade openness; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112633699

The power plant is located in the province of Adrar in the south of Algeria and classified as one of the hot regions worldwide. Performance parameters were reference yield, performance ratio, capacity factor, temperature loss and statistical indicators. The results showed that photovoltaic power plant performance depends on cell technology, insolation, and environmental conditions, especially temperature. The deviations between the simulation results and real monitoring data were found to be smaller in the case of HOMER Pro simulation tool. The total annual energy supplied in 2018 by the power plant was 36364MWh, whereas RETScreen Expert predicted 42339 MWh, or about 14% more and HOMER Pro predicted 34508 MWh or about 5.1% less. The influence of temperature on the power plant output was strong, causing a 40% drop during the summer, due to the limitations of the polycrystalline cell technology. This needs to be considered in the design of future photovoltaic power plants to be operated in hot climates. HOMER Pro and RETScreen Expert predicted an average annual final yield of 5.128 h/day, a module efficiency of 15% and an inverter efficiency of 98%. The t statistics were 3.75 for HOMER Pro and 6.12 for RETScreen Expert.

Our results revealed higher CH4 emissions from water-atmosphere interface in clear water floodplain, followed by black and white water floodplain, respectively. Active methanogenic and methanotrophic taxa were ubiquitous at 0–15 and 15–30 cm soil layer in FOR and TFS, with differences among the water types with respect to the richness, evenness and diversity of the methanogenic communities. These ecological results were not generalizable regarding to FOR and TFS sites, soil layers, and non-flooded and flooded periods. Despite the predominant oxidation of CH4 in the non-flooded period, higher richness and diversity of methanotrophs were revealed for FOR and TFS in the flooded period. In turn, the structure of the methanogenic and methanotrophic communities and their variation were influenced mainly by soil physicochemical factors, water type, soil depth and the presence of nitrifiers, as Nitrososphaera and Nitrospira. Our study reveals a signature across methanotrophic communities in soils from Amazon floodplain with different water types, with a putative disproportionate role of NC10 phylum in CH4 mitigation in natural and agricultural Amazonian floodplains.

However, research on landfill leachate treatment under consistent, representative conditions with biochar derived from the wide range of OFMSW components is needed. Further, the competitive nature of leachate dissolved organic matter (DOM) for biochar adsorption sites has not been examined. To this end, biochars were produced from seven diverse OFMSW types and batch tested using two representative organic contaminants. To evaluate leachate DOM impact on OMP removal and fouling mitigation with biochar enhancement methods, experiments were performed with three background matrices (deionized water, synthetic leachate, real leachate) and two enhancement methods (ash-pretreatment, double-heating). Since evaluating all possible OFMSW feedstock combinations is infeasible, fundamental relationships between individual feedstocks and biochar properties were evaluated. Overall, biochar performance varied substantially; the dose to achieve a given target removal spanned an order of magnitude between the OFMSW feedstocks. Also, the presence of leachate DOM more negatively impacted the performance of all biochars relative to the benchmark adsorbent activated carbon. Finally, the enhancement methods altered biochar pore structure by increasing micropore and slightly decreasing non-micropore surface areas, resulting in improved adsorption capacity (by 23 to 93%). By providing the basis for a low-cost, enhanced leachate treatment method, this study could incentivize a novel organics diversion approach that reduces climate change impacts, harvests energy from waste, and reduces landfill air emissions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Activated carbon; Benchmarking; Climate change; Feedstocks; Leachate treatment; Microporosity; Municipal solid waste; Pore size; Pore structure; Waste treatment; Biochar; Dissolved organic matters; Landfill leachate treatment; Leachates; Micropores; Organic fraction of municipal solid wastes; Organic micropollutants; Organic municipal solid wastes; Organics diversion; Performance; Deionized water; activated carbon; adsorption; biochar; landfill; leachate; municipal solid waste; waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118847288

However, little research has focused on productivity in regenerating tropical forests which are expanding in their fraction of global area have an order of magnitude larger carbon uptake rates relative to older forest. We examined above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and its components (wood production and litterfall) over 10 years in forest plots that vary in successional age, soil characteristics and species composition using band dendrometers and litterfall traps in regenerating seasonally dry tropical forests in northwestern Costa Rica. We show that the components of ANPP are differentially driven by age and annual rainfall and that local soil variation is important. Total ANPP was explained by a combination of age, annual rainfall and soil variation. Wood production comprised 35% of ANPP on average across sites and years, and was explained by annual rainfall but not forest age. Conversely, litterfall increased with forest age and soil fertility yet was not affected by annual rainfall. In this region, edaphic variability is highly correlated with plant community composition. Thus, variation in ecosystem processes explained by soil may also be partially explained by species composition. These results suggest that future changes in annual rainfall can alter the secondary forest carbon sink, but this effect will be buffered by the litterfall flux which varies little among years. In determining the long-term strength of the secondary forest carbon sink, both rainfall and forest age will be critical variables to track. We also conclude that detailed understanding of local site variation in soils and plant community may be required to accurately predict the impact of changing rainfall on forest carbon uptake. Synthesis. We show that in seasonally dry tropical forest, annual rainfall has a positive relationship with the growth of above-ground woody tissues of trees and that droughts lead to significant reductions in above-ground productivity. These results provide evidence for climate change—carbon cycle feedbacks in the seasonal tropics and highlight the value of longitudinal data on forest regeneration. © 2021 British Ecological Society","Above-ground net primary productivity; biomass carbon; Costa Rica; forest regeneration; forest soils; litterfall; seasonally dry tropical forest; succession","climate; ecosystem; fertility; finance; forest; impact; Costa Rica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116008222

A fundamental step toward this green transition is represented by the improvement of current internal combustion (IC) engines in terms of fuel economy and pollutant emissions. The spark ignition (SI) engines of modern light-duty vehicles are supercharged, down-sized, and equipped with direct injection. Gaseous fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or natural gas (NG), proved to be a valid alternative to gasoline in order to reduce pollutant emissions and increase fuel economy. In previous works the authors investigated the simultaneous combustion, in an SI engine, of gasoline and a gaseous fuel (referred to as Double-Fuel operation, DF) both in the naturally aspirated and supercharged version; a significant increment of engine efficiency and a great reduction of pollutant emissions were obtained with respect to pure gasoline operation, with almost unchanged performance. This article is a development of the previous work and shows the results of a detailed heat release analysis, performed on the DF supercharged engine fueled with mixtures of gasoline and NG in order to highlight the effects of engine speed, charging pressure, and fuel mixture composition (the proportion between gasoline and NG) on the combustion speed. It was found that both gasoline content in the DF mixture and supercharging pressure contribute to increase the combustion speed, which, in some cases, produced engine-indicated efficiency increments up to 5%. The wide set of experimental data presented in this article allows us to better understand the combustion behavior of gasoline-NG fuel mixtures and can be also used to calibrate combustion submodels integrated into engine numerical simulations. © 2021 SAE International Journal of Electrified Vehicles.","Combustion; Fuel mixtures; Natural gas; Spark ignition engine","Direct injection; Efficiency; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Ignition; Liquefied petroleum gas; Mixtures; Natural gas; Pollution; Combustion analysis; Combustion speed; Fuel mixtures; Gaseous Fuel; Large-scales; Low emission vehicles; Pollutants emissions; Spark-ignition engine; Urban areas; Zero emission vehicles; Gasoline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120610149

A major question is therefore how these communities maintain their biodiversity and biomass in these resource-limiting ecosystems. Here, we investigated desert topsoils and biological soil crusts collected along an aridity gradient traversing four climatic regions (sub-humid, semi-arid, arid, and hyper-arid). Metagenomic analysis indicated these communities vary in their capacity to use sunlight, organic compounds, and inorganic compounds as energy sources. Thermoleophilia, Actinobacteria, and Acidimicrobiia were the most abundant and prevalent bacterial classes across the aridity gradient in both topsoils and biocrusts. Contrary to the classical view that these taxa are obligate organoheterotrophs, genome-resolved analysis suggested they are metabolically flexible, with the capacity to also use atmospheric H2 to support aerobic respiration and often carbon fixation. In contrast, Cyanobacteria were patchily distributed and only abundant in certain biocrusts. Activity measurements profiled how aerobic H2 oxidation, chemosynthetic CO2 fixation, and photosynthesis varied with aridity. Cell-specific rates of atmospheric H2 consumption increased 143-fold along the aridity gradient, correlating with increased abundance of high-affinity hydrogenases. Photosynthetic and chemosynthetic primary production co-occurred throughout the gradient, with photosynthesis dominant in biocrusts and chemosynthesis dominant in arid and hyper-arid soils. Altogether, these findings suggest that the major bacterial lineages inhabiting hot deserts use different strategies for energy and carbon acquisition depending on resource availability. Moreover, they highlight the previously overlooked roles of Actinobacteriota as abundant primary producers and trace gases as critical energy sources supporting productivity and resilience of desert ecosystems. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"aridity; bacterium; biodiversity; chemosynthesis; desert; organic carbon; photosynthesis; primary production; soil microorganism; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cyanobacteria; Photobacteria; cyanobacterium; desert climate; ecosystem; microbiology; soil; Cyanobacteria; Desert Climate; Ecosystem; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106478197

The information serves as a baseline for the evaluation of the potential of climate-change mitigation measures. SOC sequestration plays an important role in the discussion of terrestrial carbon (C) sinks and the size of the SOC pool is one of several quality measures for crop production and the national and regional food security. The baseline serves also for the evaluation of the effectiveness of adaptive land management in order to cope with climate change. Austrian croplands, grasslands, forests, and settlements contain 300 Mt SOC. Peatlands have the highest SOC density (220 t C/ha), yet cover only about 2% of the country. Forest soils store 106 t C/ha and comprise the largest pool due to the coverage of more than 4 Mha (48% of the country). Intensively and extensively managed grasslands cover 0.8 Mha (10%) and contain between 91 and 113 t C/ha, and cropland on 1.28 Mha (15%) hold on average 62 t C/ha. Due to the geographic heterogeneity of Austria with respect to climatic conditions, geology and soils, and topography the regional differences in SOC stocks are large. Measures to increase the SOC stock in cropland have been applied for 25 years within agri-environmental and climate-smart strategies. An increase of the total SOC pool is expected due to the afforestation and reforestation of marginal agricultural land and to a smaller extent due to the restoration of peatlands. A decline of the SOC stock is a consequence of land development for settlements and infrastructure. © 2021 The Authors","Baseline of soil carbon; Climate change; National soil carbon storage; Soil carbon; Sustainable Development Goals","Cultivation; Food supply; Lakes; Land use; Organic carbon; Reforestation; Soils; Sustainable development; Topography; Wetlands; Austria; Baseline of soil carbon; National soil carbon storage; Organic soil; Peatland; Soil carbon; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic carbon pools; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Sustainable development goal; Climate change; agricultural land; carbon sequestration; climate change; crop production; food security; grassland; heterogeneity; land management; organic carbon; organic salt; organic soil; reforestation; soil carbon; trend analysis; Austria; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111022738

Mangrove forests are known to provide great benefits to the community as an ecosystem service and globally. Mangrove forests are threatened with loss due to anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic activities. Our previous research results show the important role of mangroves in the context of climate change for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the diversity of terpenoids for salinity defense. The term metabarcoding of environmental DNA as a key indicator for evaluating mangrove ecosystems was introduced. This work proposed framework to study environmental DNA metabarcoding applications that can provide accurate information for evaluating mangrove ecosystems using an easy and fast method. The rich mangrove forest is getting disappeared without being recognized by its true diversity, function, and potential services to human beings. Application of conservation activities based on the species diversity in the mangrove ecosystem is almost impossible, because it is too difficult to study, in term of time and effort, despite the importance of acquiring the biodiversity information. However, DNA metabarcoding can be a ""dream-like""tool and will contribute to obtain the species diversity data of the mangrove ecosystem, rapidly, globally, and massively. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120877381

This paper provides a methodological framework for the assessment of an integrated land management plan with its action plans. Based on the scientific understanding, contemporary literature and the legal documents, a set of planning principles was developed and the strengths and weaknesses of the plan highlighted. Besides some shortcomings, the assessment indicated that the plan is a good initiative for a Sustainable Land Management (SLM) paradigm. The plan was based on a forest management plan from which the other action plans such as apiculture plan, grazing plan, biodiversity plan, non-wood products (NWFP) plan and income generating plan orbit around. A new inventory procedure was developed to determine growing stock in degraded forests. The climate change effects on four land use categories were projected with a limited set of measurements. Carbon storage was calculated for all land uses by considering various carbon pools. A typical governance option was proposed where each state organization prepare and implement their own activities according to the rights and responsibilities defined in the legal documents. While spatial database with thematic maps and attributes was built with GIS and remote sensing, the essential thematic maps such as land capability classes, non-systematic and traditional knowledge were absent. The lack of holistic planning vision, scenario analysis with sound decision making tools and methods, and insufficient participation, implementation and monitoring process were identified as major drawbacks. These shortcomings have created a significant design and governance concern and jeopardized by far the sustainable implementation of SLM activities. Consequently, a sound planning framework with its necessary components was developed as a basis for a comprehensive SLM and the appropriate revisions were proposed to improve each component of the plan. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Integrated forest management; Konya; Land degradation; Planning and assessment; Sustainable land management","Biodiversity; Climate change; Decision making; Land use; Laws and legislation; Maps; Remote sensing; Action plan; Assessment and improvement; Assessment strategies; Integrated forest management; Konyum; Land degradation; Legal documents; Planning and assessment; Sustainable land managements; Thematic maps; Forestry; action plan; environmental assessment; forest management; land degradation; land management; strategic approach; sustainability; Konya [Turkey]; Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo; biodiversity; climate change; environmental protection; forest; turkey (bird); Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111073316

Four nurseries (three buildings) located in different parts of Poznań, Poland were selected as research sites. During the research period, the concentrations of CO2, PM2.5, and PM10 inside and outside the buildings over time were analyzed. Measurements outside the buildings were supplemented with an analysis of traffic near nurseries and an assessment of pollutant emissions from vehicles of various categories. Measurements were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly series during winter (December)—(W), spring (April)—(S), and at the end of spring (June)—(LS). Testing and analyses indicated poor indoor air quality in three out of four nurseries. To ensure indoor air quality at the proper level, it is necessary to supply rooms with outside air. Ventilating rooms by airing, when the outside air is polluted, reduces the CO2 concentration but worsens the indoor air quality in terms of particulate matter (PM). Seasonality in the concentration of particulate matter in outdoor air and its connection with the outside air temperature was noticed. No relationship between traffic and the values of PM10 and CO2 concentrations inside nurseries was observed. © 2021 by the authors.

This work studies its impact on distributed energy systems design which are powered by both renewable and fossil fuels. In particular, the analyses investigate a real case study situated in Singapore, characterized by cooling and electricity demands. The goal of the analyses is to determine whether carbon pricing does impact design choices in meeting the energy demands of a user located in a cooling dominated region, and secondly in assessing the effectiveness of carbon pricing as a CO2 emissions mitigation policy. This is achieved by investigating the optimal design of the energy systems meeting the demands of the test case under different carbon pricing and primary energy supply costs assumptions. The results indicate that the optimal design under current conditions heavily relies on PV with more than 10 MWp worth of capacity and that an increasing carbon pricing would lead to a lower environmental footprint. But if the supply costs for natural gas were to lower, the optimal design would switch to relying on a combined cooling heat and power-based electricity generation system up to 3 MWe, increasing the primary energy consumptions regardless of the carbon pricing scheme in place. This would also happen even at significantly higher prices than the scheme under evaluation. © 2021","Carbon tax; Distributed energy systems; Energy hub design; Energy storage; Optimal planning","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cooling; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Optimal systems; Carbon pricing; Carbon taxes; CO$-2$/ emission; Distributed energy systems; Energy; Energy hub design; Optimal design; Optimal planning; Supply costs; System planning; Costs; carbon emission; demand analysis; electricity; electricity generation; environmental planning; mitigation; pollution policy; pricing policy; Singapore [Southeast Asia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111098256

These forests, however, are threatened by changes in climate, as plants are exposed not only to global climate change but also to urban climate, having an impact on physiological functions. Here, we selected two physiological variables (stomatal conductance and leaf water potential) and four environmental variables (air temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and water availability) to compare and evaluate the ecophysiological vulnerability to climate change of 15 dominant tree species from Mexico City’s urban forest. The stomatal conductance response was evaluated using the boundary-line analysis, which allowed us to compare the stomatal response to changes in the environment among species. Our results showed differential species responses to the environmental variables and identified Buddleja cordata and Populus deltoides as the least and most vulnerable species, respectively. Air temperatures above 33°C and vapor pressure deficit above 3.5 kPa limited the stomatal function of all species. Stomatal conductance was more sensitive to changes in leaf water potential, followed by vapor pressure deficit, indicating that water is a key factor for tree species performance in Mexico City’s urban forest. Our findings can help to optimize species selection considering future climate change by identifying vulnerable and resilient species. © Copyright © 2021 Barradas and Esperon-Rodriguez.","boundary-line analysis; environmental vulnerability; leaf water potential; stomatal conductance; urban tree",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119406652

The computational models use fuel consumption and emissions maps acquired experimentally in stationary conditions from a multi-cylinder engine in previous work. The hydraulic hybrid powertrain uses the power generated by a pump driven by the ICE or stored in a hydro-pneumatic accumulator to accelerate the vehicle through a hydraulic motor connected to the differential box. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization tool was used to size the hydraulic components and to calculate the values of the control variables for activating the motor-pump system, in order to achieve the compromise solution of minimum fuel consumption and emissions. The series hydraulic hybrid architecture implemented showed the possibility of reducing fuel consumption mainly in urban routes. The hybrid model optimized for reducing engine-out emissions pointed out the potential of reducing up to 47.2% and 20.7% the CO2 and NOx emissions levels in the real-world driving cycles, respectively. Furthermore, the optimized solution of lower engine-out emissions also showed potential between 30.17% and 44.14% of fuel-saving in urban routes with frequent stop-and-go events. © 2021","Engine emissions; Ethanol powered vehicle; Fuel economy; Hydraulic hybrid vehicles; Multi-objective optimization","Ethanol; Fuels; Hybrid vehicles; Hydraulic actuators; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic motors; Multiobjective optimization; Combustion engines; Engine emission; Engine-out emissions; Ethanol powered vehicle; Fuel savings; Hydraulic hybrid vehicles; Hydraulic hybrids; Internal combustion; Multi-objectives optimization; Real-world driving cycles; Fuel economy; combustion; emission; engine; ethanol; fuel consumption; optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111344357

The data were subjected to homogeneity testing before performing the trend tests. Inhomogeneity was widely detected in discharge data, hence no further analyses were performed on such data. Temperature and rainfall trends and their magnitudes at yearly, seasonal, and monthly time steps were identified after applying the non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Sen’s slope estimator. The possible starting point of a trend was determined by performing the sequential Mann-Kendall test. This study revealed a combination of upward and downward trends in both temperature and rainfall data for the time steps under observation. For rainfall on an annual basis, there were no statistically significant monotonic trends detected, although non-significant downward trends were dominant. However, significant decreasing rainfall trends were observed in dry and low rainfall months, which were April, August, September, and November. In contrast, significant upward temperature trends were detected at the Vereeniging climate station at an annual scale and in October, November, spring, and winter. The findings are critical for climate risk management and reduction decisions for both near-and long-term timescales. © 2021 The Authors.","Climate change and variability; Homogeneity tests; Mann-Kendall test; Rietspruit sub-basin; South Africa","Rain; Risk management; Stream flow; Homogeneity test; Mann-Kendall test; Rainfall data; Rainfall trends; Rietspruit sub-basin; South Africa; Subbasins; Temperature data; Temperature trends; Time step; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121043819

However, knowledge of expected changes in the winter-season wet day climatology under global warming is significantly limited. Hence, this study attempts to quantify the expected changes in winter-season wet day climatological patterns for HR during 2020–2099 in comparison to a baseline period of 1980–2000 under two different warming scenarios, these being representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5 (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Five climate model products covering the southern Asian region were obtained from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization initiated Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) of the World Climate Research Programme and used for this purpose. Model biases are estimated with respect to observations for a base line period of 1980–2000. Model ensemble non-linear trends of the winter-season wet days for the periods 2020–2040, 2041–2070, and 2071–2099 are estimated using Sen’s slope estimator, while ensemble average future changes in the number of winter-season wet days are estimated, and attempts made to identify the topographical ranges that are expected to be mostly affected by the changing winter-season wet day climatology. The results show that the CORDEX-regional climate models have a positive bias, ranging between 1 and 30 days, across the high altitudes of the entire Himalayas, and model performance improves with an increasing number of wet days per season. Although the impact of stronger warming (i.e. under RCP 8.5) is noted to enhance the area averaged non-linear trend of wet days over northwestern (0.014) and eastern (0.005) Himalaya during 2071–2099, the model ensemble predicted area-averaged reduction in the frequency of wet days of 0.3 to 1.0 day is highly likely by the end of this century. It is also observed that the Himalayan region within the range of 1000–2500 m above sea level may experience a decline in winter-season wet days by up to 0.8 to 3.2 days under the warming scenarios of both RCP 4.5 and 8.5. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","CORDEX; Himalayan region; Winter-season wet days","climate modeling; climatology; global warming; regional climate; sea level change; topography; winter; Himalayas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114426909

Uncertainties in climate change projection were studied using various statistical methods, such as trend variability analysis via stationarity test and validation of regression assumptions prior to fitting of regression estimates. Also, multiple regression models were estimated for each hydro-meteorological variables for the given 30 years of observed data. Results demonstrated that temperature and, precipitation were inversely related with one another. It was observed from the regression model that temperature is decreases by 0.309 °C on the average increases in precipitation by one unit. Temperature also decreases for the increase in humidity by average 0.086 °C. Since, precipitation is negatively related with temperature, thus for increases in temperature the annual precipitation decreases by 0.278 mm annually. Humidity on the other hand, increases by 0.207% by increasing in precipitation and the temperature that causes humidity to decrease by 0.99%. Thus, it demonstrated that the flow in Chitral river increases due to precipitation by 0.306 m3/s for the change in precipitation by one unit. Findings from the present study negated the general perceptions that flow in the Chitral river has increased due to recession of glaciers with increase in the intensity of temperature. © 2021","Chitral Basin; Climate change; Climate prediction; Hindukush region; Hydro-meteorology; Statistical modeling","Regression analysis; Rivers; Weather forecasting; Case-studies; Chitral basin; Climate change prediction; Climate prediction; Hindukush region; Hydro-meteorology; Meteorological variables; Observed data; Pakistan; Statistic modeling; Climate change; air temperature; climate change; climate prediction; humidity; hydrometeorology; numerical model; regression analysis; statistical analysis; article; climate change; glacier; humidity; meteorology; multiple regression; Pakistan; perception; precipitation; prediction; river; uncertainty; meteorology; regression analysis; river; temperature; Hindu Kush; Kunar River; Pakistan; Climate Change; Meteorology; Regression Analysis; Rivers; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108449796

This paper analyzes the impacts of cordon pricing on the population’s daily activity pattern and their exposure to particulate matter by integrating activity-based models with air quality and exposure models in the case of New York City. To estimate changes in public exposure under cordon pricing scenarios, we take a sample of employees and study their mobility behavior during the day, which is mainly attributed to the location of the work and the time spent at work. The selection of employees and their exposure during the duration of their work is due to the unavailability of exact activity patterns for each individual. We show that the Central Business District (CBD) experiences a high concentration of PM2.5 emissions. Results indicate that implementing cordon pricing scenarios can reduce the population-weighted mean of exposure to PM2.5 emissions by 7% to 13% for our sample and, in particular, by 22% to 28% for those who work in the CBD. Furthermore, using an experimental model and assuming constant conditions, we point out the positive influence on indoor exposure for two locations inside and outside the CBD in response to cordon pricing. Considering the correlation between long-term exposure to fine particulate matter and the risks of developing cardiovascular disease and lung cancer, our findings suggest that improved public health conditions could be provided by implementing cordon pricing in the New York City CBD. © 2021 by the authors.

Major triggers of N2O production were investigated based on a seasonal measured database using a random forest (RF) model and sensitivity analysis, which was applied to identify important input variables. As the result of seasonal monitoring in the full-scale SBR, the N2O emission factor relative to daily total nitrogen removal ranged from 0.05 to 2.68%, corresponding to a range of N2O production rate from 0.02 to 0.70 kg-N/day. Results from the RF model and sensitivity analysis revealed that emissions during nitrification were directly or indirectly related to nitrite accumulation, temperature, ammonia loading rate and the specific oxygen uptake rate ratio between ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (sOUR-ratio). However, changes in the microbial community did not significantly impact N2O emissions. Based on these results, the sOUR-ratio could represent the major trigger for N2O emission in a full-scale BNR system: a higher sOUR-ratio value with an average of 3.13 ± 0.23 was linked to a higher N2O production rate with an average value of 1.27 ± 0.12 kg-N/day (corresponding to 3.96 ± 1.20% of N2O emission factor relative to daily TN removal), while a lower sOUR-ratio with an average value of 2.39 ± 0.27 was correlated with a lower N2O production average rate of 0.17 ± 0.11 kg-N/day (corresponding to 0.74 ± 0.69% of N2O emission factor) (p-value = 0.00001, Mann-Whitney test). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Full-scale biological nitrogen removal process; Influential factor; Nitrous oxide; Seasonal measurement; Sequential batch reactor; sOUR-ratio","Ammonia; Bacteria; Decision trees; Dissolution; Dissolved oxygen; Nitration; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Organic carbon; Sensitivity analysis; Wastewater treatment; Emission factors; Full-scale biological nitrogen removal process; Influential factors; N$-2$/O; Nitrous oxide; Random forest modeling; Seasonal measurement; Sequential batch reactors; SOUR-ratio; Specific oxygen uptake rate; Batch reactors; nitrous oxide; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; cyclicity; nitrification; nitrous oxide; seasonal variation; trigger mechanism; wastewater treatment; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; Article; bacterium; microbial community; municipal wastewater; nitrite oxidizing bacteria; nitrous oxide emission; random forest; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; waste water treatment plant; bioreactor; denitrification; nitrification; season; sewage; wastewater; Nitrosomonadales; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Seasons; Sewage; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110677437

Weather extremes and resulting impacts such as heat waves and flash floods are already influencing the quality of life in cities and impact on infrastructure, human health and city life. In this study, we investigated perception of and economic preferences for adaptation to climate change in one of Europe's capital cities to inform its planning policy. Through a choice experiment, we elicit the preferences of a sample (n = 550) from Prague, Czech Republic, for a citywide policy which would increase the use of six commonly used nature-based solutions (NBS) in public spaces and on public buildings across the city. Three attributes were used to describe this policy: (i) the locations where NBS would predominantly be implemented, (ii) the species diversity of these measures, and (iii) their implied costs for households. Our results showed that the NBS policy is widely supported by the public over the status quo and that this preference is mirrored in citizens’ concerns about climate change and the risks posed by heatwaves particularly. Species diversity matters in the portrayed scenarios, suggesting that (bio)diverse NBS generate additional public value over single species measures and that policy which targets biodiversity may gain support. Implementation of NBS in public spaces (e.g., street trees, rain gardens) is preferred over measures implemented on public buildings (green roofs and facades). Furthermore, adverse experiences with heatwaves has increased support for the policy. The presented results provide evidence that adaptation planning through NBS is likely to generate significant public value which is expected to increase with the intensifying effects of climate change. © 2021","Choice experiment; Climate adaptation; Nature-based solutions; Non-market valuation; Stated preference; Urban green space","adaptive management; biodiversity; climate change; environmental policy; flash flood; heat wave; perception; policy implementation; quality of life; species diversity; urban climate; urban planning; Czech Republic; Prague [Czech Republic]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114189747

Much of the action that will enable this energy transition to be realised in a democratic way is at the local level. It is at this level that many of the decisions regarding the energy transition desired by European citizens will have to be taken. The methodology used in this study is based on data collection, literature review, data validation and analysis. A part of this analysis will also be taken by the mPower project as a diagnostic baseline. The first finding of this research work is that energy transition data availability at the local level is quite low. Second, the local authorities are experiencing difficulties in decarbonising their energy consumption. Finally, the factor with highest positive relationships with other energy transition variables is the number of people employed in the field of energy transition.

Ocean warming influences vertical mixing and stratification patterns, which alter nutrient cycle, plankton production, and aquatic food web. Plankton serves as the first food source for all larval organisms and the base of aquatic ecosystem. Zooplankton community is a crucial component of the aquatic food web. They are critical components in an ecosystem of aquatic and worldwide biogeochemical cycles. Zooplankton contributes as food source to economically valuable fishes, primary-production grazers, and carbon and nutrient cycle drivers. Climate change contributes to dire consequences by altering the baseline of aquatic food web structure. However, the ocean biota itself can influence climate change, and the implications of this are evident from the increase and decrease of wild fisheries production.

This paper focuses on the differences in statistical behaviours of the surface density function (SDF = magnitude of the reaction progress variable gradient) between conventional premixed flames and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) type homogeneous-mixture combustion under MILD conditions using direct numerical simulations (DNS) data. The mean values of the SDF in the MILD combustion cases were found to be significantly smaller than those in the corresponding premixed flame cases. Moreover, the mean behaviour of the SDF in response to the variations of turbulence intensity were compared between MILD and premixed flame cases, and the differences are explained in terms of the strain rates induced by fluid motion and the ones arising from flame displacement speed. It was found that the effects of dilatation rate were much weaker in the MILD combustion cases than in the premixed flame cases, and the reactive scalar gradient in MILD combustion cases preferentially aligns with the most compressive principal strain-rate eigendirection. By contrast, the reactive scalar gradient preferentially aligned with the most extensive principal strain-rate eigendirection within the flame in the premixed flame cases considered here, but the extent of this alignment weakened with increasing turbulence intensity. This gave rise to a predominantly positive mean value of normal strain rate in the premixed flames, whereas the mean normal strain rate remained negative, and its magnitude increased with increasing turbulence intensity in the MILD combustion cases. The mean value of the reaction component of displacement speed assumed non-negligible values in the MILD combustion cases for a broader range of reaction progress variable, compared with the conventional premixed flames. Moreover, the mean displacement speed increased from the unburned gas side to the burned gas side in the conventional premixed flames, whereas the mean displacement speed in MILD combustion cases decreased from the unburned gas side to the middle of the flame before increasing mildly towards the burned gas side. These differences in the mean displacement speed gave rise to significant differences in the mean behaviour of the normal strain rate induced by the flame propagation and effective strain rate, which explains the differences in the SDF evolution and its response to the variation of turbulence intensity between the conventional premixed flames and MILD combustion cases. The tangential fluid-dynamic strain rate assumed positive mean values, but it was overcome by negative mean values of curvature stretch rate to yield negative mean values of stretch rate for both the premixed flames and MILD combustion cases. This behaviour is explained in terms of the curvature dependence of displacement speed. These findings suggest that the curvature dependence of displacement speed and the scalar gradient alignment with local principal strain rate eigendirections need to be addressed for modelling EGR-type homogeneous-mixture MILD combustion. © 2021 by the authors.

Studies have shown that women's participation in decision-making (WPDM) can influence technical efficiency among agricultural crops farmers. However, rigorous empirical evidence in small-scale aquaculture is inadequate. Using data from 440 small-scale aquaculture households in the Ayeyarwady Delta region of Myanmar, this study: (a) measures technical efficiency using radial, non-radial and two-stage double bootstrap data envelopment analysis (DEA); and (b) examines the effect of WPDM on technical efficiency. Results reveal that most households perform 45–60% below the production frontier indicating they are not technically efficient. WPDM correlates with a significant increase in technical efficiency suggesting that women's empowerment contributes to optimal use of inputs and improved on-farm aquaculture performance. Practicing polyculture and implementing climate change adaptation strategies correlate with enhanced efficiency. Practicing polyculture with compatible fish species allows advantageous interactions and coexistence which improve inputs utilization and reduce wastes. Judicious use of inputs as a strategy for addressing climatic shocks possibly explains the positive correlation between adaptation and technical efficiency. Together, the findings highlight the important need to promote interventions targeted at improving technical efficiency of small-scale aquaculture producers. Improving technical efficiency can reduce production costs, increase net farm income, and provide a sustainable supply of nutritious foods, a source of essential micronutrients such as vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids, and affordable animal-source protein. Programs and policies aimed at increasing aquaculture productivity would benefit by including interventions to reduce gender inequality and promoting equity. © 2021 The Authors","Data envelopment analysis; Input use efficiency; Myanmar; Small-scale aquaculture; Women's participation in decision-making",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114240131

Aiming exclusively to achieve a greenhouse gases reduction, the first scenario relies only on supply side measures. This scenario has a negative impact in terms of employment loss at the farm level and in the agri-food sector. In contrast, a multifunctional scenario considering simultaneously climate, biodiversity, health, and employment issues, and playing with policy measures targeting supply, demand and market organisation can maintain jobs in the farm and agri-food sector, contributes to restore the agro-biodiversity and develops food products compatible with healthy nutritional guidelines. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, using the Community Earth System Model (CAM5) experiments, with emission enhancement of anthropogenic sulfate 1) five-fold globally, 2) ten-times over Asia, and 3) ten-times over Europe we show that regional emissions of sulfate aerosols alter seasonal warming over the Arctic, i.e., colder summer and warmer winter. European emissions play a dominant role in cooling during the summer season (0.7 K), while Asian emissions dominate the warming during the winter season (maximum ∼0.6 K) in the Arctic surface. The cooling/warming is associated with a negative/positive cloud radiative forcing. During the summer season increase in low–mid level clouds, induced by sulfate emissions, favours the solar dimming effect that reduces the downwelling radiation to the surface and thus leads to surface cooling. Warmer winters are associated with enhanced high-level clouds that induce a positive radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere. This study points to the importance of international strategies being implemented to control sulfate emissions to combat air pollution. Such strategies will also affect the Arctic cooling/warming associated with a cloud radiative forcing caused by sulfate emission change. © Copyright © 2021 Asutosh, Fadnavis, Nuncio, Müller and Tripathy.","arctic summer cooling and winter warming; arctic temperature; climate change; cloud radiative forcing; transport of sulfate aerosols",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119531535

Nevertheless, coupling pressure gain combustion with a turbine can result in increased losses within the cycle, mainly because of the resulting very unsteady turbine inflow conditions. A reliable simulation tool can help to overcome this challenge and optimize turbine geometries and designs for the specific application. The harsh unsteady flow downstream of pressure gain combustors makes three-dimensional CFD computationally expensive. Thus, the development of a fast computational method is crucial. This paper introduces and explores such an alternative methodology. A one-dimensional Euler gas dynamic approach is combined with blade source terms, computed out of a steady-state turbine meanline analysis. To evaluate the methodology, three-dimensional CFD simulations are performed in parallel and the results are compared with those of the 1D method. The energy extraction of a turbine expander is computed with both methods for three different configurations of pulsed detonation combustor arrays connected at the turbine inlet. The results show that the proposed approach is capable of simulating the turbine in such an unsteady environment accurately.

Spatiotemporal analysis using land use/land cover (LULC), land surface temperature (LST), and local climatic zone (LCZ) assessments have been helpful in understanding the urbanisation characteristics and morphology. Islamabad, the capital and the only planned city of Pakistan, has witnessed a consistent rise in local temperatures, increased built-up areas, and reduced vegetation cover during the past decades. This study explores the spatiotemporal dynamics of LULC, LST, and LCZ in Islamabad using satellite remote sensing data and spectral indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI). The results indicate a whopping increase in a built-up area in the city (113% during 2013 and 2019). A positive correlation between LST and NDBI, whereas a negative correlation between LST and NDVI clearly indicates how urbanisation (and reduction in vegetation cover) are impacting the local temperatures. Assessment and analysis of LCZs helped to understand the variations and deviations of current LULC from the master plan. It was observed that compact low-rise urban development is the most prevalent. The outcomes of this study are expected to inform the urban planners, climatologists, and policymakers with the knowledge helpful for devising climate-resilient development policies that could reduce thermal stresses in the capital cities. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Land use/land cover (LULC); Local climate zone (LCZ); Local surface temperature (LST); Normalized difference built-up index (NDBI); Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)","Climate change; Land use; Morphology; Remote sensing; Urban growth; Vegetation; Development policies; Negative correlation; Normalized difference vegetation index; Normalized differences; Positive correlations; Satellite remote sensing data; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Spatiotemporal analysis; Land surface temperature; climate change; development strategy; land use; NDVI; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; spectral analysis; urbanization; Islamabad [Pakistan]; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112549251

In this work, we report the fabrication of electrodes by depositing Cu over the metallic foils of Cu and Zn, which show high faradic efficiency for the conversion of CO2 to formic acid, acetate, and methanol. The morphology, phase and oxidation state of the Cu were different on the two foils while maintaining the same synthesis steps. The Cu particles embedded on Cu foil (Cu/Cu-foil) are in 3D cuboids form with flat and smooth faces, whereas Cu on Zn foil (Cu/Zn-foil) emerge in the shape of 3D flowers with the club of Cu microspikes grown perpendicularly from a root. For the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2, the Cu/Cu-foil shows a high selectivity for formic acid and ethyl acetate with the highest faradaic efficiency of 78 % at −0.3 V vs RHE, and 64 % at −1.0 V (vs RHE) for the two products, respectively. In contrast, the Cu/Zn-foil displays a high selectivity towards methanol, with the highest faradaic efficiency of 48 % at −1.0 V vs RHE, indicating that the product selectivity can be easily modulated by changing the metallic foil on which the Cu particles are deposited. Both the electrodes, Cu/Cu-foil and Cu/Zn-foil, show long-term stable performance while maintaining the selectivity of the products during CO2 electrocatalytic conversion. © 2021 The Author(s)","CO2 reduction; Electrocatalysis; Formic acid; Shape-controlled synthesis","Carbon dioxide; Copper; Efficiency; Electrocatalysis; Electrodes; Greenhouse gases; Metal cladding; Methanol; Zinc; Carbon products; CO 2 reduction; Cu foil; Electrocatalytic; Electrochemical conversion; Faradaic efficiencies; High selectivity; Metallic foils; Shape controlled synthesis; Situ grown; Formic acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116574065

Increasing material demand and reduced building lifetimes have therefore motivated efforts for urban mining in buildings. Even though urban mining has been projected as a crucial measure for improving resource efficiency, its adoption as a practice in the construction industry remains at a very symbolic stage. Upscaling secondary resource recovery and reuse in the construction sector requires further efforts to understand urban mining feasibility from the perspective of project timelines, salvage time, skills and costs. Hence, this study develops an empirical research approach to measure urban mining feasibility and applies it to demolition-ready urban residential buildings stock in Singapore with semi-skilled construction workers. It develops indicators for urban mining feasibility based on planning stages, process change, behavioural practices and reuse-driven economic considerations. Based on urban mining of over 350 building components from 34 categories, results show an average of 1 to 12 min recovery time with an estimated urban mining cost from S$0.8 to S$9 per building component. Further, regulatory requirements for demolition permits can provide sufficient time for urban mining without affecting project timelines. Even though the mining skills of workers seem important, results highlights significant improvement in mining skills based on repeated salvage of specific building components. Results also provide robust evidence of reuse-driven urban mining feasibility in the case under study with significant prospects for embodied carbon savings. Overall, urban mining of buildings can contribute to net-zero targets and climate mitigation efforts with greater multi-stakeholder involvement and market push for reuse in the construction sector. © 2021","Decarbonisation; Deconstruction; Material efficiency; Net zero targets; Reuse; Secondary resources","Construction industry; Decarbonization; Demolition; Circular economy; Construction sectors; Decarbonisation; Deconstruction; In-buildings; Material efficiency; Net zero target; Planning process; Reuse; Secondary resources; Efficiency; building; carbon emission; construction industry; economic system; emission control; environmental economics; feasibility study; recycling; Article; building; construction and demolition waste; construction work; construction worker; cost effectiveness analysis; economic aspect; environmental impact; environmental planning; feasibility study; human; life cycle assessment; mining; process design; recycling; Singapore; urban area; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Trachinotus falcatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108836990

However, these systems are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The current study investigated perception differences about climate change between transportation professionals (N = 22) and the general public (N = 2034). The study revealed that (i) transportation professionals find climate change important, worrisome and harmful to themselves and future generations; (ii) knowledge of climate change and its consequences on transportation systems is limited on average among the general public; (iii) the public holds higher levels of misperceptions about climate change; (iv) the general public is more willing to embrace the suggestions of family and friends than climate scientists regarding the issue; (v) the general public holds a higher perception of behavioral control and confidence in their ability to carry out mitigative actions; and (vi) the public has lower information-seeking intentions about climate change. Based on the study findings, areas where perceptions differ may be considered during policy formulation and implementation processes to encourage pro-environmental behavioral changes that will reduce anthropogenic carbon emissions and enhance the functionality of transportation infrastructure. © 2021 by the authors.

Clean hydrogen production is often viewed as a competition between natural gas reforming with CO2 capture and electrolysis using renewable electricity. However, solid fuel gasification with CO2 capture presents another viable alternative, especially when considering the potential of biomass to achieve negative CO2 emissions. This study investigates the techno-economic potential of hydrogen production from large-scale coal/biomass co-gasification plants with CO2 capture. With a CO2 price of 50 €/ton, the benchmark plant using commercially available technologies achieved an attractive hydrogen production cost of 1.78 €/kg, with higher CO2 prices leading to considerable cost reductions. Advanced configurations employing hot gas clean-up, membrane-assisted water-gas shift, and more efficient gasification with slurry vaporization and a chemical quench reduced the hydrogen production cost to 1.50–1.62 €/kg with up to 100% CO2 capture. Without contingencies added to the pre-commercial technologies, the lowest cost reduces to 1.43 €/kg. It was also possible to recover waste heat in the form of hot water at 120 °C for district heating, potentially unlocking further cost reductions to 1.24 €/kg. In conclusion, gasification of locally available solid fuels should be seriously considered next to natural gas and electrolysis for supplying the emerging hydrogen economy. © 2021 The Author(s)","Biomass; Carbon capture and storage; Gasification; H2 production; Membrane reactors","Biomass; Bioreactors; Carbon capture; Cost reduction; Electrolysis; Gases; Gasification; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Natural gas; Waste heat; Water gas shift; Co-gasification; Costs reduction; Economic potentials; Global energy; H 2 production; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen production costs; Membrane reactor; Solid fuels; Techno-economics; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114691711

However, there is a lack of consensus on whether management consistently affects microbial biodiversity across geographic scales, and how this relates to altered soil function. From a regulatory and monitoring perspective, there is a need to identify functionally relevant indicators of land use in order to evaluate the progress of soil restoration approaches. We performed a landscape-scale survey of unimproved calcareous grasslands paired with local arable contrasts, and assessed the consistency of responses in a variety of soil, biotic and functional measures. In addition, adjacent grasslands undergoing restoration were assessed to identify soil microbial indicators of recovery. Organic matter content was consistently larger in grasslands than in arable fields, and increased with time in the restoring sites. Molecular comparisons of grassland versus arable soils revealed numerous bacterial, archaeal and fungal indicators, with more representatives of Ca. Xiphinematobacter, DA101, Bradyrhizobium, Rhodoplanes, Mycobacteria and Mortierella in old grassland soils, whereas Nitrososphaera, Sporosarcina and Alternaria infectoria were more abundant in arable soils. Extracellular enzymatic responses were more variable, with none of the eight investigated enzymes being consistent indicators of grassland or arable soils. Correlation analyses, incorporating the molecular and enzymatic responses across all surveyed soils, revealed that molecular indicators were more strongly correlated with soil organic matter increases with restoration of arable soils. Our results highlight that microbial taxa are among the most sensitive indicators of soil restoration, and we identify consistent responses of specific taxa to management across geographic scales. This discovery will be important for both the instigation and monitoring of soil restoration. Highlights: Soil microbes are key drivers of soil ecosystem services and are affected by management Calcareous grassland exhibited abundant Verrucomicrobia; cropping increased Nitrososphaera These taxa responded to SOM increases with grassland restoration, more so than enzymes and fungi Microbes provide consistent, site-independent indicators for calcareous grassland soil function restoration. © 2020 The Authors.

In general, tannins can be extracted using hot water or organic solvents from the bark, leaves, and stems of plants. Industrially, tannins are applied to produce adhesives, wood coatings, and other applications in the wood and polymer industries. In addition, tannins can also be used as a renewable and environmentally friendly material to manufacture bio-based polyurethanes (bio-PUs) to reduce or eliminate the toxicity of isocyanates used in their manufacture. Tannin-based bio-PUs can improve the mechanical and thermal properties of polymers used in the automotive, wood, and construction industries. The various uses of tannins need to be put into perspective with regards to possible further advances and future potential for value-added applications. Tannins are employed in a wide range of industrial applications, including the production of leather and wood adhesives, accounting for almost 90% of the global commercial tannin output. The shortage of natural resources, as well as the growing environmental concerns related to the reduction of harmful emissions of formaldehyde or isocyanates used in the production of polyurethanes, have driven the industrial and academic interest towards the development of tannin-based bio-PUs as sustainable alternative materials with satisfactory characteristics. The aim of the present review is to comprehensively summarize the current state of research in the field of development, characterization, and application of tannin-derived, bio-based polyurethane resins. The successful synthesis process of the tanninbased bio-PUs was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses. © 2021 by the authors.","Bio-based polyurethane; Extraction; Synthesis; Tannin; Tannin source","Adhesives; Construction industry; Differential scanning calorimetry; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gel permeation chromatography; Manufacture; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Plants (botany); Polyurethanes; Reinforced plastics; Resins; Tannins; Thermogravimetric analysis; Bio-based; Bio-based polyurethane; Phenolic metabolites; Protective function; Root bark; Source synthesis; Stem bark; Tannin; Tannin source; Tree barks; Flavonoids; FTIR spectroscopy; metabolite; natural resource; polymer; tannin; Adhesives; Gel Permeation Chromatography; Gravimetry; Manufacture; Polyurethanes; Tannins; Thermal Analysis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119340963

We integrate these geometries into a commercial reservoir simulator (CMG-IMEX) and examine their effect on reservoir fluids production. Our first, reference fracture scenario includes only vertical, planar hydraulic fractures. The second scenario has stimulated vertical natural fractures oriented perpendicularly to the vertical hydraulic fractures. The third fracture scenario has stimulated horizontal bedding planes intersecting the vertical hydraulic fractures. This last scenario may occur in mudrock plays characterized by high pore pressure and transitional strike-slip to reverse faulting stress regimes. We demonstrate that the vertical and planar fractures are an oversimplification of the hydraulic fracture geometry in anisotropic shale plays. They fail to represent the stimulated volume geometric complexity in the reservoir simulations and may confuse hydrocarbon production forecast. We also show that stimulating mechanically weak bedding planes harms hydrocarbon production, while stimulated natural fractures may enhance initial production. Our findings reveal that stimulated horizontal bedding planes might decrease the cumulative hydrocarbon production by as much as 20%, and the initial hydrocarbon production by about 50% compared with the reference scenario. We present unique reservoir simulations that enable practical assessment of the impact of varied hydraulic fracture configurations on hydrocarbon production and highlight the importance of constraining present-day in situ stress state and pore pressure conditions to obtain a realistic hydrocarbon production forecast. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we developed a laboratory-scale setup to measure the removal nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) using a variety of common green roof species. Experiments were conducted on detached leaves and whole plants using two chambers (0.6 L and 12 L), visible lighting, NOx/O3 sources and online analyzers. Three species were the best performant (Thymus vulgaris, Sedum sexangulare and Heuchera Americana L.) with deposition velocities (vd) ranging from 1.6 to 4.82 m/h for NO2, and 1.7–5.56 m/h for O3. In both cases, thyme was the most effective plant likely due to its higher stomatal area and the reactivity of its volatile metabolites with O3 leading to several oxidized by-products. Furthermore, NO2 uptake was found to be enhanced by surface water released by leaf transpiration leading to the production of nitrous acid (HONO). Similar values of (vd) were observed (3.84–4.65 m/h) when whole thyme plant was used. The soil was also found to be competitive in removing O3 but less performant in capturing NO2. Using a dry deposition model, we estimated that the three plant species can uptake up to 9 kg/ha/year of NO2 and 13.6 kg/ha/year, which fall in agreement with previously reported modeling data. Our experimental approach can be a rapid tool for screening the depollution performances of green roof species enabling an effective prioritization for deployment in urban environments. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Green roofs; NOx; O3","Air pollution; Deposition; Nitrogen removal; Plants (botany); Roofs; Surface waters; Urban planning; Air pollutants; Experimental approaches; Green roof; Nitrogen dioxides; NO $-2$; O3; Online analyzers; Urban air; Urban environments; Whole plants; Nitrogen oxides; atmospheric pollution; experiment; measurement method; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; pollutant removal; roof; urban area; Heuchera americana; Sedum sexangulare; Thymus vulgaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113851229

Sensory alterations, including spontaneous pain, and thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia are well characterized, but there is a notable lack of evidence about the affective pain component in this model. Evaluation of the emotional component of pain in rats has been proposed as a way to optimize potential translational value of non-clinical studies. In rats, 22 and 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are considered well-established measures of negative and positive emotional states, respectively. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that trigeminal neuropathic pain would result, in addition to the sensory alterations, in a decrease of 50 kHz USV, which may be related to altered function of brain areas involved in emotional pain processing. CCI-ION surgery was performed on 60-day-old male Wistar rats. 15 days after surgery, von Frey filaments were applied to detect mechanical hyperalgesia, and USV was recorded. At the same timepoint, systemic treatment with d,l-amphetamine (1 mg/kg) allowed investigation of the involvement of the dopaminergic system in USV emission. Finally, brain tissue was collected to assess the change in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and c-Fos expression in brain areas involved in emotional pain processing, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, and NAc. The results showed that CCI-ION rats presented mechanical hyperalgesia and a significant reduction of environmental-induced 50 kHz USV. Amphetamine caused a marked increase in 50 kHz USV emission in CCI-ION rats. In addition, TH expression was lower in constricted animals and c-Fos analysis revealed an increase in neuronal activation. Taken together, these data indicate that CCI-ION causes a reduction in the emission of environmental-induced appetitive calls concomitantly with facial mechanical hyperalgesia and that both changes may be related to a reduction in the mesolimbic dopaminergic activity. © The Author(s) 2021.","amphetamine; dopamine; mechanical hyperalgesia; nucleus accumbens; Orofacial pain; ultrasonic vocalization","amphetamine; ketamine; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; xylazine; acoustic spectroscopy; amygdala; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; biopsy; brain tissue; controlled study; immunohistochemistry; infraorbital nerve; male; mechanical hyperalgesia; neuropathic pain; nonhuman; prefrontal cortex; surgical technique; Western blotting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121747736

Here, we present a case study approaching a tidal flood risk mapping application in the face of climate change scenarios in a region with a strong environmental and social appeal. The study site is an estuarine cut in the Brazilian semi-arid region, covering part of two state conservation units, which has been suffering severe consequences from tidal flooding in recent years. In this case study, we used high-geodetic-precision data (lidar DEM), together with robust tidal return period statistics and data from current sea level rise scenarios. We found that approximately 327.60 km2 of the estuary is under tidal flood risk and in need of mitigation measures. This case study can serve as a basis for future management actions, as well as a model for applying risk mapping in other coastal areas. © Author(s) 2021.",,"climate change; flood damage; flood deposit; risk assessment; sea level change; semiarid region; Brazil; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119120162

Results indicate that the effect of oil prices on the U.S. stock market depends on the type and timing of the shock. An oil supply shock generally does not have a statistically measurable effect on stock market performance. Conversely, an aggregate demand shock has a positive effect on nearly all sectors while an oil-specific demand shock has a negative effect on stock returns for most industries. These results suggest that investors can shift the portfolios consistent with smaller effects of oil-related shocks and the costs of carbon taxes and/or tradeable permits may be smaller than commonly thought if stock prices represent the net present value of profits. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon tax; Oil shocks; Rolling SVAR; Stock markets; U.S. industries","Aggregates; Carbon; Commerce; Costs; Investments; Regression analysis; Carbon taxes; Demand shocks; Low-carbon policies; Oil market; Oil Prices; Oil shock; Rolling structural vector autoregression; Structural vector autoregression; Two ways; US industry; Financial markets; carbon emission; environmental policy; oil supply; pollution tax; stock market; United States; Trachinotus falcatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117357662

This study combined simulated daily weather data (MarkSim) and the CERES-Rice crop model from the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) software to predict rice production for three planting seasons under four climate change scenarios (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) for the years 2021 to 2050 in the Keduang subwater-shed, Wonogiri Regency, Central Java, Indonesia. The CERES-Rice model was calibrated and vali-dated for the local rice cultivar (Ciherang) with historical data using GenCalc software. The model evaluation indicated good performance with both calibration (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.89, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.88) and validation (R2 = 0.87, NSE = 0.76). Our results sug-gest that the predicted changing rainfall patterns, rising temperature, and intensifying solar radia-tion under climate change can reduce the rice yield in all three growing seasons. Under RCP 8.5, the impact on rice yield in the second dry season may decrease by up to 11.77% in the 2050s. Relevant strategies associated with policies based on the results were provided for decision makers. Further-more, to adapt the impact of climate change on rice production, a dynamic cropping calendar, mod-ernization of irrigation systems, and integrated plant nutrient management should be developed for farming practices based on our results in the study area. Our study is not only the first assessment of the impact of climate change on the study site but also provides solutions under projected rice shortages that threaten regional food security. © 2021 by the authors.

However, many management plans fail to include such assessments when evaluating threats to species or ecological communities. Species distribution models (SDMs) are versatile tools that can estimate species exposure to shifts in climate, but they lack information on the response capacity of species to climate change. Functional traits can be used in conjunction with SDMs to understand aspects of species biology that would suggest sensitivity to climate change. We illustrate how exposure to climate change and sensitivity of species based on their traits can be combined to generate predictions of climate change risk in four species listed as threatened (under state and federal legislation) and four unlisted plant species from the endemic Australian genus Persoonia (Proteaceae). We develop distribution models for each species using two emissions scenarios and assess four traits and two range metrics that are recognized as limiting factors in four potential climate change responses (reproduction, movement capability, habitat specialization, and spatial coverage) to assess the sensitivity of these eight species to climate change. Listed and unlisted species varied in niche breadth, environmental envelopes, and the percent contribution of variables to the model building process. Our models project a significant decline in habitat suitability under future climates at current occurrence locations for all species, and a 32–95% reduction in the total area (km2) of suitable habitat for all species by 2060, with significantly greater decline under the higher emissions scenario. Seven out of the eight species assessed ranked high for overall climate sensitivity therefore listing status may be a poor indicator of climate change risk to plant species. This has important implications for the continued focus on threatened taxa in conservation planning, particularly for hyper-diverse groups like plants and invertebrates where a species listing status is influenced by an often-slow progress towards comprehensive assessments of threat status. © 2021","CMIP6; Ecological niche modelling; Habitat suitability modelling; Plant conservation; Threatened species management; Trait ecology; Vulnerability assessment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116627641

The objective of this study was to explore knowledge and perspectives on climate change and health-related issues, with a particular focus on non-communicable diseases, in the informal settlement (urban slum) of Mukuru in Nairobi, Kenya. Three focus group discussions and five in-depth interviews were conducted with total of 28 participants representing local community leaders, health care workers, volunteers, policy makers and academia. Data were collected using semi-structured interview guides and analyzed using grounded theory. Seven main themes emerged: climate change related diseases, nutrition and access to clean water, environmental risk factors, urban planning and public infrastructure, economic risk factors, vulnerable groups, and adaptation strategies. All participants were conscious of a link between climate change and health. This is the first qualitative study on climate change and health in an informal settlement in Africa. The study provides important information on perceived health risks, risk factors and adaptation strategies related to climate change.

Benthic bioturbations are thought to play an important role in mediating N cycling in intertidal marshes. However, how the burrowing activity of benthos and their microbial symbionts affect N transformation and greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) emission remains unclear in these environments. Here, we show that bioturbation of crabs reshaped the structure of intertidal microbial communities and their N cycling function. Molecular analyses suggested that the microbially-driven N cycling might be accelerated by crab bioturbation, as the abundances of most of the N related functional genes were higher on the burrow wall than those in the surrounding bulk sediments, except for genes involved in N fixation, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), and N2O reduction, which were further confirmed by isotope-tracing experiments. Especially, the potential rates of the main N2O production pathways, nitrification and denitrification, were 2-3 times higher in the burrow wall sediments. However, even higher N2O emission rates (approximately 6 times higher) were observed in this unique microhabitat, which was due to a disproportionate increase in N2O production over N2O consumption driven by burrowing activity. In addition, the sources of N2O were also significantly affected by crab bioturbation, which increased the contribution of hydroxylamine oxidation pathway. This study reveals the mechanism through which benthic bioturbations mediate N cycling and highlights the importance of considering burrowing activity when evaluating the ecological function of intertidal wetlands. © 2018","Bioturbation; Intertidal marshes; Nitrogen; Nitrous oxide","Amines; Genes; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Shellfish; Bioturbation; Burrow walls; Ecosystem functions; Intertidal marsh; Intertidal wetland; N cycling; N$-2$/O; Nitrogen-cycling; Nitrous oxide; Nitrous oxide emissions; Wetlands; bioturbation; crab; emission; intertidal environment; marsh; microbial community; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide; wetland; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; animal; Brachyura; denitrification; microflora; wetland; Animals; Brachyura; Denitrification; Microbiota; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111008672

However, there is yet no effective approach for monitoring the spatio-temporal pattern of large-scale grassland degradation. In particular, the research on grassland changes in the harsh natural environment such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is still in its infancy due to complexity, and it is extremely difficult for humans to reach these remote areas. The annual changes in the grassland biomass might be the results of climate fluctuations or grassland degradation. To test the hypothesis, the impact of inter-annual climate fluctuations needs to be considered when monitoring the grassland degradation based on spatio-temporal change of grassland biomass. In this paper, we propose a Novel Climate Use Efficiency index (NCUE) by considering rainfall, temperature, sunlight time, wind speed, surface temperature, accumulated temperature, time lag effect, light, temperature and water suitability and their coordination climatic factors that mainly affect vegetation growth comprehensively, to monitor grassland change suitable for cold and dry climate characteristics of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and to reduce the effect of inter-annual variability of grassland productivity caused by climate fluctuation. As a consequence, grassland degradation monitoring could be more accurate and objective than existing ecological indicators. Our experiments show that the slope of NCUE over 31 years from 1982 to 2012 is 0.0028, showing a recovery trend in grassland. Degradation and restoration of grassland exist at the same time, and their proportions are 20.49% and 23.89%, respectively. By comparing with in-situ measurements in 2013 and 2009, 68% consistency was achieved with our prediction, and the 70% consistency is achieved by comparing with the positive and negative change trend of accumulated NDVI during the growing season. Moreover, the comparative analysis of land use/cover changes (LUCC) from 1990 to 2010 shows 69% of consistency. The ratio of the area of grassland significantly degradation and recovered predicted by NCUE change trend is 1.41% and 1.43%, respectively. It occupies a very small area of the study area. Yet, that predicted by NDVI change trend is 42.17% and 31.90%, respectively, and about 70% of the area is detected as drastic changes. It shows that NDVI is sensitive to climate fluctuations, while NCUE reduces the impact of climate fluctuations, reflecting change of grassland being affected by human activities and long-term climate change. The novel NCUE has great potential and utility to minify the impact of climate fluctuation and reflect grassland changes over space and time quantitatively. Such ecological index provides a new understanding of spatial and temporal patterns of grassland degradation in the Three River Headwaters Region (TRHR) at the same time. © 2021 The Authors","Grassland degradation and restoration; IMF; NCUE; RUE; Tibetan Plateau; TRHR","Climate change; Ecology; Efficiency; Land use; Wind; Change trends; Climate fluctuations; Grassland degradation; Grassland restorations; IMF; Novel climate use efficiency; RUE; Three-rivers headwater regions; Tibetan Plateau; Use efficiency; Restoration; biomass; climate change; environmental degradation; grassland; monitoring system; NDVI; quantitative analysis; restoration ecology; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114842214

The photosynthesis or GPP is largely determined by the photosynthetic capacity of vegetation (i.e., maximum rate of carboxylation, Vcmax) in ecosystem models. However, considerable uncertainties of Vcmax estimates may limit our potential to address scientific issues of GPP related to the increasing emission of atmospheric CO2. Recently, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) signals have been used as a proxy for resolving photosynthesis. In this study, the biochemical and structural parameters were retrieved from hyperspectral reflectance and fluorescence quantum efficiency (FQEs) was retrieved from ground-based SIF. Then, retrieved parameters were incorporated into the Soil Canopy Observation Photosynthesis and Energy (SCOPE) model to explore the potential of ground-based SIF to track Vcmax variability for a subtropical evergreen mixed forest. Then, SIF-derived Vcmax was used to parameterize Boreal Ecosystem Production Simulator (BEPS) model to simulate the GPP. With retrieved vegetative parameters and FQEs, the ground-based SIF was strongly correlated with the model-based SIF simulation at O2-B and O2-A bands, demonstrating that the coefficient of determination (R2) improved from 0.15 (constant values) to 0.60 (retrieved values) for SIFB and from 0.79 to 0.94 for SIFA simulation. Using SIF-derived Vcmax, the R2 value of simulated GPP against eddy covariance-based measurements substantially increased from 0.18 (constant Vcmax) to 0.38 (SIF-derived Vcmax) for dry season and from 0.56 to 0.67 for wet season respectively. The utilization of SIF-derived Vcmax with its corrected temperature response function reduced the relative error in annual GPP simulations by 24.9%. Our results support the significant references toward reducing unbiased SIF simulation and highlighting the potential of ground SIF in deriving Vcmax at the site scale for defining forest management options. © 2021 The Authors","Chlorophyll fluorescence; Ecosystem models; Forest; Gross primary production; Vcmax","Carbon dioxide; Carboxylation; Chlorophyll; Climate change; Ecosystems; Forestry; Photosynthesis; Reflection; Tropics; Uncertainty analysis; Atmospheric CO$-2$; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Ecosystem model; Fluorescence quantum efficiency; Forest; Gross primary production; Ground based; Photosynthetic parameters; Subtropical forests; Vcmax; Fluorescence; chlorophenol; chlorophyll; ecosystem modeling; fluorescence; forest ecosystem; net primary production; parameter estimation; photosynthesis; subtropical region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113282051

Due to the various systems of genetic control and the modifying effects of growing conditions on the manifestation of quantitative traits, there is the need to assess the genotypic variability of economically valuable features, focused on the identification of genotypes characterized by stability and adaptive qualities in growing conditions. The study examined 15 varieties of garden strawberries of domestic and foreign selection. The field experiments and surveys were carried out according to the Program generally accepted in the Russian Federation and methodology for the variety study of fruit, berry and nut crops. We studied such features as the number of peduncles (pcs/bush), number of berries (pcs/bush), average weight of berries (g), total and marketable yield (g/bush), sugar content in berries, soluble solids and ascorbic acid. The purpose of this work was to assess the genotype-year interrelation in terms of the variability of productivity features and berry quality and to identify strawberry varieties with a stable genotype. As a result of two-way analysis of variance for the variety-year interrelation, the obtained values were 1.10-8.50 at standard Fst. - 1.24. Statistically important differences had indicators of productivity of a bush between the first and second clusters (t = 5.89 at p <0.01), the first and third (t = 15.83 at p <0.01), the second and third clusters (t = 8.13 at p <0.01), as well as the average berry weight between the first and third, second and third clusters (t = 15.50 and 6.99 at p <0.01, respectively).

In order to identify possible emission sources, carbonaceous components in the particles collected by a cascade air sampler that is capable of collecting PM0.1 particles were analyzed by applying a thermal/optical reflectance (IMPROVE-TOR) protocol. The PM0.1 levels in the Jambi and Pekanbaru areas were similar to those in large cities in East Asia, such as Bangkok and Hanoi. During the rainy season, local emissions in the form of vehicle combustion were the main sources of PM. The influence of peatland fires in the dry season was more significant in cities that are located on the east coast of Sumatra island because of the larger number of hotspots and air mass trajectories along the coast. A clear increase in the carbonaceous profiles as OC, TC, and OC/EC ratios in the dry season from the rainy season was observed, particularly in fine fractions such as PM0.5–1. In both seasons, EC vs. OC/EC correlations and soot-EC/TC ratios showed that the PM0.1 fraction in Sumatra island was heavily influenced by vehicle emissions, while the effect of biomass burning was more sensitive with respect to the PM0.5–1 fraction, particularly in Jambi and Pekanbaru sites during the dry season. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper provides a thorough and authoritative review of the vast array of research in this field, including past and ongoing initiatives. The study reveals that existing research leverages recent ad-vances in digital technologies while focusing on one or several of the following themes: carbon reduction, use of renewable energy resources, cost-performance optimisation, deployment of smart control technologies, the regulatory land-scape for greening seaports, and implementing green port practices guidelines. As such, the paper provides a critical review of existing technologies and con-cepts that promote and contribute to the decarbonisation of seaports, including Smart Grids and Virtual Power Plants.

The need to reduce energy consumption becomes necessary for companies to achieve sustainable development. Therefore, a new challenge for the scientific community was foreseen, researching new algorithms or knowledge hubs to achieve green scheduling. Green scheduling may be considered one of the principles of green manufacturing, aimed at minimizing environmental damage and energy waste. A review of the literature shows that there are no research works that analyze the scientific development carried out in “green scheduling” through methodologies based on bibliometric analysis, thus the need and the novelty of this research. Based on a dataset formed by 420 scientific documents published from 2006 to 2020 a bibliometric and network analysis is carried out to find the scientific trends, the main relationships according to collaborations and intermediaries, and the research hubs that help to establish the research agenda. The results show that “green scheduling” is a growing research area in the scientific community and in recent years the number of new research topics has experienced considerable growth. This research is developed in Asia, Europe and America, but China stands out as the most productive, collaborative, intermediary, influential and active country at present, through its organizations which are mainly universities, such as Huanzhong University of Science and Technology and Tongji University. However, research development related to green scheduling is carried out in a collaborative environment between institutions located in different countries, allowing countries that are not scientific powerhouses to develop research in the area. The network analysis makes it possible to define the research framework through the clustering of the dataset's research keywords, highlighting that the main areas of research focus on the development of new methods through algorithms aimed at improving energy efficiency in production environments, in areas of computational development such as cloud computing, and in transportation. The most cited research papers, considered the main drivers of knowledge, are published in high-quality research journals, and are mainly developments in scheduling algorithms for different work environments with a green approach. Research findings can provide the academic community with relevant information about green scheduling to make appropriate decisions and become a research agenda for future research. © 2021 The Author(s)","Bibliometric analysis; Green manufacturing; Green scheduling; Network analysis; Scheduling","Computational efficiency; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Green computing; Greenhouse gases; Industrial research; Manufacture; Scheduling algorithms; Sustainable development; Bibliometrics analysis; Community IS; Environmental energy; Green manufacturing; Green scheduling; Greenhouse gas emissions; Manufacturing scheduling; Reduce energy consumption; Research agenda; Scientific community; Scheduling; carbon emission; greenhouse gas; manufacturing; mapping; network analysis; statistical analysis; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115655847

The design of such systems, however, depends on the climatic conditions and the geological characteristics of the site; in practice, the optimum design of the system also depends on the characteristics of the surrounding soil. The majority of the research into GSHPs has been focused on cold regions, thus this work is a very useful reference and important in GSHPs’ design in Saudi Arabia and therefore in other hot and arid regions. For the first time in such a hot/dry climate, a rigorous sensitivity analysis method applying the Ground Loop Design software has been employed to analyse 12 parameters that most affect the behaviour of the system. It is concluded that the most important four design parameters are the: thermal conductivity, soil temperature, building load, and fluid flowrate. On increasing these values they have opposing effects on arid environmental conditions, such as those found in the city of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. In addition, the near-optimum design of a GSHP system in the city of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia has been investigated. The temperature of the water entering the heat pump is an adjustable factor that determines the performance of a GSHP unit. Because of the coefficient of performance of the heat pump, it can also be measured by the value of the entering water temperature. Thus, the entering water temperature (EWT) was selected to be the performance measure of the system, as all the heat transfer processed between the ground heat exchanger components and the surrounding soil is manifested in the entering water temperature. The value of the EWT was fixed both at the baseline and in the proposed design systems, and these were tested over the lifespan of 20 years. The results showed that the length of the ground heat exchanger and power consumption in the proposed design could be reduced by 15% and 1.12% respectively, compared to the baseline system. These results can be used to simplify the design of buildings in similar arid regions worldwide. © 2021","Ground source heat pump; Hot/dry climates; Sensitivity analysis","Air conditioning; Arid regions; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Geothermal energy; Geothermal heat pumps; Heat transfer; Soils; Sustainable development; Temperature; Thermal conductivity; Conditioning systems; Geothermal heat pump systems; Ground heat exchangers; Ground-source heat pump; Heat pumps; Hot dry climates; Optimum designs; Saudi Arabia; Surrounding soils; Water temperatures; Sensitivity analysis; air conditioning; arid region; geothermal power; heat transfer; pump; sensitivity analysis; water temperature; Riyadh [Riyadh (PRV)]; Saudi Arabia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108969337

Wastewater sludge management for energy recovery creates an opportunity for sector integration for both wastewater treatment plants and renewable energy production. The objective of this study was to theoretically estimate the biomethane potential of wastewater sludge, together with identification of the role of biomethane in the region. The prediction of biomethane potential was based on the theoretical stoichiometry of biomethanation reactions, using the R-based package ‘Process Biogas Data and Predict Biogas Production’. The biomethane potential of sludge ranges between 232–334 × 106 m3, with a total heat-value up to 10.7 trillion BTUs annually. The produced biomethane can generate up to 1665 GWh of electric energy, an equivalent amount to the current levels of electricity generation from wind and solar power combined. The findings from the case study on Kuwait’s indicate that biomethane could displace 13 × 106 m3 of natural gas, or approximately 86,000 barrels of crude oil, while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 86% when compared to the base-scenario. Despite its potential, biomethane recovery in the region is hindered by technical-, economic-, and policy-based barriers. © 2021 by the authors.

For this reason, cities are required to adopt measures to reduce these impacts and tree planting has been suggested as a cost-effective strategy. In our study, we implemented for the first time in a Southern Caucasus city the i-Tree Eco model to quantify the main ecosystem services provided by urban forests. Trees in two parks in Tbilisi, EXPO Park (694 trees) and RED Park (1030 trees), have been measured, and a model simulation was performed for the year 2018. These green infrastructures store large amounts of carbon in their woody tissues (198.4 t for EXPO Park and 126.5 t for RED Park) and each year they sequester 4.6 and 4.7 t of CO2 for EXPO Park and RED Park. They also remove 119.6 and 90.3 kg of pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, SO2), and reduce water runoff of 269.5 and 200.5 m3, respectively.

Efforts to build green industry have raised the economic and geopolitical stakes of environmental issues as states seek to position their firms in global value chains and reshore strategic industries. This could help to generate the technologies and political momentum needed to accelerate global decarbonization. At the same time, these green interventions confront status quo interests and a variety of industrial policies that support fossil fuel-based industries. To help make sense of this new landscape, this introduction to the special issue defines green industrial policy and situates it within domestic political economy, social policy, and global geopolitics. We present six new studies that demonstrate and explore the global politics of green industrial policy. To illustrate the kinds of effects and implications of green industrial policy we are interested in exploring, we show how green industrial policy has transformed climate politics. Changes in state practice, ideas about the environment and economy, and technological cost declines came together to produce a new opportunistic and competitive climate politics. We then identify areas for further investigation as we call for a new climate politics research agenda, integrating green industrial policy more intentionally into studies of global environmental politics. © 2021 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"climate change; global perspective; green economy; industrial policy; landscape ecology; political economy; politics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120436077

One potent solution, gaining global acceptance, is that of the Green New Deal (GND), positioned as a radical rethinking of political and economic structures in view of pushing sustainability at the forefront of national, regional, and global issues. With the model rapidly gaining ground in various geographies, and in different forms in view of contextualization needs, there is a need to better understand its evolution, knowledge structures, and trends. This paper thus sets forth to provide an understanding of the evolution and implementation of GND through a biblio-metric analysis and science mapping techniques using VOSviewer and CiteSpace to identify the thematic focus of 1174 articles indexed in the Web of Science since 1995. To understand the thematic evolution of the field over time, we divided the study period into three sub-periods, namely 1995– 2014, 2015–2019, and 2020–2021. These sub-periods were determined considering important milestones related to GNDs. Term co-occurrence analyses were then conducted to understand thematic focus and associated trends. Also, co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling were other methods applied to identify major sources, authors, publications, and countries that have made more contributions to the development of research on GNDs. The findings of this paper can help both researchers and policy makers understand the evolution and trends of GNDs to better formulate GNDs strategies and policies in accordance with varying needs and geographies. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, the impact of changing injection duration in upgraded MTU-4000-R43L diesel engine on power characteristics, rate of heat release (RoHR), combustion phasing, emission and, most importantly, the gradient of pressure changes as a characteristic of the vibration and knocking of the engine, has been studied numerically. Numerical simulation is performed in AVL Fire which is coupled with reduced detail chemical kinetics. The fuel injection duration was varying from 14.6 to 35.6 oCA, the in-cylinder mean pressure, the IMEP decreases, and the ISFC increases; however, as the fuel injection duration decreases, the pressure gradient rises; from the range of 30.6 degrees onwards, the reduction of the fuel injection duration leads to a severe knock of the engine and as a result reduces its engine life. Emission results also showed that CO2 and NOx increased and CO reduced with decreasing fuel decreasing injection duration. © 2021 Materials and Energy Research Center.

Our goal is to reduce the total tour length traveled by -*the agent without violating any time limitations. This will aid in decreasing the time required to supply any type of service, as well as lowering the emissions produced by automobiles, allowing our planet to recover from air pollution emissions. The proposed model is a variation of the pointer networks that has a better ability to encode the TSPTW problems. The model proposed in this paper is inspired from our previous work that introduces a hybrid context encoder and a multi attention decoder. The hybrid encoder primarily comprises the transformer encoder and the graph encoder; these encoders encode the feature vector before passing it to the attention decoder layer. The decoder consists of transformer context and graph context as well. The output attentions from the two decoders are aggregated and used to select the following step in the trip. To the best of our knowledge, our network is the first neural model that will be able to solve medium-size TSPTW problems. Moreover, we conducted sensitivity analysis to explore how the model performance changes as the time window width in the training and testing data changes. The experimental work shows that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art model for TSPTW of sizes 20, 50 and 100 nodes/cities. We expect that our model will become state-of-the-art methodology for solving the TSPTW problems. © 2021 by the authors.

While increases in short-term exposure to air pollutants at any daily concentrations has been shown to be associated to adverse health outcomes, days with extreme levels, also known as air pollution peaks based on specific thresholds, have been used to implement air quality alerts in various cities across the globe. Objectives: We aimed at evaluating the potential effects of the Air Quality Alerts (AQA) system on different causes of premature mortality in Paris, France. Methods: Air quality alerts (AQA) based on particulate matter (PM10) levels and related interventions were implemented in the region of Paris in 2008 and were revised to be more stringent in 2011. In this study, we applied a difference-in-differences (DID) approach coupled with propensity-score matching (PSM) to daily mortality data for the period 2000 to 2015 to evaluate the effects of the Paris AQA program on different causes of premature mortality for the entire population and for adults &gt; 75 years old. Results: Overall, results did not show evidence of a reduction in mortality of the PM10 AQA program when first implemented in 2008 with initial thresholds (80 µg/m3); DID estimates were slightly above 1 for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. However, when evaluating the drastic reduction in revised thresholds in 2011 (50 µg/m3) to trigger interventions, we identified a reduction in cardiovascular (DID = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.755 to 0.930) mortality, but no change in respiratory mortality was detected (DID = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.796, 1.191). Discussion: Our study suggests that AQA may not have health benefits for the population when thresholds are set at high daily PM10 levels. Given that such policies are implemented in many other metropolitan areas across the globe, evaluating the effectiveness of AQA is important to provide public authorities and researchers a rationale for defining specific thresholds and extending the scope of these policies to lower air pollution levels. © 2021 The Authors","Air pollution; Air Quality Alert System; Policy evaluation; Premature mortality; Quasi-experimental methods","Population statistics; Quality control; % reductions; Air pollutants; Air quality alert system; Difference-in-differences; Differences-in-differences; PM$-10$; Policy evaluation; Premature mortality; Quasi-experimental method; Short-term exposure; Air quality; air quality; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; experimental design; mortality; pollution exposure; pollution policy; respiratory disease; adult; air quality; article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; France; human; particulate matter 10; premature mortality; propensity score; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental exposure; mortality; particulate matter; premature mortality; time factor; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Mortality; Mortality, Premature; Particulate Matter; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106213483

Their physically limited water resources are invoked to cover the increasing needs of the local population, combined with the seasonal water demand peaks due to tourists. This often leads to aquifers' overexploitation and seawater intrusion, deteriorating the water quality. Water scarcity may also occur due to inadequate infrastructure, limited investments and human resources for proper management. This study uses the example of Skiathos island, which faces all the above challenges. The water supply network and the city's demand are simulated through WEAP software, in an attempt to address the major drivers for future water management. A long-term water demand forecast is performed under scenarios of climate change (based on ensemble means of RCP simulations), and water pricing (based on the recommendations of European legislation). Other pressures (i.e., operation of new hotels) and measures (i.e., desalinization unit, network and reservoir works) that were already considered by the local authorities are discussed. Overall, the findings aim to sensitize and motivate local policymakers to construct databases, start monitoring, include more factors in the decision-making process, and avoid overexploitation for the sake of non-sustainable development norms. © 2021 The Author.","Climate change; Demand forecasting; Skiathos Greece; Socio-economic analysis; Urban water management; WEAP","Aquifers; Decision making; Economic analysis; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Investments; Reservoirs (water); Water management; Water quality; Water supply; Demand forecasting; Economics analysis; Overexploitation; Skiatho greece; Socio-economic analyse; Socio-economics; Urban water management; Water resources planning; Waters resources; WEAP; Climate change; climate change; economic conditions; water planning; water resource; Greece; Skiathos; Sporades [Aegean Islands]; Sporades [Thessaly]; Thessaly",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118808337

We performed a techno-economic analysis to estimate the break-even price and life cycle carbon emissions of the SAF derived from carinata (Brassica carinata) in the Southeastern United States. Carinata has the potential as a feedstock for SAF production in the selected region due to higher yield, low fertilizer use, co-product generation (animal feed, propane, and naphtha), and compatibility with current farming practices. The system boundary started at the farm and ended when the SAF is delivered to an airport. Without co-product credit or other subsidies such as Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credit, carinata-based SAF was more expensive ($0.85 L−1 to $1.28 L−1) than conventional aviation fuel ($0.50 L−1). With co-product credit only, the break-even price ranged from $0.34 L−1 to $0.89 L−1. With both co-product and RIN credits, the price ranged from -$0.12 to -$0.66 L−1. The total carbon emission was 918.67 g CO2e L−1 of carinata-based SAF. This estimate provides 65% relative carbon savings compared with conventional aviation fuel (2618 g CO2e L−1). Sensitivity analysis suggested a 95% probability that relative carbon savings can range from 61% to 68%. Our study indicates that carinata-based aviation fuel could significantly reduce carbon emissions of the aviation sector.

The circulation of air releases heat energy to expand the volume of hot fluids and impact the turbine wheel to generate power of hot gases. The present study investigates the potential of using ultrasonic atomization technology to assist in the combustion process. An experimental rig was set up to determine the performance of jet engines using ultrasonic droplets. A gas analyzer was used to measure various greenhouse emissions of exhaust gas. The performance of the engine was tested under three load levels (high, medium, low), starting from 10 psi at a steady state, to the minimum value. A significant result was tested for a low value of nitrogen monoxide at the three levels of load, and a specific result was tested for an efficiency value of 2% at the three levels of load. Carbon dioxide was found to decrease at the low load level.

The empirical estimation is conducted using a dynamic panel threshold model. We found one threshold in the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth and one threshold in the relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions and economic growth. The results indicate that energy consumption positively and significantly affects economic growth in the low energy consumption regime. In contrast, it has a negative and significant impact on economic growth in the high energy consumption regime. Moreover, CO2 emissions are positively and significantly related to economic growth in the low regime of CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth in the high CO2 emissions regime is negative and significant. Therefore, policymakers should implement other effective energy policies, such as stricter regulations on CO2 emissions, increase energy efficiency, and replace fossil fuels with cleaner energy sources to avoid unnecessary CO2 emissions and combat global warming.

BAU conditions are modeled, applying the XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) machine learning algorithm on air quality and meteorological surface measurements, and reanalysis data. A reduction in NO2 concentrations is found during the lockdown period due to the restriction policies at both AGSOFIA and EGNATIA stations of −24.9 [−26.6, −23.2]% and −18.4 [−19.6, −17.1]%, respectively.

Alternative sources of REE are desirable due to limited reserves of conventional REE containing minerals over the world combined with disproportionate supply over demand in the commodity markets. This study investigated the occurrence of REE and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in Cretaceous Nigerian coals for prospective industrial applications. Results show that the coals’ crystalline mineral matter comprises quartz, kaolinite, and illite with minor quantities of feldspar, hematite, magnetite, calcite, dolomite, which indicate detrital mineral origins. Elemental relationships (such as Al2O3/TiO2, Cr/Th vs. Sc/Th, and Co/Th vs. La/Sc) suggest sediment-source regions with mafic, intermediate or felsic compositions. REE are either strongly fractionated or characterized by light-enrichment along with outlook coefficient (Coutl) values that suggest the coals are prospective substitute sources for REE and yttrium (REY) recovery. Several minerals including jarosite, goethite, epsomite, ferrohexahydrite, natrojarosite, rozenite, and gypsum were detected in trace amounts. REE mineral phases were not identified but only amorphous phases containing Ce, La, Nd, Th, Pr, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and Hf. Maceral composition (high vitrinite), presence of iron-containing minerals (hematite and magnetite), high carbon contents, reduced volatile matter and low ash content favoured the formation of naturally occurring multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs) structures in Maiganga (MGA) coal. Hence, the present study is the first scientific report on the naturally occurring REEs and MWC nanophases in Cretaceous coals from the Benue Trough. © 2021","Cretaceous coal; Multi-walled carbon nanotubes; Nano-mineralogy; Nano-particles; Rare earth elements; Trace elements","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Calcite; Coal; Feldspar; Hematite; Kaolinite; Magnetite; Metal recovery; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Rare earth elements; Rare earths; Titanium dioxide; Yarn; Benue trough; Cretaceous coal; Haematite; Multi-walled-carbon-nanotubes; Nano-mineralogy; Nanoparti-cles; Naturally occurring; Prospectives; Rare-earths; Traces elements; Trace elements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111041077

This article presents findings from a National Geographic Society funded project, which employed a people-centered, narratives-based approach to study climate impacts and adaptation strategies of people in 19 rural study sites in four provinces of Pakistan (N = 108). The study looked at six climate-related stressors—changes in weather patterns, floods, Glacial Lake Outburst Floods, drought, heat waves, and sea-level rise—in the coastal areas of Sindh, the desert of Thar, the plains of Punjab, and the mountains of Hunza, Gilgit, and Chitral. Speaking to people at these frontlines of climate change revealed much about climate suffering and trauma. Not only is the suffering induced by losses and damages to property and livelihood, but climate impacts also take a heavy toll on people’s psycho-social wellbeing, particularly when they are displaced from their homes. The findings further demonstrate that people try to adapt in various ways, for instance by altering their agricultural practices, but they face severe barriers to effective adaptation action. Understanding people’s perceptions of climate change and incorporating their recommendations in adaptation planning can help policy-makers develop a more participatory, inclusive, and holistic climate resilience framework for the future. © 2021, The Author(s).","Adaptation constraints; Climate narratives; Impacts of climate change; Loss and damage; Pakistan; People-centered perspective",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116492770

In this study, LIBS was employed for qualitative and quantitative analysis of a rare mineral, astrophyllite, bearing precious elements of industrial and technological interest. The experiment was carried out using second harmonic generation of Nd:YAG laser of pulse width 5 ns and repetition rate of 10 Hz. Microplasma was produced by focusing laser beam on an astrophyllite target, and optical emissions from the generated plasma were recorded in the spectral range of 200–720 nm with the help of a LIBS2000+ detection system. On analyzing the optical spectra, existence of 15 elements in astrophyllite target were revealed. These elements include: Ti, W, Ag, Al, Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mg, Na, Ni, Si and H. For quantification, calibration-free method was used. Only ten elements, namely Ti, W, Fe, Cr, Cu, Ca, Mg, Ni, Si and Al, were quantified with relative weight concentrations of 55.39%, 18.79%, 18.30%, 4.05%, 2.66, 0.43%, 0.18%, 0.12%, 0.06% and 0.02%, respectively. To benchmark these results, XRF analysis was performed, which confirmed the presence of all the elements detected in the optical spectrum of the sample, except for Na, Li, and H. The concentrations of these ten elements as measured by XRF were in reasonable agreement, especially for the major elements. The presence of a significant amount of Ti and W in an astrophyllite sample, found in Pakistan, highlights the economic value of this mineral.

Therefore, there is a need to develop efficient cooling and heating systems that not only can reduce the power consumption but also shift load to off peak times, offer a better network stability and reducing CO2 emissions at an affordable cost. This work present a thermochemical energy storage based system for cooling and heating provision. The system uses air hydration/dehydration with evaporation cooling concept to generate both cooling and heating, and it can be cascaded to give a wide range of outlet temperature to meet different applications. A single effect and a double effect of the proposed system were numerically investigated using a MATLAB model and experimentally tested under the lab conditions. The modelling results showed that the system level coefficient of performance (COP) depends on the inlet temperature, relative humidity and the recovered energy from the discharging process. At an inlet relative humidity of 45%, the system COP increased from 1.8 to 4.4 when the inlet temperature reduced from 37 °C to 29 °C. The experimental results showed that an outlet temperature of 10–12 °C and 5 °C with an inlet temperature of 30 °C can be obtained, respectively, meaning a temperature reduction respectively by 18–20 °C and 25 °C with the single-stage and double-stage configurations.

The measurement consistency due to the use of a single electrode from a set of ERT electrodes for malfunction identification is experimentally and quantitatively investigated based on the sensor sensitivity and standard deviation criteria. Electrical current measurements are employed to develop a LabVIEW‐based process automation program by using the process‐specific knowledge and historical process data. Averaged electrical current is correlated to the mechanical failure of the stirrer through standard deviation evaluation, and slopes of the measured data are used to monitor the pump and concentrations status.

The average PM2.5 concentration was 21.1 ± 15.0 µg/m3 (range 0.7–66.8 µg/m3), with winter being the highest and summer being the lowest. The XEPOS 5 energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectroscopy was used for elemental analysis, and the US EPA PMF 5.0 program was used for source apportionment. The sources identified include fossil fuel combustion, soil dust, secondary sulphur, vehicle exhaust, road traffic, base metal/pyrometallurgical, and coal burning. Coal burning and secondary sulphur were significantly higher in winter and contributed more than 50% of PM2.5 sources. The HYSPLIT model was used to calculate the air mass trajectories (version 4.9). During the 1-year research cycle, five transportation clusters were established: North Limpopo (NLP), Eastern Inland (EI), Short-Indian Ocean (SIO), Long-Indian Ocean (LIO), and South Westerly-Atlantic Ocean (SWA). Local and transboundary origin accounted for 85%, while 15% were long-range transport. Due to various anthropogenic activities such as biomass burning and coal mining, NLP clusters were the key source of emissions adding to the city’s PM rate. In Pretoria, the main possible source regions of PM2.5 were discovered to be NLP and EI. Effective control strategies designed at reducing secondary sulphur, coal burning, and fossil fuel combustion emissions at Southern African level and local combustion sources would be an important measure to combat the reduction of ambient PM2.5 pollution in Pretoria. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air pollution; Biomass burning; Particulate matter; Source apportionment; South Africa; Transport cluster","Air pollution; Atmospheric movements; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal dust; Factorization; Fossil fuel power plants; Particles (particulate matter); Sulfur; Atmospheric particles; Biomass-burning; Coal-burning; Indian ocean; Particulate Matter; PM 2.5; Positive Matrix Factorization; Source apportionment; South Africa; Transport cluster; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; biomass burning; cluster analysis; concentration (composition); particulate matter; source apportionment; X-ray fluorescence; Gauteng; Pretoria; South Africa; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; particulate matter; South Africa; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; South Africa; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117263466

The increasing availability of high spatial and temporal resolution optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing data coupled with advanced machine learning techniques have provided an unprecedented opportunity for mapping complex wetlands’ ecosystems. A recent partnership between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) resulted in the design of the NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission. In this study, the capability of L-band simulated NISAR data for wetland mapping in Yucatan Lake, Louisiana, is investigated using two object-based machine learning approaches: Support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). L-band Unmanned Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) data are exploited as a proxy for NISAR data. Specifically, we evaluated the synergistic use of different polarimetric features for efficient delineation of wetland types, extracting 84 polarimetric features from more than 10 polarimetric decompositions. High spatial resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery is applied for image segmentation using the mean-shift algorithm. Overall accuracies of 74.33% and 81.93% obtained by SVM and RF, respectively, demonstrate the great possibility of L-band prototype NISAR data for wetland mapping and monitoring.

Using data from 28 selected African countries covering 1990 to 2019 and deploying the FGLS, PCSE, and MM-QR techniques, findings reveal, among others, that: at the 1% significance level, a percentage change in energy use leads to between 0.60% and 0.70% increase in carbon emissions, on average, ceteris paribus. Correspondingly, income shows to be a positive driver of emissions contributing between 0.87% and 0.84% percentage increase, on average, ceteris paribus. Also, per capita income attenuates the impact of energy use on emissions by between -0.27% and -0.23%, on average, ceteris paribus. However, significant heterogeneities occur across the sub-regions. Specifically, Southern Africa shows the largest energy contributor to emissions 1.65% while Central Africa contributes the most to aggravating emissions by 1.87% through increase in per capita income. West Africa shows the largest moderation effect at -0.56%. Across the quartiles, the effects of energy use and per capita are positive. Given these, we submit that the strong correlation between energy usage and per capita income (i.e. economic growth) poses a dilemma for African economies in their drive for growth. Leaving room for trade-offs. Perhaps, the lesson is that as African countries seek for more development without contributing to carbon emissions, governments should invest more in renewable energy.

Many agricultural policies were enforced in past four decades to improve nitrogen (N) use efficiency while maintaining crop yield. Inadvertent reductions of NH3 emissions, which may be induced by such policies, are not well evaluated. Here, we quantify the China's cropland-NH3 emission change from 1980 to 2050 and its response to policy interventions, using a data-driven model and a survey-based dataset of the fertilization scheme. Cropland-NH3 emission in China doubled from 1.93 to 4.02 Tg NH3-N in period 1980–1996, and then decreased to 3.50 Tg NH3-N in 2017. The prevalence of four agricultural policies may avoid ~3.0 Tg NH3-N in 2017, mainly located in highly fertilized areas. Optimization of fertilizer management and food consumption could mitigate three-quarters of NH3 emission in 2050 and lower NH3 emission intensity (emission divided by crop production) close to the European Union and the United States. Our findings provide an evidence on the decoupling of cropland-NH3 from crop production in China and suggest the need to achieve cropland-NH3 mitigation while sustaining crop yields in other developing economies. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","agricultural management; ammonia; decoupling; emission inventory; flux upscaling; policy intervention","agricultural management; agricultural policy; ammonia; crop production; emission inventory; policy approach; quantitative analysis; China; ammonia; fertilizer; China; crop production; policy; Ammonia; China; Crop Production; Fertilizers; Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113648753

The HSCPP construction is similar to the traditional solar chimney power plant (SCPP) but with the addition of water sprinklers installed at the top of the chimney. This allowed the solar chimney (SC) to operate as a cooling tower (CT) during the nighttime and operate as an SC during the daytime, hence providing a continuous 24-h operation. The results showed that the HSCPP produced ~633 MWh of electrical energy per year, compared to ~380 MWh of energy produced by the traditional SCPP. The results also showed that the HSCPP was able to produce 139,000 tons/year of freshwater, compared to 90,000 tons/year produced by the traditional SCPP. The estimated CO2 emission reduction (~600 tons/year) from the HSCPP is twice that of the traditional SCPP (~300 tons/year).

This paper deals about the carbon uptake dynamics produced by the management of unused lands as tool to help the fulfilment of international commitments on atmospheric CO2. The paper introduces a new perspective of using the unused lands around Municipalities to compensate the carbon emissions of urban contexts, according to the Sustainable Energy Action Plans as answer to climate change, already approved by the most part of Cities in Europe. The model of the carbon dynamics is based on a genetic algorithm which allows to find the sequence of operations on the unused land in space (portions of the land) and time (rotation of cuts and plantations) to ensure the reaching of a given outcome in terms of carbon captured. The algorithm, therefore, behaves as design support of land management, enriching the literature available for the sector. The paper identifies two possible original scenarios of storing carbon referred as “emergency” and “constant rate”; the first produces after fifty years a maximum carbon uptake of the order of 100 tC/ha while the second a maximum uptake rate of the order of 2 tC/(year ha), after an initial start-up period of 40–50 years. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon uptake; Reforestation; SEAPs; SECAPs; Sustainability; Unused lands","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Dynamics; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Reforestation; Sustainable development; Action plan; Atmospheric CO$-2$; Carbon dynamics; Carbon emissions; Carbon uptake; SEAP; SECAP; Sustainable energy; Unused land; Urban context; Carbon; absorption; action plan; biological uptake; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; genetic algorithm; greenhouse gas; land management; sustainability; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109069557

Emissions were estimated for 2019 base case (2019-BC) and projected for 2030 under the ‘do nothing’ scenario (2030-DNS) and five scenarios: fuel subsidy removal (2030-FSR), road expansions (2030-RE), public transport improvements (2030-PTI), inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs (2030-I/MP), and fuel enhancements (2030-FE). The 2030-FSR would reduce emissions by 11.2% versus 2030-DNS. The 2030-RE resulted in an average increase of 37% in emissions compared with 2030-DNS since it induces more traffic. The 2030-PTI provides alternatives to car travel; hence, cars result in an average drop of 32.8% for all emission types compared with 2030-DNS. The 2030-I/MP exhibited reductions in PM10 and toxic pollutants, of 35–54.8% compared with 2030-DNS. The 2030-FE reduced SOx, benzene and N2 O emissions by 91.8%, 81% and 39.1%, respectively, compared with 2030-DNS.

The approach was based on the Logarithmic Mean Divisa Index (LMDI) and the Tapio approach, built on Kaya extended identity. Five decoupling indicators were considered based on the four energy carriers consumed in the NTPS. The indicators include economic activity, energy structure, economic structure, population and energy intensity. The results identified three decoupling states, weak negative decoupling, weak decoupling and strong decoupling. The energy intensity, economic activity, population and energy structure prevented decoupling during the study period, while the economic structure factor promoted decoupling.
