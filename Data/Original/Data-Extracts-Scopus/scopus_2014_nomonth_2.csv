They include corresponding states techniques and component-specific correlations, as well as statistical thermodynamics approaches. However, the science for describing mixtures has consistently trailed behind, often being limited to ideal mixing or similar formulations. For example, the mixing rules (typically implemented in process simulators) for liquid viscosity and thermal conductivity, are the Kendall-Monroe and Li correlations, respectively. While the attractive feature of such mixing rules is that they do not require interaction parameters (IP's), their downside is that the do not allow IP's, even when appropriate. In many applications, they incorrectly predict only a small deviation from ideal mixing, often with incorrect sign. Thus, while these mixing rules perform reasonably for hydrocarbon systems, their efficacy for non-ideal systems is questionable. The state-of-the-art is the Redlich-Kister correlation (RKC), which can incorporate additional higher-order terms to improve the fit of data with higher precision. It is often the correlation of choice for the applied thermodynamics research community, and has been successfully applied to precisely correlate a variety of thermophysical properties for binary mixtures. However, the RK correlation does not naturally extend to multi-component systems. This investigation draws upon the exact mathematics of mixing rules established for virial coefficients of gases. Perturbations from ideal mixing are modeled akin to successive terms in the virial expansion, resulting in the name ""Virial-Based Mixing Rules"" (VBMR). Each perturbation reduces to zero for pure components, and adopts the composition order of the corresponding virial coefficient it represents. For example, the first perturbation represents the second virial coefficient and implements a quadratic mixing rule, while allowing one adjustable binary interaction parameter. The next term employs cubic mixing and allows multiple interaction parameters, including a ternary interaction parameter which may be fine-tuned for ternary and higher mixtures. All interaction parameters are initialized to zero. Applying the VBMR methodology, Sen and co-workers have recently demonstrated excellent results for the correlation of several thermophysical properties for a number of binary liquid mixtures, including density, enthalpy, and viscosity. In this investigation, the VBMR methodology is extended to ternary (and multicomponent systems), yielding non-zero ternary (and higher-order) interaction parameters accounting for three-body interations, without compromising the goodness-of-fit for binary constituents. Comparisions are made with RKC, emphasizing how the VBMR naturally extends to multicomponent systems, while the RKC does not. The VBMR model separates the temperature dependence of pure component and interaction parameters. This is postulated as a key reason for the smooth as well as weak temperature dependence of the interaction parameters. By contract, the temperature dependence of model parameters for the RKC is often siginifcantly jagged. This investigation implements and demonstrates the smotth temperature dependence for several binary and multicomponent mixtures. Copyright © American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

As such, this is a ""missed opportunity to tackle Europe's most pressing environmental challenges"", according to EBB. The EBB is concerned that if targets post-2020 are unconfirmed, investments for biofuels will cease, putting ∼ 200,000 related jobs at risk.

The overlapping development of large-scale coal conversion industries with existing oil and gas industries in the Ordos Basin, Northern Shaanxi Province has created a unique opportunity to apply a systematic approach to an energy/environmental protection development strategy: The integration of geological CO2 storage and enhanced oil recovery utilizing CO2 flooding (CO2 EOR) and geological storage that has been developed in Wyoming. The coal conversion industry in the Ordos Basin (i.e., coal-to-methanol, coal-to-olefins, etc.) provides affordable, captureready CO2 sources for developing large-scale CO2 EOR and CO2 storage projects in the Ordos Basin, China. Currently, over 40 Mt of highly concentrated CO2 (&gt; 95%) are being captured and vented from the methanol plants. Compared with other CCS projects, the ability to use CO2 from the coal-conversion industry for CO2 EOR and geological CO2 storage will make these CCUS projects in the Ordos Basin more cost effective, technologically efficient, and environmentally sound. Supported by US-China Clean Energy Research Center, Shaanxi Provincial Government, and Yanchang Petroleum Group Company, the University of Wyoming, Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Energy Resources and Chemical Engineering, and Research Institute of Yanchang Petroleum (Group) Company have developed a CO2 enhanced oil recovery demonstration project that includes geological CO2 storage in a mature, depleted oil field located in the Northern Shaanxi Province, Ordos Basin. Various scenarios for enhanced oil recovery using CO2 flooding integrated with geological CO2 storage are being simulated and optimized. The results of the reservoir characterization and CO2 flooding simulation show that integrating CO2 EOR with geological COv storage is a viable way to reduce CO2 emission in the region. © 2014 The Authors.

The photoreduction experiments were conducted through five experimental cycles. The results demonstrated that the activity of the CZT-ONC decreased by increasing the number of testing cycle. The causes for declining the activity of the CZT-ONC catalyst was studied by investigating the surface condition of the catalyst before and after used by mean X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and field emission-scanning electron spectroscopy (FE-SEM) techniques and the results are discussed. It was found that the surface conditions (chemical state of the elements and morphology) of the CZT- ONC catalyst have been critically altered.

The human range expansion of this cypress has taken place at the Northern margin of the range in Italy in recent decades, driven by ornamental planting in spite of climatic constraints imposed by low temperature. The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of low temperature in cypress in a nursery of the Autonomous Province of Trento (North-Eastern Italy). Over a period of two and half years, maximum quantum use efficiency of photosystem II (FV/FM) was monitored in order to study the effects of air temperature on the photosynthetic efficiency of 99 different clones and to derive information about the potential distribution of cypress in this province. A significant positive correlation (r = 0.64, p &lt; 0.001) was found between air temperature and FV/FM over the 29- month period and especially in spring and autumn. Minimum values of FV/FM were observed in winter. Moreover, in order to assess critical environmental factors for cypress, mean values of FV/FM were correlated with daily air temperature and temperature-based indices to identify the driving factors of the physiological changes along the annual cycle. The maximum value of correlation (r = -0.85, p &lt; 0.001) was found with 10-day Cold Degree-Day Running Sums before sampling and with a threshold of 2.0 °C for daily minimum air temperature.","Chlorophyll fluorescence; Climate change; Cold tolerance; Conifer adaptation; Conifer planting; Cupressaceae; Low temperature","Coniferophyta; Cupressaceae; Cupressus; Cupressus sempervirens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902281051

Urban land covers as the biophysical state of the earth's surface and immediate subsurface are sources and sinks for most of the material and energy movements and interactions between the geosphere and biosphere. Climate change is considered to be the biggest environmental threat in the future in the South-Eastern part of Europe. The aim of this paper is to investigate the influences of urban growth on urban thermal environment as well as the relationships of thermal characteristics to other biophysical parameters in Bucharest metropolitan area of Romania based on time series MODIS Terra/Aqua and IKONOS data acquired during 2000-2014 periods. Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable for studying urban land surface processes and surface atmosphere interactions, being a crucial component in the study of the surface energy and water budgets. Urbanization created an evolved inverse relationship between impervious and vegetation coverage, and brought about new LST patterns because of LST's correlations with both impervious and vegetation coverage. City thermal environment risk management strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change must propose efficient plans to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and cool the city through changes in the built environment, land use, and transportation. © 2014 SPIE.","Bucharest; Land Surface Temperature; Romania; Satellite remote sensing; Urban Heat Island; Urban thermal environment; Urbanization and climate impacts","Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric temperature; Budget control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Landforms; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Risk management; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Urban growth; Vegetation; Bucharest; Climate impacts; Land surface temperature; Romania; Satellite remote sensing; Urban heat island; Urban thermal environment; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923079835

In order to increase capacity and reduce costs, new offshore wind farms will use larger and more complex technology that goes beyond current understanding and experience. As a result, predicting the technical performance of offshore wind farms involves a considerable amount of uncertainty, especially during early life when teething problems may arise. We present a model that allows us to distinguish between natural variability and state-of-knowledge uncertainty when assessing the growth in technical performance of offshore wind farms over early operational life. As such, the model can be used to inform decisions to reduce uncertainties and to support effective risk management. To describe wind farm performance, we use an indicator we call availability-informed capability measures the capacity of the farm to generate electricity. We use an example based on a two-phase Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate the use of the model. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London..",,"Electric utilities; Monte Carlo methods; Offshore wind farms; Reliability; Risk management; Example based; Generate electricity; Natural variability; Offshore winds; Operational life; Reduce costs; Technical performance; Uncertainty simulations; Uncertainty analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900021584

In recent years, the efforts of regulators, ship operators, and port authorities have led to actions for ship emissions reduction to improve shipping's environmental performance. This work builds on an activity-based methodology that allows the estimation of emissions and examines environmental effects of slow steaming, fuel regulations, near-port speed-reduction schemes, and cold ironing. Pollutant emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and black carbon are modeled. A linear programming model minimizes fuel consumption through speed differentiation on a shipping line's routes based on fuel costs and binding regulations in each segment of the journey. Although the examined emissions-reduction actions may have a positive regional environmental effect by cutting emissions, it Is possible that additional emissions arc generated elsewhere because of increased sailing speeds beyond regulated areas. Trade-offs between pollutants are observed for reduction actions that may have a positive effect on some emission species but at the same time result in additional particulate matter and black carbon emissions. The presented framework allows key actors to conduct comprehensive studies and design improved emissions reduction actions with fewer negative impacts in other areas.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Linear programming; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Pollution; Ships; Sulfur dioxide; Binding regulation; Black carbon emission; Emissions reduction; Environmental balance; Environmental performance; Linear programming models; Pollutant emission; Shipping activities; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954508324

Using a collaborative framework to support catchment-scale water quality monitoring, control and management (WQMCM), individual sub-networks can learn and predict the impact of catchment events on their locality[1], allowing dynamic decision making for local irrigation strategies. Since resource constraints on network nodes (e.g. battery life, computing power etc) require a simplified predictive model, low-dimensional model parameters are derived from the existing National Resource Conservation Method (NRCS). An M5 decision tree algorithm is then used to develop predictive models for total discharge volume (Q), response start and duration (t1 &amp; td). Evaluation of these models demonstrates high accuracy (84-94%) even for a small training set of under 100 samples for Q and td.

However, while drilling an exploration well, formation evaluation revealed the existence of hydrocarbons in a shallower horizon (Albian) which was not known to be hydrocarbon bearing in the Dunga area. This raised a need to further appraise the accumulation and reduce geological uncertainties. In this paper we discuss the unique properties and uncertainties that will affect future development of the Albian reservoir, and present results from a detailed wireline logging program, fluids pressurevolume- temperature properties, and extended well testing results to evaluate the hydrocarbon find in order to reduce those uncertainties. Conventional interpretation of petrophysical logs was complemented by wireline formation testing (WFT) pressure data and formation fluid samples. The laboratory analysis of hydrocarbon samples is compared to real time downhole optical analysis of formation fluids. Additionally, pressure transient analysis (PTA) from WFT was compared to conventional PTA results from DST completed well testing, in order to help understand the vertical permeability profile. We also propose additional future work to complement the work presented in this paper by suggesting a vertical interference test and well-to-well data evaluation. All these studies will help to answer key decisions on developing an Albian reservoir which has no analog in this region.

What could the potential contribution of end-use technology and other key clean electric energy technologies such as CCS, Nuclear power, wind & solar, and biomass be? This paper presents simulation results from an Integrated Assessment Model that suggest that, in the absence of policy measures, even under the most optimistic state of technology development and deployment scenarios, the U.S. energy system would still be dominated by fossil fuels and GHG emissions would increase significantly between 2010 and 2050. A pessimistic scenario in end-use technology would result in increased electric and non-electric energy use and GHG emissions compared to the advanced technology scenario, while a pessimistic scenario in any one of the four clean technologies examined would result in reduced electric and non-electric energy use and a small increase in GHG emissions. However, if all technologies are in pessimistic status, GHG emissions would increase significantly as more fossil fuels would be used in the energy system. Technology alone cannot achieve the abatement levels required. A market-based policy targeting the reduction of U.S. GHG emissions to 50% below 2005 levels by 2050 would result in dramatic decrease in coal-fired generation. With abatement policies in place, favorable technology scenarios reduce abatement costs and facilitate the energy system transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. © 2014 by the IAEE.

In particular, the Ni-MH power system has a proper tolerance mechanism for overcharge and overdischarge, a lower cost for battery pack maintenance, and a slightly longer cycle lifetime profile. We studied the self-discharge characteristics, state-of-health, state-of-charge, and energy efficiencies at various charge input levels. The end-of-voltages during charge and discharge were evaluated for the Ni- MH storage batteries. The impedance measurements and data analysis have also been conducted for equivalent circuit simulations. The performance deterioration and capacity decay are fundamentally analyzed and discussed in details, including electrode sidereactions, structure degradations, separator weakening, and level changes of electrolyte saturation in the battery.

In the present report, DeST-h software was adopted to investigate the energy saving model, which can save 75% energy cost, used in 6-floor housing in Beijing. The heat transfer coefficient (K) was calculated to be 0.40 W m-2 K-1, which means it can save about 42.31 kW h-1 m-2 per square meter. Based on these calculations, it was found that 17.09 kg coal can be saved per square meter area in the building, resulting in reducing 42.19 kg carbon dioxide (CO2), 1.27 kg sulfur dioxide (SO2), 0.635 kg nitrogen oxide (NOx), 11.5 kg coal powder dust and 5.75 kg coal smoke dust emission per square meter area in the building. These reductions generate -36.66 RMB profit per square meter area in building. In addition, the total energy savings of the four common thermal insulate materials (rock wool, XPS, EPS and Polyurethane) in 50 years was respectively calculated to be 6.55×106, 6.63×106, 6.58×106, 6.77× 106kJ/ m2 based the theory of LCA. Furthermore, the energy consumption proportion differs at different stage. The largest one is operation energy consumption and followed by production energy consumption and transportation energy consumption. In addition, the total capital payback period of thermal insulator materials, environmental benefits and energy saving of these four kinds of materials are also different from each other. The longest capital payback period is found to be polyurethane and followed by XPX and EPS, and the shortest one is rock wool.

As a high-quality, small radius electron beam plays a crucial role in an effective beam-wave interaction, a high-convergence electron optics system is required for an 11.424 GHz high-impedance relativistic klystron, with an output power of 105MW. In the design, to alleviate the cathode loading due to high-convergence, the uniformity of the cathode emittance and the laminarity of beam are both sacrificed. Then serious space charge effect is likely to occur with a rather high current density. To minimize the scalloping, it is difficult to provide the best overlap of the beam trajectories and magnetic force lines with priority to the amplitude of magnetic flux at the cathode. With the synthesis of Pierce's electron gun and the cylindrical focusing electrode, a particle in cell model of the electron gun is constructed to obtain the electrostatic characteristics of the electron beam. Based on the electrostatic beam trajectories, a beam-focusing system is designed, with which electron beam can be well focused by adjusting the magnetic field profile especially in the transient region. The PIC simulation results indicate that the balance radius of the reasonably fluctuated beam is about 3mm ,with a fine laminarity, and the transmission, the perveance and the area convergenceare 100%, 0.9 μP and 97: 1 respectively, which satisfy the requirement of the 11.424 GHz high-impedance relativistic klystron. Moreover, with the comparison between thermionic emission and explosive emission in PIC code, the micro-characteristics of beam shows the latter is tend to be more reliable.",,"Cathodes; Electrodes; Electron beams; Electron guns; Electrons; Electrostatics; Klystrons; Magnetic fields; Thermionic emission; Electron optics system; Electrostatic characteristics; Explosive emissions; High current densities; High power microwaves; Magnetic field profile; Relativistic klystron; Space charge effects; Electron optics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911165258

In our research, MoS2 is firstly modified with ferrocene (Fe-MoS 2) on a large scale and then is used as a nanofiller to prepare PS composites by a masterbatch-based melt blending method. The aim of our present study is to study the synergistic effect of ferrocene and MoS2 on the thermal stability, fire resistance and smoke suppression properties of the PS composites. It was found that the thermal stability of the PS composite was obviously enhanced upon the introduction of 3.0 wt% Fe-MoS2. The cone test results indicated that the PS/Fe-MoS2 composites exhibited superior flame retardance to PS/MoS2 and PS/ferrocene composites. Furthermore, the addition of Fe-MoS2 could improve the smoke suppression properties of PS composites, as evidenced by the reduction of the carbon monoxide production rate and smoke production rate (SPR). The total flammable gaseous products from the PS composites were decreased which further led to the inhibition of smoke.

Municipal solid waste management was a typical complex system combines social-economic- natural factors. Municipal solid waste management was effected by managing mechanism, technical level and environmental conscious of inhabitants. Municipal solid waste run through the urban metabolism processes of production, consumption, logistics and recycling, and even more, waste has a close relationship of natural environmental such as water body, soil, air, biology and mines. In this paper, we reviewed the literatures about municipal solid waste emission, transfer, and dump of carbon, heavy metal, energy and nutrients in the framework of urban ecological metabolism, and gave the important researching directions and contents in this area. Main findings were: 1) Carbon metabolism of municipal solid waste was important in the researches of urban carbon cycle, current researches were focus on the carbon emission regulation of waste treatment, comparison studies on carbon emission between different cities, carbon emission and transfer inside the cities, carbon detecting and accounting of solid waste and waste management for low carbon emissions. 2) Heavy metal metabolism was paid attentions by researchers, current researches were focus on the inputs and outputs of heavy metals through urban metabolism, source analysis of heavy metals in different municipal solid wastes, transferring and migrating of different heavy metals through different treating and disposing processes, migrating of heavy metal in soil-plant system brought from waste compost, and impacts to heavy metal metabolism by different collection separating and transporting system. 3) Nutrients and energy metabolism of municipal solid waste were reported less than carbon and heavy metals. Inputs, output and the balance of typical nutrients, such us nitrogen and phosphorus, were studied, and nutrients metabolism from municipal solid waste were important substrate flows in the process of urban metabolism. Energy indicators such as emergy and exergy were introduced to analyze the systemic metabolism efficiency of different municipal solid waste treatment and management systems. Based on the review of current researches, some important researching areas has been putting forward: 1) metabolism of municipal solid waste based on the rural-urban geographic and season differences, these researches could promote the progress on researching geography-ecology processes of urban ecological systems; 2) producing, transferring and fate models of carbon, heavy metals, nutrients and energy metabolism, and typical Chinese parameters for accounting and simulating the urban metabolism of municipal solid waste, these researches could promote the systemic and comparing studies of different waste metabolism systems; 3) experimental researches on key processes for carbon, heavy metals, nutrients and energy metabolism of municipal solid waste, for example, the deposit, transfer and emission processes of carbon cycle through collecting, separating, transporting and treating of municipal solid waste; and the quantitative studies on the heavy metals transferring processes impacting by different waste components, environmental temperature, pH value. The researches of energy transfer, material cycling and metabolism efficiency of municipal solid waste managing system could give scientific basis of assessment, planning, engineering and management of urban municipal solid waste management systems.","Carbon emission; Heavy metals; Municipal solid waste; Urban metabolism","carbon cycle; carbon emission; compost; heavy metal; literature review; metabolism; municipal solid waste; nitrogen; phosphorus; recycling; soil-vegetation interaction; substrate; town planning; urban ecosystem; waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893016677

The appearance of additional volumes of oil and gas in the Caspian and Central Asian countries has made it important to find ways to deliver them to the foreign markets, turning energy and transportation-communication factors into one of the top  riorities in regional development. The history of current pipeline projects in the Caspian Region and Central Asia is compelling the regional states to exert efforts to reduce Russia’s transportation- communication domination. The Caspian and Central Asian countries that pin their hopes on oil and gas as a way to confirm their independence and expand their cooperation with Western states are focusing priority attention on overcoming their dependence on Russia and diversifying pipeline routes. This has caused a shift in accents toward hydrocarbon resources in foreign policy, including in pipeline  transportation. In addition to the plans for building gas and oil pipelines, geographical considerations are making significant corrections to the implementation of pipeline projects. In the 1990s, large-scale pipeline projectscould only be carried out in the Caspian Region with the active participation of the Black Sea countries, which acted as an energy bridge for delivering hydrocarbon resources from the Caspian fields. The pipeline projects eventually gave rise to the Black Sea-Caspian link, which became a backbone for the new international relations forming and served as a foundation for joining the two regions into a unified geopolitical area.1As new projects for delivering hydrocarbon resources from the Central Asian countries through the Caspian Sea appeared, the term “Caspian-Central Asian region” came into scientific circulation, reflecting the growing interconnection and interaction of the two regions in implementing pipeline projects. In recent years, pipeline projects in the Caspian and Central Asia countries have been acquiring increasing importance. As new data about oil and gas reserves appear and industrial production begins, interest in export pipelines is increasing, attracting the attention not only of the Caspian and Central Asian countries, but also of foreign states and leading oil and gas companies. This situation means that the competition among export routes will remain intense.This article examines the results of implementing pipeline projects in the Caspian Region and Central Asia and analyzes the factors hindering the building of export routes. It focuses particular attention on the geopolitical struggle that is largely generated by pipeline competition.","Caspian Region; Central Asia; Energy policy; Gas; Oil; Pipelines",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923347647

Our objective is to explore the relative influence of environment and phylogenic background on variations in plant functional traits in the Yanhe River catchment, Shaanxi, China. The goal is to provide helpful information related to understanding the mechanisms and interactions influencing plant adaptation as they relate to environmental factors. This study measured six leaf traits and three fine root traits of 107 species belonging to 35 families in 31 sample plots in three vegetation zones (forest, forest-steppe, steppe) on the Loess Plateau. One-way ANOVA was used to describe the variation among three vegetation zones and plant families. We then used redundancy analysis (RDA) to analyze the relationships between plant functional traits and meteorological factors. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to detect important relationships between plant functional traits and plant families. Finally, we used a General Line Model (GLM) to evaluate the relative contribution of environmental factors and plant phylogenic background to variations in plant functional traits. The results show: (1) There were no significant differences in leaf nitrogen concentration per mass (LN) and fine root nitrogen concentration per mass (RN), but significant differences were found in leaf thickness (LT), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf tissue density (LTD), leaf phosphorus concentration per mass (LP), the ratio of leaf nitrogen concentration per mass and leaf phosphorus concentration per mass (LN:LP), specific root length (SRL), fine root tissue density (RTD)between the three vegetation zones. The values of these various parameters increased from the south to the north as climatic aridity intensified, plants adjusted plant functional traits to adapt to different environmental conditions. Plants in the forest zone had higher competitive ability with more rapid leaf growth rates and with roots having a higher resistance to stress and damage. Plants in the forest-steppe zone had higher root growth rates and had leaves with greater resistance to stress and damage. (2) Plants from different plant families used different strategies to adapt to environment; that is different species perform differently when provided with the same resources and environmental gradients; for example, leaf nitrogen concentration per mass and root nitrogen concentration per mass of Leguminosae was far greater than that of other families, but the nutrient absorption efficiency of species in the Leguminosae was not high. (3) Average annual precipitation and the mean temperature of the warmest month were two main factors which had significant effects on variations in traits along environmental gradients in the area; for example, 16.26% of the observed variance in SLA can be explained by average annual precipitation and 4.02% can be explained by plant family. The explained variance of plant functional traits varied as those same functional traits varied and there were obvious environmental screening effects in the process of the formation of plant communities in the Yanhe River watershed. Six traits, LT, SLA, LTD, LP, SRL, and RTD were sensitive to climatic aridity at the species level; the spatial variation was caused primarily by environmental differences. In conclusion, environmental heterogeneity must be considered during vegetative restoration on the Loess Plateau.","Environmental factors; Phylogenic background; Plant functional traits; Yanhe River catchment","annual variation; environmental factor; fine root; functional change; leaf; phylogenetics; plant community; precipitation (climatology); China; Shaanxi; Yanhe Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901808516

How fast such molecules can move in the crowded protein environment of live issue is, however, poorly understood. To enable the monitoring of molecular mobility on the nanoscale in situ, we have combined two-photon excitation microscopy and patch-clamp electrophysiology with time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy imaging (TRFAIM) in acute brain slices. TRFAIM exploits the fact that most fluorophores emit in the same polarization plane as that of excitation, with respect to the molecular structure. Because excitation and emission are separated by a nanosecond-range delay, the plane of emission diverges from that of excitation depending on the speed of molecular movements in space. We show that this methodology can be successfully adapted to two-dimensional mapping of diffusion rates inside and outside microscopic cellular compartments representing synaptic connections in the brain. This approach has a potential to unveil poorly understood determinants of diffusion-limited reactions and local molecular signal exchange underlying the functioning of central neural circuits. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Brain slices; Fluorescence anisotropy; Fluorescent lifetime imaging; Microviscosity; Molecular mobility; Nanoscopic diffusion; Synaptic connections; Two-photon excitation imaging","adult; analytical equipment; animal tissue; anisotropy; article; birefringence; bleaching; brain slice; calibration; confocal laser scanning microscope; detector; diffusion; equipment design; fluorescence imaging; fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; hippocampus; image processing; image quality; intermethod comparison; light scattering; nanoimaging; neurotransmission; nonhuman; optical filter; priority journal; rat; synapse; three dimensional imaging; time resolved fluorescence anisotropy imaging; young adult; anisotropy; Article; brain slice; chemical structure; connectome; controlled study; intracellular space; methodology; molecular movement; monitoring; motion; multiphoton microscopy; nerve cell network; neuroimaging; patch clamp technique; signal transduction; two photon excitation microscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958531201

A set of comparisons show that the developed reaction mechanism can accurately predict methane conversion and the trend of products yield in different operating conditions. Using the developed reaction mechanism in plasma-assisted kinetic model, the reaction path flux analysis was carried out. The result shows that CH3 recombination is the limiting reaction for CO production and O is the critical species for CO production.

In the Copenhagen General Assembly of 2009, it has become the focus issue attracting the attention from various countries in the world how to reduce carbon emission. As one of economic powers, China yet becomes a large environmental polluter. According to the calculation of World Bank, during two decades from 1980 to 2000, China has generated 14% contribution rate to the world GDP in terms of its economic growth. However, China also pays a high price in resource consumption, high energy consumption and environmental destruction for this. As is pointed in Environmental Green Book of 2007,there were about 75% of waters in Chinese lakes suffering significant pollution and the contamination rate of urban waters reached as high as over 90%, hence causing more than 300 cities in China suffer water shortage. At present, China has become the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the globe and the loss that environmental pollution engenders to national economy holds about 10% in GDP. And the area of cultivated land in China also decreases at the speed of about 1.6 million hectares per year, hence with severe land degradation and water and soil erosion phenomena. According to another statistic report, Chinese GDP in 2004 held appropriately 4% in the globe but the consumed primary energy took up almost 12 percent of the globe, with fresh water holding 15 percent, aluminum oxide 25 percent, rolled steel 28 percent and cement 50%. In a word, the extensive economic growth pattern/mode has forced China to face serious resource and energy crises. Due to a series of negative effects brought about by environmental pollution and various inconveniences caused to life, consumers are also motivated to pay more and more attention to the environmental problems engendered by random disposability after products are used. As a result, the design and production of green products and energy conservation in production process become particularly important,and various greenproducts has become more and more common in market, making green energy conservation and environmental protection have become the starting point for peopleto go shopping. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Countermeasure; Green marketing; Low carbon","Countermeasure; Ecological environments; Environmental destruction; Environmental pollutions; Environmental problems; Green marketing; High energy consumption; Low carbon; Commerce; Disposability; Earth (planet); Economics; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Marketing; Product design; Testing; Water pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891538128

The other is a large amount of water consumption for the evaporation of the solution in the absorber and desorber. In this paper we propose an integrated system to reduce the steam extraction from turbine and to produce freshwater by using solar thermal energy. The new system produces more electricity and freshwater during the daytime, and uses the steam extraction to reduce CO2 emissions at night. A techno-economic feasibility study is performed as a case study for a 300 MWe coal-fired power plant assisted by solar desalination. As for the potential impact parameters, the local climatic conditions and CO2 capture rate are discussed.

Accurate knowledge of SOC stocks and the effects of environmental factors on SOC are crucial, both from the perspective of regional carbon budgets and appropriate landscape management of SOC. The Muyu small watershed and the Ansai catchment in loess hilly-gully area were taken as study area in the paper. On the basis of soil sampling in the field, 35 and 79 samples were taken separately in Muyu small watershed and Ansai catchment. Classical statistics and RDA were applied to study on the relationship of the distribution of SOC, soil organic carbon density (SOCD) with land use and environmental factors at two different scales. The research results were as follows. The effects of land use type on SOC and SOCD had significant difference at two scales. SOC varied with land use in the order: grass land > woodland > shrubland > farmland at the Muyu small watershed. And the order was woodland > shrubland > farmland > grassland at the Ansai catchment. Meanwhile, the SOCD was highest in the grassland and declined as follows: grassland > woodland > farmland > shrubland at the Muyu small watershed, and it was highest in the woodland and declined as: woodland > farmland > grassland > shrubland at the Ansai catchment. SOC and SOCD showed scale effects under different influence of land use. The main land use at the Muyu watershed was grassland. The soil physical and chemical properties were good enough to protect the soil and water. Thus the SOC and SOCD were both higher than other land use, which was different from that at the Ansai catchment. There were a lot of woodland and shrubland at the Ansai catchment. Since woodland was the optimal land use type to keep soil and water, and the SOC and SOCD were much higher in woodland at the catchment. Also since changes in land use had influences on physical, chemical and biological soil attributes, they changed SOC and SOCD by disturbing the equilibrium between the formation and mineralization of soil organic matter. The land use change played different roles in affecting SOC and SOCD at different scales. Then we chose slope, slope position, slope aspect, altitude, vegetational cover and land use as environmental factors. Among them, aspect, slope and vegetational cover were positively related to the SOC and SOCD at both the Muyu watershed and the Ansai catchment. Altitude, slope position and land use were negatively related to SOC at the Muyu watershed while they were positively related to SOC at the Ansai catchment. Altitude and land use were negatively related to SOCD at two scales. Slope position was negatively related to SOCD at the Muyu watershed, and positively at the Ansai catchment. The influences of environmental factors were varies: slope aspect, slope and slope position decided the migration direction and speed of material, altitude affected the vertical distribution of the hydrothermal conditions, and vegetational coverage, with land use, reflected the input and output of soil organic carbon. But since different geographical conditions, the influences of those environmental factors were complex.","Environmental factors; Land use; Scale effect; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic carbon density","carbon budget; catchment; environmental factor; gully; hill; land use change; organic carbon; physicochemical property; scale effect; slope angle; soil organic matter; spatial distribution; vegetation cover; China; Shaanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897867027

Permeability evolution law of unloaded coal samples and the influence mechanism of loading rates on that were studied. The results of triaxial unloading experiments indicate that the permeability of coal samples increases throughout the whole testing process without a descent stage, which is different from the permeability evolution law in conventional triaxial compression tests.

Genetic Algorithm (GA) was applied to search the optimal solution of the proposed model. During the search process, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based analytical model and microscopic traffic simulation VISSIM were applied to evaluate the performance of possible solutions. The proposed model can be used to determine the deployment of dynamic speed limits, the displayed speed limit, and the timing to change these speed limits. The proposed model was tested using VISSIM in an urban freeway network of about 12 miles long. Different simulation scenarios with varying AADT from 60,000 to 12,000 were tested. It was found that when properly implemented, dynamic speed control can improve traffic flow conditions, reduce congestion and emission, and enhance network throughput. For example, in the selected urban freeway network with the AADT of 80,000, the proposed dynamic speed control strategy can save 5% average travel time, reduce 9% of the vehicles with high collision risk and about 11% emission. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Dynamic speed limit; Genetic algorithm; Optimization; Speed harmonization","Computational fluid dynamics; Dynamics; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Speed; Speed control; Street traffic control; Traffic congestion; Traffic control; Travel time; Average travel time; Collision risks; Control strategies; Dynamic speed; Microscopic traffic simulation; Network throughput; Optimal solutions; Optimization modeling; Dynamic models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920840224

The glacial landforms on the QTP provide a unique perspective for its climate change. In order to investigate the onset of the last deglaciation at the QTP and its regional correlation, the terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (TCN) 10Be and 26Al surface exposure dating was chosen to date the roche moutonnée, the polished surface and the moraine debris located at the palaeo-Daocheng Ice Cap (p-DIC), southeastern QTP. Our results show that the onset of the last deglaciation is at about 19 ka, followed by another warming event occurring around 15 ka in the p-DIC area. These timings agree well with other records, e.g. equivalent with a rapid sea level rise at 19 ka and the onset of Bølling warming event at about 15 ka. Thus, our new data can provide good reveal constraint on the climate evolution at the QTP. © 2014 Geological Society of China.","Last Deglaciation; Palaeo-Daocheng Ice Cap; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau; Terrestrial Cosmogenic Nuclides","Bolling; climate variation; cosmogenic radionuclide; global change; ice cap; last deglaciation; moraine; paleoclimate; sea level change; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940042962

Meanwhile, it is supposed to be cost-effective to jointly reduce China's carbon emissions through some collaborative activities among regions. Then a natural question is how to allocate the quotas among regions in light of the collaboration. For this purpose, the Shapley value method is adopted and the results show that, first, the regions with higher GDP, higher carbon outflow and higher carbon reduction connection should be allocated more carbon quotas. Moreover, when the collaboration is considered, the optimal allocation of carbon quotas among regions will change significantly compared to the basic quotas by the entropy method; and the Central region is allocated the largest proportion of carbon quota among regions, which indicates its largest radiation effect. Besides, the collaboration between the Central region and Northern coast region, and that between the Central region and the Eastern region should be paid close attention.

In this work, an online coupled meteorology-chemistry model, WRF/Chem, is applied to simulate air quality and climate interactions for multiple months in 2001, 2005, and 2008 to characterize long-term seasonal variations of pollutant concentrations and quantify the contributions of anthropogenic aerosols to aerosol direct and indirect effects. The results show a reasonably good performance for most meteorological variables and chemical species concentrations. Large biases in some variables may be caused by large uncertainties in emissions. Anthropogenic aerosols in East Asia can reduce the surface net solar radiation by up to 6 % and enhance cloud condensation nuclei and cloud droplet number concentrations by a factor of up to 3 on domain-average, with much greater impacts over urban areas.

The scarcity within the global emission budget and the interpretation of climate change as 'global public goods' have led climate change negotiations into a burden-sharing deadlock. However, some recent economics studies suggest that mitigation could actually promote local economic growth opportunities; consequently increasing the incentives for unilateral mitigation actions. This article highlights the implications for the strategies of unlocking the climate negotiations deadlock. Following an explanation of how climate change negotiations have led to a burden-sharing game and have become a deadlock, some new ways of thinking (based on the emerging literature) are used to suggest how mitigation could promote local economic growth.Policy relevanceOne policy implication is the need to change the current mindset in global climate change negotiations. The current framing of burden-sharing can be abandoned in favour of opportunity-sharing. This more positive approach will stimulate progress on climate action. Therefore, green growth should be situated at the heart of post-2020 climate change regime. A new two-track architecture is proposed for achieving the transformation as a combined top-down and bottom-up approach. A lower legally binding target based on equity principles of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) could form a more politically realistic and inclusive basis for participation. To complement this, a green growth club would promote a higher voluntary global ambition and accelerate mitigation. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","climate negotiations; green growth; low-carbon transition; mitigation; post-2020 climate regime","bottom-up approach; climate change; economic growth; environmental economics; environmental policy; mitigation; negotiation process; participatory approach; top-down approach; voluntary approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890572314

Therefore, many countries have set targets for EV development in recent years and have employed a number of policies to achieve environmental objectives and alleviate the energy pressure. Despite the fact that the adoption of EVs has increased in the past few years, more policies, such as financial incentives, technology support or charging infrastructure, should be made by governments to promote broader range use of EVs. In this paper, we review the relevant policies that different countries may adopt for stimulating the market of EVs. Based on this, we analyze the relationship between the policies and the adoption of EVs by taking America as an example. In conclusion, some effective policies are summarized to spur the market.

This study involved prediction of the annual fossil-fuel energy saving, investment return period and carbon emission reduction of the new system against the traditional gas-fired and electrical boilers based water heating systems. An established dynamic model developed by the authors was utilised to predict the system's energy performance throughout a year in the three climatic regions. A life-cycle analytical model was further developed to analyse the economic and environmental benefits of the new system relative to the traditional systems. Analyses of the modelling results drew out several conclusive remarks: (1) the system could achieve the highest energy efficiency when operating at the hot (subtropical) climatic region (represented by Hong Kong), enabling the heat output of as high as 922kWh/m2yr and water temperature of above 45°C, while the grid power input is only 59kWh/m2yr; (2) the system is worth for investment when operating at the high energy charging tariff area (represented by London), with the cost payback periods of 8 and 5years relative to the traditional gas-fired and electrical boilers based systems, respectively; (3) the system could obtain the most promising environmental benefits when operating in Shanghai where the energy quality (embodied carbon volume of per kWh energy) is relatively poor, enabling reduction in life-cycle carbon emissions of around 4.08tons/m2 and 17.87tons/m2 respectively, relative to the gas-fired and electrical boilers. Answer to such a question on which area is most suitable for the system application is highly dependent upon the priority order among the three dominating factors: (1) energy efficiency, (2) economic revenue, and (3) environmental benefit, which may vary with the users, local concerns and policy influence, etc. The research results will be able to assist in decision making in implementation of the new PV/thermal technology and analyses of the associated economic and environmental benefits, thus contributing to realisation of the regional and global targets on fossil fuel energy saving and environmental sustainability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Economic; Energy performance; Environment; Loop heat pipe; PV; Simulation","Carbon; Decision making; Economic analysis; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Gas fired boilers; Heat pipes; Heat pump systems; Heating equipment; Hot water distribution systems; Investments; Life cycle; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Energy performance; Environment; Loop Heat Pipe; PV; Simulation; Economic and social effects; carbon emission; climatic region; cost-benefit analysis; decision making; energy budget; fossil fuel; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; solar power; sustainability; China; England; Hong Kong; London [England]; Shanghai; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907177325

Twenty-four-hour levoglucosan concentrations displayed clear summer minima and winter maxima that ranged from 46 to 1889 ng m−3, with an average of 428 ± 399 ng m−3. Besides agricultural burning, biomass/biofuel combustion for household heating with straws and branches appears to be of regional importance during the heating season in northwestern China. Good correlations (0.70 &lt; R &lt; 0.91) were found between levoglucosan relative to water-soluble K+, Cl−, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), and glyoxal. The highest levoglucosan/OC ratio of 2.3% was found in winter, followed by autumn (1.5%). Biomass burning contributed to 5.1–43.8% of OC (with an average of 17.6 ± 8.4%). Implications: PM2.5 levoglucosan concentrations and the correlation between levoglucosan relative to other compounds during four seasons in Xi’an showed that the influence of biomass burning is maximum during the residential heating season (winter), although some important influences may be detected in spring (field preparation burnings) and autumn (corn stalks and wheat straw burning, fallen dead leaves burning) at Xi’an and surrounding areas.

Since the dissolution of high-order PS in the liquid electrolyte is inevitable and essential to the cell's performance, one should allow the PS to dissolve while minimizing the parasitic reactions. To do this, nanostructured materials have been widely employed to confine the diffusion of the dissolved PS out of the cathode, such as approaches using highly porous carbon, metal oxide additive, and conductive polymer.

In Hong Kong, buildings contribute to 90% of electricity consumption and 60% of greenhouse gas emissions. Energy-efficient building has emerged as an effective approach to reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions. This paper aims to estimate the energy saving potential of different energy-efficient measures for office buildings that are an important sector of commercial buildings in Hong Kong. The energy efficient measures were identified using a four-tier framework covering building envelope, building services, renewable energy and human behavior. The potentials of the measures in reducing energy consumption were estimated using eQUEST Software. The results show that building services and building envelope are the main areas to be addressed for achieving energy-efficient office building design. The use of more efficient HVAC systems and low-emissivity windows are revealed as most favored measures for reducing energy consumption of office buildings in Hong Kong.

The complex biological and ecological characters of bamboo hinder such an effort, yet there exists an urgent need doing so due to its widespread, fast growth, high productivity, and multiple uses in Southern China. Here we report a comprehensive study on carbon production and storage, with systematic and accurate accounting of carbon density, storage and spatial distribution in a bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) forest in Sichuan province using the biometric approach. We found that: (1) difference in carbon density among ages and organs in stumpage bamboo was not significant, with a mean of 472.82 g/kg. The range of carbon density of bamboo organs varied from 462.37 to 480.68 g/kg, with a descending order of sheath, rhizome, branch, stem, leaf, root. The soil carbon density was 15. 77 g/kg, but varied significantly among layers. The carbon density was 379.96 g/kg and 377.66 g/kg, respectively, in the understory vegetation and the litter. (2) Carbon storage of the bamboo stand was 40.920 t/hm2, with 21.07 t/hm2(51.49% of the total). The bamboo leaves contained the smallest amount (1.78 t/hm2, or 4.35%). At our study site, the three-year old bamboo had higher proportion than the other aged stems, accounted for 19.91%. Above and belowground carbon accounted for 65.39% and 34.61%, respectively. The carbon storage of stumpage bamboo had the same distribution among various ages and organs. (3) The carbon storage in the top 30 cm was 113.54 t/hm2(69.02%). (4) The total carbon storage of the stand was 156.57 t/hm2, which is partitioned into 113.54 t/ hm2(72. 52%), 40. 92 t/hm2 (26. 14%) and 0. 52 t/hm2 (0. 33%) in the soil, stumpage bamboo and understory, respectively. Although there is great differences in carbon storage between P. edulis and the other bamboos, the spatial distribution seemed similar. (5) Carbon sequestration of P. edulis stand was 9.43 t· hm2· a-1, which is equivalent to 34.57 t/hm2 of CO2.","Carbon density; Carbon sink; Carbon storage; Phyllostachys edulis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904994741

However, CaO can stem from many precursors. And, the effect between different precursors has still not been studied. Calcined natural limestone, natural dolomite, calcium oxide, calcium carbonate, calcium acetate, and calcium propionate were used to investigate their pyrolysis reactivity of biomass (peanut shells and pine sawdust) at high temperature (&gt;800 °C). Experiments were conducted using a thermogravimetric apparatus and a fixed-bed pyrolysis system. Pine sawdust displayed higher pyrolysis reactivity than peanut shells. During pyrolysis, Ca-based additives fixed carbon dioxide mainly in the temperature range of 300-700 °C. By addition of Ca-based additives, the concentrations of hydrogen and carbon monoxide were increased and the concentrations of methane and carbon dioxide (over 18 vol%) were decreased. De-carbonation started around 700 °C. The emission of CO2 by de-carbonation promoted the reduction of char by the Boudouard reaction and methane by the dry reforming reaction. The total pyrolysis conversion decreased as PI-Dol &gt; PI-CaA &gt; PI-Lime &gt; PI-Ca &gt; PI-CaP &gt; PI Raw &gt; PI-CaC. The excellent pyrolysis reactivity of biomass in the presence of calcined calcium acetate can be ascribed to its preeminent physical structure. Addition of Ca-based additives increased the activation energy of the main devolatilization region. The activation energy of biomass with calcined natural dolomite, about 110 kJ mol-1, was much lower than that of other Ca-based additives studied at high temperatures. Pyrolysis of the pure biomass sample can be simply hypothesized as a first order reaction, but it varied significantly with the addition of additives. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.",,"Activation energy; Biomass; Calcination; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Lime; Methane; Biomass Gasification; Devolatilization; Different precursors; First order reactions; High temperature; Physical structures; Temperature range; Thermogravimetric apparatus; Calcium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906875916

Great importance has been placed on the desire for air quality assessment and improvement in China. New national standard (GB3095-2012) has been proposed and on trial since 2013, which is stricter than the old one. Air Quality Index (AQI, HJ 633-2012), including ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter smaller than 10 (PM10) and 2.5 μm (PM2.5), has also been carried out at the same time. This paper addresses the methodologies for urban air quality using AQI and fuzzy neural networks. Xi'an, an inland city located in Northwestern of China, is selected for this purpose. There are 560 obtainable monitoring records of air pollutants used for our study provided by 13 monitoring sites in Xi'an since Jan 1, 2013. Firstly, AQI method is used to assess these records. The results show that 421 records are assessed as ""Poor"" and worse, 463 records for PM2.5 assessed as prominent pollutant. Compared with AQI method, SOFM is a more comprehensive method using fuzzy synthetic evaluation techniques. It is improved with a monotone decreasing exponential function as membership weighting index to be faster, and used to assess air quality in this paper. The results of our study demonstrate that fuzzy SOFM is quite appropriate techniques for air quality assessment. Unlike AQI method, SOFM's result is decided by all pollutant instead of only the most serious one. No matter what kind of method, all assessment results show the very serious air pollution in Xi'an. The government and every citizen must take steps at once to prevent air quality from further depravation. © 2013 WIT Press.","Air quality; AQI; Clustering; Fuzzy SOFM; New national standards","air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; cluster analysis; environmental assessment; fuzzy mathematics; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; sulfur dioxide; China; Shaanxi; Xian",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903182213

The use of CO2 for enhancing oil recovery is also beneficial to environmental protection. However, the produced fluids during CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) production are supersaturated with high-pressure CO2 gas, which would lead to serious corrosion damages of the pipelines. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the risk of pipeline corrosion during oil production. Previous studies have made great efforts to the understanding of CO2 induced electrochemical corrosion. In this paper, we will report a possibility to reduce pipeline corrosion by managing the multiphase flow characteristics in CO2-E0R conditions. To model the corrosive conditions during CO2-E0R production, a self-designed multiphase flow loop for internal corrosion evaluation was successfully built, in which different flow patterns can be easily displayed. The role of flow patterns and emulsification that decisively influences pipeline corrosion was systematically investigated. It was found that a higher gas-to-liquid ratio could be beneficial for reducing pipeline corrosion, which was attributed to a reduction in slug frequency and an enhancement in the stirring effect on the oil and water mixtures. The critical water cut for triggering corrosion in different oil-water emulsions was determined as a function with the emulsion stability. It was found that corrosion can be totally inhibited if the transporting liquids were rightly controlled under a state of water in oil emulsion. Considering the multiphase flow corrosion characteristics, a model regarding the transporting parameters that ensure the security of crude oil transportation was proposed. It suggests that corrosion control by designing the transporting parameters be a suitable and economic method for tackling with the corrosion damages of CO 2-E0R pipelines. These ideas have been accepted for guiding the pipeline engineering in the CO2-EOR section of Shengli oilfield.","Copyright 2014; Society of petroleum engineers","Carbon steel; Electrochemical corrosion; Emulsification; Emulsions; Enhanced recovery; Flow patterns; Multiphase flow; Oil fields; Pipelines; Stainless steel; Corrosive conditions; Emulsion stability; Enhanced oil recovery; Flow charac-teristics; Gas-to-liquid ratios; Pipeline corrosion; Pipeline engineering; Water in oil emulsions; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906501356

Nitrogen (N) fertilizer is considered as the primary source of N2O emissions from agricultural soils. As a large agricultural country, China consumes the greatest amount of synthetic N fertilizer which accounts for 30% of the world consumptions. Therefore, quantifying N2O emissions from agricultural soils and seeking suitable mitigation measures have become a relatively hot issue in international global climate change studies. However, the task has proved to be uneasy because N2O production and emission processes are very complex and are influenced by a number of soil and environmental variables, interacting soil water and N processes, crop uptake and management practices. Especially the N2O emissions from the greenhouse vegetable systems are more complex because the system obtain relatively higher inputs of fertilizer (e.g., N fertilizer application rate can be as high as 1,500 kg N/hm2), more water irrigation and cultivation disturbance. This paper reported a field experiment with intensive measurements of N2O fluxes from a greenhouse vegetable system with varied management treatments in Fangshan District located in the western suburbs of Beijing, China. N2O fluxes in conjunction with the main environmental drivers (i.e., soil temperature, soil moisture, soil NO3--N and soil NH NO4+-N) were observed from Feb. 2012 to Feb. 2013. Four treatments, i.e., the control treatment (CK), the farmers' practice treatment (FP), the optimized fertilization treatment (OPT), and the OPT treatment with nitrification inhibitor amendment treatment (OPT+DCD), were implemented during the experimental period to test the impacts of fertilization on N2O fluxes from the agroecosystem. The CK had no fertilizer applied; FP consisted of 2,470 kg N/hm2 with 1,270 and 1,200 kg N/hm2 from synthetic fertilizer and manure, respectively; the OPT reduced synthetic fertilizer rate to 573 kg N/hm2. The field was planted with tomato, cabbage and lettuce rotation during the two experimental years. The results indicated that large amount of N2O emissions were observed in the spring and summer periods when the soil had relatively high temperatures and moisture. N2O emission peaks were measured following each event of fertilization or irrigation. The high peaks usually lasted for 3-5 days. During the experimental period, N2O emission rates ranged from -0.21-14.26 mg N2O m-2 h-1 with daily means ranging from 0.03-0.36 mg N2O m-2 h-1. The annual cumulative N2O emissions ranged from 1.69-20.66 kg N hm-2, based on which the annual emission factor was calculated to be 0.36%-0.77% of the fertilizer N. Compared to the FP treatment, the OPT and OPT+DCD treatments both significantly reduced the annual N2O emissions by 38.09% and 61.3%(P &lt;0.05), respectively. The N2O emissions during the tomato, lettuce, cabbage and fallow periods accounted for 60.65%, 26.32%, 10% and 3.3% of annual cumulative emissions, respectively. The fertilizer-induced N2O emissions varied across the N application rates, the crop growing periods and the management treatments. N2O fluxes were positively related to the soil water filled pore space (WFPS) when the WFPS values varied between 48.88%-79.88%(P &lt;0.05). There was no consistent correlation between N2O fluxes and the soil temperature at soil depth of 5 cm. Higher soil available nitrogen, especially nitrate, contributed higher N2O emissions. In conclusion, alternative management practices such as reduced fertilizer application rate and amendment of DCD could effectively reduce N2O emissions from the greenhouse vegetable field which usually emitted more N2O than other croplands in China.","Greenhouse vegetable field; Influencing factors; Nitrous oxide emission; Seasonal variation","agricultural emission; agricultural land; agricultural soil; global change; global warming; greenhouse ecosystem; nitrous oxide; seasonal variation; suburban area; vegetable; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905924625

In the present paper, we try to explore desert environmental change process of Kumtag desert based on stable isotope techniques collecting stable carbon isotope sample of Tamarix sand-hillocks from the different habitats and set up the stable carbon isotope series in age layers of four typical Tamarix sand-hillocks, proluvial landforms, wedland landforms, YaDan landforms and valley landforms, meanwhile environmental information and local meteorological data were collected as well. The results showed that the ratio of stable carbon isotope (δ13C), in age layers of Tamarix sand-hillocks, was fluctuated during 40-60 s of twenty century, and had declined since 1980s. The change tendency of stable carbon isotope series was accord with the stable carbon isotope downtrend of tree-ring all over the world. It was indicated that atmospheric CO2 concentration increasing affected the carbon isotope of stable carbon isotope (δ13C) in age layers of Tamarix sand-hillock. The resolution ratio(δ)of stable carbon isotope in age layers of Tamarix sand-hillocks had a similar change trendency to the global climate changes. It was dry and warm climate environment in the recent 120 years, which the resolution ratio(δ)was reduced with the global climate warming. However, the climate environment was colder and moister before the industrial revolution in the nineteenth century, and the resolution ratio(δ)was rosen. There was different response of the solution ratio δof stable carbon isotope in age layers of Tamarix sand-hillocks under different habitats to climatic elements changes. In the high altitude area, the resolution ratio (δ) in age layers was restricted by several climatic factors. e.g. air temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc. the resolution ratio(δ) composition had significantly relationship with annual air relative humidity, annual precipitation, seasonal atmospheric pressure and seasonal illumination intensity. The resolution ratio(δ) composition was affected by several climatic factors, but the hysteresis effect was not obvious. On the contrary, in the arid desert area in low elevation, the resolution ratio(δ) composition had had greatly sensitivities to annual temperature, seasonal precipitation and seasonal air relative humidity, and the hysteresis effect was obvious.","Age layers; Climate environment; Kumtag; Stable carbon isotope series; Tamarix sand-hillocks","carbon isotope; climate change; dating method; desert; dune; habitat structure; landform; stable isotope; wasteland; China; Kumtag Desert; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896267880

The results indicated that the thermophilic phases of all treatments beside T1 were met the Chinese standard of &gt;55°C for 5-7 days for sanitation. The aeration mode of T4 was in favor of reduced the H2S and CH4 emission during MSW bio-drying. Under the condition of this study, the bio-drying cycle should be determined for 18 days. Intermittent ventilation mode is more effective to reduce the moisture content in MSW bio-drying process.

CA system has four components: (i) no-till (NT), (ii) residue mulch, (iii) complex/diverse cropping system, and (iv) integrated nutrient management. Conservation tillage (CT, main technology of CA) methods, relevant to a range of cropping systems, are practiced on 6.67million hectare (Mha) in China. With growing concerns about global warming, soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration is an important strategy to offset anthropogenic emissions. This chapter collates and synthesizes available research literature on SOC sequestration under different tillage systems in China. Specific focus is on the SOC dynamics, SOC stock, rate of SOC sequestration, and soil quality under different tillage systems in diverse agroeco regions. The research on CT effects on SOC sequestration has been conducted in China for more than 20 years since the 1990s. The review of the literature indicates that NT can increase SOC concentration in the surface layer under dryland farming and rice (Oryza sativa L.) paddy soils. The average rate of increase of SOC (gkg-1year-1) in 0-20cm depth under NT systems is 0.60-3.74, 0.14-4.15, 0.50-5.94, and 8.81-17.95 for the Northeast, North, Northwest, and paddy fields of Southern China, respectively. However, most research results indicate that SOC under NT is concentrated more in the surface soil (8.6-31.3gkg-1 in NT vs. 5.3-26.8gkg-1 in plow tillage (PT)) and is relatively less in the subsoil (6.9-17.6gkg-1 in NT vs. 10.2-24.5gkg-1 in PT). Residue management is the key factor in SOC sequestration, which also influences SOC dynamics. Cropping system and rotation also affect SOC sequestration. Further, NT can improve soil quality by enhancing and stabilizing aggregation. Because of relatively short duration, soil processes under CA management are not clearly understood and are confounded by the diverse cropping systems. There is a need to study pedospheric processes affecting SOC sequestration and soil quality under long-term use of CA in diverse cropping systems and complex agroeco regions of China. Potential and limitations of CA, and research priorities in China are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon fraction; Challenges and opportunities; Conservation agriculture; Conservation tillage; Plow tillage; Soil organic carbon; Soil quality",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892173490

Based on lysimeter method, 3 microbial inoculant rates (0, 275 and 550 kg·ha-1, 275-550 kg·ha-1 was the recommended amount) were, respectively, applied into Chemical fertilizer Treatment-100% Urea (CT, CT+, CT++) and Mixed fertilizer Treatment-80% Urea+ 20% organic fertilizer (MT, MT+, MT++) to control DON and DOC loss from rice field. The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis were applied to investigate soil bacterial response to microbial inoculants. The applied microbial inoculants had a positive effect on both Shannon-Wiener diversity index and the structure of soil bacterial community, but no significant differences about homogeneous degrees index. Microbial inoculants had little impact on nitrogen in runoff of rice field, but could raise carbon concentration up under CT and reduce carbon concentration under MT. Microbial inoculants could effectively control TN, DON and DOC loss in leaching; however, excessive number of microbial inoculants could also lead to more nitrogen and carbon loss. All the treatments with microbial inoculants could raise grain yield, but MT++ and CT++ would reduce the economic coefficient. In general, under the premise that rice yield and quality was not reduced, or even increased, MT+ was the most effective treatment as source control to limit DON and DOC loss from a rice field; but a proper ratio of microbial inoculants as well as chemical and organic fertilizer application still need further tests.","Lysimeter; Microbial inoculants; Nitrogen and carbon fluxes; PCR-DGGE; Rice field",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904567681

The new-types of building materials can be produced by recycling industrial solid wastes which is an effective solution to development of green building materials and abatement of environmental emissions. In this paper, new-types of bricks made of fly ash (residues generated in coal combustion) and coal gangue (a kind of solid wastes generated in coal mining and coal production) and the conventional types of bricks (refer to perforated clay bricks and clay bricks here) are taken as examples to analyze their differences of embodied energy and carbon emissions. The energy saving and reduction of carbon emissions of different types of bricks are estimated in brick production phases and in construction phases of buildings. In phases of brick production, the embodied energy of new-types of bricks is lower than that of conventional types of bricks. The carbon emissions of fly ash brick is between perforated clay brick and clay brick while the carbon emissions of coal gangue brick is higher than that of both conventional types of bricks. The coal gangue brick and fly ash brick have better advantages of energy saving in brick production phases while the reduction of carbon emissions of both new-types of bricks is not statistically significant compared with that of conventional types of bricks. In phases of building construction, the fly ash brick has no advantages of both energy saving and reduction of carbon emissions compared with the conventional types of bricks while coal gangue brick has advantages of energy saving but having no advantage of reduction in carbon emissions. In addition, the differences of embodied energy and carbon emissions of residential buildings using new-types of bricks and conventional types of bricks are analyzed. The results showed that new-types of bricks from coal gangue can improve the energy efficiency and increase the carbon emissions of residential buildings in their building production phase compared with conventional type of bricks while fly ash bricks had no statistically significant difference with conventional types of bricks. Our research indicates that production of new-type green building materials by recycling industrial solid wastes from coal mining and coal combustion is an alternative way to realize energy-saving for sustainable construction industry in China.","Embodied energy; Industrial solid wastes; Urban carbon emissions; Wastes - recycling based building materials",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897618994

The closed-loop supply chain network consists of suppliers tier, manufacturer tier, retailers tier, and demand markets tier, in which the manufacturers collect used products from the demand markets directly. Product lifetime is introduced to denote the maximum times of manufacturing and remanufacturing, and the relation between adjacent periods is described by inventory transfer. By variational inequalities and complementary theory, the optimal behaviors of all the players are modeled, and, in turn, the governing closed-loop supply chain network equilibrium model is established. The model is solved by modified project contraction algorithm with fixed step. Optimal equilibrium results are computed and analyzed through numerical examples. The impacts of collection rate, remanufacturing conversion rate, product lifetime, and carbon emission cap on equilibrium states are analyzed.

An integrated model was deployed which combined the microscopic traffic simulation model VISSIM with the emission model established by the data collected from on-board portable emission measurement system OBEAS-3000. VISSIM recorded the second-by-second speed and acceleration of individual vehicle under different speed limit scenarios as the input data. The emission model outputs vehicle emissions through relating emissions to the instantaneous speed and acceleration of the vehicle. Speed limit scenarios were set from 90 to 40 km/h at a decrement of 5km/h and heavy vehicles weighted above 2t in total occupied near 20%. Distance-based emission rate (g/km) was used as the performance measure. The simulation results showed that, vehicles released least CO emissions with a speed limit of 70km/h, and 80km/h was optimal for HC and NOx emissions.","Emission reduction; Highway; Optimal speed; PEMS; Speed limit","Air pollution control equipment; Emission control; Exhaust gases; Gas emissions; Traffic control; Vehicles; Emission reduction; Highway; Optimal speed; PEMS; Speed limit; Speed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904754688

The laser annealing by a linear decrease of the CO2 laser power effectively reduces the residual stress. The residual stress of mitigated sites is characterized by polarimetry, the reduction of the maximum retardance around the mitigated sites with the exposure time of laser annealing fits a stretched exponential equation, and the maximum retardance with optimal laser annealing is reduced (36 ± 3)% compared to that without laser annealing. The residual stress regions are destructively characterized by introducing damage. The critical size of damage leading to fracture propagation for the mitigated sites without laser annealing is in the range of 120230 m, and the corresponding critical size of damage for the mitigated sites with laser annealing is larger than 600 μm. According to the relationship between maximum damage size and critical stress, the residual stress without laser annealing is in the range of 28-39 MPa and the residual stress with laser annealing is less than 17 MPa.

On the basis of the LCP theory and method, the researchers in this paper propose a new approach used to calculate the carbon emissions in the urban residential area through comprehensively considering the CO2 emission and CO2 absorption of carbon sink-green space in the total life cycle of the urban community. In addition, taking the typical multi-story residential areas in Shenyang City as the sample, the researchers calculate the carbon emission and discuss the features of emission in the residential area as well as the method and potential of reducing the carbon emission. The calculation results show that, the carbon emissions in the process of operation an use account for the largest proportion for the total life cycle, up to 83.8%; the carbon emissions in the process of preparing the materials for construction account for 7.69%; the carbon emissions at the stage of building demolition account for 5.32%.

On the basis of LCP theory, the carbon emission of a residential building in Shenyang was calculated in each stage of the life cycle. The calculation shows that the carbon emission in the use and maintenance stage accounts for 86%, the biggest proportion in its life cycle. The carbon emission of one square meter reaches 45.27kgCO2/(m2·y), higher than other cities in China. So the potential for Shenyang to save energy and reduce carbon is considerable. The low carbon objective can be achieved through reducing the use of fossil energy, improving resident's energy saving awareness in the use stage and enforcing energy efficiency policies and measures. Meanwhile, from the perspective of research methodology, the carbon emission of a building is regionally featured. For instance, electric carbon emission coefficient is substantially influenced by local energy structure; the distance between building material production and transportation in different places is different; the carbon emission caused by the energy consumption during the usage of the building is closely associated with local energy saving policies and regulations. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","CO2 emissions; Life cycle; Residential building; Shenyang","CO2 emissions; Energy efficiency policies; Greenhouse gases emissions; Production and transportations; Research methodologies; Residential building; Resource consumption; Shenyang; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887509196

It targets carbonic anhydrase protein (CA IX), a transmembrane carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoform, which is regulated by VHL/HIF pathway and hence expressed in the majority of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) as well as in hypoxic non-RCC tumours. CA IX functions in pH regulation and cell migration/invasion, and supports tumour cell survival in hypoxia and/or acidosis. It contains a highly active extracellular catalytic domain (CA) extended N-terminally with a proteoglycan-like region and C-terminally with short transmembrane and intracellular regions. Here we characterize the binding and internalization properties of G250, as well as its therapeutic effects in animal model, and discuss the impact of G250-mediated immunotherapy in non-RCC tumours. We demonstrated that G250 MAb recognizes a conformational epitope in the CA domain, detects the soluble CA IX ectodomain (ECD), but not the splicing variant, and does not cross-react with CA I, II, and XII isoforms. We showed that G250 internalizes via clathrin-coated vesicles, escapes degradation in lysosomes and enters the recycling pathway via the perinuclear compartment. This results in long intracellular persistence and enables consecutive internalization cycles. Moreover, the recycled antibody maintains an intact Fc portion potentially capable of continuous induction of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) response, thus explaining its therapeutic efficacy. Finally, we showed that G250 treatment is effective against HT-29 colorectal carcinoma xenografts that differ from RCC by more heterogeneous, hypoxia-related expression of CA IX. These results suggest potential therapeutic usefulness of the G250 MAb in non-RCC tumours.","Carbonic anhydrase IX; G250 monoclonal antibody; Girentuximab; Hypoxia; Immunotherapy; Internalization","CA9 protein, human; carbonate dehydratase; G250 monoclonal antibody; immunoglobulin G; monoclonal antibody; tumor antigen; animal; antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity; biosynthesis; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Colorectal Neoplasms; drug screening; HT 29 cell line; human; immunology; immunotherapy; mouse; pathology; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity; Antigens, Neoplasm; Carbonic Anhydrases; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Colorectal Neoplasms; HT29 Cells; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Immunotherapy; Mice; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907695899

The Earth, Mercury, Ganymede, and the giant planets of the solar system all contain internal dynamo currents that generate planetary-scale magnetic fields. When coupled to energetic (keV) electrons, such as those produced by solar windmagnetosphere interaction (compression or magnetic reconnection), magnetosphere-ionosphere or magnetosphere-satellite coupling, the polar regions of a planetary magnetic field are the place of intense, coherent, circularly polarized cyclotron radio emissions. These emissions - That may be as intense as solar ones - are produced by all magnetized planets in the solar system in the MHz range, and up to 40 MHz at Jupiter. Detection of similar emissions from exoplanets will provide constraints on the thermal state, composition, and dynamics of their interior - very difficult to determine by other means - as well as an improved understanding of the planetary dynamo process and of the physics of star-planet plasma interactions. Detailed knowledge of magnetospheric emissions from solar system planets and the discovery of exoplanets motivated both theoretical and observational work on magnetospheric emissions from exoplanets. Scaling laws and theoretical frameworks were built and extrapolated to obtain orderof- magnitude predictions of frequencies and flux densities of exoplanetary radio emissions. The present stage of the theory suggests that radio detection of exoplanets will develop the new field of comparative exo-magnetospheric physics, but also permit to measure exoplanetary parameters such as rotation or orbit inclination. Observational searches started even before the confirmed discovery of the first exoplanet. We review the scientific return of the detection of exoplanetary radio emissions, the current status of observational searches, and discuss the future promise in the context of SKA, especially SKA1- LOW. To the extent that Jupiter's magnetic field is not exceptionally strong, the current lower frequency limit of 50 MHz implies that SKA1-LOW will likely detect Jovian-mass planets. With the currently planned sensitivity of SKA1-LOW, we estimate that a Jupiter-like planet could be detected to about 10 pc. Within this volume there are ∼200 known stars and ∼35 currently known exoplanets, and this number should increase substantially with coming space missions dedicated to transits and powerful ground-based instruments. The accessible volume will be much increased if scaling laws derived in our solar system can be reliably extrapolated to exoplanetary systems, permitting to measure lower mass planets' dynamos and magnetospheres. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Licence.",,"Astrophysics; Earth (planet); Extrapolation; Extrasolar planets; Interactive devices; Interplanetary flight; Ionosphere; Magnetic fields; Magnetism; Magnetoplasma; Magnetosphere; Planets; Plasma interactions; Solar system; Stars; Circularly polarized; Ground-based instruments; Magnetic reconnections; Magnetospheric physics; Planetary magnetic fields; Solar system planets; Solar wind-magnetosphere interactions; Theoretical framework; Orbits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978977455

The same biological responses thought to effect cardiovascular disease through air pollution-mediated systemic oxidative stress, inflammation and cerebrovascular dysfunction could also be relevant for diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: We conducted multi-site case-crossover analyses of all-cause deaths and of hospitalizations for diabetes or neurological disorders among Medicare enrollees (&gt;65 years) during the period 1999 to 2010 in 121 US communities. We examined whether 1) short-Term exposure to PM2.5 increases the risk of hospitalization for diabetes or neurological disorders, and 2) the association between short-Term exposure to PM2.5 and all-cause mortality is modified by having a previous hospitalization of diabetes or neurological disorders. Results: We found that short term exposure to PM2.5 is significantly associated with an increase in hospitalization risks for diabetes (1.14% increase, 95% CI: 0.56, 1.73 for a 10 μg/m3 increase in the 2 days average), and for Parkinson's disease (3.23%, 1.08, 5.43); we also found an increase in all-cause mortality risks (0.64%, 95% CI: 0.42, 0.85), but we didn't find that hospitalization for diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases modifies the association between short term exposure to PM2.5 and all-cause mortality. Conclusion: We found that short-Term exposure to fine particles increased the risk of hospitalizations for Parkinson's disease and diabetes, and of all-cause mortality. While the association between short term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality was higher among Medicare enrollees that had a previous admission for diabetes and neurological disorders than among Medicare enrollees that did not had a prior admission for these diseases, the effect modification was not statistically significant.

At the same time, major aircraft (A/C) manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus estimate that the worldwide commercial A/C fleet will increase 5% per year over the next 20 years, i.e. the commercial aviation market will be doubled. This growth will require not only new airports infrastructure but also investments in en-route and Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems. Part of such investments must be aimed to a growth in the capacity of the onboard communication systems. With increasing speed of Internet connections on land, passengers expect not only to be connected to the Internet but also to have good connectivity with high bandwidth to enable them the access and use of multitude applications during the flight. The need to be connected adds to the increased passenger traffic and even the implementation of new aviation standards such as: Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC), Future Air Navigation System (FANS), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), VHF Data Link mode 2/3/4 (VDL2/3/4), etc. Governmental initiatives such as NextGen in U.S.A. and Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) in Europe are forcing aviation companies to fulfill these needs to satisfy their customers while complying with regulations in different airspaces. As a result, the aviation industry faces a new paradigm in the communication system requirements, which is the subject of this paper. As a first requirement, the industry must be prepared for seamlessly adoption of future communication systems, standards, or regulation without this implying the continuous installation of new equipment, but rather the modification of the existing one. Today, any modernization of these systems represents a major change in airborne and on-land equipment, which means buying new equipment, installation of new antennas on the A/C, etc. The main repercussions of this lack of flexibility and scalability are that many of the systems currently used have become obsolete, their modernization, when possible, is highly constrained by previous limitations, and new deployments are painfully long. Therefore, the modernization of the onboard communication systems has to be flexible enough to address all these drawbacks. This paper also discusses several Requirements for Communication Systems in Future Passenger Air Transportation (RCSFPAT). Requirements like the bandwidth, which will depend on factors that cannot yet be predicted accurately (amount of increase in air traffic, capabilities of service providers, etc.). The two primary drivers for the RCSFPAT are: 1) to provide an appropriate communication infrastructure to support future air communication systems growth, and 2) to provide a consistent global solution to support the goal of fulfilling the communications requirements from passengers and communications between A/C Earth Stations (AESs) and Ground Earth Stations (GESs) thus to ensure flight safety. In order to provide worldwide coverage of the communication systems, the only current technology able to cover the oceanic regions is Satellite Communications (SatCom). Indeed, most of the airlines and A/C manufactures have signed agreements with SatCom service providers and their communications systems are based on SatCom. This paper analyzes the capabilities of current SatCom services to fulfill RCSFPAT, and the requirements of future systems to meet the expectations of growth in the air transportation. However, the current capabilities of SatCom cannot support the bandwidth needs in those areas with a higher density of flights. Fortunately, these areas commonly extend over land due to the presence of domestic flights, and thus the increased communication requirements can be complemented with on-land infrastructures. The suitability of current systems such as those used in mobile communications and WiMAX is studied in this work, and some guidelines are provided for future systems to satisfy RCSFPAT. A solution with a multimode operation to accommodate different phases of flight as well as the hardware requirements to fulfill the RCSFPAT is also presented. In addition, the so-called Size, Weight, Power and Cost (SWaP-C) requirement is of crucial importance in aviation where any kilogram matters. By using Software Defined Radio (SDR), the weight of equipment is reduced. The number of radios, coax cables and antennas are reduced as well. Costly redundancies can be handled by the use of reprogrammable SDRs. The overall wiring required for navigation, communication, and surveillance systems interconnections are also minimized. As a consequence, the reduced number of parts increases the reliability and safety at the system level. By reducing the system weight and power consumption, SDRs also bring the additional benefits of reduced Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and fuel cost savings. In this line, LASSENA Laboratory is currently embarked on a project to develop Software Defined Avionics (SDA) in collaboration with several industrial partners in the aviation, aerospace and embedded systems sectors. Although the aviation community is considering the requirements for operating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or Systems, within the ATM infrastructure, this item is beyond the scope of this work. In conclusion, the problem addressed in this paper is not an easy one: The passengers expectations demand huge communication capabilities, the targeted coverage is worldwide, the density of flights varies in different regions, and the latency difference between different A/Cs is in the order of milliseconds. SDR appears as the only technology able to fulfill flexibility and SWaP-C requirements and Radio Frequency Unit (RFU) must be designed to meet reconfigurability scalability requirements as well. The new passenger air transportation paradigm demands an analysis of the requirements of future communication systems in a sector typically not able to satisfy the communication needs of their customers. In this globalized world, the offer of communication services may establish the difference between successful companies and the rest. Airlines not able to provide wideband communication services may be forced to transform themselves into low-cost for surviving.",,"Advanced traffic management systems; Air navigation; Air traffic control; Air transportation; Antennas; Automobile manufacture; Bandwidth; Civil aviation; Controllers; Customer satisfaction; Embedded systems; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Internet protocols; Internet service providers; Investments; Modernization; Navigation systems; Network security; Satellite ground stations; Scalability; Software radio; Traffic surveys; Air Traffic Management Systems; Airports council internationals; Automatic dependent surveillance - broadcasts; Communication capabilities; Communication infrastructure; Controller-pilot data link communications; Reliability and safeties; Wide-band communications; Satellite communication systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087598123

Detailed analyses of high resolution bathymétrie data and out-of-straightness pipeline surveys have revealed that indicators can be practical flow assurance tools for the modeling of multiphase pipeline profiles: • The Terrain Indicator can be used to quickly quantify the roughness of pipeline topographies and to anticipate the influence of route selection on hydrodynamic phenomena such as liquid accumulation and slugging. • When only low resolution bathymetry is available, regional regressions of roughness indicators can be used to create pipeline geometries that are representative of the actual seabed roughness for a better prediction of operating envelopes. • Roughness indicators can be used to fingerprint the roughness of existing pipeline topographies and to characterize geomorphic features of the seafloor. Reducing noise in raw survey data is essential for pertinent characterizations of the seafloor and pipeline profiles. Noise in data from seabed and out-of-straightness surveys can be reduced through a smoothing technique combining a moving average and a linear least squares fit. According to high resolution survey data, the span of this moving average should be equivalent to the length of one pipe joint; i.e. 40 feet or 12.2 meters. Before the completion of onerous Finite Element simulations for on-bottom roughness analyses, the same smoothing technique can be applied to the transformation of bathymetrie data into representative pipeline geometry. The span of the moving average required for this transformation appears to be equivalent to the length of one double pipe joint. Two examples are presented to illustrate the application of flow assurance indicators to the design of long subsea tiebacks. Copyright 2014, Offshore Technology Conference.

Thus, current cities need to be redeveloped towards less use of carbon in their day to day operations. Pedestrianized environment is one of the approaches used in reducing carbon foot print in cities. Heritage cities are the first to be looked into since they were built in the era in which motorized vehicles were minimal. Therefore, the research explores users' satisfaction on assessment of physical attributes of pedestrianization in Melaka Historical City, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It aims to examine users' satisfaction on pedestrian facilities provided within the study area using pair wise questionnaire comparison approach. A survey of 200 respondents using random sampling was conducted in six different sites namely Jonker Street, Church Street, Kota Street, Goldsmith Street, Merdeka Street to Taming Sari Tower and Merdeka Street to River Cruise terminal. The survey consists of an assessment tool based on a nine-point scale of users' satisfaction level of pathway properties, zebra pedestrian crossing, street furniture, personal safety, adjacent to traffic flow, aesthetic and amenities. Analytical hierarchical process (AHP) was used to avoid any biasness in analyzing the data collected. Findings show that Merdeka Street to Taming Sari Tower as the street that scores the highest satisfaction level that fulfils all the required needs of a pedestrianized environment. Similar assessment elements can be used to evaluate existing streets in other cities and these criteria should also be used in planning for future cities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Climate change; Analytical hierarchical process; Day-to-day operations; Evaluation of users; Global climate changes; Motorized vehicles; Pair-wise comparison; UNESCO world heritages; Users' satisfactions; Traffic surveys; analytical hierarchy process; attitudinal survey; carbon footprint; environmental management; global change; heritage conservation; pedestrian; pedestrianization; urban atmosphere; urban planning; World Heritage Site; Malaysia; Melaka; West Malaysia; Equus subg.

Additionally, temperature, humidity, and time data were also included to allow for potential effect of weather and time-varying influences on hospital admissions. CO showed the most significant (P &lt; 0.05) relationship to cardiovascular admissions. An increment of 1 ppm in CO predicted an increase of 4% to 20% in cardiovascular admissions.

The use of domestic coal in Spain's electricity sector will be promoted by the Royal Decree until 2014. This energy strategy on the one hand and political decision on the other were advanced under the flag of energy security and the fulfillment of the 9th Principle of the International Council of Mining and Metals (ICMM), which specified that sustainable development in mining areas should maintain, among other things, employment. The mutual understanding between the government and the local mining industry is confronted with vast criticism at the institutional, firm and social levels regarding: a) the disparities generated between electricity generation technologies; b) the increase of electricity market prices (The National Competition Commission reported the Royal Decree); and c) subsequent environmental harm. The Coal Decree has changed the gradual decrease of coal in the Spanish energy mix since the end ofthe 1990s. The environmental efficiency gains accumulated over the past several years would be lost as a result of this change of direction in policy. In the last fifteen years, the coalindustry in Spain has been under pressure from political decisions that have forced the dismantling of the industry, a labor reconversion of mining areas, and the conversion of coal-fired power plants into combined-cycle gas power plants. This situation considerably reduced CO2 emissions from coal combustion in Spain, improving the environmental efficiency of the entire economy for many years. Nevertheless, the implementation of the Royal Decree has changed these trends. This paper will examine the environmental consequences of the Coal Decree from 2010 to 2014 based on actual economic and energy demand requirements and actual electricity mix composition. A post-Keynesian energy AGE model to forecast energy demand and the derived CO2 emissions will be applied to evaluate the change in the reduction of emissions observed in the electricity sector since 2005 and in the Spanish economy since 2010. The results will be compared to other alternative scenarios of CO2 emissions evolution. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

When available, natural gas can potentially substitute oil. Moreover, the high-quality wind energy potential found in many of these areas cannot be used extensively. Main reason is the operation of small-scale, weak electricity grids which cannot cope with wind energy intermittency. To compensate for that, we examine the combination of wind energy and energy storage. For the latter we focus on the technology of compressed air energy storage (CAES), which is suitable for scalable applications. To ensure the highest level of demand satisfaction, while avoiding system oversizing, we recommend a novel Wind-CAES system that allows switch from the CAES to the Brayton cycle when the stored energy is inadequate to meet demand. We develop a new algorithm for the sizing of such configurations, and use it on a case study that includes a typical, medium-scale Aegean Sea island in combination with three representative wind regimes. The results demonstrate that even in areas with relatively low-quality wind potential there are significant improvements in fuel use reduction, CO2 emissions and strengthening of energy supply security, while for island regions with higher-quality wind potential, the proposed solution also becomes cost-effective in comparison to other alternatives. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Generally, it was found that governmental organizations are the main actors in the South Korean climate policy arena and that they mediate between the business and civil sectors. In particular, key organizations in each sector play a leading role in the formation and maintenance of at least two distinct alliance networks: growth and environmental. In particular, the growth network has been stronger and more intense than the environmental network, with the exception of nuclear power policy. The crucial drivers of proactive policy discourse in South Korea have been scientific discourse and a consensus on the advent of anthropogenic climate change by the international scientific community, the international climate change negotiations and the pressure to commit to GHG emissions reduction, and low-carbon green growth strategy.Policy relevanceThe positions of South Korean governmental organizations (as well as other civil society organizations) on the four major issues of climate policy have not been aligned. The government has not acted as a unified body; instead it is an aggregated body composed of organizations with competing interests. If policy actors with different interests share the recognition of the state of the country within global society and understand international pressure as well as the urgency of combating climate change, then a common policy goal can be achieved. It is essential for the government to exert proactive leadership for climate policies in mediating the growth and environmental networks. It is important to boost environmental networks in order to overcome the alliance of growth networks.

Here, we aimed at investigating the role of Nox in cardiac ischemic injury through gain- and loss-of-function approaches. We modulated Nox activity in the heart by cardiac-specific expression of Nox4 and dominant negative Nox4. Modulation of Nox activity drastically changes the cellular redox status. Increasing Nox activity by cardiac-specific overexpression of Nox4 imposed oxidative stress on the myocardium [increased NAD(P)(+)/NAD(P)H and decreased glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio] and worsened cardiac energetics and contractile function after ischemia-reperfusion. Overexpression of the dominant negative Nox4 (DN), which abolished the Nox function, led to a markedly reduced state [decreased NAD(P)(+)/NAD(P)H and increased glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio] at baseline and paradoxically promoted mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production during ischemia resulting in no recovery of heart function after reperfusion.

In collaboration with SaskPower, Aquistore will be the first integrated project globally to demonstrate deep saline CO2 capture, transport, and storage on a commercial scale from a coal fired power plant. CO2 will be captured at unit 3 of the Boundary Dam power-station (BD3), transported via underground pipeline to the Aquistore site, and injected to a depth of 3.4 km. Strategic outreach and engagement are necessary for ensuring CCS projects have support. Even where CCS awareness is high, many CCS projects - successful and failed - have received negative attention.

The example of Wuhan reveals that local governments should take measures to reduce the emission of PM2.5 if it affects the attainment rate and the performance evaluation value of air quality.

In the present study, changes in the transcript levels of the 20 iron related genes were profiled in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum during an early stage of acclimation from iron replete to iron-limited conditions. The results clearly showed that the profiles differ depending on genes, suggesting the occurrence of several modes of iron-responsive regulation at the transcriptional level. Upstream DNA sequences of iron starvation induced protein1 (Isi1), ferrichrome binding protein1 (FBP1), and flavodoxin (Fld) genes were isolated, fused with the GUS reporter gene, uidA, and transformed into P. tricornutum. Obtained transformants were subjected to the GUS reporter assay and the result clearly revealed that the GUS activity of all transformants was significantly increased upon iron limitation. Iron responsive Cis-elements in each promoter region were determined by the promoter truncation technique, demonstrating the occurrence of the critical iron-responsive regulatory regions of about 30bp in the promoter regions of three genes, Isi1, FBP1, and Fld. Interestingly, these sequences were similar with each other revealing two conserved motifs, A; A(A/C)G(G/C)C(G/-)C(A/G)TG; and B; CACGTG(T/C)C, which are homologous to the iron responsive Cis-element in the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The impairment of the motif B in the Isi1 promoter resulted in the loss of iron response and the core regulatory region of the FBP1 promoter conferred an iron response on the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter, PCMV, indicating that these conserved promoter sequences are iron-responsive elements. Finally, the inductive regulation of these promoters under iron-limited conditions was dissipated specifically by 5% CO2, strongly suggesting the participation of CO2 in the transcriptional regulation of the iron-related gene promoters. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Cis-element; CO2 response; Iron response; Marine diatom; Promoter; Transcriptional regulation","Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chlorophyta; Cytomegalovirus; Nitzschia alba; Phaeodactylum tricornutum; iron; aquatic species; diatom; drug effects; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; promoter region; Aquatic Organisms; Diatoms; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Iron; Promoter Regions, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922243374

By comparing CH4 consumption activities in cultures inoculated with parts from 39 plant species, we observed significantly higher consumption of CH4 associated with aquatic plants than other emergent plant parts such as woody plant leaves, macrophytic marine algae, and sea grass. In situ activity of CH4 consumption by methanotrophs associated with different species of aquatic plants was in the range of 3.7-37 μmol·h-1·g-1 dry weight, which was ca 5.7-370-fold higher than epiphytic CH4 consumption in submerged parts of emergent plants. The qPCR-estimated copy numbers of the particulate methane monooxygenase-encoding gene pmoA were variable among the aquatic plants and ranged in the order of 105-107 copies·g-1 dry weight, which correlated with the observed CH4 consumption activities. Phylogenetic identification of methanotrophs on aquatic plants based on the pmoA sequence analysis revealed a predominance of diverse gammaproteobacterial type-I methanotrophs, including a phylotype of a possible plant-associated methanotroph with the closest identity (86-89%) to Methylocaldum gracile. © 2014 Yoshida, Iguchi, Yurimoto, Murakami and Sakai.","Aquatic plants; Methane monooxygenase; Methane sink; Methanotroph; PmoA","methane monooxygenase; plant DNA; amino acid sequence; aquatic environment; article; bacterium isolation; carbon metabolism; carbon sink; controlled study; copy number variation; DNA extraction; Gammaproteobacteria; gene expression; methanotroph; Methylococcus capsulatus; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; phytoplankton; plant gene; plant leaf; pmoA gene; polymerase chain reaction; sequence analysis; unindexed sequence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897656096

However, most of the methods are effective only under certain energy demands. In operating an energy supply plant actually, it is necessary to determine the operational strategy properly based on predicted energy demands. In this case, realized energy demands may differ from the predicted ones. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the operational strategy so that it is robust against the uncertainty in energy demands. In this paper, an optimization method based on the mixed-integer linear programming is proposed to conduct the robust optimal operation of energy supply plants under uncertain energy demands. The uncertainty in energy demands is expressed by their intervals. The operational strategy is determined to minimize the maximum regret in the operational cost under the uncertainty. In addition, a hierarchical relationships among operation modes and on/off states of equipment, energy demands, and energy flow rates of equipment are taken into account. First, a general formulation of a robust optimal operation problem is presented, which is followed by a general solution procedure. Then, in a numerical study, the proposed method is applied to a gas turbine cogeneration plant for district energy supply. Through the study, some features of the robust optimal operation are clarified, and the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method are ascertained. © 2014 by ASME.",,"Alternative fuels; Cogeneration plants; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy resources; Integer programming; Numerical methods; Optimization; Emission reduction; Energy supply plants; Gas turbine cogeneration; General solutions; Mixed integer linear programming; Operational strategies; Optimal operation; Optimization method; Gas turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922111638

The emitted photon coupled into a leaky mode is differentiated by the manipulation of the quality factor in various spatial frequencies. Therefore, light extraction in this light-emitting device is determined by the modal extraction lengths and the quality factor obtained from the measured photonic bands. Furthermore, the higher-and lower-order mode spontaneous emissions are affected by the nonradiative process in the PhC structures with different periods. In our cases, the photonic crystal device with the largest period of 500 nm exhibits the highest lower-order mode extraction and quality factor. As a result, a self-collimation behavior toward the surface-normal is demonstrated in the 3D far-field pattern of such a device.

But the disorder and inefficient land development policy now has brought about negative effects, which being a menace to the sustainable development of the country, threaten the ecological security, food security and social stability. The above things are mainly about our current land management model. Since the founding of the people's Republic of China, the urban land management agencies and their functions are changing constantly under the planned economy which leaded to a single administrative leadership land management model. Recently, some scholars, experts and officials presented that: our land management model should be changed from resource management to assets management. Some researchers pointed out that the three main methods of American city land management should be adopted: administrative districts, the market mechanism and planning and the city land reserve andtransfer system. The traditional land management systems focus on the quantity of the land, but the function being neglected, what's more, administrative intervention too much and lack of market mechanism which leaded to the divorce between land management and economic, ecological. Which resulted in some problems in our land management, like weighs quantity lights quality, weighs structure lights functions, weighs results lights processes, weights physical form lights ecological, weights interception lights regulation. The ecological essence of above things lead to landscape fragmentation, soil compaction, pollution retention, ecological depletion, short sighted behavior and poor information. The crux of the land management problem is the unbalance between the needs of society-economy and the ecological carrying capacity of the regional area; the paradox between the natural ecological footprint and the ecological services of green space; the uncoordinated management relationship between urban and suburban areas, agriculture and industry, the built up area and non-built up area. And, the development behavior is mainly mass investment from external mandatory and the dominant enlarge model is export-oriented land development, which lead to the weakness of internal self-organization and regulating function. According to these problems mentioned above, the article proposed a conjugate ecological management model for urban land administration based on the land complex ecological function, which divided the land function into four categories: biomass production function, support for land construction, provide security for farmer subsistence and the other functions (like water conservation, soil conservation, climatic regulation and so on). Then three ways of mechanism transformation were put forward: the land management systems should altered from single-attribute and simple target to multi-attribute and multi-target; changing into market mechanism from administrative management; giving priority to the regulation and management system based upon land ecological function. Then, we concluded that the conjugate ecological management model should comprise the following five aspects: 1) changing from the resource management of the land plane structure to the ecological management of the land stereo space; 2) keeping requisition-compensation balance within the development area according to the ecological function, but not in terms of land area which in different locations; 3) the land development should in accordance with the structure and function optimization followed a sugar-coated berry string type, but not expands like standing pancake. 4) altering from the most strict land quantity management to the most reasonable land function management, and taking the land ecological-economic function monitoring and audit into practice. Finally, a typical ecological engineering was being analyzed, which proved that the social, economic and environmental complex ecological effects were more than the traditional land use model.","Complex ecological system; Conjugate ecological management; Ecological engineering; Land","administrative system; carrying capacity; ecological engineering; ecological footprint; food security; industrialization; land management; optimization; soil conservation; subsistence; sustainable development; urban site; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892997953

To tackle urban climate issues in a planning context, a meteorological model with high resolution is useful for evaluating different planning scenarios. This study used the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) with a single-layer urban canopy model to simulate summer meteorological conditions in Hong Kong, downscaling the spatial resolutions from 4.5 km to 500 m. Hong Kong (HK) was taken as an example due to its high building density in a sub-tropical climate region. The model results were compared against measurements at 25 weather stations. We quantified the urban heat island effect (UHI) in the summer in 2009, and estimated the resultant health impacts based on a temperature-response function. The model results and measurements show a good agreement with an index of agreement of 0.71 and a percentage difference of mean temperature of 1.33%. Our analysis estimated that the hourly temperature in urban areas (29.6°C) is higher comparing to that in rural areas (28.1°C). The Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII) was estimated to be 1.6°C on average. The UHI results in different Primary Planning Units show a north-south gradient pattern over Hong Kong: the highest UHII (1.7°C) in northern part of HK, whereas the lowest UHII (0.8°C) in southern part of HK. We found UHII correlates well with urban area size instead of population, highlighting that policy makers of high-density cities should pay attention to urban area size when tackling UHI. In addition, UHI was estimated to cause 75 [95%C.I. 22-158] mortalities in summer. Of which, ~55% of the UHI-related health impact occurs in New Territories, while 39% and 6% of the impact happen in Kowloon and Hong Kong Island, respectively. The results provide critical implications for urban planners to mitigate UHI in cities, especially in less developed countries. © Copyright: CEPT University, Center for Advanced Research in Building Science & Energy, Ahmedabad First Published 2014.All rights reserved.",,"Climate models; Ecosystems; Thermal pollution; Urban growth; Weather forecasting; High-density cities; Less developed countries; Meteorological condition; Meteorological modeling; Sustainable urban development; Temperature response; Urban Heat Island Effects; Urban heat island intensities; Atmospheric temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088356872

The carbon film reduces the surface reflection losses of the incident laser radiation and hosts uniformly distributed B4C particles at the surface. Morphological and metallurgical changes in the laser treated region are examined by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The surface microhardness is measured and the residual stress developed at the surface is determined by using the XRD technique. It is found that dense layer is formed at the surface because of the high cooling rates and a columnar structure is observed in the region next to the dense layer. B4C particles remain in the solid phase in the surface region due to its high melting temperature. The presence of carbon film resulted in the formation of Al4C3 at the surface and AlN is also formed because of the high pressure nitrogen assisting gas.

Among many available coping mechanisms, farmers adjust some of their farming practices. This article aims at exploring observed changes in the agricultural calendar as a response to climate variability in northern Benin. Interviews with local experts (agricultural extension officers and local leaders such as heads of farmer and village organisations) and group discussions with farmers were organised. A household survey was also conducted on 336 maize producers to highlight the factors affecting decisions to adjust the agricultural calendar as a coping mechanism against climate variability. As a general trend, the duration of the cropping season in northern Benin is getting longer with slight differences among and within agro-ecological zones, implying a higher risk of operating under time-inefficient conditions. Farmers receive very limited support from agricultural extension services and therefore design their agricultural calendar on the basis of personal experience. Socio-economic characteristics, maize farming characteristics as well as farm location determine the decision to adjust the agricultural calendar. Consequently, providing farmers with climate related information could ensure a rational and time-efficient management of the agricultural calendar. Moreover, research and extension institutions should help in establishing and popularising clear agricultural calendars while taking into account the driving forces of behaviours towards the adjustment of farming practices as a climate variability response. © 2014 The Authors.","Agricultural calendar; Benin; Climate variability; Coping mechanism; Driving forces; Farmers' behaviours",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906733673

The EU member-states have generally been regarded as modern and prosperous, with high and stable energy consumption and large, high-tech wind industries. China, in contrast, is an emerging economy under authoritarian rule, with rapidly-increasing energy consumption and comparatively little domestic R&D in wind turbine technology. What can explain the fast development of wind-power production capacity in the EU and in China, despite the very different political systems and basic preconditions? Applying the method of 'most-different systems design', this paper shows how, in both regions, large-scale investment in wind power has come about through a specific set of political motivations. These include strong governmental support policies based on similar main aims, like security of energy supply, creating future-oriented industries and employment, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions and local pollution. Combined these three factors together, broadly perceived might also explain political motivations driving rapid investment in new renewable energy sources elsewhere. © 2014 The Authors.

One approach to addressing these challenges is through an agent-based architecture for coordinating locally-connected energy micro-grids, each of which manages its own local energy production, distribution, and storage. By integrating these micro-grids into a larger network structure, there is the opportunity for them to be more responsive to local needs and hence more cost effective overall. In such an arrangement, the micro-grids have agents that can choose to resell their excess energy in an open, regional market in alignment with respect to their specific goals (which could be to reduce carbon emissions or to maximize their financial outcomes). In this study, we have investigated how agents operating in such an open environment can learn to optimize their individual trading strategies by employing Markov-Decision-Process-based reasoning and reinforcement learning. We empirically show that our learning trading strategies improve net profit loss by up to 29% and can reduce carbon emissions by 78% when compared to the original (non-learning) trading strategies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Micro-grids; Multi-agent systems; Power trading; Renewable energy","Carbon; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Electric power distribution; Energy policy; Intelligent agents; Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; Wind power; Agent-based architecture; Clean energy sources; Intelligent learning; Micro grid; Open environment; Power trading; Renewable energies; Trading strategies; Multi agent systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911976807

Two abundant renewable energy sources, solar and wind, are increasingly cost-competitive and also offer the potential of decentralized, and hence more robust, sourcing. However, the intermittent nature of solar and wind power can present difficulties in connection with integrating them into the main electric power grid. One measure that can address this issue of local, temporal energy deficits is to organize local micro-grid societies in which excess power is traded to those members that need it by market exchange. Different communities may employ differing strategies and policies with respect to their attitudes concerning environmental sustainability and financial outcomes. In this connection it can be valuable to have modeling facilities available that can assist communities to predict what may happen under various circumstances in a society employing mixed trading and storage strategies. In this paper we present an agent-based modeling approach that can be used to examine various strategies that can be used in connection with battery storage and market-based energy trading strategies for a set of communities locally connected into an electric micro-grid. We demonstrate that by means of agent-based what-if simulations, battery strategies can be selected that provide financial advantages to local communities and also lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions (from a policy modeling perspective). © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","Micro-grid; Multi-agent system; Renewable energy; Strategies","Commerce; Data privacy; Electricity; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent agents; Multi agent systems; Network security; Societies and institutions; Wind power; Agent-based model; Electric power grids; Environmental sustainability; Essential elements; Micro grid; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Strategies; Electric power distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903582715

To estimate carbon density of Pinus tabulaeformis plantation ecosystems for different stand ages more accurately, we tracked 9-, 23-, 33-and 47-year-old P. tabulaeformis plantations in the Hilly Loess Plateau region of China and studied the carbon content in plant organs, litter and soil, as well as the carbon storage and its allocation in different layers. By analyzing carbon sequestration characteristics of P. tabulaeformis plantations at different age stages, this paper provides a theoretical basis of evaluating the function of carbon sinks in P. tabulaeformis plantations during forest management. In addition, the carbon density of the forest ecosystems was measured and evaluated based on ""The Research Norms of Chinese Forest Ecosystem Carbon Sequestration, Rate and Potential"", which provides a basis for comparative study of cross-regional forest types. The main results were as follows. (1) Average biomass in the different components of the studied forest ecosystems were in the order of: arbor layer (76.12 t/ hm2) &gt; litter layer (14.56 t/ hm2) &gt; undergrowth vegetation layer (combined herb and shrub layer vegetation; 3.66 t/ hm2). The biomass of the arbor layer of P. tabulaeformis increased with stand age. The Pinus arbor organ biomass was as follows: stem accounted for the largest share, followed by leaves and roots, the contribution of branches and bark were minimal. Undergrowth biomass first increased then decreased with increasing tree age, while litterfall biomass increased with tree age. The biomasses of shrub organs were markedly different, which showed that biomass of branches &gt; roots &gt; leaves. In the herb layer, the above-ground portion of biomass was significantly greater than the underground portion. (2) The average carbon content was 50.2% for P. tabulaeformis and for different organs the order was leaves (53.3%) &gt; branches (51.4%) &gt; bark (50.6%) &gt; stems (49.8%) &gt; roots (47.3%). The amount of carbon stored in the shrub, herb and litter layers was 44.5%, 43.8% and 40.6%, respectively. Shrub carbon content of various organs was in the order of branches (46.0%) &gt; leaves (44.8%) &gt; roots (42.5%). The carbon content of herbs was greater in the above-ground portion (45.2%) than in the underground portion (40.2%). Forest age had no significant effect on the carbon content of arbor organs. The carbon content of different shrub organs was significantly different for each herb species. The carbon content of soil (0-100 cm) was between 0.3 and 2.7% and had an obvious vertical distribution characteristic: the surface soil layer had a higher carbon content and carbon content gradually decreased as soil depth increased. (3) Forest age was a dominant factor affecting the carbon density of the P. tabulaeformis forest community. The carbon density of 9-, 23-, 33-and 47-year-old P. tabulaeformis forests was 70.49, 100.94, 167.09 and 144.93 t/ hm2, respectively. Carbon density in different components of the studied forest ecosystems was in the order of: soil layer &gt; vegetation layer &gt; litter layer. The proportion of vegetation carbon density increased with increasing tree age continually, whereas that of soil carbon density had the opposite pattern. 9-, 23-, 33-and 47-year-old P. tabulaeformis forest arbor layer carbon densities increased with stand age (0.90, 26.56, 59.73 and 60.20 t/ hm2, respectively), as did carbon density in the litter layer. The vegetation layer and soil layer carbon density first increased and then decreased with increasing stand age.","Artificial forest; Carbon content; Carbon density; Hilly Loess Plateau; Pinus tabulaeformis","aboveground biomass; biomass allocation; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; coniferous tree; evergreen tree; forest ecosystem; forest management; litterfall; plateau; soil horizon; vegetation cover; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899977436

The results show that the progressive tax rate has less impact on regional economy, but plays a constant role of energy conservation and emissions reduction in the long term. Although independent carbon tax can reduce CO2 emissions effectively, it has strong negative impact on the domestic economy.

It explores how a geographic-based information system can be applied to designing an algae-powered housing environment at the level of an urban neighborhood, in which the algae system is taken as a design intervention to promote energy performance and carbon reduction of the urban system. A Geodesign model is suggested for managing the coupled system that integrates algae cultivation and urban systems as ""design for change"". By extending the system boundary from a closed algae cultivation system to an open neighborhood-scale urban environment, the design of a new closeloop network configuration contributes to the increase of energy performance and biofuel production and the reduction of fossil fuel consumption, waste stream flow and the carbon emissions of the urban system. The proposed Geodesign framework informs six stages of process for the coupled system: the objective model to set the goalasthe ""Net-zero"" neighborhood;the representational model to collect and organize data;the performance model to measurethe energy, biomass, waste stream and water flows;the scenario model to propose possible future paths at different spatial scales;the evaluation model to reexamine the performance of the newly designed coupled system; and the decision making model to make choices. The sixstages are then applied to a preliminary test case of four sites along an urban-rural gradient in Atlanta.This paper concludes with design and planning parameters for designing an ecological urban district in accordance with the scientific knowledge and technical criteria for algal biofuel production and sustainable urban living. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Algae; Carbon emission; Energy performance; Geodesign; Performance metrics; Urban design",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922344731

Using the performance evaluation table, the effect of FA on the lifecycle CO2 assessment of concrete columns and beams in an office building was examined under the different concrete strengths. The parametric study clearly showed that high-strength concrete is favorable to the reduction of lifecycle CO2 amount of concrete columns, whereas the reduction is not expected for concrete beams.

The multi-terminal HVDC network topology and protection allocation and configuration are discussed with DC circuit breaker and protection relay configurations studied for different fault conditions. A detailed protection scheme is designed with a solution that does not require relay communication. Advanced understanding of protection system design and operation is necessary for reliable and safe operation of the meshed HVDC system under fault conditions. Meshed-HVDC systems are important as they will be used to interconnect large-scale offshore wind generation projects. Offshore wind generation is growing rapidly and offers a means of securing energy supply and addressing emissions targets whilst minimising community impacts. There are ambitious plans concerning such projects in Europe and in the Asia-Pacific region which will all require a reliable yet economic system to generate, collect, and transmit electrical power from renewable resources. Collective offshore wind farms are efficient and have potential as a significant low-carbon energy source. However, this requires a reliable collection and transmission system. Offshore wind power generation is a relatively new area and lacks systematic analysis of faults and associated operational experience to enhance further development. Appropriate fault protection schemes are required and this chapter highlights the process of developing and assessing such schemes.

The P-pOMC is synthesized by nanocasting method using platelet ordered mesoporous silica as template. Various characterizations reveal that the P-pOMC materials have covalently bound P atoms with carbon framework for facilitation of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and also have very high surface area with uniform distribution of short mesoporous channels for unhindered mass transfer.

Based on Landsat TM/ETM+ images, land use / cover changes in Tonghua City of Changbai Mountain area, China during 1986-2008 was analyzed in this study. The carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems of the study area was quantitatively estimated using InVEST model. CA-Marcov model was used to forecast land use / cover and carbon storage in the year of 2016. The results show that total carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems of Tonghua in 1986 was about 7932.64×104tons. From 1986 to 1996, carbon storage reduced by 0.6%. However, it increased by 0.1% in 2000 and 4% in 2008, respectively. The forecasted carbon storage in 2016 would be 8296.56×104tons, increased by 4.6%. The total area of forest in Tonghua was 8.0×103km2 in 1986, taking up 54% of the land. In 1996, the percentage of forestland dropped to 53%, while it rose to 54% in 2000 and 59% in 2008. The predicted area of woodland in 2016 increased to 10338.7km2, which might be influenced by the implementation of returning farmland to forest project since 1998.

Third-generation solar cells (SCs) are solution processed SCs based on semiconducting organic macromolecules, inorganic nanoparticles or hybrids. This review considers and compares three types of promising 3rd-generation SCs: polymer:fullerene, hybrid polymer and perovskite SCs. The review considers work reported since an earlier review (Saunders et al., Adv. Colloid Interface Sci., 2008, 138, 1) and highlights the great progress that has been made in each area. We consider the operation principles for each SC type and also review the state-of-the-art devices. The polymer:fullerene and hybrid polymer SC open circuit voltages are compared to values predicted from the well-known Scharber equation and similarities and differences discussed. The perovskite SCs are also considered and their remarkable rate of power conversion efficiency performance increase is discussed. The review considers the requirements for large-scale deployment in the contexts of semiconducting polymer and hole transport matrix synthesis and materials selection. It is concluded that the 3rd-generation SC technologies discussed here are well placed for major contribution to large scale energy production. (This has already been partially demonstrated for polymer:fullerene SCs.) Looking further ahead we propose that several of the 3rd-generation SCs considered here have excellent potential to provide the low cost large-scale deployment needed to meet the terawatt challenge for solar electricity generation.

Although parameters in convective schemes can be calibrated using observations to reduce model errors, it is not clear if the optimal parameters calibrated based on regional data can robustly improve model skill across different model resolutions and climatic regimes. In this study, this issue is investigated using a regional modeling framework based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. To quantify the response and sensitivity of model performance to model parameters, we identified 5 key input parameters and specified their ranges in the Kain-Fritsch (KF) convection scheme in WRF, and calibrated them across different spatial resolutions, climatic regimes, and radiation schemes using observed precipitation data. Results show that the optimal values for 5 input parameters in the KF scheme are similar, and model sensitivity and error exhibit similar dependence on the input parameters for all experiments conducted in this study, despite differences in the precipitation climatology. We found that the model overall performances in simulating precipitation are relatively more sensitive to the coefficients of downdraft and entrainment mass flux, as well as to the starting height of downdraft. However, we found that rainfall biases-which are probably more related to structural errors-still exist over some regions in the simulation, even with the optimal para meters. This suggests that further studies are needed to identify the sources of uncertainties, as well as to reduce the model biases or structural errors, both of which are associated with missed or misrepresented physical processes and/or potential problems with the modeling. © Inter-Research 2014.","Calibration; Convection scheme; Optimization; Parameters; Regional climate model; Sensitivity; WRF","Calibration; Climate models; Errors; Models; Optimization; Precipitation (meteorology); Uncertainty analysis; Weather forecasting; Convective parameterization schemes; Parameters; Precipitation climatology; Regional climate modeling; Sensitivity; Sources of uncertainty; Weather research and forecasting models; WRF; Parameterization; calibration; climate effect; climate modeling; climatology; parameterization; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; simulation; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897137805

Buildings are the major energy consumers, and a set of buildings are connected by distributed energy resources (DERs) such as chillers and boilers in certain building clusters, e.g., a school campus or residential community. Optimized operation of such building clusters, however, is challenging. Proper device and building models are needed, and it is difficult and impractical to control everything at the cluster level. This paper presents integrated optimization of building clusters with buildings and DERs to reduce energy costs and CO2 emissions. From the energy and emission point of view, energy networks of buildings, devices, and water/electricity networks are established for energy generation, conversation, storage and utilization, and emissions. The problem is to match different types of energy demand of buildings and supplies from devices with time-varying electricity and gas prices. A mixed-integer model for a small building cluster is established. To coordinate buildings and devices, our idea is to use multipliers as shadow prices in a decomposition and coordination structure. Our surrogate Lagrangian relaxation method is used to solve the problem. With breakthroughs in multiplier updating directions and step-sizing formulas, computational efforts are much reduced. Preliminary optimization and simulation results show that total energy costs and emissions are reduced by optimized operation, e.g., making direct use of energy resource and avoiding unnecessary energy conversion. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Buildings; Cost reduction; Costs; Energy management; Energy resources; Coordination structures; Distributed Energy Resources; Energy efficient building; Environmental concerns; Integrated optimization; Lagrangian relaxation method; Mixed integer models; Residential communities; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939638224

The author's results of study of red threshold control of classic photoelectric effect were the basis for the work implementation. This effect was predicted theoretically and observed experimentally during irradiation of nanoscale carbon structure of planar-edge type by stream of low-energy photons. The variation of the accelerating voltage within a small range allows you to change photoelectric threshold for carbon in a wide range - from UV to IR. This is the consequence of the localization of electrostatic field at tip of the blade planar structure and of changes in the conditions of non-equilibrium electrons tunneling from the boundary surface of the cathode into the vacuum. The generation of nonequilibrium electrons in the carbon film thickness of 20 nm has a high speed which provides high performance of photodetector. The features of the use of nanoscale carbon structure photocurrent registration as in the prethreshold regime, and in the mode of field emission existence are discussed. The results of simulation and experimental examination of photosensor samples are given. It is shown that the observed effect is a single-photon tunneling. This in combination with the possibility of highspeed dynamic tuning determines the good perspectives for creation of new devices working in the mode of select multiple operating spectral bands for the signal recording. The architecture of such devices is expected to be significantly simpler than the conventional ones, based on the use of tunable filters.","Broadband photodetector; Carbon nanoscale structure; Dynamically tunable photodetector; Multiple spectral band photodetector; Single-photon photodetector","Carbon films; Field emission cathodes; Nanotechnology; Optical sensors; Photodetectors; Photoelectricity; Photons; Photosensitivity; Accelerating voltages; Experimental examination; Nanoscale structure; Non-equilibrium electrons; Photoelectric threshold; Single-photon photodetector; Spectral band; Tunable photodetectors; Carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900993245

However, massive integration of electric vehicles (EVs) may cause a trouble on power grid. This point of view looks at the future state of EV development, charging scheduling and drivers' behaviors are becoming increasingly important to charging management strategy. An optimal charging management leads to minimum effects on power grid, reducing peak power via vehicle to grid (V2G) mode and lower charging costs. In order to make an optimum charging management strategy, it requires some information of driver behavior, such as daily driving, parking times and usage frequency of the vehicle. At this perspective, a campus based driver behavior is gathered with face to face survey in Yildiz Technical University, Turkey.

Given the background that most of the artificial carbon emissions are resulted from the energy consumption sector and the energy is also the key element resource for economic development, this paper investigated the relationship between CO2 emission, fossil energy consumption, and economic growth in the period 1970-2008 of nine European countries, based on the approach of Granger Causality Test, followed by the risk analysis on impacts of CO2 reduction to local economic growth classified by the indicator of causality degree. The results show that there are various feedback causal relationships between carbon emission, energy consumption and economic growth, with both unidirectional and dual-directional Granger causality.

Considering efficiency and safety, it is very important to evaluate this new type heat exchanger under unstable working condition, especially in high pressure or high temperature systems. In this article, a numerical study is carried out to investigate the heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics in a CO2-H2O heat exchange process just like CO2 cooling or H2O heating. The results show that the heat transfer coefficient in the CO2 side has a parabolic distribution along the flow direction and moves forward or backward when changing the CO2 mass flow rate, which plays a major role in constituting the heat exchanger's main thermal resistance in the entrance and exit region. In a CO2 cooling process, the heat transfer coefficient in CO2 side will gradually increase when the temperature of CO2 decreases to approach the pseudo-critical point, which may be caused by the increasing specific heat. However, the heat transfer coefficient will gradually decrease when the temperature is away from the pseudo-critical point, which will be unfavorable for further reduction in heat exchanger size. Unlike in water side, the pressure drop per length of CO2 gradually decreases in the flow direction. The Filonenko equation overestimates the total pressure drop.","Computational fluid dynamics; Convection; Heat exchanger; PCHE; Supercritical CO2; Unstable working condition","Carbon dioxide; Chemical bonds; Computational fluid dynamics; Drops; Efficiency; Etching; Heat convection; Heat resistance; Heat transfer coefficients; High temperature applications; Mass transfer; Pressure drop; Printed circuits; Specific heat; Timing circuits; Two phase flow; Heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics; High-temperature systems; Parabolic distribution; PCHE; Printed circuit heat exchangers; Supercritical CO2; Thermal-hydraulic performance; Unstable working condition; Heat exchangers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085406409

Our research makes the following conclusions: Carbon taxes will restrain economy growth and curb carbon emissions, but the effects will continually decrease with the enhancement of carbon taxes. Increasing carbon taxes will increase output elasticities of capital and labour, but decrease output elasticity of energy. Therefore, it will be beneficial for the capital and labour to replace energy gradually and contribute to decreasing energy consumption and carbon emissions. With the enhancement of carbon taxes, the effects of carbon emissions intensity, energy intensity and output on carbon emissions will continually decrease. Carbon emissions intensity has the most sensitive effect on carbon emissions, followed by energy intensity and output. In order to realize low-carbon development, China should develop low-carbon energy, and then try to improve energy efficiency and take the economic growth speed issues into account. © 2014, Gh.

A field investigation of N 2O using a static closed chamber-gas chromatography revealed that the average N2O fluxes in tea fields with 225 kg N ha-1 yr-1 fertilizer application were 9.4 ± 6.2 times higher than those of woodlands. Accordingly, it is urgent to develop practices for mitigating N2O emissions from tea fields. By liquid-state fermentation of sweet potato starch wastewater and solid-state fermentation of paddy straw with application of Trichoderma viride, we provided the tea plantation with biofertilizer containing 2.4 t C ha-1 and 58.7 kg N ha-1. Compared to use of synthetic N fertilizer, use of biofertilizer at 225 kg N ha-1 yr-1 significantly reduced N 2O emissions by 33.3%-71.8% and increased the tea yield by 16.2%-62.2%.

The key impact factors for the two components were different, and hence the long-term variation characteristics of the direct runoff and base flow were of great difference. The Hun-Taizi River Catchments, Northeast China, were regarded as main sources of water supply for agriculture, industrial and domestic use of Liaoning province, China. Climate and land use were regarded as the two main factors influencing streamflow. The observed data show that the total streamflow in the upper reaches of these watersheds was reduced. However, effects of climate and land use on streamflow components in the entire watersheds have not been deeply studied, which undoubtedly affect the management and utilization of water resources in these catchments. In this paper, two non-parametric test methods, Mann-Kendall's test and Spearman's Rho test were used to analyse annual change of runoff and climate variations in the hydrological stations established in the Hun-Taizi River Catchments, Northeast China. Results showed that streamflow components of the Hun-Taizi river catchment decreased under the combined effects of climate change and land use variability, while each factor had different effects on direct runoff and base flow. Mean annual streamflow and its components were positively correlated with mean annual precipitation and woodland coverage; and negatively correlated with temperature and farmland and construction land coverage. The influences of average climate and land use on mean annual direct runoff were more intense than mean annual base flow. Climate variations speeded up the changing rate of annual direct runoff and base flow; and land use changes slowed down the changing rate. Differently from the effects on mean annual values, the influences of long-term precipitation variability and land use changes on base flow were more obvious than direct runoff. Climate changes played more important role than land use variability in affecting long-term variations of annual direct runoff and base flow due to the smaller variability of land use in this catchment. Thus, climate variation should be considered as the dominant factor to evaluate the management and utilization of water resources, hydrological processes and ecosystems in the regions of Northeast China.","Base flow; Climate change; Direct runoff; Hun-Taizi River Watersheds; Land use; Mann-Kendall's test; Northeast China; Spearman's Rho test; Streamflow","article; China; climate change; environmental impact; hydrology; land drainage; land use; methodology; river ecosystem; statistical analysis; water flow; watershed management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896132151

However, very little is known about the formation and depletion of polychlorinated dibenzo. p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) from this thermal process. In this study, an electric arc furnace (EAF) dust treatment plant adopting the SAF process was investigated and compared to the plant adopting the Waelz process. The predominant contributor of PCDD/F I-TEQ input was the EAF dusts, accounting for 98.4% of the total. The PCDD/F contents in the generated fly ashes of the SAF were extremely low, as almost all the organic compounds for PCDD/F formation were decomposed by the high operating temperatures (1500-1700. °C) of the SAF. Therefore, the PCDD/F emission factor of the SAF process (46.9. μg. I-TEQ/tonne-EAF dust) was significantly lower than that of the Waelz process (840-1120. μg. I-TEQ/tonne-EAF dust). Its PCDD/F output/input ratios (0.23 and 0.50 based on mass and toxicity) were also lower than those of the Waelz process plant (0.62 and 1.19). Therefore, the SAF process is superior to the Waelz process in reducing the potential of PCDD/F formation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Distribution; Fly ash; PCDD/Fs; Stack; Submerged arc furnace","Distribution; Electric arc furnace dust; Emission factors; High operating temperature; Metallurgical industry; PCDD/Fs; Stack; Submerged arc furnace; Dust control; Fly ash; Furnaces; Electric furnaces; dibenzofuran; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; dust; emission; fly ash; PCDD; PCDF; toxicity; air pollution control; article; chemical analysis; controlled study; dechlorination; dust; electric arc furnace dust; fly ash; furnace; halogenation; high temperature; intermethod comparison; material state; metallurgy; priority journal; submerged arc furnace; synthesis; Waelz process; waste component removal; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882747801

This phenomenon cannot be explained by conventional understanding derived from liquid anaerobic digestion. This study proposed that the high TS content-caused mass diffusion limitation may be taken responsibility for the observed methane production deterioration. Based on this hypothesis, a new SS-AD model was developed by taking into account the mass diffusion limitation and hydrolysis inhibition. The good agreement between model simulation and the experimental as well as literature data verified that the observed reduction in volumetric methane production rate could be ascribed to hydrolysis inhibition as a result of the mass diffusion limitation in SS-AD.","Anaerobic digestion; Diffusion; Hydrolysis; Inhibition; Methane","Biomass; Computer simulation; Diffusion; Diffusion in solids; Enzyme inhibition; Hydrolysis; Methane; Waste management; Bioenergy productions; Cellulosic biomass; Literature data; Mass diffusion; Methane production; Model simulation; Solid-state anaerobic digestions; Total solids; Anaerobic digestion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911484693

Field work for the gas production trial began in early 2012. Coring and logging operations were conducted to prepare for the gas hydrate production trial. On March 12th, 2013, JOGMEC succeeded in extracting methane gas from the hydrate-bearing sediments by the depressurization method and approximately 120, 000 cubic meters of methane gas were produced totally. The production finally terminated due to the increase in sand production. It indicates the importance of evaluation the state of wellbore in order to produce methane gas safety and efficiently. It calls for an analysis to predict the stress changes and plastic strain evolution of wellbore during the life of well. Hence, a wellbore model, specifically designed for methane gas production, is necessary to assess the potential risks associated with the construction and production stage. This paper describes a finite element approach, which mainly takes into account of (a) all the typical processes associated with wellbore construction and gas production and (b) the interaction between cement-casing-formation. Based on this approach, a finite element model, which includes the layered soil profile, cement, casing, gravel and sand screen, was developed in ABAQUS to simulate the gas production trial at East Nankai Trough in March, 2013. The Methane Hydrate Critical State (MHCS) model (Uchida et al., 2012), which was developed to simulate the geomechanical response of the methane hydrate bearing sediment, was incorporated into this finite element model. It presents results of coupled ground deformation and pore fluid flow analysis of a gas production wellbore from a methane hydrate formation. The study focused on the short- and long-term mechanical behaviour of the critical physical components at and near the wellbore by simulating the construction processes of the wellbore as well as the production stage. The interaction between cement-casing-formation was examined in detail.

In addition, six key points of concern in the planning process are identified. These include low-carbon estimation and index control, overall planning of infrastructure, linkage between city planning and other special low-carbon eco-planning, investment and financing and operation modes, planning management mechanisms, and the construction of a growing energy system which is combined with a project schedule. Finally, it is suggested that energy planning should be standardized as soon as possible and planned comprehensively from the aspects of technology, commerce, and management, in order to realize the low-carbon target. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","Index; Infrastructure; Low-carbon; Regional energy planning; Standardization",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894155831

Consequently, it becomes reasonable to consider large-scale plantations for mitigating increases in atmospheric concentrations by carbon sequestration and to study local modifications of weather and climate. This work investigates the impact of plantations in Oman and the Sonora Desert in Mexico assuming an area of about 100km × 100 km. For this purpose, an advanced land surface-atmospheremodelwas adapted to the local changes of land cover and operated on the convectionpermitting scale. Explicit simulations of the impact of the plantation on soil-vegetation-atmosphere feedback were performed for a duration of 1 yr.Astrongmodification of diurnal cycles of variables such as surface fluxes, temperature, and boundary layer depth was found. Over the plantations, the mean temperature decreased as a result of nonlinear changes of the diurnal cycle caused by less warming during the day than cooling during the night. Moreover, the plantations caused an increase in vertical instability and a modification of the horizontal flow leading to the development of convergence zones. During several isolated cases in summer, this process led to convection initiation and precipitation with an enhancement of about 30mmin both areas, respectively.

The effects of EGR and boost pressure on RCCI combustion were studied by using a multi-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. The model was first compared with a previous CFD model, which has been validated against steady-state experimental data of gasolinediesel RCCI in a multi-cylinder light duty engine. An RCCI piston with a compression ratio of 15:1 was then proposed to improve the combustion and emissions at high load. The simulation results showed that 18 bar indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) could be achieved with gasoline-diesel RCCI at an EGR rate of 35% and equivalence ratio of 0.96, while the peak pressure rise rate (PPRR) and engine combustion efficiency could both be controlled at reasonable levels. Simulations using both early and late direct-injection (DI) of diesel fuel showed that RCCI combustion at high load is very sensitive to variations of the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) amount. Higher IMEP is obtained by using early diesel injection, and it is less sensitive to EGR variation compared to late diesel injection. Reduced unburned hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), soot and slightly more nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions were seen for early diesel injection. HC, CO and soot emissions were found to be more sensitive to EGR variation at late diesel injection timings. However, there was little difference in terms of peak pressure, efficiencies, PPRR and phasing under varying EGR rates. The effect of boost pressure on RCCI at high load operating conditions was also studied at different EGR rates. It was found that combustion and emissions were improved, and the sensitivity of the combustion and emission to EGR was reduced with higher boost pressures. In addition, cases with similar combustion phasing and reasonable PPRR were analyzed by using an experimentally validated GT-Power model. The results indicated that although higher IMEP was generated at higher boost pressures, the brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) was similar compared to that obtained with lower boost pressures due to higher pumping losses. © 2014 by ASME.",,"Carbon monoxide; Computational fluid dynamics; Diesel engines; Direct injection; Efficiency; Exhaust gas recirculation; Gasoline; Nitrogen oxides; Soot; Brake mean effective pressures; Combustion efficiencies; Compression ignition; Computational Fluid Dynamics codes; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Indicated mean effective pressure; Operating condition; Unburned hydrocarbons; Combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919372460

Carbon dioxide from power plants is one of the main sources. Therefore it is essential to reduce the CO2 emission from power plant flue gas. Postcombustion carbon capture is the optimal choice in near-to meddle-term, since it does not need to change the configuration of the power plants essentially. Chemical absorption with amine-based solvents is currently the state-of-the-art technology for postcombustion carbon capture. This paper introduces the typical CO2 amine absorption process and analyses the main problems during the absorption process. To make the process more efficient, several improvements were investigated: increasing gas-liquid contacting area, searching for new type of reactant, and dilution of the aqueous fraction with organic liquids. The present study aims to summarize the improvements in amine scrubbing process for CO2 capture and forecast the promising research directions in the future. © 2014 The Authors.

The heat supply systems based on fossil fuel burning are of low energy efficiency as well as high air pollution. Air source electricity heat pump (ASAHP) was analyzed to be energy-saving for heating in cold regions. In order to select suitable system for different areas, the primary energy efficiency of electricity heating, coal boiler, gas boiler, electrical heat pump, and ASAHP-driven by various heat sources are compared. Combing the weather characteristics in different areas, the applicability of different systems in China are investigated in the energy efficiency point of view. Results show that the primary energy efficiency of ASAHP is generally higher than that of ASEHP except when the air temperature is very high. Both ASEHP and ASAHP are efficient in the hot summer and warm winter area for domestic hot water. And direct gas-fired ASAHP is the best choice in hot summer and cold winter area, temperate area, cold area as well as severe cold area. Additionally, hot water-driven ASAHP using gas boiler is the second choice for heating in hot summer/cold winter area and temperate area, and for both heating and domestic hot water in cold and severe cold areas.

The object of this study was to utilize the concept of heritage climatology together with a spatial analysis approach that includes respective climate parameter risks to cultural heritage sites. The study area, the island of Taiwan, is located between the Ryukyu isles in the north and the Philippine archipelagos in the south. It lies across the Tropic of Cancer, and its climate is influenced by the East Asian Monsoon. Northern and central Taiwan has a humid subtropical climate while most of southern Taiwan has a tropical monsoon climate. With nearly 300 hundred years of history, Taiwan displays much cultural diversity, which is the result of racial mingling of indigenous peoples, Spanish, Dutch, Chinese, and Japanese since ancient times, leaving behind rich cultural heritage sites.This study used different maps to gain information about potential climatic impact on Taiwan’s cultural heritage and landscape. There are four kinds of map that use ArcGIS to analyze and demarcate regions not only by climate parameters but also by risk to heritage. These four types of map are climate maps, heritage climate maps, heritage maps and heritage risk maps. By comparison of our field study results and heritage risk maps, we found that in northeastern areas of this island wooden materials of heritage have a higher risk of structural cracking, color fading and bio-degradation, while northern part, central and southern mountainous areas have a higher risk of weathering of stone materials. In addition, metal materials in southern Taiwan have a high risk of corrosion due to air pollution and acid rain. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Cultural heritage; Heritage climate; Heritage conservation; Heritage risk; Spatial analysis","Acid rain; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Historic preservation; Maps; Risk perception; Spatial variables measurement; Weathering; Climate parameters; Cultural diversity; Cultural heritages; East Asian monsoon; Heritage climate; Heritage conservation; Spatial analysis; Subtropical climates; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911904033

Biochar is thought to be a useful soil amendment to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here, a field study was conducted to compare the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) under different irrigation methods (drip irrigation (D) and furrow irrigation (F)) and fertilization regimes (conventional fertilization (C) and conventional fertilization + biochar (B)) during the cotton growth season. The accumulated N2O emissions were significantly lower with FB, DC, and DB than with FC by 28.8%, 36.1%, and 37.6%, while accumulated CH4 uptake was 264.5%, 226.7%, and 154.2% higher with DC, DB, and FC than that with FB, respectively. Irrigation methods showed a significant effect on total global warming potential (GWP) and yield-scaled GWP (P &lt; 0.01).

In this work, 20% ABE with component ratio of 3:6:1 and 80% ultra-sulfur diesel by volume, referred as ABE20, and pure diesel, referred as D100, were injected and combusted in a constant volume chamber with the ability to mimic high temperature and high pressure conditions of real diesel cylinder near the top dead center. By adjusting intake partial pressure and injection timing, the ambient oxygen concentration and temperature for fuel injection can be controlled. Ambient temperatures were set at 1100K, 900K and 700K to cover conventional temperature combustion and low temperature combustion, while the ambient oxygen concentrations were set at 21%, 16% and 11% to cover different EGR ratios separately. Spray and natural flame images were captured by a high speed camera coupled with a copper vapor laser as a light source. The results show that spray liquid penetration and soot liftoff length are shorter and much longer for ABE20 than those for D100 separately under all tested conditions, which form a much bigger gap from spray tip to the combustion area for ABE20. A big gap reduces the local equivalence ratio at the combustion area and then suppresses the soot formation due to the gap is the most effective area for air-fuel mixing processes. Indeed, the natural flame luminosity which represents the soot emission level of ABE20 is significantly lower than that of D100 at all tested conditions. At the same time, ABE20 performed a similar combustion phasing with D100 under high ambient temperature, but experienced an aggressive retardation under low ambient temperatures especially with low ambient oxygen concentrations. In addition, ABE20 did not show a stronger concentrated premixed combustion since its heat release rate peak is lower than that of D100, which was also confirmed by its longer combustion duration. Therefore, ABE20 expresses a high potential to reduce soot emissions but it also has to face combustion deterioration at low temperature combustion conditions. © 2014 by ASME.",,"Acetone; Deterioration; Diesel engines; Dust; Fermentation; Fuels; High speed cameras; Light sources; Oxygen; Soot; Temperature; Acetone butanol ethanols; Ambient oxygen concentrations; Constant volume chamber; Heat Release Rate (HRR); High temperature and high pressure; Local equivalence ratio; Low ambient temperatures; Low temperature combustion; Combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919341395

Managed by the Petroleum Technology Research Centre, Aquistore is built upon the learnings of the IEAGHG Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project, where over 22MT of CO2 have been stored in an oil field during EOR operations. As a global leader, PTRC has over a decade of experience in CO2 storage and monitoring work. Aquistore is Canada's first dedicated CO2 storage project, and is an integral component of SaskPower's Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Demonstration project - The world's first fully integrated CCS demonstration project from a coal-fired power plant. As an unique CCS project, Aquistore is providing buffer storage to this commercial CO2 capture plant and active oilfield EOR operations. In collaboration with SaskPower, Aquistore will be the first integrated project globally to demonstrate deep saline CO2 capture, transport, and storage on a commercial scale from a coal fired power plant. CO2 will be captured at unit 3 of the Boundary Dam powerstation (BD3), transported via underground pipeline to the Aquistore site, and injected to a depth of 3.4 km. The Winnipeg and Deadwood formations, which constitute the deepest units within the Williston Basin and were chosen as the target zone for CO2 injection. These geological formations have much greater capacity for storing CO2 than any oil reservoir in western Canada. The suitability of the storage complex was investigated through 3D characterization using high-resolution 3D seismic images and data from the injection and observation wells. These data show that: There are no significant faults in the immediate area of the storage site; the regional sealing formation is continuous in the area; and lastly, that the reservoir is not adversely affected by knolls on the surface of the underlying Precambrian basement. In the Aquistore project PTRC has brought together internationally recognized expertise and diverse interests. Research in monitoring methods is central to the Aquistore Project. A permanent areal seismic monitoring array has been deployed which comprises 650 geophones installed at 20 m depth on a 2.5x2.5 km regular grid. The objective of this array is to test ""sparse array"" seismic imaging and to provide continuous passive monitoring. This array is being utilized in conjunction and comparison with time-lapse 3D seismic imaging, continuous microseismic monitoring, vertical seismic profiling, cross-well seismic tomography, and broadband seismographs. Injection-related surface deformation monitoring is provided by InSAR analysis in conjunction with a network of tiltmeters and GPS stations. Electromagnetic surveys and gravimeters are also being used. In an effort to minimize surface impact these monitoring technologies - where possible - Have been collocated and solar-powered. Surface electromagnetic methods and time-lapse gravity monitoring will be tested in conjunction with deployment of a fibre-optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) line. A fibre-optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS) line is also installed. A unique fluid recovery system (FRS) as well as casing conveyed pressure and temperature gauges will contribute to the project's down-hole monitoring techniques. Aquistore's MMV program will test and develop effective methods for monitoring CO2 storage sites and ensure conformance of the storage process through continuous monitoring. This program is seeking to minimize the risk associated with any potential leakage of CO2 from the storage reservoir through early detection. Aquistore's MMV program has included an added focus on integrated monitoring methods such as the inclusion of non-seismic methods and constraints from reservoir flow simulations. Aquistore will provide an efficient, cost effective, and field-tested basis for designing effective MMV programs for other similar projects worldwide. © 2014 The Authors Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Active projects; Baselines; Canada; Ccs; CO2 storage; Deep saline storage; MMV; Saskachewan",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922933570

It remains unclear to what extent these strategies are generalizable or vary across regions. In this study we ask about three potential key factors influencing farming households' ability to adapt: access to weather information, household and agricultural production-related assets, and participation in local social institutions. We use a 12-country data set from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to explore the links between these three potential drivers of agricultural change and the likelihood that farmers made farm-associated changes, such as adopting improved crop varieties, increasing fertilizer use, investing in improved land management practices, and changing the timing of agricultural activities. We find evidence that access to weather information, assets, and participation in social institutions are associated with households that have reported making farming changes in recent years, although these results vary across countries and types of practices. Understanding these drivers and outcomes of farm-associated changes across different socio-economic and environmental conditions is critical for ongoing dialogues for climate-resilient strategies and policies for increasing the adaptive capacity of smallholders under climate change. © 2014 The Authors.","Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Agriculture; Climate change","adaptive management; agricultural policy; agricultural practice; climate change; cultivar; data set; decision making; farmers attitude; fertilizer application; geographical variation; land management; public access; smallholder; technology adoption; South Asia; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898419609

Aged manure may act as an inoculum and alter subsequent methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3) emissions when fresh manure is added to the system, compared to an empty storage that is filled with fresh manure. Completely emptying manure storages may be a practice to decrease gas emissions, however, little pilot-scale research has been conducted to directly quantify the inoculum effect. Therefore, we compared CH4, N2O, and NH3emissions from three pilot-scale slurry tanks (~10.5 m3each) filled with a mixture of fresh manure and an inoculum of previously stored manure (i.e., partial emptying) to three tanks that contained only fresh manure (i.e., complete emptying). Gas fluxes were continuously measured over 155 d of warm season storage using flow-through steady-state chambers. The absence of an inoculum significantly reduced CH4emissions by 56 % compared to partially emptied (inoculated) tanks, while there was no difference in N2O emissions. There was a significant 49 % reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because the overall budget (as CO2-eq) was dominated by CH4. Complete manure storage emptying could be an effective GHG mitigation strategy; however, NH3emissions were significantly higher from un-inoculated tanks due to slower crust formation. Therefore additional NH3abatement should be considered. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.","Ammonia; Cold climate; Inoculum; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Slurry","agricultural emission; ammonia; emission control; greenhouse gas; inoculation; manure; methane; nitrous oxide; slurry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027919907

The effects of a sprinkler system on the emissions of ammonia (NH3) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) were investigated. The duration of the study spanned three seasons: winter, spring, and summer. During the winter, NH3, PM10, and PM2.5 removal efficiencies were calculated to be 68%, 84%, and 60%, respectively. During the spring sampling campaign the removal efficiency of NH3 was calculated to be 7%. Due to an unusually high concentration of PM on the treatment floor during the spring, removal efficiencies for PM could not be calculated. Removal efficiencies for the summer season for NH3, PM10, and PM2.5 were calculated to be 22%, 89%, and 86%, respectively.

The extracted oils were subjected to enzymatic transesterification by the immobilized Candida rugosa lipase as a catalyst under room temperature with varies molar ratios of methanol to oil. The highest biodiesel yield for papaya seed oil and rambutan seed oil was found to be 96% and 89% at methanol-to-oil ratios of 6:1 and 8:1, respectively.

Therefore, a drivetrain for urban and commuter traffic is under development at the Institute of Internal Combustion Engines. The concept is based on a lean-burn air cooled two-cylinder natural gas engine, which is combined with a hydraulic hybrid system. On the one hand, lean-burn combustion leads to low nitrogen oxides emissions and high thermal efficiency. On the other hand, there are several challenges concerning inflammability, combustion stability and combustion duration. An approach to optimize the combustion process is the design of the piston bowl. The paper presents the engine concept at first. Afterwards, a description of design parameters for pistons of natural gas engines and a technical overview of piston bowls is given. Subsequent to the analysis of the different piston bowls, a new design approach is presented. Different geometries are discussed concerning their suitability for the use in a two-cylinder natural gas engine. The piston bowls are evaluated by three dimensional computational fluid dynamics (3D-CFD) simulations. Afterwards the results of measurements at the engine test bed are shown. Altogether, the paper describes design, geometry optimization, 3D-CFD-simulation and test bed results of a new piston bowl design for a small lean-burn natural gas engine.

Here, we combined stem chlorophyll fluorescence measurements with microsensor quantifications of bark O2 levels and oxygen gas exchange measurements of isolated current-year stem tissues of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) to investigate how bark and woody tissue photosynthesis impairs the oxygen status of stems. Measurements were made before bud break, when the axial path of oxygen supply via the xylem sap is impeded. At that time, bark O2 levels showed O2 concentrations below the atmospheric concentration, indicating hypoxic conditions or O2 deficiency within the inner bark, but the values were always far away from anoxic. Under illumination bark and woody tissue photosynthesis rapidly increased internal oxygen concentrations compared with plants in the dark, and thereby counteracted against localised hypoxia. The highest photosynthetic activity and oxygen release rates were found in the outermost cortex tissues. By contrast, rates of woody tissue photosynthesis were considerably lower, due to the high light attenuation of the bark and cortex tissues, as well as resistances in radial oxygen diffusion. Therefore, our results confirm that bark and woody tissue photosynthesis not only play a role in plant carbon economy, but may also be important for preventing low oxygen-limitations of respiration in these dense and metabolically active tissues. © CSIRO 2014.","corticular photosynthesis; oxygen deficiency; oxygen transport; stem photosynthesis; woody tissue photosynthesis; xylem.","anoxia; bark; chlorophyll; deciduous tree; gas exchange; hypoxia; photosynthesis; respiration; stem; xylem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906258356

In the paper, the CO2 working area was assumed to be either in the liquid or in the supercritical state and results for these two states were compared. The following power station data were used: a 900 MW pulverized coal-fired power plant with 90% of CO2 recovered (156.43 kg/s) and the monothanolamine absorption method for separating CO2 from flue gases. The results show that a subcooled liquid transport maximizes energy efficiency and minimizes the cost of CO2 transport over long distances under isothermal, adiabatic and heat transfer conditions. After CO2 is compressed and boosted to above 9 MPa, its temperature is usually higher than ambient temperature. The thermal insulation layer slows down the CO2 temperature decrease process, increasing the pressure drop in the pipeline.

Some options for a nuanced model of differentiation that addresses both responsibility and capability in a changing world are explored, such as new categories of countries, and some of the political issues that such a model might face are considered. The strengths and limitations of options for graduation based on 'objective' criteria such that countries could move between categories or 'graduate' - an option provided by the UNFCCC - are discussed. Countries could also choose to join another club (e.g. the G20), self-elect into categories or differentiate among themselves implicitly by accepting different commitments and actions. CBDR&RC will form part of the overall legally binding agreement, and must apply symmetry in some respects and differentiation in others to the commitments and actions contained therein. Some possible characteristics of CBDR&RC of relevance in a regime 'applicable to all' are outlined. These include promoting climate action and using mechanisms available in the UNFCCC to instil dynamism. Differentiation on mitigation must consider the distinctions between absolute and relative reductions, as well as commitments to outcomes and implementation. CBDR&RC should be applied to mitigation, adaptation, and the means of implementation.Policy relevanceIn Durban, Parties agreed to negotiate a regime 'applicable to all', which sent a political signal that there should be greater symmetry between nations. The world has changed since the UNFCCC was negotiated in 1992. It is now less helpful to think only in terms of two groups of countries (e.g. Annex I and non-Annex I), and evident that there are significant differences between member states. This requires a more nuanced interpretation of the principles of equity and CBDR&RC, which is an integral part of the UNFCCC. The options for the different approaches outlined in this article might help in the construction of a more nuanced model. All must do more, while some must do more still than others. To achieve this, some defining characteristics of CBDR&RC in a regime applicable to all are suggested. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","capability; CBDR&RC; differentiation; Durban Platform; equity; responsibility","environmental issue; environmental policy; environmental politics; equity; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890566412

In this work we use forest inventory data to parameterize a carbon cycle model to represent post-disturbance carbon trajectories of carbon pools and fluxes for specific forest types growing in high and low site productivity class settings. We then apply these trajectories to landscapes and regions based on forest age distributions derived from either the FIA data or from Landsat time series stacks (1985-2006) for 54 representative scenes throughout most of the conterminous United States. We estimate the net carbon uptake in forests caused by post-disturbance growth and decomposition (""regrowth sink"") for forested regions across the country. At the landscape scale, the prevailing condition of positive net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is in stark contrast to local patches with large sources, particularly in the west where fires and clear cuts create contiguous disturbed patches. At the continental scale, regional differences in disturbance rates reflect management patterns of high disturbance rates in the Southeastern and South Central states, and lower disturbance rates in the Northeast and Northern Lakes States. Despite low contemporary disturbance rates in the Northeast and Northern Lakes States (0.61 and 0.74%y-1), the regrowth sink there remains of moderate to large strength (88 and 57gCm-2y-1) owing to the continued legacy from historical clearing. Large regrowth sinks are also found in the Southeast, South Central, and Pacific Southwest regions (85, 86, and 95gCm-2 y-1) where disturbance rates also tend to be higher (1.59, 1.38, and 0.93%y-1). Overall, the Landsat-derived disturbance rates are elevated relative to FIA-derived rates (1.19 versus 0.93%y-1) particularly for western regions. The differences only modestly adjust regional- and continental-scale carbon budgets, reducing NEP from forest regrowth by about 8%. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon sequestration; Conterminous united states; Forest inventory and analysis; Landsat change detection; Net ecosystem productivity","Budget control; Carbon; Lakes; Carbon sequestration; Change detection; Conterminous united states; Forest inventory and analysis; Net ecosystem productivities; Forestry; carbon flux; forest inventory; Landsat; net ecosystem production; parameterization; regrowth; satellite imagery; time series; Carbon; Chelation; Cost Control; Ecosystems; Inventories; Lakes; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906944568

Due to coupling between engine and WHR system, control of these complex systems is challenging. This study presents an integrated energy and emission management strategy for an Euro-VI Diesel engine with WHR system. This Integrated Powertrain Control (IPC) strategy optimizes the CO2-NOx trade-off by minimizing online the operational costs associated with fuel and AdBlue consumption. Contrary to other control studies, the proposed control strategy optimizes overall engine-after-treatment-WHR system performance and deals with emission constraints. From simulations, the potential ofthis IPC strategy is demonstrated over a World Harmonized Transient Cycle (WHTC) using a high-fidelity simulation model. These results are compared with a state-of-the-art baseline engine control strategy. By applying the IPC strategy, an additional 2.6% CO2 reduction is achieved compare to the baseline strategy, while meeting the tailpipe NOx emission limit.

Mapping and monitoring this variation is essential if policy developments such as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) are to be known to have succeeded or failed. Results: We produce a map of carbon storage across the watershed of the Tanzanian Eastern Arc Mountains (33.9 million ha) using 1,611 forest inventory plots, and correlations with associated climate, soil and disturbance data. As expected, tropical forest stores more carbon per hectare (182 Mg C ha-1) than woody savanna (51 Mg C ha-1). However, woody savanna is the largest aggregate carbon store, with 0.49 Pg C over 9.6 million ha. We estimate the whole landscape stores 1.3 Pg C, significantly higher than most previous estimates for the region. The 95% Confidence Interval for this method (0.9 to 3.2 Pg C) is larger than simpler look-up table methods (1.5 to 1.6 Pg C), suggesting simpler methods may underestimate uncertainty. Using a small number of inventory plots with two censuses (n = 43) to assess changes in carbon storage, and applying the same mapping procedures, we found that carbon storage in the tree-dominated ecosystems has decreased, though not significantly, at a mean rate of 1.47 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (c. 2% of the stocks of carbon per year). Conclusions: The most influential variables on carbon storage in the region are anthropogenic, particularly historical logging, as noted by the largest coefficient of explanatory variable on the response variable. Of the non-anthropogenic factors, a negative correlation with air temperature and a positive correlation with water availability dominate, having smaller p-values than historical logging but also smaller influence. High carbon storage is typically found far from the commercial capital, in locations with a low monthly temperature range, without a strong dry season, and in areas that have not suffered from historical logging. The results imply that policy interventions could retain carbon stored in vegetation and likely successfully slow or reverse carbon emissions. © 2014 Willcock et al.","Degradation; Disturbance; Eastern Arc Mountains; Ecosystem service; Forest; IPCC Tier 3; REDD+; Tanzania","air temperature; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; environmental planning; environmental policy; tropical forest; watershed; Eastern Arc Mountains; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928546625

A large release from a pipeline transporting fluids between the capture and injection facilities could have major accident potential due to the toxicity of CO2 at high concentration. The European CO2PipeHaz project was concerned with the modelling and validation of source terms and dispersion for potential major releases from CO2 pipelines. This was led by University College London, UCL, (UK) with the other partners being University of Leeds (UK), INERIS (France), GexCon (Norway), Demokritos (Greece), Dalian University of Technology, DUT, (China) and the Health and Safety Laboratory, HSL, (UK).The project's activities included: physical properties and thermodynamic modelling of CO2 with impurities, • modelling of pipeline release rates, near-field dispersion and far-field dispersion, • small- and large-scale experimental validation, decision support tools including o QRA with integral modelling, o Possible methods to account for topography in QRA, and o The CO2PipeHaz Good Practice Guidelines. This paper describes the CO2PipeHaz Good Practice Guidelines (GPG) from the decision support tools, including setting them in the context of the project. The GPG include discussion of the decision-making required for CO2 pipelines, strategies for the use of decision support tools, existing guidelines for the design of hazardous pipelines, existing guidelines for the design of CO2 pipelines, and the new knowledge developed by the CO2PipeHaz project. An outline strategy is proposed for the use of different methods in decision support. Simpler methods such as QRA incorporating integral modelling should be used for the pipeline as a whole, to screen for pipeline sections with high consequence or risk. The detailed CO2PipeHaz consequence modelling methodology is state-of-the-art and should be considered for application in critically high consequence (or risk) sections of a pipeline. © IChemE.","Carbon capture and storage; Carbon dioxide; CCS; CFD; Consequence modelling; Pipeline; QRA; Topography","Carbon; Carbon capture; Computational fluid dynamics; Decision making; Decision support systems; Design for testability; Dispersions; Fossil fuel power plants; Global warming; Hazards; Pipelines; Risk assessment; Topography; Carbon capture and storage; CCS; Dalian University of Technology; Experimental validations; Health and safety laboratories; Modelling and validation; QRA; University College London; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908181211

Diesel emissions from these vehicles contribute to the air pollution burden in and around port facilities and neighborhoods. Striving to reduce air pollution, some ports have enacted mandatory requirements that will admit only newer drayage trucks after set deadlines while others have made progress with voluntary programs that help truck owners find funds to purchase newer trucks and scrap old ones. A discussion covers the lessons learned through the implementation of grants supporting voluntary dray truck replacement programs at US ports in Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Delaware; funding sources for the Middle-Atlantic Dray Truck Replacement Program that has enabled hundreds of dray truck owners to replace old diesel trucks with newer, cleaner vehicles; importance of support from port management and other stakeholders; communications methods; relationships with lenders, truck vendors, and scrap yards; and program management tools that have enabled this program to succeed.

Properly used, seaweed can be an ultimate sustainable material, which is not only available in many areas of the word, but also reproduces itself in the sea and is very easy to gain on the seashore. In some regions, where the quantity of building materials is limited (e.g. Danish islands), seaweed was traditionally used in vernacular architecture. Today, when many countries are threatened with deforestation, we are looking for cheap materials alternative to wood. Seaweed has some important advantages: it is non-toxic and fireproof, provides good insulation, reduces CO2 emission, has a life expectancy of more than 150 years and, what is also valuable, can be visually attractive. To the top of that, using seaweed can promote the respect for the uniqueness of regional architecture. Some examples of creative and contemporary dwellings made of seaweed as well as the brand new construction methods are presented and discussed in purpose to assess the promising possibilities of rediscovering this forgotten material. © Copyright: CEPT University, Center for Advanced Research in Building Science & Energy, Ahmedabad First Published 2014.All rights reserved.","Building conservation; Low energy materials; Vernacular architecture; Zero emission","Architecture; Artificial life; Building materials; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Fireproofing; CO2 emissions; Life expectancies; New constructions; Non-toxic; Regional architectures; Sustainable materials; Vernacular architecture; Seaweed",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018564538

Within this domain of indigeneity, some indigenous women take seriously the responsibilities that they may perceive they have as members of their communities. For the indigenous women who have such outlooks, responsibilities that they assume in their communities expose them to harms stemming from climate change impacts and other environmental changes.

The figure below shows the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for select available electricity production technologies, giving a $/Mwh cost of production by factoring in all applicable costs (construction, fuel, maintenance, operation, etc.) [23]. (feger presented) As seen in figure above, conventional natural gas currently offers the cheapest form of electricity production. It is important to note, though, that some alternatives like nuclear or wind are already competitive with other conventional electricity production methods like coal. Other alternatives, like solar or offshore wind, are still too expensive to be competitive at the moment, mainly due to the fact that electricity production from renewable sources is still too variable. With the advent of advanced electricity storage technology this issue would be eliminated, but such technology is currently unavailable or too expensive to be implemented economically [19]. Because of their positive environmental impacts, alternative electricity production methods are given some assistance by the federal government in order to make them more economically competitive. These economic aids mainly come in two forms: tax credits and loan programs. On the tax side, an installment tax credit allows solar production facilities a credit equal to 30% of the cost of implementation, while a production tax credit allows wind, hydro, and geothermal plants to receive a. 23 cents/kwh credit. However, the installment tax credit is only available until the end of 2016, and the production tax credit already expired at the beginning of 2014 [26]. On the loan program side, the government has extended loans to help both nuclear and renewable power plants, though the renewable plant loan program expired in 2011 [27] [28]. On top of aid being given to alternative electricity production methods, the federal government can also level the playing field by putting a burden on conventional electricity sources. This mainly comes in one of two forms, a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program, both of which seek to charge electricity producers for the amount of carbon emissions they produce. On top of producing revenue for the federal government, these programs help incentivize electricity producers to innovate new ways to reduce their carbon emissions. Though no such program has ever been implemented, a cap-and-trade program was able to at least pass the House in 2009 [24] [25]. Even small actions by the federal government can have noticeable effects in shifting the production methods used in the electricity production sector. Just a relatively small tax such as $10/metric ton of carbon emissions would cause significant carbon emission reductions compared a scenario in which no government actions are taken [33]. Additional analysis specific to natural gas and renewables shows that any carbon tax would actually increase the amount of natural gas-based electricity production for the next couple of decades, and increase the amount of renewable-based electricity production indefinitely. Additionally, if current favorable tax policies for renewables are renewed long-term, the use of renewables is significantly higher than those projected given current tax policy deadlines, especially after 2030 [34] [35]. As a result, it is recommended that a two-pronged approach be taken to limit the amount of economic disturbance while ensuring the electricity production sector makes a greater shift towards renewables given the reduction of coal use. First, a carbon tax equivalent of $10/metric ton of carbon emissions should be enacted to reflect the social cost of emissions. Each year this tax would increase 5% per year after inflation in order to push companies to innovate new carbon reduction technologies. Second, the production tax credit should be extended for all renewable electricity production methods using the current credit of 23 cents/kwh. This credit would decrease 5% per year after inflation to mirror the carbon tax in order to account for the increased rate of improvement in renewable technologies and the relative advantage given by the increasing carbon tax. It is important that such a program be long-term in order to allow industry to accurately model the economic landscape their projects will enter. Given the current gridlock in Washington and the long-term nature of implementing new electricity production facilities, a long-term tax plan is the only way to ensure economic stability. Factoring in only revenue from taxes on natural gas use and costs from credits extended to renewables use, such a program would pull in an average surplus of $5.5 billion per year between 2015 and 2040; factoring in coal would increase this figure significantly, particularly in the near future. Feeding at least part of this surplus into loan programs for nuclear plants would ensure that an increased amount of low carbon electricity production facilities are able to come to market.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961923783

Luckily, currently-available, low-emission renewable energy technologies are most well suited for electricity production over any other energy sector application. As a result of recent government regulations combined with high coal prices, coal plants, which currently dominate the electricity production landscape, are being retired at an accelerated rate [8]. This, combined with increased electricity demand, has opened up the door for new electricity production technology to be implemented. However, due to the low price of natural gas resulting mainly from the onset of fracking, efforts to implement new renewable-sourced electricity production facilities have been stalled in favor of natural gas power plants. While natural gas plants produce only half the carbon emissions of coal, and do not produce harmful byproducts such as sulfur dioxide or mercury, they are not as environmentally friendly as the other available alternatives, such as nuclear, solar, or wind [11] [12] [13] [14]. The fact that natural gas dominates the shift away from coal is not surprising, however, given the current economic landscape.

The fact that natural gas dominates the shift away from coal is not surprising, however, given the current economic landscape. The figure below shows the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for select available electricity production technologies, giving a $/Mwh cost of production by factoring in all applicable costs (construction, fuel, maintenance, operation, etc.) [23]. (Figure Presented) As seen in figure above, conventional natural gas currently offers the cheapest form of electricity production. It is important to note, though, that some alternatives like nuclear or wind are already competitive with other conventional electricity production methods like coal. Other alternatives, like solar or offshore wind, are still too expensive to be competitive at the moment, mainly due to the fact that electricity production from renewable sources is still too variable. With the advent of advanced electricity storage technology this issue would be eliminated, but such technology is currently unavailable or too expensive to be implemented economically [19]. Because of their positive environmental impacts, alternative electricity production methods are given some assistance by the federal government in order to make them more economically competitive. These economic aids mainly come in two forms: tax credits and loan programs. On the tax side, an installment tax credit allows solar production facilities a credit equal to 30% of the cost of implementation, while a production tax credit allows wind, hydro, and geothermal plants to receive a .23 cents/kwh credit. However, the installment tax credit is only available until the end of 2016, and the production tax credit already expired at the beginning of 2014 [26]. On the loan program side, the government has extended loans to help both nuclear and renewable power plants, though the renewable plant loan program expired in 2011 [27] [28]. On top of aid being given to alternative electricity production methods, the federal government can also level the playing field by putting a burden on conventional electricity sources. This mainly comes in one of two forms, a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program, both of which seek to charge electricity producers for the amount of carbon emissions they produce. On top of producing revenue for the federal government, these programs help incentivize electricity producers to innovate new ways to reduce their carbon emissions. Though no such program has ever been implemented, a cap-and-trade program was able to at least pass the House in 2009 [24] [25]. Even small actions by the federal government can have noticeable effects in shifting the production methods used in the electricity production sector. Just a relatively small tax such as $10/metric ton of carbon emissions would cause significant carbon emission reductions compared a scenario in which no government actions are taken [33]. Additional analysis specific to natural gas and renewables shows that any carbon tax would actually increase the amount of natural gas-based electricity production for the next couple of decades, and increase the amount of renewable-based electricity production indefinitely. Additionally, if current favorable tax policies for renewables are renewed long-term, the use of renewables is significantly higher than those projected given current tax policy deadlines, especially after 2030 [34] [35]. As a result, it is recommended that a two-pronged approach be taken to limit the amount of economic disturbance while ensuring the electricity production sector makes a greater shift towards renewables given the reduction of coal use. First, a carbon tax equivalent of $10/metric ton of carbon emissions should be enacted to reflect the social cost of emissions. Each year this tax would increase 5% per year after inflation in order to push companies to innovate new carbon reduction technologies. Second, the production tax credit should be extended for all renewable electricity production methods using the current credit of .23 cents/kwh. This credit would decrease 5% per year after inflation to mirror the carbon tax in order to account for the increased rate of improvement in renewable technologies and the relative advantage given by the increasing carbon tax. It is important that such a program be long-term in order to allow industry to accurately model the economic landscape their projects will enter. Given the current gridlock in Washington and the long-term nature of implementing new electricity production facilities, a long-term tax plan is the only way to ensure economic stability. Factoring in only revenue from taxes on natural gas use and costs from credits extended to renewables use, such a program would pull in an average surplus of $5.5 billion per year between 2015 and 2040; factoring in coal would increase this figure significantly, particularly in the near future. Feeding at least part of this surplus into loan programs for nuclear plants would ensure that an increased amount of low carbon electricity production facilities are able to come to market.",,"Byproducts; Coal; Coal byproducts; Commerce; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric utilities; Emission control; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Laws and legislation; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Plants (botany); Production; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Sulfur dioxide; Taxation; Carbon emission reductions; Electricity production; Levelized cost of electricities; Low-carbon electricities; Natural gas power plants; Production tax credit; Renewable electricity production; Renewable energy technologies; Electric power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954142501

Advanced ultra-supercritical (A-USC) development for materials to reach 760C (1400F) is a goal of the U.S. Program on Materials Technology for Ultrasupercritical Coal-Fired Boilers sponsored by the United States (U.S.) Department of Energy and the Ohio Coal Development Office (OCDO). As part of the development of advanced ultra-supercritical power plants in this program and internally funded programs, a succession of design studies have been undertaken to determine the scope and quantity of materials required to meet 700 to 760C (1292 to 1400F) performance levels. At the beginning of the program in 2002, the current design convention was to use a ""two pass"" steam generator with a pendant and horizontal tube bank arrangement as the starting point for the economic analysis of the technology. The efficiency improvement achieved with 700C (1292F) plus operation over a 600C (111 2F) power plant results in about a 12% reduction in fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The reduced flue gas weight per MW generated reduces clean up costs for the lower sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate emissions. The operation and start up of the 700C (1292F) plant will be similar in control methods and techniques to a 600C (1112F) plant. Due to arrangement features, the steam temperature control range and the once through minimum circulation flow will be slightly different. The expense of nickel alloy components will be a strong economic incentive for changes in how the steam generator is configured and arranged in the plant relative to the steam turbine. To offer a view into the new plant concepts this paper will discuss what would stay the same and what needs to change when moving up from a 600C (1112F) current state-of-the-art design to a plant design with a 700C (1292F) steam generator and turbine layout.

Depending on the cell type and location, cells are prone to multiple types of insults that may compromise their proper function. Generally, these insults are overcome by defensive mechanisms but sometimes they lead to sustained damage, requiring the action of scavenging and repair machineries to retain the viability of the cells. As a final measure, severely damaged cells are targeted to a controlled cell death pathway in order to not to compromise the well-being of the whole tissue. The polyamines, spermine and spermidine are essential cellular constituents, participating in many vital functions such as proliferation and differentiation, immune response and scavenging of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, dysregulation of polyamine metabolism is often associated with different pathological states. Polyamine acetylating enzyme spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase is induced by inflammation, drugs and by several other environmental insults. Resulting accelerated polyamine acetylation with accompanying polyamine biosynthesis induction i.e. activation of polyamine futile cycle generates excessive amount of hydrogen peroxide, hampers cell energy metabolism and induces mitochondrial dysfunction and biogenesis. Therefore, the drugs inhibiting polyamine metabolism are valuable in protecting mitochondria and cell energy metabolism. Here we review the current literature focusing on the applicability of charge-deficient polyamine analogs as drugs to modulate polyamine metabolism. Alteration of pKa of amino group(s) in a respective analog is achieved by fluorine substitution of hydrogen atom, hydroxylamine substitution of methylamine or by reducing the numbers of carbon atoms between amine groups to two instead of three or four. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.","Cell organelles; Charge deficient; Ornithine decarboxylase; Polyamine; Polyamine analog; Reactive oxygen species","acyltransferase; amine; carbon; fluorine; hydrogen; hydrogen peroxide; hydroxylamine; methylamine; polyamine; putrescine; reactive oxygen metabolite; spermidine; spermine; acetylation; animal cell; animal tissue; atom; biogenesis; biosynthesis; cell damage; cell death; cell differentiation; cell energy; cell proliferation; immune response; inflammation; mitochondrion; mouse; nonhuman; polyamine metabolism; priority journal; rat; review; Acetyltransferases; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Mitochondria; Polyamines; Reactive Oxygen Species; Spermidine; Spermine",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892956577

Controlling the total carbon emission can’t be separated with making carbon initial quota, which will certainly influence generating capacity of generating enterprises in Jibei. Consequently, Jibei grid should purchase more clean electricity in outside province. Firstly, common methods of carbon quota distribution have been introduced in this paper and three scenes of carbon emission reduction have been set. Then, generating capacity in Jibei has been calculated in three scenes, and the influence of purchasing power in outside province on Jibei grid has been analyzed.

We subtly engineered the interfaces between planar graphene sheets and curved carbon nanotubes (G-CNT) and gained a remarkable activity/selectivity for ORR (larger current, and n = 3.86, ∼93% hydroxide + ∼7% peroxide). This performance is close to that of Pt; and the durability is much better than Pt. We further demonstrate the application of this G-CNT hybrid as an all-carbon cathode catalyst for lithium oxygen batteries.We speculate that the high ORR activity of this G-CNT hybrid stems from the localized charge separation at the interface of the graphene and carbon nanotube, which results from the tunneling electron transfer due to the Fermi level mismatch on the planar and curved sp 2 surfaces.

Forest fires, which play an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, have a very significant effect on carbon emissions and carbon sinks, and also play an important role in the carbon cycle. Although the impact of forest fires on carbon emissions has been analyzed in detail, studies that scientifically and accurately measure carbon and carbonaceous gas emissions from forest fires are lacking. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from temperate forest fires are usually calculated based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guidelines (IPCC 1997) and only include direct effects of burning. Forest fires have been shown to release significant amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and play a significant role in the global carbon cycle and carbon balance.In this study, we estimated the level of emissions from forest fires for carbon and carbonaceous gases including CO2, carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) from 1953 to 2012 in Heilongjiang Province, China. We used a geographic information system based modeling approach to simulate emissions using a two-step procedure. First, we calculated total carbon released from forest fires in Heilongjiang for selected years between 1953 and 2012 by merging and analyzing measurements of several parameters. Second, we calculated the amounts of four carbonaceous gases released during the burn, CO2, CO, CH4, and NMHC, using several different experimentally derived emission factors. The origin of each of the inputs used in our models was based on a combination of analysis of forest fire inventory, forest resources inventory, field research, and laboratory experiments. Direct total carbon emissions from forest fires in Heilongjiang during 1953-2012 were about 5.88×107 t, and mean annual carbon emissions were about 9.80×105t per year, accounting for 8.66% of the direct total carbon emissions from forest fires in China. Carbon emissions of four trace gases, CO2, CO, CH4 and NMHC, from forest fires were 1.89× 108, 1.06× 107, 6.33×105 and 4.43× 105 t, respectively; mean annual emissions of CO2, CO, CH4 and NMHC were 3.15×106, 1.77×105, 1.05×104 and 7.38× 103 t, respectively, accounting for 7.74%, 6.52%, 9.42% and 6.53% of the amounts of CO2, CO, CH4 and NMHC released from forest fires in China, respectively, during that period. Our results indicate that combustion efficiency of coniferous broad-leaved mixed forest is lower than other forest types. The mean annual burned area for this type of forest accounts for 57.54% of China's total burn area, while this area's fires account for only 38.57% of carbon total emissions from forest fires. We propose the following forest fire management strategy. First, our studies show that the area's mean annual forest fire carbon emissions have an important impact on the regional carbon balance. So, we suggest strengthening the management of forest fuels (fine fuels, heavy fuels, etc.) as part of the regional forest fire management strategy. Fuels on the ground do not decompose easily in Heilongjiang's cold and dry temperate forests. Land managers should implement a reasonable prescribed burning plan designed to reduce the accumulation of combustible fuels. A policy for conducting periodic prescribed burning will reduce the incidence of forest fires. Prescribed burning should help land managers to control and limit the incidence and intensity of wildfires while allowing them to improve the condition of the ecosystem. Finally, we should give full consideration to the role of forest fires in maintaining the ecological balance of forest ecosystems.","Carbon emissions; Carbonaceous gases emissions; Forest fire; Forest fire management path; Heilongjiang Province","carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon monoxide; emission inventory; fire management; forest fire; GIS; methane; prescribed burning; stand structure; temperate environment; temperate forest; temporal period; China; Heilongjiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902504402

However, a fundamental imaging-depth limit, accompanied by a vanishing signal-to-background contrast, still exists for TPFM when imaging deep into scattering samples. Formally, the focusing depth, at which the in-focus signal and the out-of-focus background are equal to each other, is defined as the fundamental imaging-depth limit. To go beyond this imaging-depth limit of TPFM, we report a new class of super-nonlinear fluorescence microscopy for high-contrast deep tissue imaging, including multiphoton activation and imaging (MPAI) harnessing novel photo-activatable fluorophores, stimulated emission reduced fluorescence (SERF) microscopy by adding a weak laser beam for stimulated emission, and two-photon induced focal saturation imaging with preferential depletion of ground-state fluorophores at focus. The resulting image contrasts all exhibit a higher-order (third- or fourth- order) nonlinear signal dependence on laser intensity than that in the standard TPFM. Both the physical principles and the imaging demonstrations will be provided for each super-nonlinear microscopy. In all these techniques, the created super-nonlinearity significantly enhances the imaging contrast and concurrently extends the imaging depth-limit of TPFM. Conceptually different from conventional multiphoton processes mediated by virtual states, our strategy constitutes a new class of fluorescence microscopy where high-order nonlinearity is mediated by real population transfer. © 2014 SPIE.","deeptissue imaging; imaging-depth limit; multiphoton microscopy; Nonlinear microscopy; real population transfer","Fluorescence microscopy; Multiphoton processes; Photons; Stimulated emission; Deep-tissue imaging; Imaging-depth limit; Multi-photon microscopy; Nonlinear microscopy; Population transfer; Fluorophores",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898024989

Combustion gas turbines are designed to comply with emission and performance standards at base load operations. Many of these units will find is difficult to simultaneously meet the demands of the market and the regulatory emission performance standards on a continuous basis. Permitting these units and the ability to maintain compliance will become more and more challenging and costly as long as the regulations continue to be tied to the traditional base-load model. EPA Best Available Control Technology (BACT) standards and the proposed Greenhouse Gas (GHG) New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) for new Electric Generating Units (EGU) are still premised on a steady state, baseload model that is rapidly vanishing. Many unit-level emissions requirements may actually conflict with what the power system is demanding. While the GHG Tailoring Rule allowed for the introduction of system-level ( i.e., grid-level) considerations in setting case-by-case GHG BACT determinations, the proposed GHG NSPS for new EGU ignores system level concerns in favor of unit level requirements. These issues were explored and opportunities to improve air permits for new EGU were discussed.

Effects of climate change on forests could result in a ripple effect of policy and economic response on economic sectors and human communities. The United States produces more timber than any other nation, and although timber volume nearly doubled between 1945 and the late 1980s, production since then has declined. Per capita consumption of wood products has declined since the late 1980s, but population growth has continued to increase consumption to 0.57 billion m3 in the 2000s. Increased production will be concentrated on a smaller land base with a projected net loss of 9.3 million ha of forest land in the United States over the next 50 years, mostly on private lands subject to urbanization. In natural resource-based communities, socioeconomic relationships based on commodities (e.g., timber) or amenities (e.g., recreation) will be disproportionately affected by climate-forest interactions. Anticipated climate changes, coupled with population growth, strongly increase the value of urban trees in providing ecosystem services and for mitigating climate change impacts at fine scales. Policies targeting climate mitigation directly influence forest extent and use, and responses may include more harvesting (a result of new product markets such as biofuels) and altered forest management (responding to demands for forest-based C storage). Preparation for future climate stresses in rural, urban, and wildland-urban interface communities will be enhanced by ensuring that present-day communities have diverse economies and are capable of adapting to change. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).","Ecosystem Service; Forest Land; Forest Owner; Social Vulnerability; Urban Forest",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052191055

The findings illustrate the importance of understanding how households use migration as a risk management strategy when faced with climatic stressors like changes in rainfall. The findings further point out four household profiles that help address the debate of the role that migration does or does not play in adaptation to climate change. The main findings show that while all communities surveyed use migration when faced with climatic stressors, those with ""resilient"" characteristics were able to benefit from the strategy. In contrast, those households which lacked such characteristics (such as access to land, education, social networks, formal and informal institutions) had migration outcomes that slowly deteriorated their development base and can be considered as ""erosive coping strategies"".

Pipelines are considered to be the most likely method for transporting captured CO2 and their safe operation is of paramount importance as their contents are likely to be in the region of several thousand tonnes and CO2 poses a number of concerns upon release due to its unusual physical properties. To this end, National Grid initiated the COOLTRANS (CO2 Liquid Pipeline Transportation) research programme to consider the pipeline transportation of high-pressure dense phase CO2. Part of this work involved the development of a mathematical model for predicting the dispersion of pure CO2 following the venting, puncture, or rupture, of such a transportation pipeline during normal operational conditions. In this paper, we describe the use of a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) tool that can be used to numerically simulate the near-field sonic dispersion from such releases, above and below ground. The model is shown to qualitatively and quantitatively reproduce observed experimental results. Validated flows at the top of the crater formed by below ground releases presented here for a range of scenarios provide the basis for developing robust source conditions for use in CFD studies of far-field dispersion, and for use with pragmatic quantified risk assessment (QRA) models. © 2014 The Authors Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Accidental releases; Atmospheric dispersion; Ccs transport; Experimental measurement; Mathematical modelling; Multi-phase flow",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922876208

Microbial fuel cell concepts have previously been adapted to detect changes in the availability of relatively high concentrations of organic compounds in waste water but, in most soils and sediments, rates of microbial activity are not linked to the concentrations of labile substrates, but rather to the turnover rates of the substrate pools with steady state concentrations in the nM-μM range. In order to determine whether levels of current produced at a graphite anode would correspond to the rates of microbial metabolism in anoxic sediments, small graphite anodes were inserted in sediment cores and connected to graphite brush cathodes in the overlying water. Currents produced were compared with the rates of [2-14C]-acetate metabolism. There was a direct correlation between current production and the rate that [2-14C]-acetate was metabolized to 14CO2 and 14CH4 in sediments in which Fe(III) reduction, sulfate reduction, or methane production was the predominant terminal electron-accepting process. At comparable acetate turnover rates, currents were higher in the sediments in which sulfate-reduction or Fe(III) reduction predominated than in methanogenic sediments. This was attributed to reduced products (Fe(II), sulfide) produced at distance from the anode contributing to current production in addition to the current that was produced from microbial oxidation of organic substrates with electron transfer to the anode surface in all three sediment types. The results demonstrate that inexpensive graphite electrodes may provide a simple strategy for real-time monitoring of microbial activity in a diversity of anoxic soils and sediments. © 2014 Wardman, Nevin and Lovley.","Anaerobic metabolism; Aquatic sediments; Biogeochemistry; Electromicrobiology; Microbial activity; Subsurface sediments","acetic acid; ferric ion; ferrous ion; graphite; methane; sulfide; sulfuric acid; water; anaerobic metabolism; Article; biogeochemistry; electrode; electron transport; microbial activity; microbial metabolism; monitoring; nonhuman; sediment; soil; turnover time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987829291

To date however climate policy discourse has largely overlooked the conservation of existing C stored in mountain grasslands and shrublands. These ecosystems provide critical ecological goods and services to humanity yet are increasingly at risk from anthropogenic stressors including agricultural intensification, mining and climate change. The absence of a global estimate for these C stocks is likely to be one reason for their exclusion from climate change policy discussions, both on a political and scientific basis. This represents a missed opportunity in two respects: firstly, by conserving and restoring existing C stocks the impacts of climate change can be lessened; and secondly, carbon finance and climate finance might provide the necessary financial support to address the aforementioned stressors. In this paper we use spatial analysis and estimate there to be between 60.5. Pg C and 82.8. Pg of C contained within biomass and soils of the world's mountain grasslands and shrublands. To put this in perspective, globally tropical Savannas and grasslands, temperate forests and tropical peatlands are estimated to contain 326-330. Pg C, 159-292. Pg C and 88.6. Pg C respectively. Our review of existing empirical studies and of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) national greenhouse accounts suggests that this C is not reliably accounted for in international carbon budgets. Our estimate is the first to provide a global point of reference, useful in developing future research and in climate policy discussions. We conclude by briefly discussing how climate finance might be leveraged to support the sustainable management of these C stocks, and in so doing uphold the other important socioeconomic benefits provided to humanity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon; Grasslands; Mountains; Policy; Shrublands; Stocks","ecosystem service; environmental economics; environmental policy; estimation method; global perspective; grassland; mountain region; shrubland; sustainability; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; biomass; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; financial provision; greenhouse gas; human activity; peatland; risk assessment; savanna; soil carbon; spatial analysis; temperate forest; tropical region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922362990

We build and assess a reference scenario within EnergyPLAN and three renewable energy scenarios from a technological and resources perspective. The results show that sufficient resources are available for the South West Region energy system to become 100% renewable and quantifies the land-use implications. Moreover, EnergyPLAN can be a useful tool in exploring different technical solutions. However, thorough investigations of as many alternatives as possible, is necessary before major investments are made in a future energy system. © 2014, Aalborg University press.

However, few studies have examined the driving forces for household transportation emissions from the perspective of individual behavior. On the basis of daily activity survey conducted in Beijing from 2000 to 2011, this study examines the impacts of individual travel behavior on carbon emissions from urban transport. It first investigates the changes in the inhabitant travel characteristics and carbon emissions, and then discusses the effects of population, per capita economic activity, transportation intensity, transportation mode share, vehicle-use intensity and emission coefficient on carbon emissions based on decomposition analysis. Results shows that: (1) carbon emissions due to urban traffic has increased from 2.99 Mt in 2000 to 16.76 Mt in 2011, following an annual growth rate of 16.95%; (2) the vehicle-use intensity effect, per capita disposable income effect and population effect are found to be the main drivers that increase household daily travel carbon emissions; and (3) both transportation intensity and emission coefficient have significant effects on the reduction of carbon emissions.

Light-induced stomatal opening is mediated by at least three key components: the blue light receptor phototropin (phot1 and phot2), plasma membrane H+-ATPase, and plasma membrane inward-rectifying K+ channels. Very few attempts have been made to enhance stomatal opening with the goal of increasing photosynthesis and plant growth, even though stomatal resistance is thought to be the major limiting factor for CO2 uptake by plants. Here, we show that transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing H+-ATPase using the strong guard cell promoter GC1 showed enhanced light-induced stomatal opening, photosynthesis, and plant growth. The transgenic plants produced larger and increased numbers of rosette leaves, with ~42-63% greater fresh and dry weights than the wild type in the first 25 d of growth. The dry weights of total flowering stems of 45-d-old transgenic plants, including seeds, siliques, and flowers, were ~36-41% greater than those of the wild type. In addition, stomata in the transgenic plants closed normally in response to darkness and abscisic acid. In contrast, the overexpression of phototropin or inward-rectifying K + channels in guard cells had no effect on these phenotypes. These results demonstrate that stomatal aperture is a limiting factor in photosynthesis and plant growth, and that manipulation of stomatal opening by overexpressing H+-ATPase in guard cells is useful for the promotion of plant growth.","Arabidopsis thaliana; Biomass; Photosynthetic rate; Stomatal conductance","abscisic acid; phototropin; proton transporting adenosine triphosphatase; Arabidopsis; article; cell membrane; controlled study; darkness; dry weight; flower; flowering; guard cell; nonhuman; phenotype; photosynthesis; plant growth; plant seed; priority journal; promoter region; stomatal conductance; transgenic plant; Arabidopsis thaliana; biomass; photosynthetic rate; stomatal conductance; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Cell Membrane; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Light; Phenotype; Photosynthesis; Plant Stomata; Plants, Genetically Modified; Potassium; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Proton-Translocating ATPases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891958565

In this paper, an integrated analytical framework, which can quantify the impact of changing urban form on commuting CO2 emissions, is presented. This framework simultaneously considers two emission dependent factors, commuting demand and modal share based on the concept of excess commuting and accessibility analysis, and ensures its applicability to other cities where the detailed individual travel data is not available. A case study of Beijing from 2000 to 2009 is used to illustrate this framework. The findings suggest that changing urban form in Beijing did have a significant impact on commuting CO2 emission increase. Changing to a more decentralized urban form in Beijing had a larger impact on commuting distance and increased usage of cars, which resulted in a significant rise in CO2 emissions. There is a larger space and an urgent need for commuting CO2 emission reduction, in 2009 in Beijing, by planning and by strategic measures in order to promote sustainable transport. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Accessibility; Changing urban form; Decentralization; Excess commuting; Modal share; Sustainable transport","accessibility; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; developing world; empirical analysis; numerical model; urban area; urban pollution; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905365776

Island is a special terrestrial ecosystem, on which the communities and environmental conditions are similar to that of the mainland, but its ecological structure is relatively simple, and the species richness is lower than that of the mainland. Island ecosystems still has strong ability of carbon storage, carbon fixation and plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. This work discusses carbon sequestration estimates in the island terrestrial ecosystems. Island regions are especially vulnerable to projected changes in eustatic sea level, storm impacts, and habitat suitability due to low-lying land and limited migration potential. The island area in the global is about 1/15 of the whole mainland, so the ecosystem of forest, shrub, and grass on islands has had an impact on the global carbon sequestration. Although the species of forest, shrub, and grass on islands is relative fewer, there is significant difference of biodiversity on the islands at different latitudes. The combining methodology of the estimate model of biomass and the inventory of sampling investigation can be selected to estimate the carbon storage of forests, shrub, and grass on islands. The estimate model of biomass is a specific type of modeling that seeks to mechanistically represent cycles of carbon at islands regional ecosystem through an integrated into account of biology and geochemistry. Using models to estimate carbon sequestration on the island, factors influencing the carbon storage assessment are considered to be identified. The factors covers the land area of the island, season, wind, slope, aspect, elevation, average temperature, rainfall, soil properties, and so on. Biodiversity also enhances the ability of ecosystems to maintain multiple functions, such as carbon storage, productivity, and the buildup of nutrient pools. If the maintenance of biodiversity is to be justified as a strategy for enhancing ecosystem services, it is essential to understand how biodiversity affects ecosystem multifunctionality. Nevertheless, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality, especially carbon storage, has seldom been studied in islands. It is focused on how the richness of perennial vascular plants (hereafter ""species richness"") and a range of key abiotic factors (climate, slope, elevation, and soil texture) influence carbon storage in different typical islands ecosystems. The direct relationship between species richness and carbon storage on island can be evaluated using both ordinary least-squares (OLS) and spatial regression models. And these results will suggest that the correlation between species richness and carbon cycle may be a general pattern in nature that reflects a cause-and-effect linkage. Furthermore, a large proportion of photosynthetical fixed carbon is directed belowground to roots and associated microorganisms, potentially affecting carbon sequestration either positively or negatively. A better mechanistic understanding of how the belowground allocation of carbon affects long-term sequestration rates is crucial for predictions of how the currently large carbon stock in island soils may respond to altered climate change, elevated CO2 levels, and other environmental shifts. Fungi play important roles in island soil ecosystems, as the decomposers of organic matter and the root-associated mediators of belowground carbon transport and respiration. It will be profiled the relative abundance of major functional groups of fungi through the depth profile of island soil by use of modern gene technology. And the results will elucidate the mechanisms underpinning carbon sequestration in island soil and highlight the importance of root-associated fungi for ecosystem carbon balance.","Carbon cycle; Carbon sequestration estimates; Island; Terrestrial ecosystems","belowground biomass; biogeochemistry; biomass allocation; carbon balance; carbon fixation; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem service; environmental conditions; estimation method; forest ecosystem; functional group; fungus; global climate; grass; island; least squares method; root; sampling; sea level; shrub; soil ecosystem; soil organic matter; soil profile; soil texture; species richness; terrestrial ecosystem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892955897

The system was a single-chamber, air-cathode MFC with a reactor, resistance box and data processing unit. Factors such as moisture content, concentration of phosphate buffer solution (PBS), catalyst addition and electrode area were investigated. Moisture contents of 80%, 70% and 60% resulted in maximum power densities of 349±39, 36±9 and 12±2 mW m-2, respectively. A moisture content of greater than 80% is suitable for generation of current in the composting MFC. Addition of 0.1 mg Pt cm-2 catalyst resulted in 10-fold greater maximum power density with an output voltage twice as great as that generated in the absence of the catalyst. A concentration of 100 mM PBS resulted in maximum power density and output voltage. The power per unit area of electrode was inversely proportional to surface area of the electrode. Quantification of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen (CHN) content indicated enhanced degradation or organic compounds in addition to production of the electric current. The diversity of the microbial community, as determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was directly proportional to content of water, but inversely proportional to concentration of PBS. The results of this study demonstrated that the composting MFC can be used to treat wastes while generating electric current. © 2014 The Authors.","Bacterial; Community; Current density; Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE); Electricity; Microbial; Optimum",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897866652

Recent years, industry and academia pay more attention to this area. Modeling of CO2 transportation in pipelines is crucial in engineering design and operation of these pipelines. However, there are no standalone industrial standards for CO2 transportation modeling due to a lack of valid operational and experimental data. This paper will review up-to-date CO2 pipeline design and modeling especially focusing on the Equation of State (EOS). The most economical means of CO2 transportation is to keep it in dense phase. This is a big challenge for traditional Equations of State such as the Peng-Robinson equation and the SRK equation because they are more suitable for the vapor-liquid equilibrium properties of hydrocarbon mixture systems. Pure CO2 properties can be accurately predicted by the Span-Wagner equation. But impurities in CO2 can change the properties dramatically. It has been reported that both Peng-Robinson and Span-Wagner equations have been used in the energy industry for CO2 pipeline simulation. This paper will present the results using different Equations of State for CO2 simulation. Different commercial software packages have been tested. The results show there is about 5% difference in density and a 3% difference in viscosity. The Peng-Robinson equation with Peneloux volume correction is more conservative in pressure drop calculations.

To discuss the issue of carbon emissions intensity based on the specific industrial structure is conducive to correctly judge and grasp the industry factors that result in the change of carbon emissions and effectively formulate industrial development policies for controlling carbon emissions. This paper based on the analysis of China's carbon emissions change trend, chose 28 major provincial data of carbon emissions, proportion of three industries, per unit of GDP carbon emissions during 2004-2011, studied correlation between China's carbon intensity, primary industry, secondary industry and tertiary industry, using gray correlation analysis method. And the following conclusions are obtained: The second industry is the main factor influencing the regional carbon intensity. There are 16 areas around the country that have the biggest correlation between secondary industry and carbon intensity. However, the second industry is not the only factor that affects regional carbon emissions increase. Tertiary industry does not have obvious effect on the reduce of regional carbon emissions. There are 11 areas around the country whose influence of the third industry on carbon emissions exceeds that of second industry, which needs to be brought to the forefront. The first industry has the minimal impact on carbon emissions intensity. There are only 4 areas around the country whose first industry's impact on carbon emissions intensity is not the minimal. In summary, there is no single, precise evolution law between industrial structure change and carbon emissions in different provinces domains in China. On this basis, this paper discusses carbon reduction strategy of industrial structure adjustment of our country in the future, so as to effectively control influence of the industrial development on carbon intensity. © Trade Science Inc.","Carbon intensity; Grey correlation analysis; Industrial structure; Low carbon economy","Carbon; Correlation methods; Environmental management; Industrial emissions; Renewable energy resources; Carbon intensity; Correlation analysis; Gray correlation analysis methods; Grey correlation analysis; Industrial development; Industrial structure adjustments; Industrial structures; Low carbon economy; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84918580757

The simulations (RegCM3-BATS, RegCM4-BATS, and RegCM4-CLM) were compared with observed data by setting the same domain and initial and lateral atmospheric boundary conditions and using 30 km spatial resolution. The results showed that, compared to observed data, regional average annual mean temperature was underestimated by 1.22, 2.11, and 1.32C, and regional average annual precipitation was overestimated by 43.2, 49.8, and 18.4% in RegCM3-BATS, RegCM4- BATS, and RegCM4-CLM respectively. There were significant differences in simulated energy and water budget components among the 3 models resulting from the influence of the 2 different land-surface parameterization schemes, which impacted the simulated precipitation and temperature results through interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere. Therefore, climate simulation over the TP is very sensitive to the use of different land-surface schemes in regional climate models. Overall, use of RegCM4-CLM instead of RegCM-BATS resulted in a warmer and drier land surface and a better simulation of annual average spatial patterns of temperature and precipitation. © 2014 Inter-Research.","Land-surface scheme; Precipitation; Regional climate model; Temperature; Tibetan Plateau","climate modeling; land surface; regional climate; sensitivity analysis; spatial analysis; temperature profile; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84917729351

By estimating environmental directional distance function and shadow price of carbon dioxide emissions, this paper aims to evaluate carbon emission efficiency and reduction cost of China and its 30 provinces in China respectively from 1997 to 2011. Based on the estimated results and the growth rate of carbon emissions and economy outputs, China can be divided into three abatement zones: the steep-slope zone, the flat zone and the plateau zone. The comparison of the emission characteristics and potential reductions across the three zones leads to three findings of the study: (i) carbon emission performances varied greatly from province to province; (ii) the shadow price of China between 1997-2011 met a turning point in 2002, keeping increasing before the year but declining afterwards; and (iii) though carbon emissions among three zones exhibit great differences, yet similarities existed within each area. In addition, in order to carry out the abatement measures more economically, many other factors also need to be taken into account, including the regional emission efficiency and reduction costs, economy level, resources endowment and energy consumption structure and so on. © Sila Science.

Air pollutants emitted from exhaust gases of rice husk incineration lead to environmental damage, not only because of the influence on global environment and climate, when released into the atmosphere, but also on human health due to local air pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to effectively utilize waste rice husk to reduce air pollutants. In recent years, there is an increasing demand on the utilization of unused biomass instead of fossil oil fuel in combustors for farming-greenhouses heating during the winter season. With increasing demand will increase the running costs. In general, since these combustors are small scale in their sizes, there are lack of regulations or laws (e.g. the air pollution control act and the waste disposal and public cleaning law) in operation for their air pollution control. Although the small size combustors are characterized by their simplicity of structure and the low costs, however, they emit visible black carbon so-called elemental carbon as suspended fine particulate matter due to their poor combustion performance. In this study, we investigated the possibility of the substitution of fossil fuel by waste rice husk in laboratory model combustion experiments. We evaluated the emission behavior of harmful air pollutants emitted from rice husk combustion by measuring carbonaceous and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in suspended fine particulate matter caused from the exhaust gases. From the analytical results we found that particulate mass concentrations reduced substantially at high temperature combustion. The PAHtot (total 27 species) varied in the range 72.5–876 ng/g at different combustion temperature. PAHs emissions and molecular weight increased with combustion temperature rise. We firstly reported that the six ring PAHs (AA, DB(a,e)F, DB(a,l)P, DB(a,e)P, DB(a,i)P and DB(a,h)P) are discharged from biomass burning in different combustion temperatures using small size combustors. From the results of our study, it can be suggested that stable combustion performance under suitable conditions in order to control less air pollutants emitted from biomass fuel although small size combustors are still not regulated. However, it is very necessary to develop appropriate exhaust gas treatment technology for the small combustion equipment. © 2014 WIT Press.","Carbonaceous composition; Combustion conditions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Rice husk; Rice straw; Small size combustor","appropriate technology; atmospheric pollution; combustion; incineration; PAH; plant residue; rice; straw; suspended particulate matter; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926490038

Operation strategies for operable windows can have significant impacts on indoor thermal comfort and energy consumption of building performance. It is not uncommon that building facility managers complain that operable windows were left open in buildings with a conventional HVAC system. However, optimum control strategies of window operation can improve thermal comfort and reduce energy consumption for building using natural ventilation or mixed mode ventilation. The study focuses on the investigation of the impacts of window operations on building performance for different types of building systems including natural ventilation, mixed mode ventilation, and conventional HVAC systems in a medium-size reference office building. Building performance simulation tool̄EnergyPlus is used to simulate window operations for each system in three different climates. Various control strategies of window operations for building operation systems, implemented using (EMS) in EnergyPlus, are evaluated based on the criteria of thermal comfort and energy consumption. The results highlight the impacts of window operations on thermal comfort and energy use and identify that hybrid ventilation for perimeter zones has 12-20 % saving potentials of annual HVAC site energy consumption. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","Energy; Mixed mode; Natural ventilation; Thermal comfort; Window operation",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894136283

It was found that the countries' allocation quotas all increase with enlarging global emissions permit but with different growth rates under each allocation regime, and given global emission permit, changing in scheme parameters also has some impact on each country's allocation quota. Allocation regimes were also evaluated from the perspective of equality based on cumulative emission per capita, finding that the regimes considering historical responsibility for emissions can effectively reduce the inequalities of global emissions; And regimes incorporating ability to pay are useful in further reducing emissions inequalities between Annex I and non-Annex I groups. © 2014 The Authors.

CO2 solubility in salty aqueous solutions plays a key role in GCS. However, the models of CO2 solubility are scanty when the mixture + + 2+ 2+ of K, Na, Ca and Mg in aqueous solution is included. In this study, a simple model for CO2 solubility is proposed covering conditions typically encountered in geological sequestration. Effect of + + 2+ 2+ the property and concentration of K, Na, Ca and Mg on the solubility of CO2 is quantified based on the behavioral features of solubility data. In order to describe CO2-brine phase equilibrium, the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR-EOS) and Krichevsky-Kasarnosky equation (KK equation) are applied. The (PR-EOS) is modified for better performance in high salinity brine. The Henry's constant is precisely described by temperature and concentration of the mixed ions. A linear correlation is also found between the partial molar volume of CO2 and the ions in aqueous solution at a given temperature. The relationship can be represented by parameters optimized with least squares approach. The predicted solubility of CO2 in pure water and aqueous NaCl solutions are well validated at the temperature and pressure ranges of 313-453 K and 8-50 MPa, where adequate experimental measurements are given. In terms of salty aqueous solutions with mixed ions, desirable agreement is achieved between this model and the literature data, making our work possess theoretical and practical significance to the GCS.","CO2 geological sequestration; KK-equation; PR-EOS; Solubility","Aquifers; Calcium; Climate change; Digital storage; Equations of state; Hydrogeology; Ions; Phase equilibria; Solubility; Solution mining; Solutions; Aqueous NaCl solutions; Geological sequestration; High salinity brines; KK-equation; Least-squares approach; Partial Molar volume; Peng-Robinson equation of state; Temperature and pressures; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911867673

The explosion is a result of rapid combustion when a methane/air mixture is ignited by an unexpected energy release, such as a mine fire, electrical arc or sparks caused by frictions or rock falls. In most cases, an ignition of methane/air mixture could result in a deflagration other than detonation. Resulting flames and overpressure induced by a methane deflagration will harm neighboring miners and local ventilation control devices.. ,It is essential that the mechanism of an explosion and associated destructiveness be fully understood. This research seeks to predict an influence region of an incident happened within a representative underground mine geometry. The most common geometric changes in an underground coal mine are bends, regulators/doors, obstacle in airways and changes in sectional area. These geometric changes could result in an attenuation of the flame and pressure wave as a result of a methane deflagration. A study of this phenomenon could enable mine planners to have better understanding of the over-pressure redistribution due to the explosion. Both numerical and experimental work has been done in this study to ascertain a better insight of this potentially devastating event.

The empirical results indicate that the national weighted average shadow price presents an ""N-shape"" curve across the sample period, experiencing the initial phase of growth followed by a phase of deterioration, and then a further increase. This change trend implies that the cost of carbon emissions reduction is increasing. In addition, the shadow price varies significantly across provinces, which means that China should uphold the principal of ""common but differentiated responsibilities"" in regional carbon emissions reduction. Generally, the shadow price of the east provinces with high economic development is markedly higher than that of the west provinces with low economic development. The OLS regression results indicate that the shadow price positively connected with the regional economic development levels. Moreover, an inflection point exists in the relation curve between the shadow price and GDP per capita, that is, the increase rate of the shadow price becomes small when the GDP per capita is less than 18.1 thousand Yuan, while it becomes large when the GDP per capita surpasses 18.1 thousand Yuan. With the economic growth, the cost of carbon emissions reduction would be significantly increased.

However, it needs to make clear that how the physiological performance of E.japonicus treated with different water stresses including full irrigation (CK) (90%-100%FC), low water stress (LWS) (75%-85%FC), moderate water stress (MWS) (65%-75%FC), and serious water stress (SWS) (50%-60%FC) is, and landscape function and ecological serves function are also considered as integrated indicators to selecting optimization irrigation strategy in this study.

Design/methodology/approach: In this context, life cycle inventory and life cycle assessment of China's electricity coal were established in three difference stages: coal mining, coal transportation, and coal burning. Then the outcomes were analyzed with the aim to reduce waste gases emissions' environmental impact in the electricity coal supply chain from the perspective of sensitivity analysis. Findings: The results and conclusion are as follow: (1) In terms of total waste gas emissions in electricity coal supply chain, CO2 is emitted in the greatest quantity, accounting for 98-99 wt% of the total waste gas emissions. The vast majority of the CO2, greater than 93%, is emitted from the power plant when the coal is combusted. (2) Other than CO2, the main waste gas is CH4, SO2 and so on. CH4 is mainly emitted from Coal Bed Methane (CBM), so the option is to consider capturing some of the CH4 from underground mines for an alternative use. SO2 is mainly emitted from power plant when the coal is combusted. (3) The environmental burden of coal burning subsystem is greatest, followed by the coal mining subsystem, and finally the coal transportation subsystem. Improving the coal-burning efficiency of coal-fired power plant in electricity coal supply chain is the most effective way to reduce the environmental impact of waste gas emissions. (4) Of the three subsystems examined (coal mining, coal transportation, and coal burning), transportation requires the fewest resources and has the lowest waste gas emissions. However, the energy consumption for this subsystem is significant (excluding the mine mouth case), and transportation distance is found to have a substantial effect on the oil consumption and non-coal energy consumption. (5) In electricity coal supply chain, the biggest environmental impact of waste gas emissions is GWP, followed by EP, AP, POCP and ODP, and regional impact is greater than the global impact. Practical implications: The model and methodology established in this paper could be used for environmental impact assessment of waste gas emissions in electricity coal supply chain and sensitivity analysis in China, and it could supply reference and example for similar researches.

The myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury model of isolated rat heart was set up by the use of improved Langendorff retrograde perfusion technology. Compared with the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) group, the aqueous extract of Elaeagnus angustifolia L. leaf (0.5 mg/mL, 1.0 mg/mL) pretreatment markedly improved the coronary flow (CF) and raised left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and maximum rise/down velocity (±dp/dtmax). The infarct size of the EA-treated hearts was smaller than that of I/R group. After treatment with EA, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased; malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl content reduced more obviously (P<0.01) than that of I/R injury myocardial tissue.

The Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC), through its role in assisting Indigenous people to acquire and manage land for cultural, social, environmental and economic benefits, has operated in the carbon market and is keen to continue working with its partners to explore the opportunities to develop and broaden this further. The Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association, as the major industry body for the pastoral industry in the Northern Territory, has been actively involved in assessing the opportunities which may be presented through greenhouse gas abatement where these are compatible with sound resource and economic management. In recent years, Australian governments have considered and developed diversified carbon abatement opportunities for farmers, particularly through the Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI). Australian Carbon Credit Units generated through the CFI can contribute to meeting Australia's commitments under international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The opportunity for economic diversification into carbon farming on marginal land where the primary land use is pastoralism is of particular interest, particularly where it can lead to strengthened economic returns, jobs and other benefits for Indigenous people. Lessons learnt from the ILC's Fish River Fire Project demonstrate the potential, but also emphasise the need for further research into the practicalities of introducing carbon projects into predominantly pastoral landscapes in Australia and internationally. It is suggested that several issues require further assessment by pastoralists who may be considering engaging in the CFI or other carbon markets. © Australian Rangeland Society 2014.","Carbon Farming Initiative; carbon markets; fire; grazing; pastoralism; savannas.",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907575549

In Australia, burning of savanna contributes between 2% and 4% annually of the nation's reportable emissions. Complete removal of this source of emissions is unrealistic because fire is a ubiquitous natural process and important land-management tool. In the rangelands of northern Australia, fire is used to manage habitat for conservation, control woodland thickening, manipulate pastures for grazing and is an essential component of indigenous cultural and land-management practice. There has been a concerted attempt in recent times to move away from complete fire suppression and its consequence: frequent, extensive and high intensity wildfires occurring late in the dry season. In fire-adapted vegetation types, prescribed early dry season fires help reduce the incidence of late season wildfires and consequently the amount of GHG emissions produced. The emergence of a carbon economy affords a potential opportunity for land managers to diversify their livelihoods by adopting fire-management practices that reduce GHG emissions and increase carbon sequestration. However, in order to realise benefits from this emerging economy, there is a need to identify and address a range of barriers affecting community participation. The papers in this Special Issue document current scientific knowledge, policy issues and pathways to participation, with particular reference to Australia's savanna rangelands. This introductory paper outlines how northern Australia has both the opportunity and requirement to develop a diversified rangelands economy to realise multiple conservation, economic and emissions outcomes. © Australian Rangeland Society 2014.","carbon sequestration; diversification; emissions; greenhouse gases; prescribed burning; savannas.",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907584737

This offers the opportunity to cover parts of the process energy demand with concentrated solar power (CSP) and thereby increase the fuel production and carbon conversion efficiency. A plant is examined that produces 1st and 2nd generation ethanol by fermentation of sugars (from sugarcane) and enzymatic hydrolysis of the lignocellulosic residues (bagasse), respectively. Enzymatic hydrolysis is a promising alternative for 2nd generation biofuels due to its high conversion efficiency and low environmental impact. In conventional ethanol production processes, electrical and thermal power is delivered to the system by burning parts of the feedstock to drive a steam based cogeneration cycle (between 400 and 800K). Introducing high temperature thermal power (at 800K) from a solar trough field coupled with sensible heat storage, for continuous operation, offers the opportunity to replace the heat generated from biomass burning, and thus increase the product yield. In this work, the potential for process integration of a solar trough field coupled with packed bed thermal storage to a 1st and 2nd generation ethanol production site is evaluated by means of pinch analysis. Decision parameters such as the solar fraction, the percentage of bagasse to 2nd generation, and the solar field size are optimized via multi-objective optimization based on evolutionary algorithms to maximize the carbon conversion efficiency and minimize the total annual cost for a plant located in Ribeirão Preto, Brazil.","Bioethanol; Biomass; Concentrated solar power (CSP); Enzymatic hydrolysis; Organosolv lignin; Pinch analysis; Process integration; Solar heat","Bagasse; Bioethanol; Biomass; Carbon; Conversion efficiency; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Heat storage; Packed beds; Solar energy; Solar heating; Sun; Concentrated solar power; Continuous operation; High conversion efficiency; Lignocellulosic residues; Organosolv lignin; Pinch analysis; Process integration; Sensible heat storages; Multiobjective optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84915820454

The rapid urbanization in the latter half of the 20th century was carried out against a backdrop of depletion of limited natural resources; generation of wastes, including greenhouse gases; and inefficient use of energy. The Brundtland Commission and subsequent 1987 report recognized this behavior as globally unsustainable. Over the past 25 years, much effort has been expended to establish carbon emissions on a country-by-country basis to demonstrate reductions against a baseline. There has been a transformation in energy consumption in commercial and residential buildings as a result of concerted efforts in energy conservation. However, the construction of buildings and infrastructure and the operations and maintenance of infrastructure have received comparatively little attention, despite being responsible for significant proportions of global greenhouse gas emissions. This paper concentrates on the use of carbon accounting and embodied energy methods for a wide range of ground engineering construction activities. The authors examine concepts of capital and operational carbon and associated payback period and provide examples that show how this holistic approach can result in design changes and considered choices in construction and maintenance means and methods. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Construction industry; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Maintenance; Carbon accounting; Carbon emissions; Construction of buildings; Ground engineerings; Holistic approach; Operations and maintenance; Rapid urbanizations; Residential building; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906831890

Evaluating modifications to existing building stocks is essential to a proper assessment of GHG reduction policy at various levels. With deeper penetration of intermittent renewable energy resources, supply and demand effects at a high resolution (e.g. hourly) will become more important as variations in grid emissions will become more significant. Citylevel hourly electricity load data is available; however, effects of building stock changes on usage profiles are not easily analyzed, and on-site fossil fuel usage - the dominant loads in many urban areas - are generally only available annually. Building energy models allow for detailed simulation of building systems, but existing building models must be calibrated to actual energy usage to predict the effects of energy conservation measures. Reference building models developed by the U.S. Department of Energy for the EnergyPlus software tool were used as the basis for a set of calibrated building energy models to perform community-scale energy conservation measures on the dominant building classes in NYC (i.e. residential and office buildings). A statistical analysis of zip code-level annual electricity and fuel usage data was performed to determine electricity, space heating fuel and domestic hot water (DHW) fuel usage intensities (EUIs) for three broad building categories encompassing these building types in New York City. Several parameters were adjusted for each model until simulations produced the EUIs from the statistical analysis: Thermal envelope characteristics, peak electric equipment and lighting loads, DHW flow requirements, cooling equipment coefficient of performance and heating equipment efficiency. Cooling energy demands were adjusted based on the electricity demand vs. temperature behavior during the cooling season. The hourly daily usage schedules of internal electric and lighting loads were then adjusted for all models, targeting the actual hourly electricity demands for NYC. Because hourly changes affect annual EUIs, the calibrations were performed iteratively until the model outputs, weighted by each building type's total NYC square footage, equaled the annual EUIs for each building type and the hourly electricity demand data. This paper shows that this comprehensive calibration approach can achieve root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 7% from the average annual electricity demand for these building types, compared to a 31% RMSD for an approach using annual energy calibration only.

The tool has been especially developed and revamped for affordable green building assessment helping to reduce global warming. Hence, by the comparably simple and transparent energy audit it provides, the TEPC examines buildings for their: (1) contribution to reduce CO2; (2) transmission rate in shielding a building's envelope against the effects of the tropical heat; (3) generation of thermal comfort and (4) referring total cost of ownership to green the building further. All four dimensions are measured in the rainbow colour scale in compliance with national energy regulations. Accordingly, this research examines the tool's implementation in tropical countries.

By reducing air pollution levels, it is possible to reduce the global burden of disease from respiratory infections, heart disease, and lung cancer. Air pollution is a major environmental health problem able to produce serious risks to health from exposure to particulate matter (PM) and ozone (O3) in many cities, including Multan, Pakistan. At present there are no national inventories that estimate air pollutant emissions in Pakistan, and regular monitoring of environmental air quality is still not systematic in this country. According to the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), a major share of the emissions load from motor vehicles, although not quantified, can be attributed to a relatively small number of smoky diesel and two-stroke vehicles found in many Pakistani cities. The high levels of sulfur in automotive diesel (0.5–1%) and furnace oil (1–3.5%) are seen as a major contributor PM in ambient air. Emissions from large-scale facilities and a wide range of small-to-medium-scale industries (brick kilns, steel rerolling, steel recycling, plastic molding, etc.) cause a disproportionate share of pollution through their use of dirty “waste” fuels (i.e., old tires, paper, wood, and textile waste) and the use of diesel electric generators in commercial and residential areas. In Multan, the burning of municipal solid waste is also a significant source of air pollution in the urban area, where almost 48,000 t of solid waste is generated each day, most of which is either dumped in low-lying areas or burned at low temperatures, generating PM, but also producing other carcinogenic pollutants. The air quality monitoring program presented in this chapter aims at providing information for identifying main pollution sources and analyzing pollutant transport dynamics through the continuous measurements of aerosol, trace gas concentrations, and meteorological variables in Multan. Within this project a monitoring station has been installed at Multan Airport: this represents the first permanent air quality station working in this city. The activities have been carried out in collaboration with the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and the Environmental Sciences Department of the Bahauddin Zakariya University (BZU). The air quality system performs continuous measurements of meteorological variables, PM 2.5 and PM 10 (atmospheric particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 and 10 μm, respectively) and O3. Measurement results will allow to improve knowledge in the field of atmospheric sciences and air quality monitoring in order to facilitate sustainable development resource management at local level. Moreover, in collaboration with the PMD, a preliminary “Air Quality Monitoring Plan” has been defined to collect available information on local conditions and to provide suggestion for the implementation of an action plan to improve air quality in Multan City such as the reinforcement of environmental regulations, infrastructural interventions (e.g., roads) to reduce dust emissions, and the organization of awareness campaigns regarding air pollution control at school and university level. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Aerosol optical depth; Cholistan desert; Mineral dust; National environment quality standard; Pakistan meteorological department",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060541973

Black carbon (BC) is a good indicator of combustion-related air pollution and is associated with negative health effects. In addition BC and CO2 emissions are known to contribute significantly to global warming. Current traffic control systems are designed to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. The CARBOTRAF system combines real-time monitoring of traffic with simulation models for emissions and local air quality prediction in order to deliver on-line recommendations for alternative adaptive traffic management. The aim of introducing a CARBOTRAF system is to reduce BC and CO2 emissions and improve air quality by optimizing the traffic flows. The system is implemented and evaluated in two pilot cities, Graz and Glasgow. Model simulations link traffic states to emission and air quality levels. A chain of models combines micro-scale traffic simulations, traffic volumes, emission models and air quality simulations. This process is completed for several ITS scenarios and a range of traffic boundary conditions. The real-time DSS system uses these off-line model simulations to select optimal traffic and air quality scenarios. Traffic and BC concentrations are simultaneously monitored.

Due to uneconomic waste management, resources are being lost, which presents long-term problems due to the lack of economic competitiveness and loss of jobs. Reuse represents a major contribution to achieving the prioritization of waste management and indirectly contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, extends the life of products, reduces the amount of waste disposed to landfills and saves raw materials and natural resources. Moreover, reuse is an important contribution to the realization of social entrepreneurship. It stimulates the production of local jobs in deficit areas and allows for the promotion of craft professions which are in Slovenia almost extinct. The paper shows the activity of a network of reuse centres located in Slovenia which play the leading role in the implementation of the prioritization of waste management and the development of green jobs. The centres, in which it is possible to make garments and textiles, order unique products or buy items with added value are located in Rogaška Slatina, Tepanje, Slovenske Konjice, Vojnik, Trebnje, Tržič, Ljubljana and Ormož. Special emphasis is placed on preparing the presentation of clothing and textile waste for reuse. Since the concept of reuse benefits the society, as it in the addition to reducing waste impacts the thinking and understanding of limited resources, the designers and buyers can also feel the real value of the materials in an entirely different image.","Green jobs; Reuse; Social entrepreneurship; Textile waste","Economic competitiveness; Green jobs; Long-term problems; Prioritization; Reducing waste; Reuse; Social entrepreneurship; Waste prevention; Greenhouse gases; Textiles; Waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897852961

The second improvement is to the suite of climatic elements, which now includes both maximum and minimum temperatures. The third improvement is to the computational approach, which now employs climatologically aided interpolation to address topographic and network variability. Version 2 exhibits substantial differences from version 1 over the period 1895-2012. For example, divisional averages in version 2 tend to be cooler and wetter, particularly in mountainous areas of the western United States. Division-level trends in temperature and precipitation display greater spatial consistency in version 2. National-scale temperature trends in version 2 are comparable to those in the U.S. Historical Climatology Network whereas version 1 exhibits less warming as a result of historical changes in observing practices. Divisional errors in version 2 are likely less than 0.58C for temperature and 20mmfor precipitation at the start of the record, falling rapidly thereafter.

Instead USEPA would mandate that unless a coal fired power plant met the same carbon dioxide (CO2) emission levels as achievable with power plants utilizing Integrated Gas Combined Cycle (IGCC) combustion technology that in addition provided permanent sequestion of at least 25% of the CO2 produced, it could not be built. This prohibition, like the historic prohibition of alcohol, is more likely to have negative rather than positive consequences. This paper focuses on facts concerning fossil fuel utilization and its impacts upon global climate, the global economy, and the world population. It contrasts the impacts of current popular notions in the media and the regulations that govern our nation, that fossil fuels are an evil that must be stopped, versus the utilization of common sense to assess how to best use and advance currently available science and technology. It highlights best available control technology that could reduce the man made contribution of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in a way that does not bankrupt the global economy and jeopardize the global population. It will assess the growth of renewable energy and project the number of generations that would be required to have them replace fossil fuel as an energy source. The paper will compare the historical relevance of the impacts of the prohibition of alcohol in the United States from 1920-1933 that contributed to the rise of organized crime funded by the illegal trade in alcoholic beverages. It will examine this historic precedent on alcohol prohibition and contrast it with the probable result of government actions that seek to prohibit the production and use of fossil fuels. It will conclude that if existing proven technologies, such as those that are currently available for improving the efficiency and environmental performance of coal fired power plants were utilized worldwide, then coal power plant fuel efficiency would increase by 40% and the production of carbon dioxide would be reduced by another 40% for the remaining coal that is burned. Any solution related to CO2 reduction must evaluate its impact on the total supply of global energy which will directly impact the global economy. Solutions that are in effect a prohibition on any given energy commodity are not likely to find acceptance in the global economy without the introduction of affordable and available replacements. Given: (1) the world's current dependence upon fossil fuels (83% of the total) to run the world economy; and (2) the best projections for the reduction of this use by non-fossil fuels into any foreseeable future (a reduction of 6% in a 30 year generation); it would be extremely short sighted for the USA to not be in the forefront of nations with advanced technological knowhow to be: (a) systematically advancing currently available supercritical coal fired boiler technology and (b) working on the development of promising new technologies such as the Integrated Gas Combined Cycle (IGCC) coal fired technology and carbon capture and sequestration technologies with the potential to increase the efficiency and environmental performance of coal fired electrical power plants so they could be made available to the rest of the world. Since technological progress is evolutionary rather than revolutionary, prohibitions on resource specific technological progress as advocated by the USEPA will ultimately be interpreted by the public as the worst sort of policy proving grossly inadequate in limiting global CO2 levels and promoting social injustice. Common sense would dictate that the USA place all of its efforts into promoting the systematic advancement of the best technologies currently available for improving the efficiencies and environmental performance of all energy resources, including fossil fuels, if we are to help the rest of the globe reduce CO2 emission rates in a positive and significant manner.","Environmental protection; Fossil fuels; Utilization efficiency","Alcohol fuels; Alcoholic beverages; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal fired boilers; Coal fueled furnaces; Economic geology; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Gas plants; Law enforcement; Metal drawing; Mining; Nuclear fuels; Particulate emissions; Population dynamics; Sustainable development; Technology transfer; Best available control technologies; Carbon capture and sequestrations; Carbon dioxide emissions; Environmental performance; Fossil fuel utilization; Integrated gas combined cycles; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Utilization efficiency; Fossil fuel power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083942644

In recent literature, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was employed to decompose a series of air pollutant levels, followed by modeling using support vector machine (SVM). This combination of DWT and SVM was reported to produce a more accurate prediction model for air pollutants by investigating different levels of frequency bands. However, DWT has a significant demand in model complexity, namely, the training time and the model size of the prediction model. In this paper, a new method called variation-oriented filtering (VF) is proposed to remove the data with low variation, which can be considered as noise to a prediction model. By VF, the noise and the size of the series of air pollutant levels can be reduced simultaneously and hence so are the training time and model size. The SO(sulfur dioxide) level in Macau was selected as a test case. Experimental results show that VF can effectively and efficiently reduce the model complexity with improvement in predictive accuracy. © 2014 Chi Man Vong et al.",,"Air pollution; Discrete wavelet transforms; Frequency bands; Sulfur dioxide; Support vector machines; Accurate prediction; Air pollutants; Data filtering; Model complexity; Model size; Prediction model; Predictive accuracy; Training time; Mathematical models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899967883

The technical work is split in four technical sub-projects on ultra-high pressure ratio compressors, lean combustion and fuel injection, structures and thermal management and engine performance assessment. The technology will be developed at subsystem and component level and validated in test rigs up to TRL5. The developed technologies will be assessed using three generic study engines (i.e. regional turbofan, mid-size open rotor, and large turbofan) representing about 90% of the expected future commercial aero-engine market. Two additional study engines from the previous NEWAC project will be used for comparison. These are based on intercooled and intercooled-recuperated future engine concepts. The compressor work is targeting efficiency, stability margin and flow capacity by improved aerodynamic design. High-pressure and intermediate-pressure compressors are addressed. The mechanical and thermo-mechanical functions, including the variable-stator-systems, will be improved. Axialcentrifugal compressors with impeller and centrifugal diffuser are under investigation too. Three lean burn fuel injection systems are developed to match the technology to the corresponding engine pressure levels. These are the PERM (Partially Evaporating Rapid Mixing), the MSFI (Multiple Staged Fuel Injection) and the advanced LDI (Lean Direct Injection) combustion systems. The air flow and combustion systems are investigated. The fuel control systems are adapted to the requirements of the ultrahigh pressure engines with lean fuel injection. Combustorturbine interaction will be investigated. A fuel system analysis will be performed using CFD methods. Improved structural design and thermal management is required to reduce the losses and to reduce component weight. The application of new materials and manufacturing processes, including welding and casting aspects, will be investigated. The aim is to reduce the cooling air requirements and improve turbine aerodynamics to support the high-pressure engine cycles. The final objective is to have innovative ultra-high pressure-ratio core-engine technologies successfully validated at subsystem and component level. Increasing the thermal efficiency of the engine cycles relative to year 2000 in-service engines with OPR of up to 70 (at max. condition) is an enabler and key lever of the core-engine technologies to achieve and even exceed the ACARE 2020 targets on CO2, NOx and other pollutant emissions: • 20 to 30 % CO2 reduction at the engine level, exceeding both, the ACARE 15 to 20% CO2 reduction target for the engine and subsequently the overall 50% committed CO2 and the fuel burn reduction target on system level (including the contributions from operations and airframe improvements), • 65 to 70 % NOx reduction at the engine level (CAEP/2) to attain and exceed the ACARE objective of 80% overall NOx reduction (including the contributions from both, operational efficiency and airframe improvement), reduction of other emissions (CO, UHC and smoke/particulates) and • Reduction of the propulsion system weight (engine including nacelle without pylon).

Maritime transport and seaport areas have been included since the 1990s, with the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the MARPOL treaty (1997-ongoing) gradually leading the way to cleaner shipping. Political interest is rising, because maritime and seaport emissions negatively affect the lives of millions of people. Environmental policy may stimulate technical fixes, both end-of-pipe and at the source. Seaport terminal operators may buy more energy efficient equipment, replace diesel by electricity and optimize operations. Ship owners may adapt their fleet to reduce fuel consumption. Less fuel consumed means lower (local) emissions (of SO2, NOx, PM10, CO2) to the air; interesting options, which are increasingly put to good service. A critical assessment of their real impact in a longer timeframe is warranted. In a desk-research study, an input-output model was used to determine the impact of these technical fixes on (local) air pollution. It turns out that their impact can be substantial: reductions in air pollution of 70% and beyond by ships and terminal equipment. Cleaner air goes in parallel with lower operational costs as well. A green company image also attracts customers. A caveat is that the environmental impact of cleaner fuels is partially compensated by the growth in container transport. Transport is a consequence of logistic choices. Replacing global- by regional or local sourcing/sales and transport optimisation (optimised use of containers) is a worthwhile alternative, which also makes macro-economic sense. © 2014 WIT Press.","Air pollution; Fuels; Logistics; Ports; Sea transport","atmospheric pollution; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; fuel; input-output analysis; logistics; macroeconomics; pollutant source; pollution effect; port",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903180168

In contrast to most-real life cases, the proposed approach facilitates the inclusion of multiple criteria to support decision-making i.e. life span, required growth space, planting capability in built environment, aesthetics, tolerance, pollution attenuation, adaptation to local climate, crown density, cost, and potential allergenicity of species. The framework combines two multi-criteria methods to provide an optimal ranking and enhance the robustness of decision-support. The approach is implemented for the center of Thessaloniki, Greece. Mulberry, sweetgum, scholar tree and hackberry are highly ranked and can be considered as excellent alternatives considering their combined performances to all criteria.

The wide abundance of biomass material, in particular lignin, makes it a promising feedstock for diesel-range fuel production. The conversion of lignin to liquid energy carriers requires novel catalytic approaches in order to obtain a uniform pool of hydrocarbons.[1] While lignin, a highly branched phenol-based polymer, contains much less oxygen than cellulose, the high oxygen content in the lignin-derived molecules still requires substantial amounts of hydrogen for complete reduction to hydrocarbons.[2] The hydrogenation of ligninderived bio-oils on metals, such as Pd or Ni, leads to a range of C6-C9 cycloalkanols. The alcohols must be dehydrated to olefins and then further alkylated and hydrogenated to obtain diesel-range alkanes. While a direct, one pot, conversion of lignin would be most advantageous, the dehydration step of the reaction cascade still poses significant complications and is rate-limiting for the reaction sequence. In the past hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) has been successfully performed on dual functional metal/acid catalysts even in liquid water, which is the solvent of choice due to its ubiquitous presence.[3] Also, it has been shown that phenol hydroalkylation on solid acids, such as HBEA, can take place in aqueous environment thereby providing a way to increase the bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation product carbon numbers.[4] This can be tentatively attributed to the unique environment of the zeolitic pores (often referred to as confinement and nest effects[5]) leading to better stabilization of the sorbed and transition states.[6] A fundamental study of the active centers, reaction intermediates and reaction dynamics/kinetics is critically needed to facilitate the development of catalysts for the practical conversion of biomass to energy-carrying alkanes. Therefore, we introduce the application of a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies that enable us to monitor the state of the reacting molecules and determine the catalyst active site structure. We have recently reported an in-situ study of a cyclohexanol reaction (a common cycloalkanol from phenol HDO) on HBEA in liquid water at elevated temperatures using high-resolution magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy.[7] In particular, this method not only enabled us to discriminate between different mechanisms of water elimination, but also to follow the distribution and catalyst adsorption of products during the reaction. It was shown that the initial rates of functional group migration in the reactants/products during cyclohexanol dehydration on HBEA in liquid water are better explained by the E1 mechanism. This new insight can lead to improved reaction control and process design for cycloalkanol dehydration in the future. The developed technique is also suitable for study of other industrially relevant reactions, e.g. alkylation and isomerization reactions. In a separate effort the structure of the catalysts, HBEA150 and HBEA25, was analyzed in unprecedented detail. As a note in passing, Al3+ substitutes Si in the tetrahedral (T) positions of the zeolite framework forming the catalytically active sites. HBEA has nine different T-sites. Previously, it has been difficult to determine experimentally the distribution of Al3+ amongst the different T-sites in the zeolite.[8] We report a quantitative analysis of the Al K-edge EXAFS that allowed us to determine the Al3+ lattice distribution. The experimental EXAFS spectra were interpreted by invoking a linear combination fit of the molecular dynamics (MD) EXAFS derived for each T-site from the DFT modeled structure. It has been determined that most of the Al3+ populating T-sites that are part of one or more 4- member framework rings. In contrast, dramatically different Al3+ distributions are found for the T-sites occupying only 5- and 6-member rings. Using the method described above, we studied the integrity of HBEA framework under hot liquid water conditions that are typical for HDO. Commonly there are two mechanisms describing zeolite lattice degradation: acid catalyzed dealumination, removal of Al3+ from the T-sites and base-catalyzed hydrolysis of siloxane bonds. It was determined that dealumination does not occur under high-temperature water conditions up to the point where the zeolite undergoes complete lattice degradation. It was also found that the Al3+ site retains its coordination and local structure, remaining identical to that of the initial HBEA T-site. For the same samples, however, we observed severe loss of crystallinity. These results suggest that the desilication mechanism is primarily responsible for the increasing number of framework defect sites, which form as a function of time. We believe future work in the field of catalyst design in particular in respect to framework Al3+ distribution will benefit greatly from this capability. In summary, a combination of two novel approaches for both reaction and catalyst studies is presented and their application is demonstrated. The new understanding of the dehydration reaction step as part of the overall HDO cascade is an important advance toward future industrial implementation of the bio-oil conversion to diesel-range fuels. The quantitative analysis of Al3+ T-site distribution and the zeolite framework stability in liquid water are highly relevant to refining. In particular, the optimization of zeolite performance and increase of catalyst life cycle will greatly reduce both environmental impact and refinery operation costs to the industry.",,"Bioconversion; Biofuels; Biomass; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Dehydration; Design for testability; Environmental impact; Extended X ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy; Fuels; Functional groups; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogenation; Isomerization; Life cycle; Lignin; Liquids; Magic angle spinning; Molecular dynamics; Molecules; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Oil shale; Oil wells; Oxygen; Palladium; Paraffins; Phenols; Reaction kinetics; Refining; X ray absorption; Base-catalyzed hydrolysis; Cyclohexanol dehydration; Extended Xray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies; High resolution magic angle spinning; High-temperature water; Industrial implementation; Isomerization reaction; Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR); Reaction intermediates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910622126

The true success, however, of this trend depends on the successful integration of electric vehicles on the infrastructure systems that support them. Left unmanaged electric vehicles may suffer from delays due to charging or cause destabilizing charging loads on the electrical grid. While many works have sought to mitigate these effects with advanced functionality such as coordinated charging, vehicle-to-grid stabilization, and charging queue management, few works have assessed these impacts as a holistic transportation-electricity nexus. Furthermore, rigorous dynamic system mathematical models that couple the kinematic and electrical states have yet to be developed holistically. This paper develops such a model in the hopes of its application by EV fleet operators to not just assess but also improve their operations &amp; control. The hybrid dynamic system model is composed of a marked petri-net model superimposed on the continuous time kinematic and electrical state evolution. The application of the model is demonstrated on an illustrative example of modest size and sufficient functional heterogeneity. © 2014 American Automatic Control Council.","Discrete event systems; Hybrid systems; Petri nets","Carbon dioxide; Discrete event simulation; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Hybrid systems; Kinematics; Mathematical models; Petri nets; Coordinated charging; Emissions reduction; Functional heterogeneity; Hybrid dynamic systems; Infrastructure systems; Petri-net modeling; Queue management; Transportation electrifications; Nonlinear control systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905674583

Severe governmental policies steering on reducing the energy use seem essential to stimulate and enforce the improvement of the energy performance of buildings with a focus on reducing the heating and cooling energy demand. In Europe the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is a driving force for member states to develop and strengthen energy performance regulations for new buildings and energy certificates for the building stock. The goals are to build net zero energy new buildings in 2020 and to reach a neutral energy situation in the whole stock by 2050. More and more research projects deliver insight that the expected impact of stricter regulations for newly built houses is limited and the actual effects of energy savings through housing renovations stay behind the expectations. Theoretical energy use calculated on base of the design standard for new houses and assessment standards for Energy Performance Certificates of existing dwellings differ largely from the measured actual energy use.

Observed and forecasted climate modifications in this region, such as the CO2 concentration and temperature increase and the net radiation, rainfall and wind speed decrease, will likely alter vegetation water stress and modify productivity. In order to simulate how climatic change could alter soil moisture dynamic, biomass growth and fruit productivity, a water-driven crop model has been used in this study. The numerical model, previously calibrated on an olive orchard located in Sicily (Italy) with a satisfactory reproduction of historical olive yield data, has been forced with future climate scenarios generated using a stochastic weather generator and a downscaling procedure of an ensemble of climate model outputs. The stochastic downscaling is carried out using simulations of some General Circulation Models adopted in the fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report (4AR) for future scenarios. The outcomes state that climatic forcings driving potential evapotranspiration compensate for each other, resulting in a slight increase of this water demand flux; moreover, the increase of CO2 concentration leads to a potential assimilation increase and, consequently, to an overall productivity increase in spite of the growth of water stress due to the rainfall reduction. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Climate change; Crop model; Olive yield; Stochastic downscaling","Atmospheric composition; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Crops; Forestry; Orchards; Productivity; Rain; Soil moisture; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Crop model; Down-scaling; Future climate scenarios; General circulation model; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Olive yield; Potential evapotranspiration; Stochastic weather generator; Climate change; climate forcing; crop production; downscaling; Mediterranean environment; olivine; orchard; rainfall; simulation; water stress; weather forecasting; Italy; Sicily",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901992208

Despite their large socioeconomic impacts, research into heavy rainfall and flooding associated with TCs has received limited attention to date and still represents a major challenge. The capability to adapt to future changes in heavy rainfall and flooding associated with TCs is inextricably linked to and informed by understanding of the sensitivity of TC rainfall to likely future forcing mechanisms. Here a set of idealized high-resolution atmospheric model experiments produced as part of the U.S. Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) Hurricane Working Group activity is used to examine TC response to idealized global-scale perturbations: the doubling of CO2, uniform 2-K increases in global sea surface temperature (SST), and their combined impact. As a preliminary but key step, daily rainfall patterns of composite TCs within climate model outputs are first compared and contrasted to the observational records. To assess similarities and differences across different regions in response to the warming scenarios, analyses are performed at the global and hemispheric scales and in six global TC ocean basins. The results indicate a reduction in TC daily precipitation rates in the doubling CO2 scenario (on the order of 5% globally) and an increase in TC rainfall rates associated with a uniform increase of 2K in SST (both alone and in combination with CO2 doubling; on the order of 10%-20% globally). © 2014 American Meteorological Society.","Extreme events, Hurricanes/typhoons, Precipitation, Climate models","Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Floods; Hurricanes; Oceanography; Climate variability; Daily precipitations; Daily rainfall patterns; High-resolution atmospheric models; Hurricanes/typhoons; Limited attentions; Sea surface temperature (SST); Socio-economic impacts; Rain; atmospheric forcing; climate modeling; climate variation; hurricane; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; sensitivity analysis; tropical cyclone; typhoon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902094521

On a global scale, the variability of these emissions had been attributed to water table variations; however, at landscape scales this variability is poorly understood. We measured CH4 fluxes from five characteristic wetland plant communities of southwest Florida representing a gradient in inundation periods. From wettest to driest conditions, communities were designated as deep slough, bald cypress, wet prairie, pond cypress and hydric pine flatwood. Non-steady-state rigid chambers were deployed at each community sequentially at three different times of the day during a 24-month period. CH4 fluxes did not show a discernible daily pattern, in contrast to a marked seasonal increase in emissions during inundation. All wetland communities acted as temporary sinks of CH4, but overall were net sources. Median and mean ± standard error fluxes in CH4-C m-2 d-1 were higher in deep slough (11 and 55.3 ± 21.5), followed by the wet prairie (9.01 and 53.3 ± 26.6), bald cypress (3.31 and 5.54 ± 2.51) and pond cypress (1.49, 4.55 ± 3.35). The pine flatwood community acted as a net sink during the study period (0.0 and-1.22 ± 0.81). Seasonality in CH4 emissions was positively correlated with water levels, but not with soil temperature. However, longer inundation periods did not necessarily result in higher CH4 emissions. These findings add to our current knowledge of CH4 fluxes from subtropical wetland ecosystems and have implications for modeling at ecosystem scales in heterogeneous wetland landscapes. © 2014 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of Polish Academy of Sciences.","Climate change; Cypress swamp; Florida; Hydroperiod; Methane emissions; Southwest; Subtropical wetlands","Cupressus; Taxodium distichum; Taxodium distichum var. imbricarium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927571485

Statistically significant downward trends (computed using the nonparametric Theil-Sen method) in annual on-road CO, NOx, and VOC emissions of 6.1%, 3.3%, and 6.0% per year, respectively, are noted during the 1995–2009 period despite an increase in total vehicle distance traveled. The CO and NOx emission trends are correlated with statistically significant downward trends in ambient air concentrations of CO and NOx in Atlanta ranging from 8.0% to 11.8% per year and from 5.8% to 8.7% per year, respectively, during similar time periods. Weather-adjusted summertime ozone concentrations in Atlanta exhibited a statistically significant declining trend of 2.3% per year during 2001–2009. Although this trend coexists with the declining trends in on-road NOx, VOC, and CO emissions, identifying the cause of the downward trend in ozone is complicated by reductions in multiple precursors from different source sectors. Implications: Large reductions in on-road vehicle emissions of CO and NOx in Atlanta from the late 1990s to 2009, despite an increase in total vehicle distance traveled, contributed to a significant improvement in air quality through decreases in ambient air concentrations of CO and NOx during this time period. Emissions reductions in motor vehicles and other source sectors resulted in these improvements and the observed declining trend in ozone concentrations over the past decade. Although these historical trends cannot be extrapolated to the future because pollutant concentration contributions due to on-road vehicle emissions will likely become an increasingly smaller fraction of the atmospheric total, they provide an indication of the benefits of past control measures. © 2014 A&WMA.",,"Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Exhaust gases; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Roads and streets; Volatile organic compounds; Ambient air concentration; Ambient air quality; Emissions reduction; Motor vehicle emissions; National emissions inventories; On-road vehicle emissions; Pollutant concentration; Similar time periods; Vehicles; carbon monoxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; ambient air; Article; concentration (parameters); exhaust gas; priority journal; traffic and transport; trend study; United States; weather; air pollutant; air pollution; article; chemistry; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; history; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon Monoxide; Environmental Monitoring; Georgia; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Nitrogen Oxides; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906991438

However, the final choice about the real acceptability of a biomass plant must take into account different aspects; from one side the benefits in terms of limitation of contribution to global warming and use of local resources for energy production; from the other side, the rather important effects on local air quality. In fact, it is important to evaluate the territorial aspects, the eventual need to import in order to satisfy the local energy requirement and, above all, consideration of environmental positive aspects is important, as concerns GHG limitation and the right destination of residual or waste materials that can be used in energy production. Thus, in order to evaluate advantages and limits, the useful tools consist of the classification of all the biomass that is available, the construction of energy and environmental balance, the definition of consumptions and emissions and the evaluation of air quality effects derived from meteorological and orographic conditions. These are the right instruments that can be utilized in order to evaluate the interactions of biomass plants with the global environment. These tools and instruments have been applied for two Italian case studies. The main conclusions are that the utilization of biomass for energetic purposes can lead to positive solutions towards the limitation of consequences as concerns climate change without unacceptable negative effects on a local scale, if careful localization is considered. The specific considered cases can be also indicative of a general methodology, useful for fundamental procedures of compatible energy planning. © 2014 WIT Press.","Air quality; Biomass; District heating; GHG; Local compatibility","air quality; alternative energy; biomass; emission control; energy balance; greenhouse gas; heating; renewable resource; sustainability; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897868386

Gas/particle partitioning in the EMEP4UK model simulations used a bulk approach, which may lead to uncertainties in simulated secondary inorganic aerosol. However, model simulations were able to accurately represent both the long-term decadal surface concentrations of particle sulfate and nitrate and an episode in early 2003 of substantially elevated nitrate measured across the UK by the AGANet network. The latter was identified as consisting of three separate episodes, each of less than 1 month duration, in February, March and April. The primary cause of the elevated nitrate levels across the UK was meteorological: a persistent high-pressure system, whose varying location impacted the relative importance of transboundary versus domestic emissions. Whilst long-range transport dominated the elevated nitrate in February, in contrast it was domestic emissions that mainly contributed to the March episode, and for the April episode both domestic emissions and long-range transport contributed. A prolonged episode such as the one in early 2003 can have substantial impact on annual average concentrations. The episode led to annual concentration differences at the regional scale of similar magnitude to those driven by long-term changes in precursor emissions over the full decade investigated here. The results demonstrate that a substantial part of the UK, particularly the south and southeast, may be close to or exceeding annual mean limit values because of import of inorganic aerosol components from continental Europe under specific conditions. The results reinforce the importance of employing multiple year simulations in the assessment of emissions reduction scenarios on particulate matter concentrations and the need for international agreements to address the transboundary component of air pollution. © Author(s) 2014.",,"aerosol; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric transport; concentration (composition); emission control; long range transport; nitrate; particulate matter; partitioning; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928738759

These countries still have the majority of their traffic infrastructure based on individual-mobility meaning that public transport and alternative means of transport are not a priority yet for many reasons. As a consequence, rising CO2 emissions remain an important constraint towards sustainability in these regions. Taking into consideration the Brazilian example, this study analyses the Brazilian experience in developing and producing flex-fuel vehicles (FFV) which are cars that can run with both gasoline and bioethanol produced from sugarcane with the so-called advanced engines. It is argued here that the FFV technology developed in Brazil is an important mitigation initiative towards low-carbon urban centres and a great example of innovation in the Brazilian automotive sector. This research uses the organizational learning literature and applies the case study method to demonstrate how the process of technology transfer occurs among companies involved with this Brazilian technology, showing case-particularities and factors that facilitate or hinder the knowledge transfer process. For example, results show that some institutional aspects in the Brazilian bioethanol industry were crucial to turn this technology-initially developed to contribute to the country's energy security-into a very successful example of mitigation in the national mobility sector. Interactions among the actors within the chain, labour mobility, effective participation of research institutions and the leader role of the automaker's suppliers all enabled the rise of learning processes which were essential to the technology transfer process. © 2014 WIT Press.","Brazilian flex-fuel vehicles; Mitigation technologies; Organizational learning; Technology transfer","Automotive industry; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Ethanol; Fuels; Knowledge management; Research; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; Technology transfer; Urban transportation; Bioethanol industry; Climate change policies; Flex-fuel; Institutional aspects; Knowledge transfer; Organizational learning; Research institutions; Traffic infrastructure; Bioethanol; biofuel; carbon emission; climate change; environmental policy; participatory approach; public transport; technological development; technology transfer; Brazil",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903204486

Interestingly these systems have been around for over 40 years, but have only locally developed into main stream growing systems, mainly in Australia and Asia. This paper addresses the questions of what drives this renewed interest, why these systems haven't developed earlier - like for example stone wool-based systems - and whether hydroponic systems are reliable enough for sustainable, large scale introduction. We analysed case material of regional transition processes in horticultural production systems from over the past 50 years. We analysed the processes according to 1) the need for change in horticulture at the time - the main drivers, 2) the knowledge system available, 3) the knowledge available and 4) the windows of opportunity for introduction. Early adoption to hydroponic systems in the '70s led to system failures due to lack of knowledge of nutrient management, the role of oxygen, systematic design approaches, an over-focus on logistical solutions and disease management. By the time most of these issues were understood - in the '80s - the interest in hydroponic systems had made way for substrate-based systems in most areas of the world. Insights in disease management, emission reduction and a deeper understanding of root physiology however, have remained under-developed. Looking at the knowledge system surrounding successful introductions like the stone wool-based systems in the '80s, we find well-funded extension services to help growers adjust to the new systems and open-source innovation. Substrate-less systems largely lacked such support and lacked knowledge exchange due to large distances between first users. Extension activities were funded by governments as well as supplying companies with a vision for return on investment based on patents. For (easy to copy) hydroponic systems such knowledge protection was not available. Over the last 5-10 years a number of suppliers acquired knowledge protection through inventions on logistical aspects of the systems. We conclude that the renewed interest has a number of regional drivers such as depletion of land and societal interest in urban farming. However, to make hydroponic systems a lasting success, research effort should focus on reliable production: disease management, emission reduction and root development. Following, growers will need support to learn to operate these systems successfully. Given the current high needs, the international research interest and new forms of IP protection for suppliers, the time seems ripe for new, hydroponic systems to emerge.","Adoption; Deep flow technique; Nutrient film technique; System design; Transition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902253081

These projects bring good aspects that improve the economic situation and mobility in the region. On the flipside, transportation projects also may have an impact on the environment due to an increase in vehicle miles travelled and emissions. It is important to assess current on-road emissions to better plan control strategies that could help a region attain the ambient air quality standards. On-road emission models can be used as planning tools in various settings; for example: (1) metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) ranking projects for implementation; (2) air agencies working on state implementation plans; and (3) the State Department of Transportation working on National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis. The two pieces of the puzzle for estimating emissions are: (1) vehicle miles of travel (VMT); and, (2) emission factors. The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) has automated the process by developing a module, called EmiLink, that is used on the back end of the regional travel demand model. Currently, using results from this tool, volume changes between a build and a no-build network are estimated for all roadway links for all analysis years. EmiLink has been successfully applied to numerous projects undergoing the NEPA process in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) area. Not only has it reduced the time required to complete a MSAT analysis, but it also provides procedural and data assumption consistency. A case study was performed for the Loop-12 NEPA project in the DFW region which focused on pros and cons of the FHWA's currently recommended procedure and other methods or parameters that can be utilized to identify transportation impacts in a project level MSAT analysis. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Roads and streets; Ambient air quality standards; Development and applications; Impact on the environment; Metropolitan planning organizations; National Environmental Policy Act; Transportation projects; Vehicle miles of travels; Vehicle miles travelled; Multimodal transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905993728

An integrated environmental monitoring system was designed and implemented over the years. Furthermore, the impact assessment was supported by other tools, such as life cycle analysis (LCA) and risk assessment. In order to fulfil new rules, over the years, the plant underwent several revamping processes. The environmental monitoring was activated in 1997 an involved the analysis of several matrices: soil, atmospheric deposition, vegetation and particulate airborne matter. Based on the obtained results, the monitoring evolved and the sampling sites, analites, matrices and/or sampling techniques were modified. LCA application to the plant was carried out both to investigate the contribution of the incinerator to different environmental categories and to evaluate the effect of the revamping process on plant impacts. In order to assess health effects connected to plant activity, risk assessment applied to air emissions was evaluated for the period 1997-2006. All the study results show that incineration plant emissions do not appreciably affect the contaminant load in the study area. Source apportionment techniques demonstrated that the main sources in the study area are vehicular traffic and regional contribution. LCA indicates quantitatively the lower environmental impact resulting from structural upgrade operations.

Majority of extant studies on sustainable urban transport is focused on pollution caused by urban passenger transport, with marked paucity of literature on the impact of urban freight transport. To partly bridge this gap, the paper objective is the impact assessment of selected regulative measures, i. e. fleet renewal on freight transport emissions. We used the case of Novi Sad to estimate the potential impact of selected restrictive measures on the external freight transport air pollution. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies on impact of urban freight transport on the air pollution in the cities in the Balkan region. Several research findings are of interest. Firstly, the analysis of particular gas emissions reveals expected overall positive effects of the fleet renewal in most of cases. Still, the total amount of same emissions hardly increase, so this particular measure is not enough to reach the ambitious EU strategy goals concerned with sustainable urban freight transport. Further, some negative impacts of restrictive measures on gas emissions were also recorded and discussed. The observed complex impact of restrictive measures on urban freight air pollution indicates that urban freight transport planning and modeling requires a comprehensive database, clear goals and higher priority of environmental criterion in traffic planning. Our results and recommendations may be useful for scholars, urban transport planners, policy makers, and practitioners.","Air pollution; All-or-nothing assignment; COPERT 4; Engine technology restriction measures; Urban freight transport; Urban transport planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897762167

A study was undertaken to quantify methane emissions of cattle when nitrate replaced urea in a high concentrate diet. Twenty Angus steers were allocated to two treatment groups and acclimated to one of two iso-energetic and iso-nitrogenous finisher rations (containing NPN as urea or as calcium nitrate), with all individual feeding events recorded. A single methane measurement device (C-lock Inc., Rapid City, SD, USA) was exchanged weekly between treatments (2 × 1-week periods per treatment) to provide estimations of daily methane production (DMP; gCH 4/day). A 17% reduction in estimated DMP (P ≤ 0.071) resulted from nitrate feeding, attributed to both a tendency for reduced dry matter intake (DMI; P ≤ 0.088) and H2 capture by the consumed nitrate. NO3-fed cattle consumed a larger number of meals (14.69 vs 7.39 meals/day; P &lt; 0.05) of smaller size (0.770 vs 1.820 kg/meal) each day, so the average interval between a feeding event and methane measurement was less in NO3-fed cattle (3.44 vs 5.15 h; P &lt; 0.05). This difference could potentially have skewed the estimated DMP and contributed to the tendency (P ≤ 0.06) for NO3-fed cattle to have a higher methane yield (gCH4/kg DMI) than urea-fed cattle. This study found short-term methane emission measurements made over 2 weeks (per treatment group) were adequate to show dietary nitrate tended to reduce emission and change the feeding pattern of feedlot cattle. Changes in feeding frequency may have confounded the ability of short-term methane measurements to provide data suitable for accurately estimating methane per unit feed intake. © CSIRO 2014.","greenhouse gases; measurement","cattle; dry matter; emission; feeding behavior; measurement method; methane; nitrate; urea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906322637

Temperature changes are found in the vicinity of wind farms and previous simulations have suggested that large-scale wind farms could alter regional climate. However, assessments of the effects of realistic wind power development scenarios at the scale of a continent are missing. Here we simulate the impacts of current and near-future wind energy production according to European Union energy and climate policies. We use a regional climate model describing the interactions between turbines and the atmosphere, and find limited impacts. A statistically significant signal is only found in winter, with changes within ±0.3a ‰°C and within 0-5% for precipitation. It results from the combination of local wind farm effects and changes due to a weak, but robust, anticyclonic-induced circulation over Europe. However, the impacts remain much weaker than the natural climate interannual variability and changes expected from greenhouse gas emissions. & copy; 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Recovery has recently been added as a fourth action, and it is applied to the waste types that cannot be reused or recycled. Thus, recovery remains the last option before final landfilling. The annual amount of municipal waste from households in Finland is 2.5 million tons. Waste collection and utilization is organized relatively well, but still 1.1 million tons are disposed of to landfill. A recent survey on mixed waste quantity and quality showed that almost 65% of its content is bio-based. Energy recovery from this waste in combined incineration plants for district heat and electricity (CHP) may serve as an additional measure for greenhouse gas reduction in local communities. Since buildings are responsible for approximately 40% of energy consumption, it is important to reduce energy consumption. In Finland, due to the long heating season, the energy production method and heat source are extremely important for greenhouse gas reduction. This paper discusses energy recovery from waste in a case study of a new residential area in southern Finland. All the buildings fulfil current Finnish energy requirements and represent typical wooden frame construction with rendering façades. It is assumed that the households will be connected to the local district heat system, in which heat is produced partly in gasdriven heat plants and partly in a municipal waste incineration plant. We show that energy recovery from waste should not be underestimated, because it is a valuable means of greenhouse gas reduction, especially in local communities. © 2014 WIT Press.","Carbon footprint; District heat production; Energy efficient buildings; Greenhouse gas reduction; Municipal waste","building; carbon footprint; emission control; greenhouse gas; heat production; incineration; landfill; municipal solid waste; recycling; waste disposal; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926512866

This technology has been successfully applied to conventional furnace systems and seems to be an auspicious concept for reducing NOx and CO emissions in stationary gas turbines. To achieve a flameless combustion regime, fast mixing of recirculated burnt gases with fresh air and fuel in the combustion chamber is needed. In the present study, the combustor concept is based on the reverse flow configuration with two concentrically arranged nozzles for fuel and air injections. The present work deals with the active control of MILD combustion for gas turbine applications. For this purpose, a new concept of air flow rate pulsation is introduced. The pulsating unit offers the possibility to vary the inlet pressure conditions with a high degree of freedom: amplitude, frequency and waveform. The influence of air flow pulsation on MILD combustion is analyzed in terms of NOx and CO emissions. Results under atmospheric pressure show a drastic decrease of NOx emissions, up to 55%, when the pulsating unit is active. CO emissions are maintained at a very low level so that flame extinction is not observed. To get more insights into the effects of pulsation on combustion characteristics, velocity fields in cold flow conditions are investigated. Results show a large radial transfer of flow when pulsation is activated, hence enhancing the mixing process. The flame behavior is analyzed by using OH∗ chemiluminescence. Images show a larger distributed reaction region over the combustion chamber for pulsation conditions, confirming the hypothesis of a better mixing between fresh and burnt gases.

The aim was to evaluate the compatibility of atmospheric methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) measurements of the routine station instrumentation, consisting of a gas chromatograph (GC) for CH4 and N2O as well as a cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) system for CH4 and CO2. The advantage of a TCI approach for quality control is that the comparison covers the entire ambient air measurement system, including the sample intake system and the data evaluation process. For initial quality and performance control, the TCI was run in parallel with the Heidelberg GC before and after the measurement campaign at Mace Head. Median differences between the Heidelberg GC and the TCI were well within the WMO inter-laboratory compatibility target for all three greenhouse gases. At Mace Head, the median difference between the station GC and the TCI were -0.04 nmol mol-1 for CH4 and -0.37 nmol mol-1 for N2O (GC-TCI). For N2O, a similar difference (-0.40 nmol mol-1) was found when measuring surveillance or working gas cylinders with both instruments. This suggests that the difference observed in ambient air originates from a calibration offset that could partly be due to a difference between theWMON2O X2006a reference scale used for the TCI and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO-1998) scale used at Mace Head and in the whole AGAGE network. Median differences between the CRDS G1301 and the TCI at Mace Head were 0.12 nmol mol-1 for CH4 and 0.14 μmol mol-1 for CO2 (CRDS G1301 - TCI). The difference between both instruments for CO2 could not be explained, as direct measurements of calibration gases show no such difference. The CH4 differences between the TCI, the GC and the CRDS G1301 at Mace Head are much smaller than the WMO inter-laboratory compatibility target, while this is not the case for CO2 and N2O. © Author(s) 2014.

Energy efficient models can reduce megawatts of power through out globe thereby reducing carbon foot print by improving overall network lifetime of large scale networks. Recent advances in physical layer have optimized energy consumption of IEEE 802.15.4 Physical layer, but energy efficiency of MAC and network layers is also essential to realise Green wireless networks. Though anycast multi-hop communication is initiated by many recent researchers by obtaining reliability, delay and energy expressions, still there is no model that captures relay nodes state wise behaviour effectively. In this paper a new energy model with 3-dimensional Markov MAC model with generalized anycast routing and state behaviour is proposed and developed for asynchronous wireless ad hoc networks. Proposed state behaviour of node model has consideration of MAC and network parameters like minimum backoff exponent, maximum backoff stages and retries along with network parameters like packet length, wake up rate, Sleep, Idle-Listen, Active-Tx and Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) states. Results show that total energy of derived model depends on many network and MAC parameters. Affect of most of the considered parameters are analysed with simulation results. Total energy of the multi-hop network reduced to 25% with variation in minimum backoff exponent and increased by 45% with increase in packet length. It is observed that derived analytical energy model better fits with most of the parameters that affects energy. © 2014 IEEE.","Anycast routing; Clustered multi-hop network; End-to-end delay; Markov chain; Reliability; Wake up rates","Ad hoc networks; Carbon; Carrier communication; Carrier sense multiple access; Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Markov processes; Network layers; Network routing; Reliability; Smart power grids; Standards; Telecommunication networks; Wakes; Wireless networks; Anycast routing; Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidances; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); End to end delay; Energy efficient wireless networks; Multihop networks; Multihop wireless network; Wake up; Wireless ad hoc networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988287799

The system was designed to: separate solids and liquids with the aid of settling and polymer flocculants; biologically remove ammonia nitrogen with bacteria adapted to high-strength wastewater; remove phosphorus via alkali precipitation; and reduce emissions of odorant compounds, ammonia, pathogens, and heavy metals to environmental media. Technical environmental performance standards were those identified by the State of North Carolina in 15A NCAC 02T, 2010, Swine Waste Management System Performance Standards and included: discharge of animal waste to surface waters and groundwater; emission of ammonia; emission of odor; release of disease-transmitting vectors and airborne pathogens; and nutrient and heavy metal contamination of soil and groundwater. The third generation was designed to further reduce cost of manure treatment through pre-concentration of diluted manure using a decanting tank before polymer flocculation. The treatment system was demonstrated full-scale on a farrow-to-finish farm that produced 30, 450 swine per year. The treatment system was contained in tanks. The results showed that the innovative swine manure treatment system was capable of operating under steady state conditions treating flushed swine manure at a rate of approximately 75, 000 gallons of manure per day. The treatment system was documented to remove, on a mass basis, approximately 99% of total suspended solids, 98% of COD, 99% of TKN, 100% ammonia, 100% odor compounds, 92% phosphorus, 95% copper, and 97% zinc from the flushed manure. Fecal coliform reductions were measured to be 99.98% (when the alkali precipitation component of the system was at a pH of 10.1). The third generation technology meets the criteria identified in the referenced NC Performance Standards. The treatment process also provides a mechanism and market for the solids that are separated. Collectively this treatment process, when operated and managed under the conditions during which we conducted this study, significantly reduces the potential for emissions of odor and ammonia, and the transfer of nutrients and pathogenic bacteria to surface and groundwater in the drainage basin where the animals are grown on animal feeding operations.","Ammonia control; Animal waste treatment; CAFO; Environmentally superior technology; Nitrification-denitrification; Odor abatement; Phosphorus recovery; Solid-liquid separation; Swine wastewater","Agricultural wastes; Ammonia; Animals; Bacteria; Catchments; Environmental management; Environmental microbiology; Flocculation; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Heavy metals; Liquids; Manures; Nutrients; Odor control; Phosphorus; Separation; Soil pollution; Standards; Tanks (containers); Waste management; Waste treatment; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Animal wastes; CAFO; Environmentally superior technologies; Nitrification-denitrification; Odor abatement; Phosphorus recovery; Solid-liquid separation; Swine wastewater; Chemicals removal (water treatment)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911372299

As such, the allocation of competences between the European and national levels is governed by the principle of subsidiarity, which is aimed at maintaining a high level of decentralization. As it stands, subsidiarity is tested primarily, if not exclusively, against the presence of, or potential for, economic or environmental externalities of the regulated activity. Notwithstanding recent changes in the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen ex ante political control over the application of the subsidiarity principle, a rebuttable presumption in favor of an ever-increasing European role in environmental policy has developed. This Article aims to move beyond this rebuttable presumption by introducing additional criteria for competence allocation: Heterogeneity of preferences and conditions between regulated jurisdictions and activities, and the potential for economies of scale and scope. In addition, a distinction is made between the different phases of the regulatory process-specifically, norm setting, implementation, and enforcement-also referred to as regulatory competences. By distinguishing between these stages of regulation, the relative importance of externalities, and the additional criteria mentioned above, each stage of regulation is explicated. Finally, this Article discusses the extent to which instrument choice can act as an alternative for the centralization or decentralization of competences. The potential of this complementary ""competence allocation"" approach to the interpretation of subsidiarity in European environmental law is illustrated by a case study of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme.",,"centralization; decentralization; emissions trading; environmental legislation; environmental policy; European Union; policy implementation; regulatory framework; resource allocation; Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994462382

Finally, we look at the specific role that a macroregional climate change adaptation strategy has in helping to manage institutional complexity inherent in a multilevel governance context. © 2014 Pion and its Licensors.","Climate change adaptation; EU baltic sea region strategy; Institutions; Macroregion; Multilevel governance; Transnational cooperation","bottom-up approach; climate change; governance approach; government relations; regional climate; regional planning; regulatory framework; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919391542

It is understood that cities which pioneer a low emissions development model today will attract future investment, reduce energy costs and become efficient, inclusive, clean places to live and work tomorrow. Local governments have an important role in addressing non-technological barriers to support the transition to a renewable energy future. Two projects will illustrate approaches taken in this context. The Urban-LEDS project (www.urban-leds.org), funded by the European Commission, and implemented by ICLEI and UN-Habitat, supports local governments in emerging economy countries (Brazil, India, Indonesia and South Africa) to integrate low-carbon strategies into all sectors of urban planning and development, by defining and approving Urban Low Emissions Development Strategies (Urban-LEDS). The process is supported by experienced European cities, especially those with an understanding of policies, technologies and stakeholder engagement relevant to energy efficiency, renewable energy electricity, heating and cooling. The second project - The Municipal Climate Action Plan (PACMUN) (http://iclei.org.mx/web/index.php/seccion/PACMUN) - has been successfully implemented in Mexico by ICLEI, and is extended for two more years. Here technical and institutional assistance is offered by the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC), with the project is financed by the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Mexico. In both projects the switch to renewable energy is being explored in a wider community strategy. The paper will address the methodology and approach taken by selected cities, with a focus on planning and approach to renewable energy, the use of local resources and the involvement of civil society in processes. © 2014 The Authors Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Civil society; Local climate and energy action; Local government; Low carbon strategies; Municipal climate plan; Renewable energy",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922323073

In previous work on IEM, a suboptimal real-time implementable solution was proposed, which was based on Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP). In this paper, we compute the optimal solution using Dynamic Programming (DP). As the emission legislation imposes a terminal state constraint, standard DP algorithms are sensitive to numerical errors that appear close to the boundary of the backward reachable sets. To avoid these numerical errors, we propose Boundary Surface Dynamic Programming (BSDP), which is an extension to Boundary Line Dynamic Programming and uses an approximation of the backward reachable sets. We also make an approximation of the forward reachable sets to reduce the grid size over time. Using a simulation study of a cold-start World Harmonized Transient Cycle for a Euro VI engine, we show that BSDP results in the best approximation of the optimal cost, when compared to existing DP methods, and that the real-time implementable solution only deviates 0.16 [%] from the optimal cost obtained using BSDP. © IFAC.",,"Automation; Costs; Diesel engines; Aftertreatment systems; Best approximations; Emission constraints; Emission legislation; Integrated emissions; Pontryagin's minimum principles; Simulation studies; Supervisory control strategy; Dynamic programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929738839

This DPF requires an active regeneration from time to time, which removes the particulates from the filter, at the cost of fuel. When route preview information is used from e.g. geographical and telemetric systems, on-road system performance can be optimized over expected duty cycles for a specified time horizon. However, at this moment, state-of-the-art emission control does not use preview information. As a consequence, the performance of the emission aftertreatment control devices, e.g. for Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) and DPF, must be tuned conservatively to maintain legislative accordance and durability. To show the feasibility of active regeneration scheduling of the DPF using preview information, the relevant drivetrain components are modeled, together with the baseline regeneration control of the DPF. These high-fidelity, parametric models are fitted and validated on test-bench and vehicle measurement data. For a set of representative drive cycles, the maximum potential of preview for DPF regeneration is quantified. Using simplified control models, a previewing controller is designed, that is computationally efficient. The designed controller has the potential to reduce the fuel requirement of the DOC/DPF system by more than 50% per active regeneration, while complying to emission legislation. Due to the large timescale of soot accumulation in the DPF, a large preview window is needed, typically beyond 2 hours of route information. In future work the availability of this information has to be tested for the intended long-haul applications. © 2014, FISITA.

Every supplier tries to tackle a specific part of mobility of their own interest. This results in a large variety of applications which give a different advice for the same situation. This causes a lot of confusion for the user. The user has no information of the current traffic situation and can therefore not decide which advice is optimal to chose. If all parties that advice and inform travellers work together and by fully utilising the information resources of the current road system, the travel comfort for the users can be substantially improved. In this paper we present a solution to realise a collaboration between these different suppliers. This solution is presented in the form of an approach called The Digital Road Authority. The Digital Road Authority is a concept that merges all traffic data from various sources into a smart personal travel advice to improve the utilisation of the network. Coordination is the main keyword in this story, the Digital Road Authority keeps the overview and thereby coordinates each user personally. All parties connected to the Digital Road Authority will collaborate to make these actions more effective. As a main focus point we want to ensure safety and combine all knowledge to optimally coordinate road users. In this paper we outline the initial phase to realise the Digital Road Authority. This initial phase consists of three pilots. In this article we will outline one of these pilots. This pilot focuses on the optimisation of the delivery of cargo at distribution centres. The main focus points in this pilot are the reduction of CO2 and NO2 emissions and minimisation of congestion caused by freight traffic. A description of the implementation of this pilot will be given.","Co-operation; CO2 and NO2 reduction; Coordination; Dynamic traffic management; Mathematical models","Carbon dioxide; Intelligent systems; Mathematical models; Nitrogen compounds; Nitrogen oxides; Roads and streets; Supply chains; Traffic control; Transportation; Coordination; Current traffic situations; Distribution centres; Dynamic traffic management; Freight traffic; Information resource; Reduction of emissions; Road authorities; Traffic congestion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929223807

It has become clear that effective climate change mitigation and adaptation not only require restrictions on energy consumption in the industrialized world, but also a decoupling of economic development from greenhouse gas emissions in the South. But can developing countries take a less carbon-intensive path, even though its outcome is highly uncertain? In many scenarios for a sustainable future energy supply, decentralized solutions play a crucial role. Such solutions are often based on renewable energies and can help to avoid lock-in effects based on fuel intensive energy systems. However, they are characterized by various aspects that conventional research paradigms have given little attention to, until now. These research challenges are reflected in the concept of Microenergy Systems, which serves as a theoretical basis for the Research Focus and Ph.D. program at the Technische Universität in Berlin. It brings together academics from various disciplines to take a micro-perspective on the idea of decentralized energy supply. This chapter introduces and discusses the concept of Microenergy Systems. It summarizes the development of the relatively young research group—the experiences of engineers, social and political scientists, economists and planners partaking in joint research and education in the field of decentralized sustainable energy solutions. Furthermore it highlights the attempt to establish an international scientific community concerned with Microenergy Systems amongst academics who are scattered throughout different institutions and numerous universities worldwide. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Decentralized energy supply; Education; Knowledge transfer; Transdisciplinary research; User perspective",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071387961

The interactions lead to the formation of toxic and corrosive hydrogen sulfide (free H2S gas and dissolved H2S). Such interactions are caused by the instability of hydrocarbons in the presence of water and a reactive reservoir rock matrix containing water-soluble anhydrite. The mass conversions of the inorganic water-rock-gas interactions which are triggered by the redox degradation of hydrocarbons establish a certain, thermodynamically defined state of chemical equilibrium. Any approach to geochemically model ""acid gas generation"" and ""H2S-risk distribution"" in petroleum systems should be based on a conceptual model that dequately reproduces the intimately interconnected and interdependent nature of all isochronous hydrogeochemical reactions, whether they are kinetically controlled or establish equilibrium species distributions. Such approaches rely (1) on the thermodynamical calculation of chemical equilibrium species distribution, (2) on the coupling of kinetically controlled oil degradation and sulfate reduction by oil-derived reductants to the equilibrium calculations, and (3) on the calculation of diffusive mass transport through the free pore water network and the irreducible water film. The key to model TSR, ""acid gas generation, and ""H2S-risk distribution"" is not to consider and model any single, isolated reaction like the kinetically controlled sulfate reduction which depends on the thermal history. The actual key to model TSR, the fate and behavior of sulfidic sulfur, and a realistic ""H2S-risk distribution"" in petroleum reservoirs is an overall reproduction of the hydrogeochemical reactive transport processes which temporally and spatially evolve in a complex network of oil/petroleum-water-rock-gas interactions under reservoir conditions.

In one 140-cm peat core, for example, all ages fell within a ~1000-yr time window. Following these unreliable results, a few bulk peat samples were dated to help assess if any of the plant macrofossil-derived dates were reliable. Bulk dates did not help to solve the problem. This study evaluates the possible sources of error but is unable to single out one clear cause. It is probable that many factors related to the fen environment, such as flooding and root intrusion, may have contributed to the errors.

This paper estimates the potential reductions in costs and emissions that could be achieved with tugs or an electric motor embedded in the landing gear to propel aircraft on the ground. The use of tugs would result in the avoidance of $20/ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions if the measure were adopted for all domestic flights. Estimates of average net savings for airlines vary from $100 per flight at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City to a loss of $160 per flight in Honolulu, Hawaii. Electric taxiing would save between $30 and $240/ton of CO2 emissions avoided. Either approach could reduce CO2 emissions from domestic flights in the United States by about 1.5 million tons each year, or about 1.1% of the total emissions in 2006. If the switch were limited to large narrow-body aircraft on domestic service at the busiest airports in the United States, the total reduction in emissions would be 0.5 million tons of CO2 annually, accompanied by savings of $100/ton. Air quality benefits associated with lower main engine use were monetized by using the air pollution emission experiments and policy model and ranged from more than $500 per flight in the New York City area to just more than $20 per flight in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, area. The analysis also demonstrates that emissions reductions from different interventions (e.g., single-engine taxiing and the use of tugs) are often not independent of each other and therefore cannot be combined in a simple way.",,"Air quality; Air transportation; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Engines; Landing gear (aircraft); Tugboats; Carbon dioxide emissions; Costs and benefits; Domestic services; Emissions reduction; John F.

Previous studies mostly used simplistic approaches to simulate climate change, such as changing the average daily rainfall on wet days by a fixed percentage or multiplying the CLIGEN-generated daily rainfall by a fixed factor. None of these methods is adequate for reproducing the steady decrease in rainfall in southwest of Western Australia (SWWA). The aim of this paper is to develop a new method to adjust CLIGEN parameter values where rainfall has gradually but significantly decreased. Annual rainfall has shown a significantly decreasing trend since the mid-1920s in SWWA. Long-term (90 years) daily rainfall data from seven sites in SWWA were used to assess the changes to CLIGEN parameter values with an underlying gradual decrease in rainfall. CLIGEN parameters were analysed for each of the 54 overlapping time series of 30-year each for these sites in SWWA. This paper shows that for the wet months in winter, changes in monthly rainfall are correlated with changes in mean daily rainfall, the standard deviation, and the probability of a wet day following a dry day. There is little evidence to suggest that there is a need to adjust the two remaining parameters, i.e. the skewness coefficient, and the probability of a wet day following a wet day to simulate changes in the mean monthly rainfall for this region. This study shows that CLIGEN parameter values can be adjusted to reproduce the historical declining trend in rainfall for these sites in SWWA and to be used for prediction of future rainfall trends in this region and any other climatically similar regions of the world.",,"Climate change; Stochastic systems; Water resources; Annual rainfall; Historical data; Monthly rainfalls; Rainfall trends; Skewness coefficients; Standard deviation; Stochastic weather generator; Western Australia; Rain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925064235

Since the environmental pollution associated with rapid increase in cement production has worsened significantly in the last decades, it is worth analyzing production trends at the country level. This study primarily explores two questions regarding cement production. The first question deals with statistical analyses to confirm whether per capita cement production converges to some level and to examine what factors determine a country[U+05F3]s cement production. The second question is to derive environmental implications from the empirical results. To address the first, we apply econometric techniques to see if cement production per capita converges using data from 1978 to 2007. We found that per capita cement production will eventually converge although its levels vary across countries and explored determinants of countries' cement production, confirming an inverted U-shape relationship between per capita GDP and cement production (i.e., environmental Kuznets curve). Regarding environmental implications, we argue that it is of critical importance to control excessive cement demand, addressing the distinctiveness and impacts of China. In particular, we show the potential for extremely large amounts of excessive cement production in China and that elimination of this excessive production could result in substantial reductions of CO2 emissions and local pollutants such as mercury and particulate matter without damaging economic development. These results indicate the importance of demand management, as well as technological transfer, in challenging global and local resource and environmental issues. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","China; Energy use; Production convergence; Technology transfer; World cement production",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897432606

Reverberation time lags occur due to light travel time delays between changes in the direct coronal emission and corresponding variations in its reflection from the accretion flow. Reverberation is detectable using light curves made in different X-ray energy bands, since the direct and reflected components have different spectral shapes. Larger, lower frequency, lags are also seen and are identified with propagation of fluctuations through the accretion flow and associated corona. We review the evidence for X-ray reverberation in active galactic nuclei and black hole X-ray binaries, showing how it can be best measured and how it may be modelled. The timescales and energy dependence of the high-frequency reverberation lags show that much of the signal is originating from very close to the black hole in some objects, within a few gravitational radii of the event horizon. We consider how these signals can be studied in the future to carry out X-ray reverberation mapping of the regions closest to black holes. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Accretion, accretion disks; Black hole physics; Galaxies: active; Galaxies: Seyfert; X-rays: binaries","Architectural acoustics; Galaxies; Gravitation; Reverberation; Time delay; Travel time; X ray optics; Accretion , accretion disks; Black Hole physics; Galaxies : active; Galaxies: seyfert; X-rays: Binaries; Stars",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905329420

However there is still little empirical knowledge about what specific kind of work emissions trading schemes do. Using the analytical tools provided by science and technology studies, especially developments studying markets and economic practices, this paper looks to contribute to filling this void by exploring three kinds of work that emissions trading schemes might do: performing a textbook market of emissions permits, performing a civilized market in which a multitude of heterogeneous actors participate and as exemplars of the validity of certain economic knowledge. In order to explore the usability of this conceptualization the paper will then analyze one of earliest concrete implementations of this device: an emissions trading scheme introduced to deal with industrial air pollution in the city of Santiago (Chile) in the early 1990s. Through a historical genealogy, it will show this emissions trading scheme working not mainly as a textbook market, but as a civilized one and as a powerful exemplar that helped to mobilize both command-and-control regulation and neoliberal environmental economics to/from Chile and elsewhere. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis.","air pollution; Chile; civilized market; emissions trading; exemplar; textbook market; work","atmospheric pollution; emissions trading; environmental economics; industrial emission; pollution control; regulatory approach; carbon emission; experimental study; genealogy; human activity; neoliberalism; Chile; Metropolitana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902345075

This paper investigates the organizational values present in several municipal policy departments in order to explore their willingness to act upon climate adaptation and the implications for mainstreaming. Q methodology, supplemented by interviews and focus groups, applied in three major Dutch municipalities - Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam - reveals three value patterns: (1) start today; (2) not for us to lead; and (3) shared responsibility. These different value patterns indicate that there is a general agreement on the problem, impacts and solutions, but disagreement on the time frame for action and the allocation of resources. Although all three value patterns are present within departments in each municipality, different value patterns prevail in each municipality. Additionally, the analysis shows barriers as well as opportunities for mainstreaming. A lack of political commitment and leadership, and unsupportive organizational structures, create barriers. In spite of this, there is willingness to act and strategic framing is applied to gain acceptance for the mainstreaming of climate adaptation. © IWA Publishing 2014.","Local government; Mainstreaming climate adaptation; Organizational values; Q methodology; The Netherlands","Local government; Mainstreaming climate adaptation; Netherlands; Organizational values; Q methodology; climate change; environmental policy; local government; resource allocation; water management; Amsterdam [North Holland]; Netherlands; North Holland; Rotterdam; South Holland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907756938

The increasingly stringent legislative requirements of exhaust gas and CO2 emissions push for further improvements of the engine and also the aftertreatment system by components such as LNT and SCR. This will lead to difficulty in installation and increase the cost. As a result, reducing the diesel-powered vehicle advantage in cost and make them less attractive compared to gasoline-powered and hybrid vehicles. On the other hand, in emerging countries where the automobile market is strongly growing, diesel engines are in demand for logistics, national development, industrial progress and other productive activities. Now that diesel engines are more widely used in various regions in the world, it will be impossible to assume a certain level of fuel quality like in the first world countries. Combustion fluctuation, low fuel efficiency, acceleration failure, or other deteriorated driveability aspects may occur due to poor quality fuels. In order to cope with these problems, DENSO introduced the fourth generation common rail system (CRS) capable of offering ultra high pressure fuel injection of up to 2500 bar into the market in 2013 thus ensuring lower absolute values of emissions, higher fuel efficiency and good driveability. The new CRS, which is robust against foreign material, was built up through fundamental review of the design back to the best form of the system. Reduced variation in emissions was also achieved by a new air path control which directly controls the engine steady-state emissions. Additionally this control allows for improved transient emissions. The engine out emissions are reduced, thus reduces the aftertreatment workload, resulting in improved packaging and cost reduction of the total engine management system (EMS). In addition, by using the world's first direct feedback control system (i-ART) which was commercialized in 2012, this system can detect the fuel properties allowing for optimal combustion.

However, carbonate precipitation was detected only when the bacteria grow in media added with calcium. Precipitation took place rapidly, and crystal formation began 3 d after inoculation and the percentage of carbonate-forming bacteria was slightly higher than 90%. Seventeen dominant colonies with carbonate precipitation capacity were the dominant heterotrophic platable bacteria growing aerobically in media added with calcium acetate and calcium chloride. According to their taxonomic affiliations (based on partial sequencing of the 16S-rRNA), the seventeen strains belonged to the following genera of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria: Artrobacter, Bacillus, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Agromyces and Rhodococcus. All of these strains formed calcium carbonate crystals, precipitated always as calcite crystals which showed large amounts of bacterial fingerprints or bacteria calcification. In addition all the seventeen bacterial strains showed carbonic anhydrase activity. The results of this research suggest that in submerged fixed-film bioreactors used for the treatment of urban wastewater, the precipitation of carbonates through bacterial action could take place in situ in the presence of certain concentrations of calcium. Moreover, this biological activity could be useful in the CO2 and calcium capture in urban wastewater treatments.","Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Co2 capture; Submerged fixed-film bioreactor; Urban wastewater","bioreactor; calcite; calcium; calcium carbonate; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); crystal; enzyme activity; film; microbial activity; precipitation (chemistry); waste treatment; wastewater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897891155

But in March 2013, a joint proposal by the governments of the United States and the Russian Federation to up-list polar bears to Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) diverted public attention from climate change towards the hunting of polar bears. Prior to a vote on the proposal, non-governmental organisations spear-headed a media campaign to support the up-listing. In the United Kingdom the campaign received support from celebrities and was widely reported in English language news media. Narratives of commercial legal and illegal polar bear hunting and the imminent extinction of polar bears were aggressively promoted, rhetorically supported by the manipulation of trade and scientific data. By rendering discourses of commercial hunting and a lucrative global trade in polar bear parts highly visible, sustainable hunting and climate change-induced habitat loss were rendered invisible. Media reports of commercial hunting de-coupled polar bear conservation from climate change mitigation, and disassociated polar bear hunting from regulated indigenous subsistence practices. A review of current polar bear conservation measures and an analysis of media coverage leading up to the CITES decision reveal these conflicting discourses, and suggest that more nuanced media coverage of polar bear conservation is necessary if appropriate multilateral conservation policies are to be enacted and publicly supported. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Conservation; Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES); Hunting; Inuit; Media; Polar bears",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894385658

But the side effect of this phase shift is reduction in the power transfer capability of the system. This paper proposes a new design method with help of theory and simulations which shows that it is possible to reduce the magnetic emissions and transmit the same power at unity power factor at expense of higher primary current and bigger capacitors on both sides. This reduction increases with increase in the secondary capacitor till a certain maximum point and then decreases.

The first investigated fertilizer addition and mammalian herbivore exclosure in understory vegetation over a 20-year period and showed that nutrient availability, and not herbivory, controlled herbaceous biomass. Fertilization increased the amount and nutrient content of vegetation, but 13 species were lost, whereas natural levels of mammalian herbivory rarely affected this vegetation or its diversity. The second study investigated how removing plant functional groups from a grassland influences its functioning. Over a seven-year period, we determined that the identity of the functional group was important in determining ecosystem properties and that graminoids were more influential than expected from their proportional biomass. In both of these studies, short-term responses were transient and not indicative of longer-term responses of these communities. This finding reinforces the need for long-term experiments, especially in northern ecosystems.

The projected population growth will cause severe competition for existing resources, not to mention the issue of overcrowding of the planet and additional greenhouse gases that will have an adverse effect on the ecological health of the planet. A recent survey conducted by the United Nations Population Control Division shows that the majority of today's young men in many countries are willing to participate in family planning by taking full control of their fertility, an important global health issue. However, the contraceptive needs of tens of millions of men/couples go unmet every single day and results in millions of unwanted pregnancies. Ever since the approval of the birth control pill by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1960, scientists have been hoping for a male equivalent. It has, however, been a difficult road, in part because of the complicated science of the male reproductive system. It is easier to control a monthly event of ovulation in women than to regulate the production of millions of fertile spermatozoa every day in men. Thus, the contraceptive options for men have not changed in decades and are still limited to the use of condoms, a timely withdrawal/pulling out (coitus interruptus) or vasectomy, a minor surgical procedure in which the vas deferens is occluded to prevent the release of spermatozoa during ejaculation. The first two approaches have a relatively higher failure rate, whereas the last approach is largely irreversible and not suitable for younger men. In this article, we will discuss various approaches currently available for men to take control of their fertility. Our intention is to discuss the details of three similar approaches that will provide safe, affordable and reversible contraception for men and are close to being approved for use by millions of men around the globe. The availability of safe, reversible and reliable male contraceptives will allow men and women to take full control of their fertility in family planning. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.","Condoms; Family planning; Male contraception; RISUG; Vas-devices; Vasalgel; Vasectomy","adjudin; antigen; calcium channel blocking agent; Carica papaya extract; contraceptive vaccine; eppin; follitropin; gonadorelin; gossypol; luteinizing hormone; male contraceptive agent; n butyldeoxynojirimysin; oral contraceptive agent; selective androgen receptor modulator; sperm antigen; Tripterygium wilfordii extract; unclassified drug; vasalgel; male contraceptive agent; androgen; gestagen; gonadotropin antagonist; male contraceptive agent; miglustat; proteinase inhibitor; testosterone; article; coitus interruptus; condom use; contraception; family planning; fertilization; heat; hormonal therapy; human; immunological procedures; male fertility; nonhuman; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance; sexual abstinence; sperm; spermatogenesis; vas deferens implant; vasectomy; adult; animal; condom; drug effects; family planning; female; fertility; immunocontraception; male; procedures; United States; Article; birth control; cost effectiveness analysis; devices; drug megadose; heat treatment; infant mortality; intravas devices; libido disorder; male infertility; pregnancy rate; spermatozoon; unwanted pregnancy; Adult; Animals; Condoms; Contraception; Contraception, Immunologic; Contraceptive Agents, Male; Family Planning Services; Female; Fertility; Humans; Male; Spermatogenesis; United States; Vasectomy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904119084

Due to high density in an undisciplined urban setup, the city is in real scarcity of open and green spaces for her large number of dwellers. The rapid growing population in conjunction with very immediate developing urbanization has led to unplanned and uncontrolled expansion of Dhaka which is resulted in the gradual loss of open and green spaces in the city. In the quest of meeting the great demand of urbanization, the city has hardly saved some of her natural spaces. Unfortunately these very few existing open spaces are not even well preserved with natural greeneries or vegetation; as a result this lack of green and plantation severely affects the microclimate of those spaces. Whereas the use of vegetation and plantation as an element of urban landscape, has always great environmental benefits and opportunities both in the scale of micro and global climate; like temperature control, solar radiation control, wind control, reduction of air pollution by absorption the pollutant and noise reduction etc. Urban vegetation minimizes direct solar radiation of the surface, optimizes wind velocity and its form and configuration influence temperature, air humidity and wind pattern of an urban setting. Vegetation create green barrier as visual boundary, natural screen and space buffer as a major element of landscape design. The objective of this paper is to discuss the impact of vegetation in urban air temperature and explore the possibility of vegetation configuration to maximize the cooling effect in urban open space in Dhaka city. For researching these issues, a short field survey has done in two significant urban squares to find out the answer of the proposed research query.

Box 1000FI  02044, Finland","It is predicted that share of solar and wind energy will be increased in the future energy systems. The competitiveness of these technologies is further improved if strict climate policy and for example consequent high costs for CO2 emissions or emission performance standards will be applied, leading to increased electricity prices. This will bring demand for more flexible large scale energy production and/or energy storages due to the intermittency of solar and wind energy production at different timeframes, for example between day and night and different seasons. In addition, it is notable that future integration of electricity markets and grids will expand the area impacted by intermittent renewables.Possible and predicted high economic value for CO2 emissions and emission standards are also a rationale for the development of CCS technologies. After the investment, variable operational expenditures of solar and wind power are low in comparison with other low carbon technologies and therefore these plants are utilised before others. This will impact also on the utilisation rates of plants equipped with CCS. In this paper techno-economic analyses of industrial scale Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) power plant are presented in different market situations. Feasibility of CLC investment and the utilization of such plant is investigated and compared to oxyfuel and air combustion references in energy system which contain high share of solar and wind power. The CC-Skynet™ toolkit, created by VTT during Finnish CCS projects, enables comparison of economic feasibility of different CCS technologies in different market scenarios, including varying prices for electricity, CO2 emission allowances, fuels, plant utilisation rates, etc. In addition, in the case of CLC, sensitivity analysis are possible also for example for prices of different oxygen carriers, investments etc. The toolkit is highly versatile but it does not include modelling of any physical phenomena which are required as inputs. The economics of CCS are evaluated from investor's (local energy company) point of view including the effects on the existing energy system. Effect of CCS on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and operation economics of the CCS cases are compared to the reference energy system with varying parameters of operation. Electricity production efficiency of CLC power plant is higher than in power plants based on solid fuel and other CO2 capture technologies, because CLC does not require large air separation unit or solvent regeneration. Higher net efficiency in electricity production by CLC results lower specific production costs in comparison to other CCS technologies. This probably leads to higher utilisation rate for CLC which is important for example in terms of payback time for the investment or required breakeven price for CO2 emissions. Results show that CLC may be more competitive in comparison to other CCS technologies due tohigher electrical efficiency. Economic feasibility is dependent on several factors which are uncertain in the case of future energy system. However, it is probable that high CO2 prices lead to increased electric price such that electrical efficiency has large dominant effect on feasibility. Investment costs do not dominate in comparison between CCS technologies. Feasibility of CCS is different between geographical locations due sensitivity of transport and storage. © 2014 The Authors.

Reducing the Pt loading leads to an increase in electrochemical surface area, but the specific activity decreases as previously observed in conventional carbon based electrocatalysts. Removing residual chlorine impurities by replacing the H2PtCl6 nanoparticle precursor with Pt(acac)2 increases the specific activity. Niobium-doping of the SnO2 support also results in an increase in specific activity, due to the increased electronic conductivity.

Due to its innovation promotion for renewable energy exploitation in recent years, Pingtung County, located in the southernmost of Taiwan, was introduced as a case study. Finally, some recommendations for promote renewable electricity development were addressed in the paper. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The carbon intensity basically maintains positive correlation with energy intensity and economic growth, while the correlation between carbon intensity and industrial structure, and that between carbon intensity and fiscal expenditure varies from each other. There are different industrial structures and corresponding changing laws in various provinces and cities. The favorable influences on carbon intensity by fiscal expenditure are not remarkable, and yet the relationship between proportion of fiscal expenditure and carbon intensity still shows positive correlation in most of the provinces. In the long run, the major way of realizing energy saving and emission reduction for various provinces still lies in adjustment and optimization of both industrial structure and energy consumption structure. © 2014 by the author(s).","Carbon intensity; Change of industrial structure; Energy saving and emission reduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924485065

The 20-20-20 targets that are established by the EU, has set a series of severe climate and energy targets to be met by 2020. These targets mean that each Member State shall reduce their primary energy use of 20 % by 2020. A special significant potential to reduce energy demand and CO2 emissions are highlighted within industrial energy systems. In Sweden the use of electricity is among the highest in the world. Rising electricity price will promote further electricity production in Swedish CHP plants. Altering industrial energy use will imply considerable cost-effective possibilities to lower global emissions of CO2 when considering reduction in electricity consumption to reduce marginal production in coal condensing power plants. The aim of this paper is to analyse how a system perspective can be profitable for both energy suppliers and industrial energy users as well as for the environment. Results show how industrial and energy supply measures will lead to reduced electricity use with about 50 %, increased use of district heating and cost-effective possibilities to lower global emissions of CO2. Driving forces and barriers to implementation of energy efficient measures, together with a system perspective of how to account for electricity use, are also discussed. © 2014 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

To improve transit accessibility and attract riders, agencies often build park-and- ride facilities on the periphery of cities. Through the provision of convenient parking facilities, agencies attempt to encourage drivers to shift modes and leave behind their cars to complete their journey by transit. Although park-and-rides arc intended to increase transit ridership, such facilities may carry paradoxical environmental consequences. At issue is the degree to which such a multimodal car-to-transit trip actually offsets GHG emissions. The study reported in this paper examined single- occupancy vehicle (SOV) park-and-ride users in the Denver, Colorado, metropolitan area and evaluated the magnitude of GHG emissions saved from transit ridership. Through a comparison of a multimodal trip against a theoretical SOV drive-only trip, the effects from GHG emissions were weighed. In addition, the environmental opportunity cost of park-and-ride stations was assessed through the repetition of the analysis under the assumption that all park-and-ride transit users that originated from within a 2-mi radius would shift modes to walk or bike rather than drive an automobile to the station. The results suggested that park-and- rides loeated at inncrcorridor stations were far less effective in reducing GHG emissions than were end-of-line stations. This ineffectiveness appeared to be exacerbated by a parking fee structure common to both the inner-corridor and end-of-line stations. If the goal is environmental sustainability, the location of a park-and-ride facility at almost every station should be reevaluated in favor of a strategy that focuses on how and where park-and-rides can be most effective. The results of this study suggested that inner-corridor stations, particularly those closest to a downtown area, induced unnecessary driving trips and provided an incentive for longer SOV transit-access car trips.",,"Amphibious vehicles; Cost benefit analysis; Gas emissions; Light rail transit; Mass transportation; Motor transportation; Parking; Site selection; Sustainable development; Transportation; Denver , Colorado; Environmental consequences; Environmental sustainability; Light rail system; Parking facilities; Single occupancy vehicles; Sustainable transportation; Transit riderships; Greenhouse gases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938599455
